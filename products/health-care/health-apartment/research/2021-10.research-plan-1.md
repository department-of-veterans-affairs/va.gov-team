# Research Plan for Apartment IA Proof of Concept Testing, October 2021
## Goals

The Health Apartment Team is conducting research to validate the IA of the health apartment proof of concept (POC) and the discoverability of health things within the apartment. The outcome of this tree test research will provide us with insights into what works and what needs work from the start. The tree test will also give us a clear, quantifiable benchmark to improve on in our iterations. 

**BACKGROUND** 

This project maintains the vision of the Digital Modernization Strategy set in 2017: To simplify and unify the Veteran health experience into a single front door by bringing all things health, including My HealtheVet, into VA.gov. We will create an accessible, usable, and discoverable health "home."


**RESEARCH QUESTIONS** 

See 'Tasks' below for a detailed list. Overall, 14 tasks were prioritized to balance thoroughness with an appropriate cognitive load for Veterans; see 'Method' below for additional information on how these tasks were prioritized based on various analytics.


## Method	
Based on [generative research in early 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1) and [the recommendations from that generative research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/health-apartment-ia), we will conduct this first round of research using a tree test to understand the discoverability of tasks and to validate the organization of information in the apartment. Built in Treejack by Optimal Workshop, we will pilot the tree test with Veterans on the internal team for clarity, timing, and general feedback prior to using it with Perigean recruits. This research will be asychronous (i.e., no live moderation), with opportunity for participants to share additional thoughts during the test itself. 

To balance comprehensiveness with cognitive load, we decided to test no more than 20 tasks per study. Here's how we prioritized which tasks we should test first. 
* We used top search terms to define top tasks, assuming that these are high-need, low-discoverability items. [Go to our analytics page for more information.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/analytics/Analytics.md) 
* We prioritized tasks / topics that we had questions about.

Note: Because the "big 4" tools (messages, appointments, pharmacy, and records) are well understood in MHV, the apartment POC did not make major shifts to them. Thus, we are not testing them in this first tree test.

### Tasks
The prioritized 14 tasks, linked to our testing objective, were carefully curated such that they reflect how Veterans might naturally approach the website. We ensured that the answer wasn't given away by using the same language that’s in tree itself, and we used plain language to write the tasks. Below, the parentheticals describe the general goal of the task.

1.  You need to see a podiatrist, but live 110 miles away from the closest VA podiatrist. You want to find out whether you're eligible to see a non-VA podiatrist. (learning about community care)

2. How would you go about seeing the non-VA podiatrist? (viewing and managing appointments)

3. You have a 30% disability rating. You want to learn what health benefits your disability rating qualifies you for. (learning about disability benefits)

4. Your VA doctor prescribed you a hearing aid. After a few months, the battery has died. You want to order a replacement battery. (ordering health supplies)

5. Where would you order prosthetic socks? (ordering health supplies)

6. You drove to your primary care appointment at VA. How would you go about getting reimbursed for gas? (requesting travel pay)

7. You were notified that you have an outstanding amount for a VA appointment. You want to find out how much you owe. (viewing medical copayments)

8. You need to go to the dentist. How would you find out what coverage you qualify for? (learning about dental benefits)

9. A Veteran you care for was just diagnosed with PTSD. You want to learn more about this condition. (learning about specific health conditions (i.e., research health))

10. Your doctor told you that you have high blood pressure and asked you to enter those numbers online between visits. (tracking self-entered health data)

11. You want to subscribe to the My HealtheVet newsletter. (reading or subscribing to the MHV newsletter)

12. You had some blood tests done at VA this week and you want to see those results. (viewing labs & test results)

13. You got married and you want to add your spouse as a dependent. (managing benefits)

14. Where would you expect to find information about COVID-19 vaccines? (learning about COVID-19 vaccines)

## Participants and Recruitment	
We've proposed using Perigean to recruit and schedule 60 qualified participants for each of the 6 groups outlined below (10 participants in each group). These groups build off the original 3 from the generative research with additional segmentation by familiarity with MHV and another group that includes current service members. We ask that each of the groups be considered a separate recruitment effort. One benefit of this recruiting strategy is the ability to have participants within these clear segments. 

We will be testing with these 5 groups or segments. Below are minimum numbers for the users who must meet the primary criteria within each recruiting segment, along with secondary criteria to be applied across all segments.

**PRIMARY CRITERIA**

1. Familiarity with MHV
- At least X participants who have signed into MHV in the past 6 months
- At least X participants who last signed into MHV 12 months ago
- At least X participants who have never signed into MHV

2. Number of years with the VA/eras of service:
- At least 3 participants who have left the miliary within the last 3 years
- At least 3 participants who served in Operation Enduring Freedom or the Iraq War
- At least 3 participants who served in the Gulf War
- At least 3 participants who served in the Vietnam War

3. Use of VA benefits:
- At least 4 participants who use health care only, or health care and disability compensation, but no other VA benefit types (e.g., housing, education)
- At least 4 participants who use VA health care + 1 other VA benefit type
- At least 4 participants who use VA health care and 2 or more VA benefit types

4. Caregiver and dependent needs:
- At least 4 participants who access VA benefits for themselves only, without the help of a caregiver
- At least 4 participants who access VA benefits for themselves and their dependents, without the help of a caregiver
- At least 4 participants who are caregivers to Veterans and/or their dependents accessing VA benefits

5. Service members
- At least X participants who will transition from the military in the next year
- At least X participants who will not transition from the military in the next year


**SECONDARY CRITERIA** 

Across the 5 study groups, we would like the sample to include the below targets. 

Gender:
- At least 10% women

Inclusion:
- At least 34% people of color
- At least 25% without a degree
- At least 17% with immigrant origins
- At least 50% with an identified cognitive disability ("difficulty remembering, concentrating, or making decisions because of a
physical, mental, or emotional problem", _The Disability of Veterans_, Kelly Ann Holder)

Geographic distribution:
- At least 10 participants from the East Coast
- At least 10 participants from the West Coast
- At least 10 participants not from the East Coast nor West Coast
- At least 25% participants from a rural area

Notes on decisions for above criteria: 
- We assume that the IA doesn't need to be tested specifically on a mobile device, as it is the tree only, not a wireframe designed for mobile or desktop. At later stages, we will recruit for participants on mobile.
- We spoke with Josh Kim regarding testing with Treejack on assistive devices and learned that it is technically "accessible," but not actually usable with screen readers. He recommended coding a tree in CodePen for testing with screen readers. Based on this, we propose launching this study with Treejack for participants who don't use screen readers and adding a CodePen tree testing to the backlog to address the risk of testing without this critical user group.
