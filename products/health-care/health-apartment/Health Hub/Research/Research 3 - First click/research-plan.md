# Research Plan for Health Apartment IA, August 2022
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
As the team considers how to include the Health Apartment on VA.gov, this research will help inform decisions on overall placement of the health apartment experience in the broader VA.gov IA, as well as the entry points to that experience.

### OCTO Objectives 

This effort supports the following OCTO objectives:
- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov

### Veteran Journey
Veteran tasks fit into the following key points in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Putting down roots
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	

The goal of this research is to gain insights into where on VA.gov Veterans, family members, and caregivers would go to complete health care related tasks. 

### Outcome
This research will help inform placement of entry points into the "get benefits" and "manage benefits" experience for health care. 


### Research questions

Where do users go on the VA.gov home page when asked to complete a task related to exploring and applying for benefits (i.e. "get benefits")?
Where do users go on the VA.gov home page when asked to complete a task related to managing their health care and benefits (i.e. "manage benefits")?
Does a persistent "My health" option in the header impact the findability of health care related content and tools positively or negatively?
Do Veterans who are not enrolled in health care navigate differently than Veterans who are enrolled in health care?
Do family members and caregivers navigate differently than Veterans?


### Hypothesis
Displaying the "My health" link in the header regardless of authentication status will primarily attract Veterans who are already enrolled in health care due to familiarity with My HealtheVet, and Veterans who are not enrolled in health care, as well as family members and caregivers, will not attempt to navigate to health care content related to "get benefits" via that link. 

## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

## Recruitment	


Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach

This reasearch will focus on Veterans, as well as family members and caregivers.

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)
