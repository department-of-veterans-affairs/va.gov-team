# **Research Plan for Health Apartment IA, August 2022**


### **Background**

As the team considers how to include the Health Apartment on VA.gov, this research will help inform decisions on the information architecture of the health apartment and the broader  VA.gov structure.

### **OCTO objectives**

This effort supports the following OCTO objectives:
- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov


### **Veteran journey**

Veteran tasks fit into the following key points in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Putting down roots
- Retiring
- Aging


## Research goals

The goal of this research is to gather qualitative insights to supplement the findings of the Health Apartment IA Tree Test completed in early July 2022. The same two hypotheses will be tested against a subset of tasks in a moderated setting so we can gather feedback on what is and is not meeting the mental model of Veterans in the health care space. We will be looking to better understand how labeling, organization, and hierarchy of the menus impact their ability to successfully complete tasks.

### Outcome

This research will help inform the next iteration of IA for the authenticated health care experience on VA.gov, identify what additional research needs are, and help inform the roadmap for the continued health apartment work. 

### **Research questions**

Can Veterans navigate proposed changes to VA.gov to find information or complete core tasks as they get and/or manage their VA health care benefits?

**Specific goals**
- Evaluate the usability of navigation in and between the ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’ sections
- Better understand the impact of labeling and organization of the health hub
- Gain insight into user mental models as they get and manage their benefits and care and any perceived differences between the tasks. 
- - In particular, following up on previous research, gather more insight on why users might find “Get” tasks more challenging (H0 vs H1– what’s challenging about get tasks in H0, what’s challenging about manage tasks in H1)


### **Hypothesis**

We’re testing two hypotheses:
- Hypothesis 0: Veterans find it easier to understand the benefits that are available to them and complete health care related tasks when there is one unified section to ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’.

- Hypothesis 1: Veterans find it easier to understand the benefits that are available to them and complete health care related tasks when there are two separate sections for ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’.

## **Method**

We will conduct remote moderated sessions via Zoom and using Optimal Workshop’s Tree Jack tool. We will be testing the same 2 hypotheses/trees, with no changes, that were tested in the first round of tree testing. We will test these hypotheses with Veterans. 
Participants will be given a task, then asked to navigate the tree to identify where they would go to complete a task. The tool will log their navigational path and where they indicate the answer is. The team will observe and listen for feedback from the users, and may ask follow-up questions to better understand what is working and what is not. 
All Veterans who participate will be asked to complete the same set of tasks. Tasks will be randomized for each participant to avoid bias due to participants “learning the tree” and giving later tasks an advantage.

### **Participants and recruitment**

Ask Perigean to recruit 40 people using the cohorts below. We expect no less than 5 completions for each cohort. Ideally, we would like to have:
The total number of participants will be broken into four cohorts’

1. H0 Veterans Enrolled in VA Health Benefits
2. H0 Veterans Not Enrolled
3. H1 Veterans Enrolled in VA Health Benefits
4. H1 Veterans Not Enrolled enrolled in VA Health Benefits, but benefit eligible

- All participants should be Veterans
- Half of the overall number should be enrolled for VA health benefits
- Half of the total number (20) should be Veterans not enrolled for health benefits with the VA
- Of the 20 participants enrolled in health benefits, at least half of them should have used MyHealtheVet online health management tool within the last year.
- Half of the total number should represent underserved Veteran populations

We want to ensure we research with the following underserved Veteran populations:
- Females
- Minorities
- Lower education
- LGTBQAI2S+
- Cognitive disorder
- Candidates may meet several secondary criteria so long as a minimum number of identified underserved Veteran populations identified in spreadsheet are represented in the data pool.

### **Timeline**

**Prepare**

We’ll conduct a pilot session with mock participants (week of August 8).


**Research sessions**

- Research sessions will begin the week of August 15. 
- Schedule sessions beginning at 9:30am ET for 50 minutes, with at least 10 minutes break in between, maximum 5 scheduled participants a day. 

**Length of Session**

Each session will be scheduled for 50 minutes. The sessions will break down to approximately 10 minutes for introductions and primer questions, to be followed by the moderated test, for which the remaining 40 minutes will be used.
