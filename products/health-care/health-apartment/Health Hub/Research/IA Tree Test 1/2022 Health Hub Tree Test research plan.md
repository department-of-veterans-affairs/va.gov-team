# Research Plan for Health Hub Benefits Navigation. May 2022

## Background

Veterans find it extremely difficult to navigate commonplace interactions with the VA. The VA ecosystem is so complex that Veterans feel discouraged to learn about, apply, maximize, and manage their benefits. 

This experience extends online. There is a fragmentation in information and tools. In particular, navigating between general information and personalized information and tools is difficult. Veterans (will) come to VA.gov to learn what benefits are available to them, apply, and then track and manage those benefits. While these are distinct stages, we expect that Veterans will need to continue learning about their benefits during the application process, and when managing their benefits. 

As the team considers how to include the Health Apartment on VA.gov, this research effort is an effort to update and improve the benefits-related information architecture of VA.gov.

### OCTO objectives

This effort supports the following OCTO objectives: 

* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
* Veterans can manage their health services online
* Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features


### Veteran journey

Veteran tasks fit into the following key points in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf): 


* Primary point in the Veteran journey: “Taking care of myself”
* Secondary points: “Starting up,” “Putting down roots,” “Retiring,” and “Aging”


## Research goals

How we might create an experience that allows Veterans to easily find the content and tools they need based on where they are in their VA health care journey: 

* learning about the benefit
* applying for the benefit
* getting started with the benefit
* or managing their care and health benefits? 

We want to understand how Veterans might navigate between tasks in ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’ on proposed changes to VA.gov.  We will first explore how this works with health care, and later consider how our learnings will impact the other benefits. 


### Outcome

To understand (and build consensus) how to best organize the UX for ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits,’ specifically for health care, on VA.gov. We’ll use the information architecture insights from this research to build and test prototypes of a future Health Hub. 


### Research questions


1. Can users (Veterans and Caregivers or family members) navigate proposed changes to VA.gov to find information or complete core tasks as they get and/or manage their VA health care benefits and care? 


### Specific goals



* Evaluate the usability of navigation in and between the ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’ sections
* Assess the labeling of health hub section
* Gain insight into user mental models as they get and manage their benefits and care


At this stage it would be ideal to focus mainly on overall high-level results for each of the hypothesis — Baseline, H0 and H1 and not each of the questions asked (Optimal Workshop provides a large amount of data on many metrics at this lower level). The metrics to focus on are:

* Overall Success: The Success score refers to the percentage of participants who selected a correct answer, regardless of whether or not they had to jump around the tree a few times before doing so.
* Overall Directness: The Directness score is the percentage of participants who did not backtrack at all when selecting an answer, whether their answer was correct or incorrect. It attempts to measure how certain participants were in selecting their answer, though it's important to not assume too much about what your participants were thinking.
* Time Taken: The time taken score is a box plot of the recorded task completion times. Participants who took longer than 100 seconds to complete a task are excluded.
* Optimal Workshop also provides a weighted average of the squares (^2) of success and directness that favors success over directness. This is a number that we will record, but it's usefulness to our study is not determined yet.

Restricting our focus to these overall scores at this stage should guide us to next steps and help us determine if a closer/deeper look at more specific metrics is warranted.


### Hypotheses

We’re testing two competing hypotheses: 

* Hypothesis 0: Veterans find it easier to understand the benefits that are available to them and navigate through the information when there is one unified section to ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’. 
* Hypothesis 1: Veterans find it easier to navigate when there are two separate sections for ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’. 
* We'll also be testing the existing VA.gov sitemap to give us a baseline against which we can measure both hypotheses

The current [Heath Apartment prototype that’s being tested](https://www.sketch.com/s/908b453b-ef8b-4193-b955-ea00f9fd14aa/a/7yK3287/play), assumes Hypothesis 0. 


## Method and tools

This phase of the research is designed to indicate which information architecture strategy to follow: hypothesis 0 or hypothesis 1. 

In this first phase, unmoderated remotely conducted tree tests allow us to evaluate navigation and labeling quickly across multiple research cohorts. 

We will use Optimal Workshop to conduct the tree tests. 


### What it is 

[Nielsen Norman Group - Tree Testing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tree-testing/)


### Method


##### IA Tree Tests (remote, unmoderated)

Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a tree test activity that contains, respecitvely, 12 tasks for a Veteran and 11 tasks for Caregivers and family members that they may experience when getting or managing their health care benefits. For each task, the participant will locate in the tree where a specific task can be completed. 

We would like to get complete responses from at least 50 Veterans, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). Each cohort will access the study using a unique URL. 

We’re using three trees, one for each hypothesis, and one for the current site.


##### Research materials



* Tree test for hypothesis 0
* Tree test for hypothesis 0 (for Cargivers and family members)
* Tree test for hypothesis 1
* Tree test for hypothesis 1 (for Cargivers and family members)
* Tree test for baseline
* Tree test for baseline (for Caregivers and family members)
* The [Tasks](#appendix-a-tasks) we’re asking each participant to complete. It will be the same tasks for both trees. 


## Participants and recruitment

Ask Perigean to recruit 126 people using the cohorts below in order to get at least 25-50 completes for each tree. Ideally, we would like to have:



* 1/7 of recruited participants Veterans' family members or caregivers who help a Veteran manage their VA health care
* 6/7 of participants are Veterans
    * 1/2 are enrolled in VA health care with a preference for those who have used the MyHealtheVet online health management tool within the last year. 
    * 1/2 Veterans are not enrolled in VA health care with a preference for those who do not receive any other VA benefits
* We want to ensure we research with the following underserved Veteran populations:
    * Females 
    * Minorities 
    * Lower education
    * LGTBQAI2S+
    * Cognitive disorder
    * _Candidates may meet several secondary criteria so long as a minimum number of identified underserved Veteran populations identified are represented in the data pool._

The tree tests will be open for two weeks, with the starting date TBD


### Length of session

This is an asynchronous online test. Participants are expected to spend 15 - 20 minutes. 


## Team roles

Research guide writing and task development: Team MOVE

Participant recruiting & screening: Perigean

## Appendix A: Tasks

### Tasks 

The prioritized tasks, linked to our testing objective, were carefully curated such that they reflect how Veterans might naturally approach the website. We ensured that the answer wasn't given away by using the same language that’s in the tree itself, and we used plain language to write the tasks. Below, the parentheticals describe the general goal of the task.
