# Research Goals
As we work toward the integration of My HealtheVet into the modernized VA.gov experience, we must ensure that we maintain - or improve upon - the high performance of the existing health care hub, and ensure Veterans, family members, and caregivers can easily find the content and tools they need wherever they are in their VA health care journey. 

We want to evaluate how variations of the health care hub IA perform in key tasks for:
- Exploring and applying for benefits (aka “Get benefits”) 
- Managing your health care (aka “Manage benefits”) 
- Veterans already enrolled in health care 
- Veterans not enrolled in health care
- Family members/caregivers of Veteran



# Research Questions

Can users (Veterans and Caregivers or family members) navigate proposed changes to VA.gov to find information or complete core tasks as they get and/or manage their VA health care benefits and care?

Specific goals
- Evaluate the usability of navigation in and between the ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’ sections
- Assess the labeling of health hub section
- Gain insight into user mental models as they get and manage their benefits and care




# Methodology 

- We conducted 3 unmoderated tree tests utilizing Optimal Workshop’s Treejack tool. 
- Participants were sent to 1 of the 3 trees and were asked to complete 12 tasks by navigating the menu structure and indicating where they would be able to find the answer. 
- Of the 12 tasks, 6 tasks were considered more related to learning or applying for the benefit (“Get benefits” tasks) and 6 tasks were considered more related to managing their health care or health benefit (“Manage benefits” tasks). 
- Tasks were randomized to avoid bias from learning the tree as the test progressed. 



# Hypotheses and Conclusions

Hypothesis 0: Veterans find it easier to complete health care related tasks when there is one area for all health care content and tools regardless of enrollment or authentication status

- Some aspects of this hypothesis are definitely true (manage tasks), while others are definitely false (get tasks) compared to baseline.

Hypothesis 1: Veterans find it easier to complete health care related tasks when the options specific to their enrollment status are in two separate sections or experiences

- The performance of this hypothesis was flat overall, and didn't show a significant improvement or detriment over baseline.

## Finding 1: Neither hypotheses showed a significant change compared to baseline when looking across the full structure for all tasks

Labels: label 1, label 2 

_List all labels that apply to this finding from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

- H0 did show a significant increase in overall directness (75%) over baseline (62%) for all Veterans, but overall task success was trending lower
- The differences in the hypotheses can be better seen when you look individual at “get” versus “manage” tasks, indicating that neither structure – as a whole - is more optimized over the current experience

**Finding 2: H1 was flat, while H0 showed a significant detriment**

Labels: label 1, label 2 

_List all labels that apply to this finding from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

- H0 had a significantly lower task success in both the not enrolled (45%) and the enrolled (52%) groups compared to baseline (59% and 69% respectively)
- H1 showed a significant improvement in task success with the not enrolled group (73%) compared to baseline (59%) – this included a significant increase in task success in 4/6 tasks, and 5/6 tasks in that group had 70% or higher task success, compared to 1/6 in baseline

## Finding 3: H0 failed 3 key tasks

Labels: label 1, label 2 

_List all labels that apply to this finding from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

- H0 had significant detriments and failing scores on tasks for eligibility (24%) and apply (27%) compared to baseline (87% and 78% respectively)
- H0 also failed the copay rates task (33%), which is important content to both Veterans who are not enrolled as well as those enrolled.  This failed task is interesting given the pay copay bill tasks was highly successful (94%) for H0 and the content lives in the same section labeled “Copay bills and travel pay”

## Finding 4: Both H0 and H1 showed significant improvements in the mental health and community care tasks compared to baseline

- For mental health, H1 had a significantly better success rate (71%) compared to baseline (43%) and  H0 (57%). H0 had a significantly better direct success rate (47%) compared to baseline (11%) and H1 (25%) 
- For community care, H0 had significantly better success rate (84%) compared to baseline (48%) and H1 (63%). H0 also had a significantly higher direct success rate (71%) compared to baseline (22%) and H1 (29%)

## Finding 5: H0 showed significant improvement in direct success compared to baseline, while H1 was flat

- H0 performed significantly better in directness (83%) and direct success (65%) compared to baseline (61% directness, 48% direct success), but not in overall task success
- H0 had a significant increase in tasks success for Veterans not enrolled in health care, and while H0 didn’t have a significant increase in task success for enrolled Veterans, it was trending positively

## Finding 6: H1 showed a significant decrease in 3 tasks

- Although H1 appears flat overall compared to baseline, it had a significant decrease in 3 tasks – Medical records (baseline 87%, H1 69%), Pay copays (baseline 87%, H1 69%), and Travel pay (baseline 67%, H1 39%) 
- H0, has the same structure and labeling for this content – H1 is just down 1 level- and scored 80% or higher on those same tasks
- While H1 failed the travel pay task overall, there was a stark difference in performance between the not enrolled group (70% task success) versus the enrolled group (42%)

## Finding 7: H1 showed a significant shift of where participants were exploring and selecting 

- Veterans exploring the manage spoke was significantly lower in H1 (60%) compared to baseline (74%), while the those exploring the “get” spoke increased in H1 (21%) compared to baseline (13%)
- Veterans that selected answers in the “manage” spoke (58%) was also trending down compared to baseline (63%), while answers selected in the “get” spoke in H1 (12%) was trending up compared to baseline (3%)
- H1 have a positive trending shift of fewer Veterans exploring the “resources” spoke in H1 (16%) compared to baseline (25%)

# Additional Insights

- H1 “manage” tasks performed significantly worse than H0 despite being the same organizational structure





# Recommendations

Recommendations will be put together once the Family member/caregiver tree test and the moderated Veteran tree test are complete. 




# Next Steps

1. Complete tree tests and synthesis 
  - Complete Family member/caregiver tree test and synthesis
  - Complete moderated Veteran tree test and synthesis
  - Create overall view of hypothesis performance across all 3 rounds of tree testing
  - Conduct first click test and synthesis
2. Impact analysis of key auth experience considerations 
  - Review and identify how key considerations will impact each approach to the health apartment
3. Make recommendation on health apartment approach
  - Recommend approach to health apartment based on analysis of research findings and key auth experience considerations
  - The key question to answer is whether the health apartment will replace the full existing health care hub, or focus on the content/tools related to managing health care (i.e. live within the manage section of the health care hub, or live separately from the health care hub)
4. Revise the IA for the health apartment and health care hub based on approach and research findings
  - Complete deep dive of specific task data and feedback from tree tests as needed in order to refine IA
  - Create revised IA to incorporate findings, missing content and tools, and current content strategy between the benefit hubs and Resources and Support
  - Conduct a tree test on the revised IA to ensure positive improvements
5. Continue Veteran and family member testing on revised IA and or prototypes as appropriate
