## Session 1 (was 2): Male, Raleigh NC
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to talk about how you find urgent medical care when you need it, and how the website at VA.gov can best support you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran’s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
* [Once you are recording],
My screen is now being recorded.

### Framing and background
(Approx. 10 minutes)


I’d like you to think back to a recent time when you needed urgent care. That could be anything from a fever that lasted too long or became too high to a significant injury that needed immediate attention.


If you’re comfortable sharing information about what took place, can you describe the situation briefly? If you aren’t comfortable sharing details about your health, that’s completely fine. (Skip question if subject requests to keep this information private.)

Christmas time, flu like symptoms, my wife said I should go to an urgent care clinic.

Can you tell me where you went for the care? What kind of facility was it — a VA facility, a walk-in facility, such as a minute clinic, or an emergency room in a traditional hospital?

Duke urgent care clinic, there’s a new one that’s 20 minutes away, googled that on the website, called them up, they had a walk in facility, waited 15 minutes to be seen, did a swab, did some tests, gave me some meds, 

Why did you choose that facility?

There’s one that we have, it was 30 minutes away, it was a little bit of a drive to get there, 10 minutes from our house, Duke bought it out. It was just closer down the road, my wife said hey they have a new one. Let’s try that. 

1. Distance - I deal with Duke primarily, I go to the VA for audiology, it’s 35 to 40 minute drive on a good day. Since I use Duke for primary care, it was just easier to go there? 

If that was your first time at that facility, do you remember how you learned about it and chose to go to that facility?

My first time, I’d been to the other location on two occasions. It’s on a main road, we noticed it was Rex and turned into Duke, sign changed over to Duke. 

If you had to find an urgent care facility quickly that was covered under your VA benefits, how would you do that? (Probe for device usage and/or preference.)

I would go on my desktop, Google urgent care Raliegh North Carolina. I know there is another one at Brer Creek, I would start with Duke Urgent Card Raleigh, 

Are you familiar with the Mission Act? 

I thought I saw something, a letter recently, not familiar with it. 

(If yes) What do you know about it? 

 	

### Speak Aloud Practice

(Approx. 1 minute)

What I’d like to do now is look at a few different websites, and while we look at these websites, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Let’s do a practice
(Have them share their screen, run through think aloud protocol to find the Veterans Affairs website using Google)

### Usability Test/Observation
(Approx. 15 minutes)
So let’s imagine you’ve got a medical situation where you’ve decided to seek urgent care. If you used this website, what would you do?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

I see a health care button, and I see Find a VA health facility

Under 

* Search - Urgent Care
* Search results for Urgent Care
* Added Zip Code, Fail
* Took out Zip Code, put Raleigh NC
* Fail 
* Go back to the home page
* Not a button that brings me back to home page
* Hit my back button twice
* Back to the four boxes
* Click on Health Care
* Nothing on urgent care on the hub
* I’d go back to “Get VA Health Care” 
* Click on that, I’m running out, nothing that’s popping up for urgent care

Other word - Walk in clinic
Emergency room - I wouldn’t do that for flu like symptoms

Facilitator lead to 
* Enter’s zip code, missed the text link
* Enter zip code, VA Health, Urgent Care
* These are 62 miles away, emporia’s 72 miles away
* Fail 
Facilitator lead to link
* Didn’t read
* Selected Zip code to prefer
* Zip 15 miles

The process is laborious, had I not guided you, at this stage, we see something to type in, we jump to that. We aren’t going to jump to the words that we are going to use. That needed to pop up earlier. Once I got to it it’s pretty good. It’s quite a few steps to get to this. You could get lost, and you’re home with the flu and you want to do this, it was 6 or.7 steps with my help. I’d go back to step one under the search engine, I should have come right to a screen like this. 

I want to know is it open now? Closed? Current wait? Even all the stores now do it, I’d like to see what the hours are as well. It’s too many steps. 

* Error - maps didn’t display
* Windows/Google Chrome

Now, let’s make sure you’re eligible for the location you’ve selected. How would you check your eligibility?

* Click back, I would make an assumptions that if’ its’ here I would be covered, I would call the number and say “I’m a Veteran with a VA card, what will be my cost?” I would do that before I drove over there
* I would call to check elibibility, 1833 number
* (Note they see this website as part of the VA website)

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

Final - I would say, there were a lot of steps to navigate through, and get to that. We are all Google and Amazon savvy. I can get to what I want pretty quickly on Amazon. That would be a good model for us to get to. That’s historically why I’ve stayed away, medical websites anyways, they are a bit laborious to do it. 

I see this on route 95 now, there is an emergency room with a. Digital sign up, we can be seen here in 14 minutes, see the wait time is at an urgent care. The organizations that we are teaming with, if you can link in and list the wait time, as we go forward with technology.

Overall too many steps. 

### Closing

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Session 2 (was 5), Male, Norwich CT
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to talk about how you find urgent medical care when you need it, and how the website at VA.gov can best support you.

### Framing and background
(Approx. 10 minutes)


I’d like you to think back to a recent time when you needed urgent care. That could be anything from a fever that lasted too long or became too high to a significant injury that needed immediate attention.


If you’re comfortable sharing information about what took place, can you describe the situation briefly? If you aren’t comfortable sharing details about your health, that’s completely fine. (Skip question if subject requests to keep this information private.)

It was maybe late last year, beginning of this year. Had a cold, I don’ have a primary doctor on the outside. I use the VA , it’s hard to find a doctor that wants to accept new patients. I called the “urgent care,” I call it “quick care” out of new London CT, went on the VA website, sent him a message, I’ve been feeling like crap, my chest is congested with a bunch of crap that’s in it, is there a way I can get seen? They said they have an opening, you can come in today, they did their normal vital signs. 

Can you tell me where you went for the care? 

It’s in new London CT, it’s a small satellite VA office, more of a burn your finger, you stub your toe, have common cold. It’s a clinic type thing, a small clinic, not very big, there’s a few offices, inner office type things. They help you go down to West Haven, CT, small stuff you can go to the bigger offices. 

(If necessary) What kind of facility was it — a VA facility, a walk-in facility, such as a minute clinic, or an emergency room in a traditional hospital?


Why did you choose that facility?

1. It’s close to my home, 15 miles/15 minutes (**DISTANCE**)
2. The doctor is a former Veteran, he listens to you, this is going on, we could try this, maybe try that, get’s you more involved with your care and not treat you like faster.  (**TRUST**)

If that was your first time at that facility, do you remember how you learned about it and chose to go to that facility?

Been there a few times, go there for my annual physical, gone there having a simple common cold, they can get you in, within 24 hours, or within an hour. Better than going to West Haven, or newington, can’t find a doctor quickly. If I need something, you don’t need the emergency room, that’s the closest and quickest way to see doctor. 

The VA mentioned it when I was there doing something, when I was in West Haven, a few friends that I worked with they mentioned that they had a small office. I did a quick Google search, click on the VA website, it brought you down to Shaws Cove, that’s close to where I live. 

If you had to find an urgent care facility quickly that was covered under your VA benefits, how would you do that? (Probe for device usage and/or preference.)

I’d probably go on Google first, type in a little information, if I wasn’t typing in the correct info, I would ask or call, I don’t really want to go down to WH or Newington, I would. 

I would call the CT VA first, then listen through the options, pick the best option that’s for me. They might be able to help, go farther down. 

I’d go to Google search engine, VA facilities near Orange CT., 

I usually use my phone, sometimes the phone doesn’t show the whole website, you can switch it to the desktop. Most of the Time it’s on my phone, first, 

Are you familiar with the Mission Act? 

I think they just redid something with it, I’ve been getting a lot of emails from the VA. They are allowing you to go to urgent care outside of the VA. I didn’t really quite read it. I could be totally wrong. 

(If yes) What do you know about it? 

 They had to redo it with something in the making for awhile. I’m getting a lot of emails all of a sudden, I never got this many emails. Earlier this year when they approved something, that’s when the emails started to come in about the mission act, things you can can’t do. 	

### Speak Aloud Practice

(Approx. 1 minute)

What I’d like to do now is look at a few different websites, and while we look at these websites, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Let’s do a practice
(Have them share their screen, run through think aloud protocol to find the Veterans Affairs website using Google)

### Usability Test/Observation
(Approx. 15 minutes)
So let’s imagine you’ve got a medical situation where you’ve decided to seek urgent care. If you used this website, what would you do?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

I would scroll down to see if they have a quick link to find a VA close to me. It doesn’t look like they… so would it be… if this is my first time signing up for benefits? I would go to send a secured message to your health care team. 

I’m not a phone person, I do everything through a text or email due to tinnitus. 

* Home page
* Sign in
* Sign in with ID.me **(NOTE PII AT THIS POINT)** 
* Wait for this, enter email address
* Enter Confirmation Code
* (Slow)
* Send a secure message
* Go to my Healthy Vet
* (For me I wouldn’t start a new conversation, I would follow up with the most recent message, with the Doctor’s secretary/nurse)
* Bring you to a section on what would you need, optometry, labs, X-ray
* Send to Dr. Granerio, that’s my primary
* If I sent a new message, I would compose a message, subject General

Guided them to go back to the home page

* Clicked on secure message
* Got stuck in home for my healthy vet
* So I have to sign out? 
* Opened new tab - VA.gov

* I would go to Contact Us to see if there is a number
* They just use the 203 area code for the WH VA facility (calls local facility)
* I would look for the West Haven number that’s on here
* I would call at this point, wait for the close option, or the best option, or the exact option for my situation, trying to find the nearest health care facility
* Unless it’s on the contact us

* contact us
* Find a VA location
* Let them know my location
* Dismissed Microsoft Edge
* Clicked on my state
* (Didn’t wait for it to load)
* Click on my post code, choose all facilities, click search
* (Didn’t see the still searching message at first)
* It’s good that it went to my location
* (Waiting just a few seconds, performance on this page is an issue) 

I usually do it on my cellphone, not the laptop

Guide to VA Approved Urgent Care (user didn’t see it)

* Clicked on that
* Important Read this
* (Read the page)
* I would go to this page, and look at it, 
* I would go to the urgent care facility up the street, call them first, ask them if they take VA patients, and if so, can I come in now and do whatever it is that they do. I don’t know if they all take it, I don’t wanna waste my time to drive up the street. 
* (User didn’t click on the button) 

Guided user to button (FAIL)

* Click on Zip Code by default
* Entered Zip Code, 15 miles
* Clicked on Search
* This is one that I know, know where these are, 3/4 I do know where they are which is not that far from where I live

Now, let’s make sure you’re eligible for the location you’ve selected. How would you check your eligibility?

* I would do the exact same thing - I would have figured it out, I would have done what we just did
* Except for that last part, find the page before this one. Knowing for me, I would still call whatever one I go to, I still would call that number just to make sure - you just want to verify everything is awesome, even though today at 4:36 pm the website says they accept it, it could have changed yetersdya. I still would call to confirm, just want to make sure that people are able to come to you to get seen. Another verification instead of going that distance, even though it’s not that far from the house, the hassle of travel and being turned down isn’t worth it. 

Guided user to home page, Mission Act

* User didn’t scroll past the four boxes
* (Since I’m able to sign in)
* If I didn’t know I’d check your claim or appeals status
* I would see, whoops, going faster than me. 
* For me that’s where I would go to start, try to see what else I can get from there

* They have Ebenefits, that’s another website to go to that’s really good

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

Anything else? 

I see the commercials that VA is partnered with Mobile, you can chat with your physician or a physician slash nurse, I don’t know fi that’s available for general common cold type stuff, urgent care. Maybe you can speed up the process, if you have your meds and the local CVS or the Walgreens, I don’t know how that portion works, but try to eliminate the small stuff. 

For me, I’m an actual Veteran, my credentials are set, the doctor/nurse on the video chat is a licensed whatever, this way you don’t have to physically go to the place, avoid the lines, unless it’s something serious. 

Conditions that you don’t need to do extensive or intense checking this that and the other thing, a lot of the Vets I talk to, we don’t mind going out, but some of us, it is far to go to some of these VA clinics, you have to deal with the traffic, hopefully they are on time, a lot of times they aren’t on time. Your 8oclock is now 9 oclock. 

If it’s all legal to do, with the webcam that would be great. Zoom in on my sore, oh okay that’s a normal rash, put you on a bennydryl, (etc.)

## Session 3 Male, Omaha, Nebraska

Name: 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to talk about how you find urgent medical care when you need it, and how the website at VA.gov can best support you.

### Framing and background
(Approx. 10 minutes)


I’d like you to think back to a recent time when you needed medical care quickly. That could be anything from a fever that lasted too long or became too high to a significant injury that needed immediate attention. What do you call it when something like that happens? 

Don’t have a name for it, and I can’t think of a time where I was on the fence. My experience has been that if I have an issue, it qualifies to go to the emergency room. 

If you’re comfortable sharing information about what took place, can you describe the situation briefly? If you aren’t comfortable sharing details about your health, that’s completely fine. (Skip question if subject requests to keep this information private.)

Last time I went to the emergency room, broken my little toe, I wasn’t sure it was broken, it was after hours, I really couldn’t go to the same day care, or try to get into to see one of my primary doctors if it wasn’t after hours. 

Been to the emergency room for multiple issues, can’t think at the moment of other issues. My wife might be able to, my wife might be able to, (asks wife) 

(Pause) 
Went when I had an attack of gout. Had a lot of pain, didn’t know what it was about. 

Can you tell me where you went for the care? 

Went to the Western VA hospital, emergency room. Nebraska. In Omaha. It’s a hike for me to go down there, it’s about 14 miles, or thereabouts. It’s just a longer drive than you would normally do. Omoaha is spread out, we live in the western area which is pretty far away. I live at 144th, Facility was 42

(If needed) What kind of facility was it — a VA facility, a walk-in facility, such as a minute clinic, or an emergency room in a traditional hospital?


Why did you choose that facility?

There’s no other VA facility that’s that close to me. Just to be clear, I’m 100% service connected disabled. 

If that was your first time at that facility, do you remember how you learned about it and chose to go to that facility?

Not first time. Been going there for the last 9 years. I was having issues with health, at the time I had heart failure, I had a lot of other diseases that I didn’t know where they came from, being treated at local facilities, my wife kept insisting I should go to the VA, I might qualify for VA care. She finally convinced me to go, I was 64, and had been terminated from my last job, at a health system here in town, so I went. And I qualified for a few years of regular care, in the mean time they started evaluating me and figured out I could apply for benefits, it was Agent Orange related. 

If you had to find an urgent care facility quickly that was covered under your VA benefits, how would you do that? (Probe for device usage and/or preference.)

As I understand it, the VA has an app or a link where I can go look up in my area what urgent care facilities are covered by the VA. I could locate the one that was closest to me. 

I believe I got an email that described the urgent care facility availability. I looked at that and clicked on it and saw that there was a whole bunch of them. Didn’t need them at the time so I didn’t memorize anything. 

Are you familiar with the Mission Act? 

Yes. Familiar as someone who hasn’t really used it. 

(If yes) What do you know about it? 

Essentially it replaced the original one that was out there for several years, it allows care in the community, if it’s appropriate and the VA approves it.  	

### Speak Aloud Practice

(Approx. 1 minute)

What I’d like to do now is look at a few different websites, and while we look at these websites, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Let’s do a practice

(Have them share their screen, run through think aloud protocol to find the Veterans Affairs website using Google)

### Usability Test/Observation
(Approx. 15 minutes)
Let’s say you wanted to see if you were eligible for coverage of urgent care How would you check your eligibility?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

* Search
* Would type urgent care
* Community based urgent care
* Four step process, confirm elibilttiy, click on eligibility
* Eligibility
* Success (met both criteria)


* Go to the VA urgent care locator 
* Read this first
* (Retail and urgent are differentiated here) 
	* Describes what the VA would pay for, prescriptions, etc. 
	* Also call pharmacy hours before seeking it
* Flind a Network Urgent Care Location
* Go to search by Zip Code
	* Enter Zip Code
	* Five Mile Radius
* There is one and it’s very close to me, 144th on West Maple Road
* Get the info and the phone number
* I would call the clinic, describe my situation to see if it was appropriate for their care
	* Might suggest I go someplace else

To qualify my answers
1. I worked in HC for over 40 years
2. I was a labrotory scientist
3. I was director of many laboratyies, radiology, patient transport, during 44 years
4. I have a little more experience in Health Care than the average Veteran in trying to seek out care. 

Anything you might have a little more insider knowledge about? 

No, except I knew the steps to go through ahead of time, I got an email and checked it out, what I would do, ahead of time. Not intending to go anywhere, because I had no problem. 

So let’s imagine you’ve got a medical situation where you’ve decided to seek urgent care. If you used this website, what would you do?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

(Go back to VA home page)

* Clicks on VA logo
* User looks at the options below
* Clicks on the Mission Act link
* Lean About Community Care elebility
	* This isn’t going to help me a lot
* Click on on Appointments/Getting Care
* VA Facility Locator
	* That’s VA locations, I would back away from this
* Click on VA-approved urgent care locations and pharmacies
	* We’re back where we were
* Find network urgent care lcoations
* Switch to Zip Code
* Enter Zip Code
* End up with the same facility
* Had wrong zip code, no results
* Ended up with same facility
* Didn’t zoom in
* Success

That’s a lot of steps to do it that way, there’s needs to be something on that front end page to make it quicker. The main VA.gov page, there is no direct link to get to here (urgent car) in any kind of speed. We went through a lot of pages to get back to here. There needs to be a quicker link on the front page, without going through all those steps over again.

Maybe 1, check your elegibility, maybe 2, there’s one that says find an urgent care facility. 

I can imagine someone who has other disabilities than what I have, struggling with that. I have above average use of computer systems myself.  

I’m above average with using computers, I didn’t tear down this computer to replace a solid state drive that’s failing, in anticipation of this thing, otherwise this would be torn in pieces. 

This one is a ME.2 solid state drive, buried on the circuit board, under the graphics card on this computer, got to pull everything out… (computer stories) 

Any other feedback? 

I think this is a great step, by the VA, to determine whether or not a Veteran can figure this thing out. You have other goals that I don’t know anything about probably. 

### Closing
(Remaining time)
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

## Session 4, Male, Tamps

### Framing and background
(Approx. 10 minutes)


I’d like you to think back to a recent time when you needed urgent care. That could be anything from a fever that lasted too long or became too high to a significant injury that needed immediate attention.


If you’re comfortable sharing information about what took place, can you describe the situation briefly? If you aren’t comfortable sharing details about your health, that’s completely fine. (Skip question if subject requests to keep this information private.)

I had a urinary tract infection and I had to go the ER. And I went from there, they did some tests on me, and admitted me for a few days. 

Can you tell me where you went for the care? 

Went to the VA in Tampa

(If necessary) What kind of facility was it — a VA facility, a walk-in facility, such as a minute clinic, or an emergency room in a traditional hospital?


Why did you choose that facility?

That’s where they usually do my care anyway, it’s a spinal cord injury clinic. They have a good program there for that. More better than the regular hospital. Been there before, go there all the time. 

If that was your first time at that facility, do you remember how you learned about it and chose to go to that facility?

That was way back in 1997, when we first moved here, it was the VA hospital. 

If you had to find an urgent care facility quickly that was covered under your VA benefits, how would you do that? (Probe for device usage and/or preference.)

Go to the emergency room at an ER hospital, the one that’s closest to me, which I have done before. Know where it is. 

Are you familiar with the Mission Act? 

Yes. 

(If yes) What do you know about it? 

We’re going through the Mission Act now. I know we are trying to get through a couple of programs, but they are just starting, not too many people know how they use it to much. Trying to get therapy down her outside of the VA, they haven’t been given permission to do it yet. I got bowel and bladder care program, that we need to go with.  	

### Speak Aloud Practice

(Approx. 1 minute)

What I’d like to do now is look at a few different websites, and while we look at these websites, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Let’s do a practice
(Have them share their screen, run through think aloud protocol to find the Veterans Affairs website using Google)

### Usability Test/Observation
(Approx. 15 minutes)

Let’s say we’d like to  sure you’re eligible for the location you’ve selected. How would you check your eligibility?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

* Schedule and view your appointments
	* Trying to figure out where I would go for that
* (Long searching)
* Click on Health Care heading below
* Click on The Mission Act and VA care
	* Considered Find a VA Location Near You (Mission Act site)
* Learn About Community Care Eligibility
	* (Compared the six bars, looked at them but did not read the heading above it)
* Urgent Care (in left menu)
	* (Reads confirm eligibility)
* Click Elgibility
	* (Reads eligibility)
	* 

NOTE HE CONSIDERS HIS LOCAL VA WEB PAGE HIS HOME PAGE, WE”VE SEEN THIS BEHAVIOR A FEW TIMES

So let’s imagine you’ve got a medical situation where you’ve decided to seek urgent care. If you used this website, what would you do?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

* (Looks for a label… Find a VA Facility)
* Clicked on Health Care
* Get VA Health Care
	* (Thinks this is getting the care, not APPLYing for the care)
* Looking to see where there’s a thing that shows me where the facilities are, (doesn’t see it)
* Clicked on Community Care (Down the page) 
* Clicked on Urgent Care in the Content (icon)
* VA Urgent Care Locator
	* (Looking for locations, reads about retail and urgent, or clinic)
* Looking to see if he can find location
* (Long wait) Find an Urgent Care Location at the bottom
* Search by Zip Code
* Entered Zip Code, 50 mile radius
	* (Selected 50 miles, because I know there’s not one right here, assumed it’s VA facilities only)
	* Fast Track urgent care, 21, Minute Clinic
* (Browsed list) There isn’t one that wouldn’t be a good fit

Why wouldn’t these be a good fit? 

These are all the minute clinic, those are the drug stores. 

It says urgent care, but I might as well go to the VA ER. Since nothings really that close. 

Are these closer than the VA ER? 

Some of these are closer. 

I’d prefer to go to the VA because they can deal better with me. I’m an SCI patient, the regular hospitals don’t work that well in my case. They aren’t equipped to do SCI patients, really spinal cord injuries. They aren’t equipped to do that. 

Any other feedback? 

No I think that we’re, it’s all little bit dfifficult to navigate. It doesn’t just pop up. You have to look around a little bit. 

### Closing
(Remaining time)
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we’d like to offer you a $50 thank-you gift. Is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address Shannon and Brian used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? [If no] Ok, we’ll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you’re a part of? If so, we can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect to our team.
Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Session 5, Female Atlanta GA
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to talk about how you find urgent medical care when you need it, and how the website at VA.gov can best support you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran’s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
* [Once you are recording],
My screen is now being recorded.

### Framing and background
(Approx. 10 minutes)


I’d like you to think back to a recent time when you needed urgent care. That could be anything from a fever that lasted too long or became too high to a significant injury that needed immediate attention.


If you’re comfortable sharing information about what took place, can you describe the situation briefly? If you aren’t comfortable sharing details about your health, that’s completely fine. (Skip question if subject requests to keep this information private.)

In the past 6 mos, had to go to urgent care because I had gotten a really bad migraine, lasted 48 hours, the meds weren’t working. Had to go urgent care for additional medical care. 

Can you tell me where you went for the care? 

I actually went to an emergency room in Atlanta. The wait was shorter and I was able to get in faster. I just got there checked in and was seen within 10 minutes. When I’m in pain like that, waiting is pretty diff. To wait in a bright room. 

(If necessary) What kind of facility was it — a VA facility, a walk-in facility, such as a minute clinic, or an emergency room in a traditional hospital?

Private hospital. 

Why did you choose that facility?

Wait time. Really only the wait time that made me go. 

If that was your first time at that facility, do you remember how you learned about it and chose to go to that facility?

Word of mouth, talking to people, being new to the area, not really knowing others. Reviews from others. 

Read them somewhere?

Spoke to them in person, also doing online searches. 

If you had to find an urgent care facility quickly that was covered under your VA benefits, how would you do that? (Probe for device usage and/or preference.)

I’d go to google and I would type in the nearest VA OR VA clinics, I would go from there. If one isn’t accessible I’d go to the nearest minute clinic or emergency room. 

What device: primarily I use my phone, which is an iPhone

Are you familiar with the Mission Act? 

I’m getting famliar with it, but not totally familiar. 

(If yes) What do you know about it? 

I believe that now you can use at this time you can use urgent care facilities, with your VA health care. 

Where you heard that first? 

I think I read it when I was at one of my appointments at the VA. 	

### Speak Aloud Practice

(Approx. 1 minute)

What I’d like to do now is look at a few different websites, and while we look at these websites, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Let’s do a practice

(Have them share their screen, run through think aloud protocol to find the Veterans Affairs website using Google)

### Usability Test/Observation
(Approx. 15 minutes)
So let’s imagine you’ve got a medical situation where you’ve decided to seek urgent care. If you used this website, what would you do?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

* Home page
* Find a VA Location
	* (Location permission - user didn’t notice this)
	* Says need same day care for a minor illness or injury, I would say it’s a minor illness, just getting an IV or two bags, I would say it’s a minor illness
* I would click on VA Approved Urgent Care locations and Pharmacies (above search)
	* Reading to make sure I understand what I clicked on
	* Talking about you can only seek care from VA’s contracted network
	* There are two types
	* Walkin health clinic, and urgent locations, are the ones diagnose, need immediate medical attention, not an emergency room - those are for illnesses or injuries, that are not life threatening
* Find a Network Urgent Care Location
	* Normally search by Zip Code
* Search by Zip Code
	* I like to keep it in a smaller radius, I would leave it at 5 mile radius
* Click on search
	* I have lots of options, 15, I have a map, and I have a minute clinic on Peachtree, St.
	* I see two different colors - I don’t know what it means
	* Oh - green is a retail location, blue is urgent care
	* 
* SUCCESS

How would you pick which location you would go to? 

I would need the urgent care, which would be the blues. 

The closest would be (Specific one) 

I would click on or hover over the name and click on it
 (Note content is rendering off the page) 

Next I would call and ask their hours before driving there. 

Now, let’s make sure you’re eligible for the location you’ve selected. How would you check your eligibility?

I would ask them over the phone if they take VA benefits, under the new Act, which I forgot the name of. 

* Home page
	* VA Benefits and Health Care drop down
* Would pick the bottom one, go to the Mission Act
	* So I would click about learn about community care elibility, maybe, or I would probably click on Urgent and Walk-in 
* Lean about your urgent care benefits
	* Scrolls to Process Overview
	* Find a provider within the network, confirm elebelity by saying VA benefit
	*  There’s a phone number to dial for assistance
	* When you walk in, we can dial the Tri West system the IVR system to check the elibility
* SUCCESS

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

Any other feedback? 

* I don’t know if it’s on there already, but would this all be in one location, with everything on a pamphlet or brochure? Trying to navigate systems sometimes can be overwhelming when you have to from one tab to another. E.g. you want to print it out and put on a refridgerator.

REALLY INTERSTING IDEA _ FOR SOMEONE IN URGENT CARE OR TRAVELLING

Like a one pager?

Maybe like a flow chart, with the phone numbers, locate the location, contact to verify eligibility, etc. 

A one pager would be helpful, going and doing this is good, but you aren’t in constant pain, you can just grab that or look at it

## Session 6, Male Live Oak Florida

### Framing and background
(Approx. 10 minutes)


I’d like you to think back to a recent time when you needed urgent care. That could be anything from a fever that lasted too long or became too high to a significant injury that needed immediate attention.


If you’re comfortable sharing information about what took place, can you describe the situation briefly? If you aren’t comfortable sharing details about your health, that’s completely fine. (Skip question if subject requests to keep this information private.)

Most recent one, myself, I live in a rural area, and I was doing something something with a fence, a piece of fell and hit me on the shin, punctured the skin, pretty deep, bled freely. My concern was I couldn’t remember my last tetanus shot. I wasn’t bleeding out, but also I had a tetanus problem, wanted to get that looked at property soon. 

Can you tell me where you went for the care? 

I went my VA PCM. I called them, I can’t remember if it was in the evening or next day, I think that’s what happened, after regular hours, I was leaving town. First thing the following morning, I called the clinic and told theme the situation, they got me in, got me the tetanus booster. 

(If necessary) What kind of facility was it — a VA facility, a walk-in facility, such as a minute clinic, or an emergency room in a traditional hospital?

VA Primary Care Manager. His doc or his team. Regular VA Hostpiratl, not an outpatient facility. 

Why did you choose that facility?

I have coverage there, don’t have to worry about copays. Had I gone to a civilian provider or ER, it would have been more out of pocket cost, and I have a. Good relationship with the team, I can call them or send them an email, they usually accommodate the vets, I know they have walk in slots every day, something like this they felt like I needed to be seen. 

If that was your first time at that facility, do you remember how you learned about it and chose to go to that facility?

I work there. I worked there for a few years back in the mid 2000s. I would have known anyway, as a Vet I pay attention to that kind stuff. I’d been receiving care at another VA so I was used to.

Where’s my nearest VA, how do I get assigned to a team, what’s the process I go through. I need to go to the facility, get records transferred. Those types of issues, setting up a relationship with the provider, learning about the facility, what’s their phone number, where are they located. 

If you had to find an urgent care facility quickly that was covered under your VA benefits, how would you do that? (Probe for device usage and/or preference.)

Purely VA, then the odds are pretty high I would know where I’m going, where is the closest VA to that location. Let’s say I’m on the road, point A to Point B, I have to fix a flat, and I injure myself changing a tire. I should be seen by someone to make sure it’s nothing serious. 

I’d guess I’d go to Google, or something like that, and say “nearest VA to my location.” 

I’d use my mobile phone, my iPhone. 

Are you familiar with the Mission Act? 

I am familiar with it, not as much as I should be. I know that it deals with some of the issues, distance, wait times, that were covered under the choice act. I haven’t dug into in depth to see what the differences are. 

(If yes) What do you know about it?

### Usability Test/Observation
(Approx. 15 minutes)
So let’s imagine you’ve got a medical situation where you’ve decided to seek urgent care. If you used this website, what would you do?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

Knew about the new VA.gov

Talked to them about the new VA.gov

	* (I’m on this page, I can see there’s a block that says Health Care)
	* (Don’t see anything that applies to an urgent care situation, if this was more routine it covers key areas. I don’t see anything about an urgent situation)
	* (Scroll down the page, so I )
* Find a VA health facility benefit, office, cemetary
* Entered a city
* Clicked search
	* Gives me, there’s a VA clinic, that I see that comes up. There are 8, I can scroll down
* So what I would do now, and I’m not sure how to do it, what I want to know is which one is the closest to where I am. (DISTANCE)
	* I would call the phone number, I would probably call first, one decision is what time of day. 
	* If it’s business hours I would call them. - this is my situation, I would call
	* If it’s after hours, I would scroll down and go to the VA medical center because it would be a 24/7 operation
* FAIL             

* Saw the VA Approved Urgent Care Locations after finished - Missed it
	* Here’s my thought - if I’m trying to find a VA facility near me, the design might want to make the assumption it’s because I’m not familiar with the area and I need something right now versus in the future. If it’s right now, I’m probably going to want the option to look for health care facilities, kind of sooner, so it wouldn’t be…
	* That link, should have been on the previous page
	* The option here, Find a VA, should be under health care, doesn’t need to be the top one - these reasons are more likely, but we might want a button that says “need urgent care?” Something like that. Is this routine or do you need something that’s more speed on finding something
	* **You could do the find a VA location, but that’s too generic - I want a health care facility**
	* You can go to another VA, etc. whatever that button would have sent me to 
	* I do like the language “Find…” but it needs to be more in my face
* VA- approved facilities (above search)
* On the Urgent Care Benefit - read me page
	* It’s got a read this, that’s good
	* It’s unfortunate we need to have this stuff: one part of me says you don’t someone going to a place and end up with a significant out of pocket expense. On the other hand, if it’s an urgent care situation, do you want to have them wade through the legal phrasing? 
* I would click on Find a Network Urgent Care Location
* Iowa City
	* Gives me the invformation, the red/white x is where the clinic is. That is a VA clinic - it says “call urgent care for hours ofhoperation, but I can’t click on it. I’m not sure about this right here. It’s not a clickable link. (Failure page, no search results, 
* Click on urgent care clinic - 
	* FAIL this is a legend as opposed to a tab.
* At this point I’m a little stuck.FAIL

* Maybe I could search by the Zip Code to find a non va facility
	* I don’t the Zip Code, if I did know the Zip Code, I would still do VA facility search, but if that didn’t work I would search Zip Code
* Search by Zip Code
	* I would give it more than 5 mile radius, I want more options
* Click Search
	* No locations there, that has nothing to do with you guys
* I might go back and do the VA facility
* At this point I ‘m kind of stuck 
* FAIL

* Abandon and go to Tri Care website


Now, let’s make sure you’re eligible for the location you’ve selected. How would you check your eligibility?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

	* I thought I saw something… about elebility at some point
	* At the bottom is the Mission Act, it does say learn about eligibility criteria, it matches 
* Mission Act at the bottom (not the bar, user missed the bar) 
* When can you use non VA providers (Learn about community care elibilitiy)
	* I wouldn’t go to the video right away, scan the page, here’s the process
	* “Proof” that I’m eligible, it will say that the VA and I are both on the same page in terms of elibigliy to get that care. 
	* The VA or the veteran schedules the appointment with the provider, it looks like I won’t see anything/any bill for that. 
	* It’s already dealt with
* I might click on elibiligy
	* To get a little bit more info, I’ve been around long enough to know if I read this list it’s doesn’t mean I get it. I’m confirming I meet this criteria
	* (Interprets the criteria) 
* I would click on the Fact Sheet  for Quality Standards - I’d probably read that 
	* (NOTE: THE FACT SHEET IS NOT A “SHEET” IT”S FOUR OR FIVE PAGES)
	* It doesn’t tell me here, how am I informed of that. Does this mean I call my local VA before with a specialist to confirm? Is there some other process, that’s not a usability issue. 
	
* What I do appreciate, having the opportunity to do this
* I like the design, this is pretty straightforward
* The challenge is going to be the refinement, I really would recommend if you could put something under Health Care that says “need urgent care” if you identify that as something that people are going to need. I can see that seeing a real possible needs. 
* I like that I don’t have to look around to find my prescriptions and the Secur messages, and appts. These are the top 3.

### Framing and background
(Approx. 10 minutes)


I’d like you to think back to a recent time when you needed urgent care. That could be anything from a fever that lasted too long or became too high to a significant injury that needed immediate attention.

I have one quick question before we get started. I am not exactly sure if this survey was sent to me as a Veteran who doesn’t use the VA, honorably discharged, or as a caregiver to our Veteran, who is 100% service connected. 

We tried to register, so we could be counted, but we were told because of priority group 8g, something, financially we would not qualify for Vet services, we were denied. 

Who 

If you’re comfortable sharing information about what took place, can you describe the situation briefly? If you aren’t comfortable sharing details about your health, that’s completely fine. (Skip question if subject requests to keep this information private.)


Can you tell me where you went for the care? 

In his case, what we have to do if he needs emergency care, he is followed by a spinal cord injury center, we call the San Antonio VA, make arrangements to get him there first, unless it was life threatening. If it was urgent, we would drive 2 hours for care. 

(If necessary) What kind of facility was it — a VA facility, a walk-in facility, such as a minute clinic, or an emergency room in a traditional hospital?

VA South Texas Veterans Health Care system, his primary care physicians. 

Why did you choose that facility?

It fits his needs better than the closer one, which is in Temple TX, it has more of a geriatric population, and if we need respite care, the SA VA is more age appropriate. 

If that was your first time at that facility, do you remember how you learned about it and chose to go to that facility?

Yes, he was in patient at a civilian neuro rehab center, and this was in 2005, one of the doctors that practiced there, who had done his residency at the spinal cord injury center in SA, knew that we were working on discharge planning. Suggested we call there, gave us contact info. Felt like we may have an easier time getting the equipment we need than if you discharge from here, without them having evaluated him. We sent his med. records in, they had us bring him down for a week admission, it turns out he was there for six weeks, they helped us transition home, taught us how to do home care programs, ordered hospital bed, iv poles. 

If you had to find an urgent care facility quickly that was covered under your VA benefits, how would you do that? (Probe for device usage and/or preference.)

Theres one here in Lakways - Vicks urgent care, I have used it myself, for servere nosebleeds, I would drive him there. 

Are you familiar with the Mission Act? 

Yes. 

Where did you first hear about the Mission Act? 

I’m on a bunch of .gov email update lists, whatever is going on with Veterans. I may have seen it on Facebook, maybe in the news. It could have also been through the Elizabeth Dole foundation hidden heroes news. I’m an EDF fellow, anything news related, we get from them, stuff of high importance. 

(If yes) What do you know about it? 

 I know that it would allow us to access urgent care centers that are int he program, closer to home.

(Approx. 1 minute)

What I’d like to do now is look at a few different websites, and while we look at these websites, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Let’s do a practice
(Have them share their screen, run through think aloud protocol to find the Veterans Affairs website using Google)

### Usability Test/Observation
(Approx. 15 minutes)

Now, let’s make sure you’re eligible for the location you’ve selected. How would you check your eligibility?

Looking at this there’s a whole list of menus, at the bottom, learn how 
* Click on the Mission Act blurb at the bottom
* Urgent and Walk-In Care, Learn About Urgent Care Benefits
	* Looked at process overview
* Clicked on VA Urgent Care Locator (link below the icon)
	* The first thing that pops out that under the care benefit, it must be within the network, don’t go to anybody that’s not on this list, they may not get paid
	* Click on “READ THIS” read and print this page.
	* First thing talks about urgent care perscription - well I would think that access to urgent care should be first, and prescription second
	* I would have had page 2 as page 1, answers questions not just for me but for the provider. 
	* The first page is labeled incorrectly, it should be perscription
	* PARTIAL FAIL
	* I would bold and capitalize that
	* Civilian providers, one of the first things is that they’re not going to get paid. It’s a hard job to get paid through the Choice program
	* Feels successful

Let’s imagine you’ve got a medical situation where you’ve decided to seek urgent care. If you used this website, what would you do?

* Go to Search 
* Type Urgent Care Locations
* No, and then I would add Texas
* No, then I would change that to Urgent Care Approved Locations Texas
* No, then I would add Mission Act
* Looks like that would send me somewhere, the first result
* Go to My Healthy Vet
* Login 
	* (Very familiar with the system) 
* I would do the same search, without logging in, and looking to see if there’s something on the mission act in there. 
	* my health.va.gov
* Special publication about urgent care and the Mission Act
* VA Fact Sheet (pdf)
* Page 2, I would scroll through the fist page, all the same information that was further back, then it says finding an urgent care provider 
* Va.gov/find location
	* Now I can do it by city state or postal code
* Accepted it to allow location
* Put in our address, searching for Community Care (Non-Va Health) Type Urgent Care
* Hit search
* OH But I see the link above the map, I might click - Click on the VA approved urgent care above the map
* Now that thing comes back up, so that I can read this important notice, nothing came up telling me, 
* Click Find a Network Urgent Care Location
	* Now I have to go through it all over ageain
* Search by Zip Code
* Enter Zip Code, would change to 15
* Hit Search
	* I see two that are in our community
	* 11 different facilties
	* Probably fast med 
	* I think minute clinic is CVS Phramacy
		* I don’t know why I wouldn’t choose it, the only thing we’ve done through minute clinic is flu shots, I don’t in may mind see it as an urgent care clinic, see it as a convenience thing for a flu or a cold. I don’t know that they would have x rays like

Any other feedback:

Unless you’re familiar and informed on VA regulations I don’t know that every Veteran or Caregiver would think to do the mission act. I would like to see Urgent Care used before the mission act. 

I don’t think you’re thinking eligibility when someone is running a fever. I would be going to VA.gov and looking for an urgent care center.

## Session 8
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to talk about how you find urgent medical care when you need it, and how the website at VA.gov can best support you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran’s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
* [Once you are recording],
My screen is now being recorded.

### Framing and background
(Approx. 10 minutes)


I’d like you to think back to a recent time when you needed urgent care. That could be anything from a fever that lasted too long or became too high to a significant injury that needed immediate attention.


If you’re comfortable sharing information about what took place, can you describe the situation briefly? If you aren’t comfortable sharing details about your health, that’s completely fine. (Skip question if subject requests to keep this information private.)


Can you tell me where you went for the care? 


(If necessary) What kind of facility was it — a VA facility, a walk-in facility, such as a minute clinic, or an emergency room in a traditional hospital?


Why did you choose that facility?



If that was your first time at that facility, do you remember how you learned about it and chose to go to that facility?



If you had to find an urgent care facility quickly that was covered under your VA benefits, how would you do that? (Probe for device usage and/or preference.)



Are you familiar with the Mission Act? 



(If yes) What do you know about it? 

 	

### Speak Aloud Practice

(Approx. 1 minute)

What I’d like to do now is look at a few different websites, and while we look at these websites, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Let’s do a practice
(Have them share their screen, run through think aloud protocol to find the Veterans Affairs website using Google)

### Usability Test/Observation
(Approx. 15 minutes)
So let’s imagine you’ve got a medical situation where you’ve decided to seek urgent care. If you used this website, what would you do?

Now, let’s make sure you’re eligible for the location you’ve selected. How would you check your eligibility?
