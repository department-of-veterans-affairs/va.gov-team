# Urgent Care Usability Study
#### Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA)
Kevin M. Hoffman, June 2019

## Research goals
This usability study was meant to reveal pain points and identify possible short term improvements to the experience of learning about urgent care benefit eligibility and finding urgent care facilities covered under VA benefits. This study came out of recent updates to VA (and related) websites and applications incorporating new content as a result of the Mission Act.

Research needs to begin with a clear identification of a hypothetical problem. The problem we are focused on is this: a user of VA and related websites and applications, in order to take advantage of urgent care, needs to understand their coverage and find a facility that will provide that care. 

We interviewed each user, then had them execute tasks that provide insight into the following questions: 
* How do people use the current site to assess their eligibility for urgent care?
* What pathways and page elements in the home page, VA.gov, the facility locator, and the TriWest VA Urgent Care and Retail Locations (referred to as the TriWest location finder) tool best support understanding their urgent care benefits and finding a facility for that care?
* What natural language do Veterans use to assess their eligibility for that care, and find urgent care facilities?
* What design system elements are the most likely to support these needs, and in what pages would those elements be most effective?

Prior to the study, we hypothesized that: 
* The current implementation is confusing to users because it is a blend of VA tools and non-VA tools. This results in a loss of confidence in information and leads to failure at key tasks, such as finding a facility and understanding the eligibility for urgent care benefits.
* There isn’t sufficient “gradation of emergency” in the design of VA.gov and related websites to match the variation of urgency in care needs. We only have one level of urgency across the site, but urgent care might be considered less urgent, or a different kind of urgent, than the purpose of our primary hotline.
* Veterans may not know labels and terms associated with the Mission Act well enough to associate the Mission Act with urgent care, or may not remember that association when they are in an urgent care situation.

## Methodology

Usability research is used to assess how well websites, applications, physical tools, and devices are able to successfully help a user perform a task. When enough (four or more out of six to eight) users fail at a task it has been statistically validated that most users will probably fail at that task, and there is not further need to test with more users. Task failures merit changes, such as revising the content or labels used in the design, revising the design itself, or revising the way that the design functions. 

### Tasks assessed

The research assessed those sites’ and applications’ ability to support users on two tasks:

1. Can users find an urgent care facility? 
2. Can users confirm what urgent care benefits are covered by the VA?  

It is worth noting that these two tasks are interrelated. If a user attempts to complete one of these tasks, they will accumulate knowledge that will influence the choices they make in the other task. For this reason, half of users began with task 1 (find a facility), then followed with task 2 (assess if they would be covered under their VA benefits at that facility). The other half of users began with task 2 (investigate what urgent care benefits are covered), and then completed with task 1 (find a facility that would meet their urgent care needs that was covered under those benefits).  

### About the participants

We invited 6 Veterans and 1 Veteran caregiver (referred to as “users”) to spend approximately 30 minutes with a researcher reviewing existing web sites and web-based applications relevant to the two tasks. 

Users were geographically spread throughout the U.S. and demographically diverse, but there was a majority of test subjects who identify as men rather than those that identify as women. A full profile of users can be found in the appendix. 

## Research limitations 
### Device preference

To test these tasks we asked users to look at websites and web applications in a desktop (or laptop) browser. When asked, a majority of users stated that they would be more likely to use their phone (usually an iPhone) to complete the task of finding an urgent care facility. For this reason, testing using the users mobile device of choice is recommended for further study on the “find a facility” task. Reasons that a minority of users cited for not using an iPhone to find a facility include: 
* User preference
* Habit of trusting “full size” websites for more information, e.g. mobile websites “don’t always show everything” 
* Caregiver performing the search for the Veteran (note, this was only one user and cannot be considered a pattern)

For the second task, assessing eligibility for urgent care benefits, nearly all users stated they would use a desktop (laptop) browser. 

### Methodological limitations

Usability research is not a method that is effective at assessing what a knowledge a group of people have (e.g. “Do Veteran’s know about the urgent care benefits provided by the Mission Act?”)  In this study, we’ve noted where certain topics and insights would be worth further research via the appropriate method, such as empathy interviews or surveys.

## Issues revealed 
Our findings are organized into five sections:

* Primary Findings 

Addresses whether or not users were successful at the tasks identified, and what aspects of each of our hypotheses were confirmed or refuted. 

* Severe Issues (by task) 

These issues are problems that all or nearly all users encountered. 

* Moderate Issues (by task) 

These issues are problems that happened often enough that they are worth addressing, but they aren’t universally experienced. 

* Issues by Page/Application

This organizes observed issues users encountered by page or application state. 

* Other Findings of Note

We began by interviewing users about their general behaviors around finding urgent care locations. Although that was not the primary purpose of this study, it helped users get into the appropriate frame of mind before executing the two tasks, and revealed some interesting contexts which could affect success at either tasks. Finding from those interviews are outlined in the /Other findings of note/ section. These findings should be considered as clues that could guide further research, but not as definitive findings. 

### Primary findings

To review, the two tasks we explored were

1. Can users find an urgent care facility? 
2. Can users confirm what urgent care benefits are covered by the VA? 

The primary findings for each of these tasks can be summed up as:

1. They cannot find an urgent care facility in an efficient fashion, if at all. 
2. They cannot successfully confirm what urgent care benefits are covered by the VA, but some users have methods for doing so that exist just beyond what our websites provide. 

For users in this study that were asked to explore their eligibility for urgent care /before/ finding an urgent care facility (task 2 before task 1), they were more likely to be successful in finding a facility. However, this is the reverse sequence that most users believed they would execute these tasks. When asked, they stated they wouldn’t naturally check their eligibility for urgent care when they were experiencing a health issue that required urgency. Two users noted exceptions to this preferred sequence, stating that they have gotten into the habit of calling before they leave the house to make sure they have the coverage they need. They both stated that they do this because of past negative experiences. 

#### Results of hypotheses

Observed user behaviors confirm our first hypothesis: the current implementation is confusing to users and they do fail at the task of finding a location more often than not. However, one assumption for why they fail is not confirmed: that they find the mix of VA and non-VA tools confusing. The blend of VA and non-VA systems doesn’t result in a loss of confidence — it actually results in a misunderstanding: users assume when using the TriWest facility locator, all results are covered when in actually they may not be. They assume this because they arrived there from a VA.gov link. 

Our second hypothesis, that there isn’t sufficient “gradation of urgency,” was partially confirmed. Throughout the study users often sought out the terms “urgent care” in multiple places and were unable to find them. They also used certain terms (urgent care, walk-in care, approved urgent care) to search for the information they needed unsuccessfully. 

Our third hypothesis stated that users may not know labels and terms associated with the Mission Act enough to associate it with this need. This was partially confirmed by the fact that more users have limited or no knowledge of the relationship between urgent care and the Mission Act. In addition, nearly all users stated a lack of confidence in their understanding of the Mission Act, saying things like “I may have read something about that in an e-mail” or “I’m not sure but I think it’s about community care.” 

The methodology of this study (usability research) is not ideal to confirm or deny this how well a group of people “knows something.” Further study is recommended to assess whether or not Mission Act knowledge is pervasive among users. However, users knowledge of the Mission Act is not as important as whether or not Veterans are able to find the care and information they need using *their own natural language,* and not the names of laws or policies that provide that care. 

### Severe issues

#### Task: Find an Urgent Care Facility
* Most users could not find an urgent care location without assistance, which was only provided when a user would state “I’m not sure what to do next.” Failure points, where users stated they were stuck, include the following pages:
	* MyHealtheVet
	* Site search results
		* User got results they felt wouldn’t help them
		* User got an empty result without being advised on next steps
	* VA Health Care benefits hub 
	* The Community Care landing page
	* The VA.gov facility locator 
		* Failed to work as expected, user couldn’t click on his state
		* User interpreted facility results incorrectly, assuming VA Hospitals were urgent care facilities
	* The TriWest facility locator 
		* User assumed “Minute Clinics” were drugstores, and couldn’t get the appropriate care there
		* User got an empty result without being advised on next steps
* No user used the "Find a VA Location" link in the site header for the urgent care use case. This is an issue because it is the most direct path to the information available. Home page pathways that users followed (from most used to least used) include:  
	* Search - More than half of users
	* Health Care (clickable heading near the bottom of the page) - Some users
	* Contact Us (which does lead to the VA.gov location finder) - Few users
	* Find a VA health facility, benefit office, or cemetery (blue box in the lower left corner of the home page) - One user
* Users that used site search (more than half of users) to try to find urgent care locations would repeatedly refine their search terms up to four times with no satisfactory results. Common strategies (observed more than once) included adding the following terms to there term “urgent care:” 

	* State names
	* City names
	* Zip codes

These strategies did not result in finding information that the user found satisfactory. 

Less common strategies (observed in one user) included adding the terms

* Approved, i.e. “Approved locations urgent care Texas” 
* Mission Act, i.e. “Mission Act approved locations urgent care” 

The latter of the two less common strategies resulted in a single user finding their way through the Mission Act site through to the TriWest urgent care facility locator. /Please note, this was only observed in one out of seven sessions, and should be considered an outlier, but possible, behavior./ 
* Users were frustrated, confused, or occasionally stuck on the text landing page for the TriWest location finder. A third of users did not see the button leading to the TriWest location finder. One user, by clicking on the label "Read This" in large text above and below the text never reached the location finder at all. /Please note, because this was only observed in one out of seven sessions, it should be considered an outlier, but possible behavior./  Several users remarked that 
* Nearly all users within the TriWest location finder *immediately* switched to the Zip Code interface from the "nearest VA location" interface, completely ignoring the default interface. The only user that did not make this switch initiated a search using the default interface, but before executing his search (and within a minute) saw the Zip Code option, and switched to it. 
* More than half of users assumed that because they were able to find a location via the TriWest location finder, it was already covered under their VA Health Care benefits. However, a minority of older users (retirees) were in the habit of calling ahead to confirm that they would be covered at a location due to a past negative experience.

#### Task: Confirm Eligibility for Urgent Care Benefits
* Most users did not distinguish between eligibility requirements for “community care” and eligibility requirements for “urgent care.” Users often moved between these pages interchangeably without realizing that these were two different sets of benefits, and attributed the eligibility requirements of one type of benefit to the other type of benefit. When looking at the Mission Act web page, half of users asked to confirm eligibility for “urgent care” chose to click on “Learn about community care eligibility,” while the other half chose to click on “Learn about your urgent care benefits.” 
* Most users did not understand the eligibility requirements for "community care." Specifically, they did not understand only one of the six listed requirements needs to be met. Some users would expand the requirements and get lost in details or dead ends (such as "Fact Sheets" that were usually longer than a single sheet.)

### Moderate issues

#### Task: Find an Urgent Care Facility
* When going to the Health Care hub on VA.gov, around half of users incorrectly equated the label "Get health care" with finding a location for urgent (or VA, or any type of health) care as opposed to what it actually represents, which is *applying* for health care benefits.
* Less than half of users expressed some confusion with the type ahead, "optional" field on the VA.gov location finder. When what they typed into that field wasn’t one of the suggested options that appeared below, they were confused why it wasn’t actually “optional.” 

#### Task: Confirm Eligibility for Urgent Care Benefits
* Users sometimes would wind up going to a “Fact Sheet” either intentionally or accidentally, and it would result in a dead end where they felt that they could not confirm their eligibility. Examples include:
	* When trying to understand what it meant under Community Care eligibility, a user clicked on a Fact Sheet after expanding the accordion menu (item 6, A VA Service Line Does Not Meet Certain Quality Standards), read the Fact Sheet, and still did not feel like they understood if they were eligible for urgent care or not. 
	* Upon arriving at the TriWest Location Finder, the user is confronted with a large body of text with a header and footer that reads “IMPORTANT: Before seeking care READ THIS important notice.” While most users read what was between the header and the footer, some users clicked on the text READ THIS, which opened a PDF fact sheet that leads with information regarding prescriptions. They found this confusing, and felt like abandoning the task.

	* Users would append search term "urgent care" with zip codes, city names, state names, and "approved"
	* User noticed the page title "Community-based urgent care" in search results which connected those two terms in the users mind
* Find VA Locations https://www.va.gov/find-locations/
	* User expressed confusion at the "Service type" field changing from optional to required
	* Users looked for "Urgent Care" in the drop down menu under "Search for"  
* Find Locations - Locations (Legacy Page) https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/home.asp
	* No user noticed or used this page
* VA Secure Messaging https://www.va.gov/health-care/secure-messaging/
	* Users would use this page to find most recent message with their VA physician, then reach out to them for urgetn care, discontinuing searching for a facility
* VA MISSION Act https://www.missionact.va.gov	
	* Users assume "Learn about comunity care eligibility" refers to urgent care 
* My HealtheVet https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home
	* Users familiar with MyHealtheVet would go here to find urgent care
* My HealtheVet Search Results 
	* Users familiar with MyHealtheVet would apply similar search tactics used in site search
* TriWest Location Finder https://vaurgentcarelocator.TriWest.com/
	* Users switch to Zip Code search from default of "Nearest VA Facility" 
	* User remarked that if I was travelling, I wouldn't know any addresses or zip codes
	* Note: tool has changed/updated since this testing to add default interface of "address search." 

### Other findings of note that could guide further research

Although this was primarily a usability study of existing tools, there were a number of interesting insights gained from the comments of Veterans around these tasks. These insights should not be read as “validated assumptions” but rather as things that might be true, but require further research to assess how true they actually are, refine or refute the assumption, and what could be done to address the issues implied. 

#### Users have varying levels of awareness about the Mission Act, but state they are not confident in their knowledge about the law. More users attribte their knowledge about the Mission Act to e-mail than other means. 

Users had varying familiarity with the Mission Act. Around a third associated it with urgent care (specifically getting urgent care outside of a VA facility), another third associated it with changes in health care, and another third didn't know what it was. Of those that were familiar with it, most believed they had first heard about it via an e-mail although some alluded to hearing about it from a VA health care facility or .

#### Users consider the "VA home page" to be the home page of their local VA hospital, not the national Veteran's Affairs website. 

When asked to find the VA home page via Google, all users made the assumption that they were looking for their local VA facility, and not the Veterans Affairs home page, VA.gov. 

#### What variables affect how Veterans prioritize an urgent care facility? 

* Proximity/distance - "I want to travel as little as I have to, and prevent having to travel (and possibly wait in line) to only find out I can’t get what I need."
* Trust/familiarity - "I know my VA doctor, and I’ve had good experiences with them, so I’m more likely to trust them first to help me out with something quick than to navigate through eligibility information for a new, non VA facility." 
* Wait time - "If I go to a private hospital, I know I'll get see faster than if I go to my regular VA facility." 
Note: One user suggested that useful functionality would be availability of wait times digitally, not unlike a mobile application for a restaurant. “The current wait time for urgent care at this location is…”
* Confidence in coverage - "My VA benefits covered me here before, so I'll just bo back there." 
* Existing conditions, e.g. mobility, spinal injuries, etc. - "I don’t think that an urgent care facility locally will have the equipment needed to assess my simple issue given the complexity of chronic conditions I already deal with." 

#### “The VA” means my local VA facility, NOT the central VA.gov website. 

When asked to use Google to find the “VA website,” all users assumed that the researcher was referring to their local, most commonly visited physical VA location, and not the website for Veterans Affairs. This has huge potential for creating better data and usability consistently between localized hospital sites and the central site. Further study should explore where users naturally go, and how to support the expected tasks in the appropriate digital locations. This also has repercussions for VA wide systems architecture choices that are obviously beyond the scope of a one week study, but it lends support for further investigation into how we can best architect digital experiences and products that “feel local,” but “act global,” meaning they get consistent answers and information at multiple levels of connection. 

#### Users find urgent care facilities by a variety of means, but common methods include prior knowledge from living and travelling in the neighborhood, referral from a VA medical professional or private practice, word of mouth from trusted sources, and traditional online searches. 

When searching online, users are more likely to use their smart phone except in the circumstance where they are at home and suspect of whether or not they will be covered. In those cases they combined desktop searches with calling ahead to confirm coverage, or calling a VA health care facility to get a recommendation on the nearest urgent care facility that would be appropriate to their specific medical need. 

## Recommendations
### Simple fixes

#### Create new visual and written language for the topic of urgent care, and place it at key pages throughout VA and non-VA sites and related applications. 
Establish within the design system a visual language (color, icon, button, etc.) and use appropriate labels for “Urgent Care.” Place throughout the site on pages and in applications where users are most likely to seek that information, occupying the appropriate place in the hierarchy of each page/application. 

There could be variations on how to implement this that are fairly simple to execute, including everything from a simple text link with a consistent icon to a more “widget” style component, with a brief description. 

Pages and applications where this information would be sought include: 

* Home page
* Health Care “mega menu” modal, revealed through navigation
* Health Care benefits hub landing page
* VA Secure Messaging
* Search results pages, especially search results with an empty result
* The Mission Act landing page
* The Community Care and Urgent Care pages (currently these use different iconography than VA.gov)
* The Find a VA Location application

#### More clearly associate “Find a VA Location” link with user behaviors and mental models for searching and seeking assistance. 
This would be more consistent with observed mental models around seeking urgent care eligibility /or/ facilities, which are associated with search behaviors (e.g. I would search Google for that.) There are a number of ways this could be addressed, such as 
* Moving “Find a VA Location” closer to “Search” and/or “Contact Us” 
* Adding iconography associated with maps, e.g. a “map pin” icon or similar, conventional map location icon
* Changing the label to be more descriptive and address health issues, such as “Find VA Locations (Health care, Benefits, Cemetery)”
* Removing the location finder link from the navigation, and integrating it into the existing “Search” drop down similarly to how it has been integrated into the “Contact Us” drop down. 
* Adding or emphasizing location finder information to any site search results pages, especially the VA.gov site search. 

#### Re-architect the Mission Act landing page to more clearly delineate between the concepts of finding care and changes to services. 

From the user perspective, at least as far as this use case is concerned, what the Mission Act does is far more important to them than what the Mission Act has changed. For this reason, the information hierarchy on the Mission act page could be revised so that things a user would do take priority are are more clearly explained and visually prominent, while changes the Mission Act puts into place are less so. A possible approach would be a “how can we help you?” section. Think about writing things from the Veteran’s perspective, e.g. the Veteran is saying “I want to…” and the options might be something like:  
* Enroll for VA health care benefits
* Find a VA medical facility
* Find a non-VA approved medical facility for traditional appointments (community care) 
* Find nearby urgent care for minor medical issues requiring immediate attention

#### Eliminate page elements, such as the location finder within the Community Care and Urgent Care pages in the left column, that users do not either notice or use. 

The location finder found at 

https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/home.asp

Should be retired, and links to it throughout any site should be redirected to the current facility finder at 

https://www.va.gov/find-locations/

Users ignore this facility finder in the left column, and are more likely to click on the links or buttons within the copy of health care pages which link to the more current, appropriate tools. 

#### Add an explanation of how “Community Care” and “Urgent Care” are not the same type of care within each respective page. Also, eliminate additional labels for these concepts wherever possible. 

More clearly explain the difference between the two types of care on either page, in a section early on each page that states “What is the difference between Community Care and Urgent Care?” Provide a link the other type of care from each page. Avoid additional labels for these two types of care whenever possible, such as “Retail Care” in the TriWest location finder. “Retail Care” was not a term that was used by any user in our study, nor did they express an understanding of what it meant until they read the first page of the TriWest location finder.  

#### Redesign the transition between VA.gov and the TriWest location finder by addressing the landing page with a more appropriate pattern.

This web page is intended to be a common user experience pattern known as an "interruptor," which stops the user and confirms that they read, or are given the option to read, necessary information before they continue. The implementation of this tool as a web page is not the conventional execution of this in terms of design. A simple fix would be to 
* Present the copy as a modal that appears over the search tool, not as a seperate page. 
* Shorten the content significantly, focusing on key concepts.
* Provide a longer, fuller version of the text. 

#### Reverse the default search interface on the TriWest location finder to "Search by Zip Code" from "Search by VA Facility." If possible, add location detection to this page and default to the current zip code.  

This research took place when the only two options on the TriWest location finder were to "Search by Zip Code" and "Search by VA Facility." Since this research was completed, a third option "Search by Address," has been added. Without further testing, it is not possible to confirm whether or not this is an improvement and addresses the default behavior of users, however it is more aligned 

#### Address the TriWest location finder rendering errors in Microsoft Windows/Edge browsers. 

Windows users using the Microsoft Edge browser (or Internet Explorer) cannot use this tool because the maps do not render properly, or at all. This is a bug and should be corrected.  

### Improvements that Require Effort

#### Create a consolidated location search experience that emphasizes primary use cases, including VA Facilities, approved community facilities, and approved urgent care facilities. 

This would require significant back end data integration and API work. This effort is already underway and in the early stages of design, but to be executed properly it will require further research to consider the full range of use cases related to finding a facility beyond the single urgent care use case. 

#### Integrate legacy health care benefits pages, such as the Community Care section, into the VA.gov architecture and design. 

Assuming this is part of extensive migration efforts already underway, additional research may be required to greater clarify the difference between Community Care and Urgent Care from the user perspective, and provide access to each in the appropriate parts of the site experience.
