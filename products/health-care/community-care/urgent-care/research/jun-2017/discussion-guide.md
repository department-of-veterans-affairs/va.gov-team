# Discussion guide for urgent care use case under the Mission Act

Remember to close existing applications for test users before new test

## Introduction

(Approx. 3 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how VA.gov website can help you find urgent care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
- [Once you are recording], 

My screen is now being recorded.

## Framing and background

(Approx. 10 minutes) 

I’d like you to think back to a recent time when you needed urgent care. That could be anything from a fever that lasted too long or became too high to a significant injury that needed immediate attention. 

If you’re comfortable sharing information about what took place, can you describe the situation briefly? If you aren’t comfortable sharing details about your health, that’s completely fine. (Skip question if subject requests to keep this information private.)

Can you tell me where you went for the care? 


(If necessary) What kind of facility was it — a VA facility, a walk-in facility, such as a minute clinic, or an emergency room in a traditional hospital?  

Why did you choose that facility? 

If that was your first time at that facility, do you remember how you learned about it and chose to go to that facility?

If you had to find an urgent care facility quickly that was covered under your VA benefits, how would you do that? (Probe for device usage and/or preference.)

Are you familiar with the Mission Act? 

What do you know about the Mission Act? 

(If necessesary) Where did you first hear about it? 

## Speak Aloud Practice

(Approx. 1 minute)

What I’d like to do now is look at a few different websites, and while we look at these websites, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web.  Let’s do a practice 

(Have them share their screen, run through think aloud protocol to find the Veterans Affairs website using Google)

## Usability Test/Observation

(Approx. 15 minutes)

So let’s imagine you’ve got a medical situation where you’ve decided to seek urgent care. If you used this website, what would you do? 

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.) 

Now, let’s make sure you’re eligible for the location you’ve selected. How would you check your eligibility?

## Closing

(Remaining time)

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $50 thank-you gift. Is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address Shannon and Brian used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? [If no] Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you're a part of? If so, we can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect to our team.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
