# Urgent Care Usability Study (under the Mission Act)
## Goals

This usability test is meant to observe pain points and possible short term improvements in the experience of learning about and finding urgent care under the law as updated by the Mission Act. 

1. What product and team: This research could affect information architecture of VA.gov blue bar navigation, the [Find a VA Location tool](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/), and the [TriWest urgent care facility locator tool](https://vaurgentcarelocator.triwest.com/Locator)).  
2. Background (brief summary) As a user, in order to use urgent care, I need to understand my coverage and find a location. Here is a [full overview of the original issue/request.]()
3. Research questions: 
* How do people use the current site to assess their eligibility for urgent care?  
* What pathways and page elements in the home page, on the facility locator, and in the TriWest urgent care facility locator tool support?
* What natural language are veterans comfortable with that would improve the findability of eligibility and location information for urgent care? 
* What design system elements are the most likely to support these needs, and in what locations?  
4. Hypotheses: 
* The current implementation is confusing to users because it is a blend of VA tools and non-VA tools, resulting in a loss of confidence in information and failure at key tasks (finding a location, finding the best possible eligibile location, etc.). 
* There isn't sufficient "gradation of emergency" in the design system as implemented. We only have one level of emergency across the site, but urgent care (may) sit beneath the purpose of our primary hotline, in terms of urgency.  
* Veterans may not know labels and terms associated with the Mission Act enough to associate it with this need, or may not remember it when they are in an urgent care situation. 

## Method

1. Remote moderated usabilty testing, open ended questions with follow up discussion. 

2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 

It's the fastest method to set up and get insight into the issue as it currently exists, and uncover where on the page are the lowest effort, highest impact opportunities for improvement. 

3. Where are you planning to do your research? If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool youâ€™ll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)

Using Zoom via our recruiting provider. 

4. What will you be testing? (Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.) 

Live site including
* [Home page](https://www.va.gov/)
* [Mission Act Page](https://www.missionact.va.gov/)
* [Facility Locator Tool](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/)
* [TriWest Locator Tool](https://vaurgentcarelocator.triwest.com/)

### Participants and Recruitment

1. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)

6-8 Veterans that use health care benefits throught the VA. 

2. What is your recruitment strategy? 
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact UX lead.)

Recruitment firm. 

### When? 

1. Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 

Wednesday June 19 and Friday June 21. 

2. Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 

It's ready now. 

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 

30 minutes. 

4. Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Wednesday June 19 (8 to 10am, noon to 5pm) and Friday June 21 (8 to 10am, 1:30 to 4pm).
5. Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 

Monday June 17. Ad Hoc, Layla Soileau.
