# 1095-B Form

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form 1095-B reports the months a person had qualifying minimum essential health coverage to the IRS. VA sends this form to Veterans to show what months they were covered under the VA healthcare system. 

In most cases, it is simply a form for one's records. However, some states still have an individual coverage mandate, and in those states, the form is necessary for filing taxes. The form is not required by the IRS, but it is required to be sent by health care providers as of 2019.

## Product roadmap overview

This product is not complete, and not in production yet. Here is a list of the [next steps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/Final%20documents/1095-B%20Turnover%20document%209.7.22.pdf) for the new team. 

Overview of product roadmap (with details below): 

- Minimal Viable Product
- Opt-in to paperless delivery
- Spanish translation
- Making the 1095-B form findable
- Ability to retrieve previous years' 1095-B forms

### 1. Minimal Viable Product

The MVP release is the closest to completion. This release makes the 1095-B form available online, but does not link to the page from anywhere (so it's not easily findable). 

#### Release plan
- [Release plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/product/1095b-release-plan.md)
- [Staging ticket](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/1095b-tax-form-61e19735167b2500170b2146/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/44401) 

#### Designs

- [Clickable Adobe Sketch prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/1f2a2fbd-8d48-47c6-8e95-b26d5259a211/prototype/a/17C9D6DF-D927-4D2F-9429-9205CB4421A1)
- [MVP Designs (PNG)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/Final%20documents/Designs/MVP%20designs)
- [MVP Design file in Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/s/2f061f33-42de-4d8f-83ad-40286632ba36/p/D703716B-FAF8-478D-9CC4-7B9FB0FE4BE5) 
- [MVP demonstration video - Widget](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/Final%20documents/Accessible%201095-B%20demo%20radio-downloads-video.mov)

### 2. Opt-in to paperless delivery

This would allow Veterans and dependents to opt-in to receiving the 1095-B form digitally only, reducing the cost to the VA of having to mail it out. 

#### Designs

- [Opt-in designs (PNG)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/Final%20documents/Designs/Opt-in%20designs)
- [Opt-in Design file in Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/s/2f061f33-42de-4d8f-83ad-40286632ba36/p/D703716B-FAF8-478D-9CC4-7B9FB0FE4BE5) 
- [VA Notify templates - emails](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/Content/VA%20Notify) -content under revision by sitewide, standing by for new design

#### Building the opt-in capability requires co-ordination across multiple teams: 
- MyVA: Samara Strauss & Liz Lanz
- HEC: Joshua Faulkner
- VA Profile: Micheal Richard 
- VA Notify: Beverly Nelson

### 3. Spanish translation

- The [Spanish translation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/Content/HEC/HEC%20Documents%20Spanish%20Opt-in/SPA%201095%20webpage.docx) of the website is available, but has not been implemented. 

### 4. Making the 1095-B form findable 

- [Requisition wayfinding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/Final%20documents/Crosslinks%20wayfinding%201095-B.pdf)
- Making the form findable will be implemented by the sitewide team
    - Sitewide: Randi Hecht

### 5. Ability to retrieve previous-year 1095-B forms
