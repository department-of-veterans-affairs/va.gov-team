***1095-B Content Needs***

After assessment of project scope and current landscape, it has been determined that the following minimum content needs will have to be addressed.


**What’s in scope for us**

1) *Our Page* (Net new pages we make)
    - Basic explanation of what 1095-B is and that it’s your paper mailed form
    - FAQ we need to address:
     - How do I opt-in to receive this form electronically? (confirm policies around opt-in to stop mailing)

*Path forward*: Carl to write this content as first draft in Sprint 1. Carl to check if there is a copy review team (part of Platform Review) 

2) *Navigation & UX*
Depending on placement of form and access, we will need to develop copy for page navigation, CTAs and any descriptive copy.

*Path forward*: We make the recommendation to IA team (might be the Experience contact), part of Design Intent. Sprint 2 work.

3) *Landing Page* Updates (Currently Existing Pages that we need to change)
Consider updating content on homepage and “find forms” to reference 1095-B or Tax documents. Existing content around The Affordable Care Act & 1095-B form need to be updated on VA.gov to reflect current laws, changes to how the VA is delivering the form and point users to how they can download the form online. Or, develop a plan for sunsetting old pages. Existing content can currently be found at:
  - https:///www.va.gov (homepage)
    - Update quick links in records section to include tax documents?
    - Craft alert messaging?
  - https://www.va.gov/find-forms
    - Add an entry for the 1095 B; informational & FAQ as well as direct download in authenticated.
  - https://www.va.gov/health/aca/index.asp
  - https://www.va.gov/health/aca/EnrolledVeterans.asp
  - https://www.va.gov/health/aca/information-for-tax-season.asp
  - Letters
    - Current content not updated since 2018

 *Path forward*: 
    - Design team to make a comprehensive list of everywhere across va.gov that could link back to us
    - Carl to write marketing callout of what the page could say to redirect back to us
    - Discuss with VA-PO on next steps of how we want to take it to these teams if desired
    - Sprint 3, 4 (after Contact Center Review)


**For discussion around scope**

4) *Form Mailed Cover Letter*
  - Currently accompanying the form 1095-B (and as we have seen competitive analysis) there is a cover letter explaining what the form is and what needs to be done with it. This letter will need to be updated to reflect current process and legislation.
  - Additionally, we might consider adding new elements to this form:
    - Escalation path. If information is incorrect or has changed, what needs to be done?
 
 *Path forward*: 
      - Discuss with VA-PO and Business Owner if downloading the PDF form means you also have to download the cover letter
      - Understand if/how we can update the physical mailed letter


5) *Announcements/Notifications
  - Marketing callouts for newsletters, social media, email announcements to notify Veterans of digitized 1095-B
    *Path forward*: Discuss with VA-PO and Business Owner if needed; may have marketing & comms team dedicated to this 

6) *Additional FAQs*
    FAQs we may opt to address, either on the cover letter or on the website:
      - What if I did not receive the 1095-B?
      - What if I am only insured part of the year? 
      - Is this form available in other languages?
      - What if information on my form is incorrect or my information has changed?
        - Changes to address & contact information
        - Changes to name, Social Security number or other demographic information
      - If I received this form, am I required to file taxes?
      - Do I need to wait to file my taxes until I receive this form?
      - How long do I need to keep this form on file?
 
 *Path forward*: Decide with VA-PO and Business Owner which we want to include online
