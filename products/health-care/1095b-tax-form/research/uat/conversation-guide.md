## Intro

**MODERATOR:** Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we'll ask you to help us test va.gov on a topic related to healthcare and tax documentation. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take less than 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions

**MODERATOR:** Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, as about location, occupation, military service history)

## Interview

**MODERATOR:** To start, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your usage of VA benefits and digital services. 

- Are you currently enrolled in the VA healthcare system and use any of those benefits? 
    - A [IF NO] Do you get health insurance from an employer or pay out of pocket?    

- Are you familiar with a form called the 1095-B? 
    - A [IF NO] It's ok! I wasn't really either! It's a form that shows proof of health insurance that you might receive from the VA or an employer. In previous years you might have included it with your taxes to show the IRS you were covered with health insurance. 

- Do you recall ever getting someting like that in the mail from VA or maybe an employer? 

- Do you do taxes yourself or with your spouse? Do you ever use tax filing software like Turbo Tax? 

## First Task: [Participant loads 1095-B page] - X minutes

**MODERATOR:** We've taken the first step in making the 1095-B form available online. I'm going to send you a link in the Zoom chat. I ask that you open it up in a web browser, and then let me know once you see it. 

[Pause for confirmation]

Okay, now I'm goin to ask you to share your screen on Zoom so that we can look at the page together.

**MODERATOR:** Please proceed to download the form. 

Is the information on the form correct? Please verify your name, address, and coverage details. 

## Second Task: [Address changes]

**MODERATOR:** Let's pretend that your address is incorrect on the 1095-B page. How would you go about changing it?

[Pause]

Let's go ahead and click through, but of course we won't actually change anything. 

Thank you for helping us test this new feature. 

## Thank-You and closing - X minutes

Do you have any questions or comments for me before we sign off? 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
