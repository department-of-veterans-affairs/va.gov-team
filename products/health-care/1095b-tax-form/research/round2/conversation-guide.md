# 1095-B Tax Document Conversation Guide: Round 2

## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is James and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we&#39;re going to talk about managing healthcare and tax documentation from the VA.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran&#39;s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Later,**   **you&#39;ll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it&#39;s a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes:  **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

  _Start recording._

- **I have started recording**. I&#39;d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## Warm Up

1. Could you tell me a little bit about yourself? _(If stuck ask about location, occupation, military service history)_


## Interview

MODERATOR: To start, I&#39;d like to ask you a few questions about how you use VA benefits, digital services and customer service.

2. Are you currently enrolled in the VA healthcare system and use any of those benefits?
  A. [IF NO] Do you get health insurance from an employer or pay out of pocket?
3. Have you previously used any of the digital tools or services on the va.gov website?
  A. [IF YES] Could you tell me an example or two of the things you&#39;ve done on the website, and what your experience has been?
  B. [IF NO] How do you prefer to interact with the VA, if not on the website? Do you use other services like online banking or social media?

MODERATOR: So, part of what we&#39;ll be focusing on today is getting forms or paperwork from the VA, and how we might improve that.

5. Do you recall getting mail to your home from the VA?
 - A. [FOLLOW UP IF NEEDED] Has there been a lot? Is it particularly helpful?
 - B. [IF MENTIONS 1095-B by name: Go to 6B]
  
6. Are you familiar with a form called the 1095-B? _PAUSE_
  - A. [IF NO] Its okay, I wasn&#39;t really either! It&#39;s a form that shows proof of health insurance that you might receive from the VA or an employer. In previous years you included it with your taxes to show the IRS you were covered with health insurance.
  - B. [MENTION OF FORM / FAMILIAR] Go to Question 7
 
7. Do you recall ever getting something like that in the mail from the VA or maybe an employer? What do you usually do with something like that?
8. What about other paperwork or forms you might need when submitting your taxes? How do you organize that?
9. Do you do taxes yourself or with your spouse? Do you ever use tax filing software like turbo tax?
10. In the past, do you remember when you might have looked for the 1095-B document? Maybe before, during or after doing your taxes?
11. Do you know if the 1095-B document is required when you're filing taxes? Whats your understanding of that?

## Transition to Prototype

**MODERATOR:** Our design team has been tasked with thinking through how we might provide the 1095-B proof of health insurance on the VA&#39;s website. In a moment I&#39;ll bring up a prototype of what that might look like, and we&#39;ll go over it together to get your feedback. Does that sound good?

**MODERATOR:** As I mentioned earlier you&#39;ll be interacting with a prototype or demo tool. It&#39;s still a work in progress, there might be a few mistake or it may not function exactly the way you expect. That&#39;s okay! Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it&#39;s a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

**MODERATOR:** As part of this prototype, I&#39;ll give you a task and ask that you try something called &quot;thinking aloud&quot; while you do it. It&#39;s kind of like narrating what you see in front of you and what you might do. An example I like to give, is if someone gave me a task of calling my mom and asked me to think aloud while I do it.

So: &quot;I&#39;m pulling out my cell phone from my pocket. I see the time on the screen and I swipe up to unlock it. I&#39;m looking for the cell phone icon and then select that. Now I see my contact list and I scroll to my mom&#39;s name. I select that, I now see the call button and click that to make a call.&quot;

I&#39;m going to send you a link in the zoom chat. I ask you open it up in a web browser, and then let me know once you see it.

[Pause for confirmation]

Okay, now I&#39;m going to ask you to share your screen on Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together.

## Prototype Tasks

### Task 1: Download a copy of the 1095-B form that has your information filled out.

[Screen: unauthenticated 1095-B landing page]

Please think aloud and walk me through what you see on the screen.

Before clicking on anything, what might you do next?

[BACK UP PROMPT:] If you wanted to download this form, what might you do next?

Is there anything missing from this screen?

**MODERATOR:** Please proceed by selecting &quot;sign in&quot;. We&#39;re going to imagine that your login information and password have been entered. Before clicking the button to sign in, what do you expect to see on the next screen?

[Proceed to next screen]

[Screen: authenticated 1095-B landing page]

Please think aloud.

What do you make of the options available?

**MODERATOR:** Please proceed to download the 1095-B form.

[SCREEN: Personalized version of 1095-B Form]

**MODERATOR:** For this form, I&#39;d like you to imagine that all your personal information is already filled out, such as your name, social security number and date of birth.

Imagining all the information is correct on this form, what do you think you might do with it next?

  **IF STUCK:** Some examples might be saving it on your computer, printing it, or closing your browser and not doing anything with it.

### Task 2: Error Solving

**MODERATOR:** Before proceeding, let&#39;s try imagining some of the information is incorrect. Perhaps there is an old address you no longer live at or there is a mistake with your social security number. How might you proceed then?

_NOTE: Discuss options or allow them to proceed by closing the form, and returning to the authenticated view._

[IF OPTIONS DISCUSSED:] You mentioned what you might do if something was wrong with the form. Does any of the information on this screen help you with that? Are there any options you might not have considered before?

[IF IMMEDIATELY CLOSED PDF:] So imagining some of the information on the form was incorrect, how might you proceed from this screen?

[NOTE: Discuss problem solving, fixing information with the VA]

Which method would you prefer to update the form? Calling a telephone number, sending an secure message or filling out a form?

**MODERATOR:** Okay, I&#39;d like to click on the top right of the screen and show you a different version of this same page that we&#39;re considering.

[SCREEN: authenticated version with paperless opt-in component]

**MODERATOR:** So one of the ideas we&#39;re considering is allowing you to sign up for paperless delivery of forms from the VA like this one. Have you ever done something like that â€“ where you get forms or things like bank statements delivered to you digitally without paper mail?

Is signing up for paperless delivery of just this form something you might consider?

Okay, this part of the prototype is finished. Do you have any questions or feedback before we proceed?

[Pause]

## Wrap Up

**MODERATOR:** So, I think its time to wrap up. My last question is this: based on what you&#39;ve seen today, would you prefer getting the 1095-B document on the VA website rather than getting a copy in the mail?

Do you have any questions or other comments for me before we sign off?

Thank you so much, your feedback and insights have been invaluable as we continue working on this project.
