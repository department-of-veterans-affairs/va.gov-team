## ATO Documentation: 1095-B Tax Form
**_Last Updated: MM/DD/YYYY_**

_Please Note: The Veteran-Facing Services Platform ATO boundary includes all environments: Dev, Staging, Utility, Sandbox, and Production, as well as all VFS teams/Products, Platform teams, CMS, VA Notify, and VA Mobile. If the environments your team uses have different configurations, we will need this information for each environment._

#### POC
1. What is the name of your product(s)/system(s)?

   1095-B Tax Form

2. Describe its purpose in a few sentences.

   Veterans can log in to va.gov and download their 1095-B tax form so they can report health coverage when they file taxes. There was no way to view this form digitally before this page on va.gov was built: https://www.va.gov/records/download-your-irs-1095-b/

3. If you represent multiple products, please describe the relationship between them, if there is any.

   We represent multiple products and the only one kind of related to 1095-B is Paperless Delivery. We will have a separate document that covers that product.

4. What is the expected duration of your project? This information helps us understand how our processes need to adapt

   We maintain this product so there are always have items on our roadmap for it. In the short term we are rearchitecting the backend to pull tax data from a new API endpoint rather than the current way of storing and reading files from S3.

#### AWS Resources

- S3 bucket for transferring data from enrollmenty system. This process will be deprecated later this year and S3 will no longer be used by this feature.
