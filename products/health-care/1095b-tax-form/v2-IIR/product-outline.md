# 1095-B Tax Form 

## Digital Access MVP Product Outline

### Overview

The IIR team is implementing a net new way for Veterans to digitally access their 1095-B tax forms on va.gov. IRS form 1095-B reports the months a person had qualifying minimum essential health coverage to the IRS. VA sends this form to Veterans and dependents to show which months they were covered under the VA healthcare system. 

In most cases, it is simply a form for one's records. However, some states still have an individual coverage mandate, and in those states, the form is necessary for filing taxes. The form is not required by the IRS, but it is required to be sent by health care providers as of 2019.

#### Context

A previous team was working on this project in 2022 but it was never launched. IIR's goal is not to pick up where they left off but to reevaluate a true MVP (emphasis on the minimum) that is reliable. There is a desire for something to be released for the 2025 tax season so we are aiming for a late February/early March release.

### Problem Statement(s)

- The VA spends approximately $4mil/year on printing and sending physical 1095-B forms to Veterans and dependents.
  
- Veterans and dependents have to call and wait to have it reprinted and resent if they need a replacement.

- The current experience of printing and sending physical forms is not meeting government goals of having digital experiences that are “consistent with [the public’s] favorite consumer websites and mobile apps.”


How might we statement: How might we make the 1095-B tax form easily accessible to Veterans through a digital experience.

### Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans can view and download their 2024 1095-B via va.gov

- Veterans are directed by call center representatives to log into va.gov to view their 2024 1095-B if they need a replacement

### Undesired User Outcomes

- More than 10% of Veterans or dependents enrolled in VA healthcare for 2024 cannot view and download their 2024 1095-B via va.gov (only for the MVP because there may be subsets that cannot access due to BE data ingestion reasons)

### Desired Business Outcomes

- Less reprints and resends happen for the 2025 tax season

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- More reprints and resends happen for the 2025 tax season

### Launch Strategy 

- No notifications or comms will be sent out for the MVP, it will be a page that users can passively access. We will work with call centers so representatives can direct Veterans to download their form on this new page instead of issuing a reprint and resending.

### Launch Dates

- Estimating end of February/beginning of March to provide some value to the 2025 tax year.

### Screenshots

Before | N/A - this functionality is net new and does not currently exist on va.gov

After | TBD - In Progress
