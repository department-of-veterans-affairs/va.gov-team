# Questions for Kaiser about their E-visits tool

Dr. Frisbee and others have found inspiration for the Get Care work from [this E-visits tool](https://thrive.kaiserpermanente.org/care-near-oregon-washington/overview/community/telehealth-video-phone-visit/e-visits) offered by Kaiser. We are interested to learn more about why it was created, how it was created and whether it is accomplishing it's goals. Our hope is that some of the questions they've asked and roadblocks they may have hit will better inform our approach to problems within the Get Care space.

* Can you talk me through some of the complexity of getting this tool fully orchestrated across the various services it points patients to?
* Can you tell me about a part of this tool you considered implementing but didnâ€™t? (User feedback or roadblocked by something else)
* How have you communicated the availability of this tool to patients?
* What types of patients are most suited to using this tool?

## Outcomes
