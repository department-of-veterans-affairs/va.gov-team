# Research Plan for Discovery Sprint, Get Care, Aug 8, 2019

## Goals
1. What product & team: Get Care Discovery Sprint, a 6 week engagement.
2. Background: Veterans have access to countless types of care services, making it complicated to know what kind of care to access and how to access it. There are many siloed resources for care within the VA, including:  VA MISSION Act/community care, My HealtheVet, VAOS, VA Video Care, telehealth, secure messaging, specialty mobile apps, etc.
For Veterans, this can lead to frustration due to the different combinations of experiences they may encounter while also creating an administrative burden for the VA.
3. Research questions: How do Veterans experience access care from the VA? What do they think of as care? What experiences have worked well for them? Where have they encountered friction? How wide of a variety of tools or resources do people use? What conditions make them encounter new opportunities for methods of care or access?
4. Hypothesis: The experiences will likely be varied, but we suspect that Veterans are frustrated by the many different places they need to go to access these sources as well as the inconsistent data and experiences. We also suspect that Veterans may not know about tools and opportunities that might work for their situation.

## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 
  - Remote interviews with Veterans

2.	Remote sessions allow us to have conversations with Veterans from around the country. VA Medical experiences vary quite a bit regionally and we want a representative sample.


## Participants and Recruitment
Participant criteria: 
  1.	All participants should have experience with VA medical care/VHA (Veterans would need healthcare support occasionally and Veterans who deal with healthcare needs on regular basis)
  2.	Both Women and men
  3.	Some assistive device users
  4. 	People who own smart phones and people who do not own smart phones
  5.	Urban and rural circumstances

What is your recruitment strategy? 
  1.	Perigean will recruit
  2.  9 participants maximum

## When? 
1.	Timeline: Week of August 19 (As early as 8/15 would be fine.)
2.	Prepare: Interview guide is under development
3.	Length of Sessions: ~1 hour
4.	Availability: 10am - 6pm EST, August 15-23
5.	Pilot: Interview will not be piloted
