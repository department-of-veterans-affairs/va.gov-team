# Get Care Veteran Interview Insights

See Research Plan for additional information on our goal and how we recruited.

## Participants

- 8 conversational interviews
- 6 men and 2 women
- Ages 25 - 74

## Measurable characteristics

### Use of technology to interact with VA services

- 8/8 use a computer
  - 1 participant used their work computer while they were on a break.
- 1/8 uses mobile to interact with VA
  - This participant is blind and prefers single use applications, because they have less distracting content surrounding the primary interaction.
  - 1 Participant tried to use the Move! App, but it wasn't supported by the Move program at his VA.
- Has used or currently uses a mobile app to monitor health
  - 1 participant uses mobile apps regularly to track diabetes related metrics
  - 1 participant uses fitness tracking apps regularly and used MyFitnessPal for about 10 months, but stopped after they were comfortable with new diet.

### Uses secure messaging

- 7/8 participants use Secure Messaging to interact with the VA

### Supplemental Care

- 7/8 participants use supplemental care
  - 1 participant regularly uses VA community care
  - The remainder have supplemental insurance or pay out of pocket

### Frequency of visits to VA

- The majority participants vist a VAMC or VA clinic
  - 3-6 times per year
  - One participant estimated they receive care from the VA (including community care) around 200/year. This include weekly visits to a dialysis center.
  - 1 participant only visits once or twice per year. They only schedule appointments when the VA reaches out to them.



## Characterictics of extreme Experiences with VHA

### Infrequent Interactions - Participant 7

Young, yearly health interactions, unengaged with tools.

- Sees a healthcare provider 1-2 times per year for annual check up.
- Uses smartphone for personal browsing and social interactions.
- Waits for VA to call/notify before setting up an appointment.
  - **"They give me a call, I answer and we figure out the time then." - P7**
  - **"I don't necessarily go out looking for things. Would be me [passively] finding out about it. I'm sure that will change as I get older and have more health needs." - P7**

### Frequent Interactions - Participant 1

Older, health requires daily management, highly engaged with tools.

- Multiple times/week dialysis treatment
- Relies heavily on digital tools to support zero light sensitivity (blindness)
- Uses mobile device and apps heavily to simplify screen reader interactions

### Frequent Interactions - Participant 8

Older, health requires daily management, highly engaged with tools.

- Daily maintenance of diabetes indicators
- Uses smartphone and smartwatch to track multiple daily health metrics



## How our research questions were answered

### What care options (analog and digital) are Veterans aware of/currently using and why?  For options they are not using (analog and digital), why are they not?

#### In use:

- My HealtheVet
  - Secure Messaging
    - Not all providers are reliable at responding to secure messages in a timely fashion.
    - After sending a secure message to a provider...
      - ***"She called me back and it was kind of nice." - P2***
      - ***"[I would use secure messaging for] Anything non-emergent. It's a convenience thing for me, because my days are full." - P2***
  - Rx Tool
  - Health Records
    - **"A little nosy. I want to see what the doctors have said about the visit." - P3**
  - VAOS
- Phone & In Person Interactions
  - Most participants relied on phone calls for some interactions.
  - We heard:
    - You can get more information over the phone
    - ***"I know hat MyHealteVet has the choice to schedule. If I talk to someone, I'll get more info." - P3***
    - But it can also take a lot of time to get the information you need from the right person.
    - ***"I find it more convenient for me to use secure messaging. With phone you don't get through, you get voicemail." - P1***
- Telehealth
  - Two Veterans had used telehealth.
  - One Veteran had used CVT and felt like a phone call would have sufficed.
  - One Veteran had used VVC for consulting with a dieticien and would use it again.

#### Not in use:

- VA Mobile Apps
  - When asked about potential use, Veterans expressed concerns regarding actual usefulness and the amount of “cruft” that comes with them. 
  - Those that were interested in using their mobile devices to connect with VA resources expressed an interest in lightweight apps that are non intrusive (no camera access, gps access etc…).
    - ***"The problem is...they want access to acces to camera, location, facebook. I don't see a need for all that access." - P2***
  - 1 participant does prefer accessing single use applications as it makes navigating with screen reader simpler.

### **Are Veterans/caregivers open to using other digital tools that they may not know about/may not currently exist? (chat, telehealth, etc.) How would they want to find out about those tools?**

#### Openness:

- Veterans expressed willingness to engage with new digital methods of care.
  - 1 participant said, ***"Absolutely. I have a very good relationship with my doctors. I can trust them with anything I keep track of … except my financials."***

#### Messaging:

1. Veterans highly trust recommendations from their providers.
   - All participants talked positively about their providers. Some had negative stories about particular care interactions, but as a whole, primary care was a trusted source for both their clinical care as well as a source for recommending new tools and services.
   - For those that were engaged with mobile devices and health tracking, this trust also extended to sharing data.

2. Veterans find out about new programs through advertisements at their VAMC.

3. Direct emails/newsletters from VA.

4. The Veteran Community

### Are Veterans/caregivers open to being guided to a different tool that meets their need, even if that is not what they set out to do? (meaning, I came to make an appointment, but maybe we guided them to use chat instead b/c it would meet their need faster).

#### Yes, but…

- The first interaction is key
- Participants were willing to something new if it can help their provider
- For telehealth:
  - There was some hesitancy associated with using new technology
  - Several participants were unsure what the right kind of care video chat would make sense for.
    - ***"It depends on what the care would be. [Yes,] if it's just answering common questions or basic stuff. But if i was legit sick or it was something more severe, I'd prefer doing it in person." - P7***
    - ***"A little mixed I guess. One-on-one in person is a more personal touch. It's what I'm used to and comfortable with...video chat would have to be a normal thing. It's just what you get used to...They're already using computers for surgery" - P8***
    - **"If it's something that would help me, I have no problem with it. If it will help my doctors get me the care I need, no problem."**



## Overall Quotes

***"I will say it's getting better and better. We can do more things. Now days we can just punch in that days tests and get results.***

***Used to get this through telephone. I would have to wait for primary care to make a telephone appointment or wait the whole week.In the meantime. I have to wait 7 or 8 days to see.That causes anxiety." - P8***

[Uses phone to answer health questions while] **"Out and about. I know what to do longterm, but especially when you get low blood sugar you can get very very confused, you want to make sure everything is ok." p8**
