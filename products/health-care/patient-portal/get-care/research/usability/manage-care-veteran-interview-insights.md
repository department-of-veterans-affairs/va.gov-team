Participants were generally very receptive to this idea. (3, 5, 5, 5)

- ***"That's something I can take to doc appointments regardless of where I am" - P3***

- Most of the participants mentioned having all of the data in one place.
  - 1 participant expected to access the data under Blue Button
  - 1 participant was very clear about wanting access via a computer
    - **"A computer website would be better than an app. Apps take up too much space no room for app or old phone new phone. Apps are usually backed up by a website." - P1**
- **"I would really need all of that in one app or no websites.It would be hard to track multiple apps and remember names of multiple apps." - P1**
