# Research Plan for Usability Testing, Get Care, Aug 20, 2019


## Goals

1. **What product & team?** Get Care Discovery Sprint, a 6 week engagement.
2. **Background**: Veterans have access to countless types of care services, making it complicated to know what kind of care to access and how to access it. There are many siloed resources for care within the VA, including: VA MISSION Act/community care, My HealtheVet, VAOS, VA Video Care, telehealth, secure messaging, specialty mobile apps, etc. For Veterans, this can lead to frustration due to the different combinations of experiences they may encounter while also creating an administrative burden for the VA.
3. **Research questions**: Does our prototype resonate with Veterans? If not, were there other things that were highlighted as more important? What elements of the prototype caused confusion? What opportunities are there for enhancing the prototype? How would Veterans expect to access this prototype? Is it discoverable where weâ€™ve decided to place it? Do they have any expectations for how it might be integrated with their existing care interactions (tools or in person). Does i
4. **Hypothesis**: This is hard to estimate as the prototype will be rapidly generated just before we share it with Veterans. We expect that Veterans will generally perceive the tool as valuable., We expect that Veterans may have some confusion around language for care modalities vs types of clinical care. Veterans may see the tool as duplicative of workflows they already have. We also suspect it will be difficult/complex to communicate what options are available at each given location or for a Veterans particular care needs.

## Method

1. What method of research are you planning? 
Remote, moderated usability testing with low- and medium-fidelity prototypes

2. Why this method?
Remote sessions allow us to have conversations with Veterans from around the country. VA Medical experiences vary quite a bit regionally and we want a representative sample. We will also be inviting Stakeholders to observe and participate in deriving insights. Coordinating this co-creation remotely will enable more stakeholder participation.
3. Where are you planning to do your research?
We will use the Perigean **GoToMeeting** account to enable participants to take over screen control. Because our first prototype will low-fidelity, this will allow us to more easily intercept to reset the Veteran if needed.
4. What will you be testing?
We will be testing a prototype that will be shared digitally via Mural or Invision.

## Participants and Recruitment

Participant criteria: 
  1.	All participants should have experience with VA medical care/VHA (Veterans would need healthcare support occasionally and Veterans who deal with healthcare needs on regular basis)
  2.	Both Women and men
  3.	**No** assistive device users. (Our low fidelity prototype will not be accessible to people using screen readers.)
  4. 	People who own smart phones and people who do not own smart phones
  5.	Urban and rural circumstances

What is your recruitment strategy? 
  1.	Perigean will recruit
  2.	4-6 participants/per day. 8-12 total.

## When? 

1. Timeline: Tuesday, August 27, 2019 (4-6 participants) and Thursday, August 29, 2019 (4-6 participants)
2. Prepare: The prototype will be completed the day before the sessions.
3. Length of Sessions: 30 min.
4. Availability: Tuesday, August 27, 2019 from **9-7 (EDT)** and Thursday, August 29, 2019 from **9-7 (EDT)**
5. Pilot: This will not be possible, due to the fast turnaround from prototype creation to usability testing.
