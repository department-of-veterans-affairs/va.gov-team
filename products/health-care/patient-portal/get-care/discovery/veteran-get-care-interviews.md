## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Caitlin** and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about some of your interactions with VA tools and how you access healthcare from the VA.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45min to 1 hour.** 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. 

*Start audio and screen recording.*

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today?"
