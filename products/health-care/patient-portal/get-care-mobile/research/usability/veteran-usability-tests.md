## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Alexis** and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about some of your interactions with VA tools and how you access healthcare from the VA.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30min.** 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. 

*Start audio and screen recording.*

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today?"

Alright. Thanks again for giving us some of your time today.

We have 3 different ideas we want to talk to you about in the next 30 min, so it might feel like I'm jumping around a little.

## First Section: VA and Mobile Interactions - 5 minutes


### Questions
* How many times do you visit your local VAMC or VA clinics in a year?
* How do you access healthcare online with the VA?
* How do you access this online care? (home computer, tablet phone?)
* Do you have a smartphone?
* Do you use a lot of apps?
  *   Why not?
* Do you use any health tracking apps?
* Would you be interested in sharing that kind of information with your VA doctor?
* Have you ever been prescribed or recommended an application by your doctor?
* Have you ever heard of VA apps?

Ok thanks, I’m now going to share my screen with you, to show you some mobile phone interactions for a new VA app we are considering building.
This is the very early stages so what you’ll see is very barebones and you can not actually click on anything, so I’ll be navigating through the screens. Also, I did not create these drawings so you will not offend me in any way with your comments. So please speak openly.
Ready?

## Second Section: Mobile App flow - 15 minutes

### Questions
* So what do you think of this?
* What would be your preferred login method?

[Transition to Home Screen]

Ok great, let’s imagine you have successfully logged in and this is your home screen.

* Walk me through, what you see. Speak all your thoughts out loud and let me know if you have questions about functionality on this screen.

Ok thanks, now let’s imagine you are using some health apps to share your progress with your doctor. 
Where would you go to see that information?

[Transition to next screen.]

* Ok walk me through what you are seeing here.  Speak all your thoughts out loud and let me know if you have questions about functionality on this screen.

* What would you be interested in looking at first?

Oh, looks like you got a notification.

* What do you think about this notification?
* What would you expect to happen once you clicked on it?

Wrap-up.



## Post-Task Wrap Up - 5 minutes

On a scale of 1 - 5 (1 as not useful at all, 5 as extremely useful)
* How likely is it you would use something like that?
  * Why or why not?


## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
