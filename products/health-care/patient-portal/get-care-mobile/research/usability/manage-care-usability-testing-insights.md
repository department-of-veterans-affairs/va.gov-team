# Manage Care Usability Testing Insights

See Research Plan for additional information on our goal and how we recruited.

*Prototype was minimally funcational. Results from these sessions are more aligned with concept testing.*

## Participants

- 6 participants
- 6 men
- Ages 25 - 54

## Measurable characteristics

### Frequency of care

3 participants visit their VAMC or VA Clinic 3 or less times per year.

1 participants visits their VAMC or VA Clinic 6 times per year.

2 participants visit their VAMC or VA Clinic 15 or more times per year.

### Use of online tools

- 3 participants use MHV to access VA healthcare online.
- Amongst the rest:
  - 2 mentioned access via eBenefits
    - **"I don't know where else to start and that has links from there."**
    - 1 of these participants preferred it because they can use their CAC. They prefer that access method because they can't remember their DSLogon password because it changes so frequently.
  - 1 wanted to reference a different tool, but could not come up with the name
  - 1 had tried to get an account set up with MHV, but so far had not been able to gain access.

### Prefered method of access

- 3 Participants use a computer
- 2 use smartphones
  - **"Usually it's more accessible on my phone" - P1**
- 1 uses both

### App usage

- High usage
  - 4 participants
- Med
  - 1 participant
- Low
  - 1 participant
    - **"I have a smartphone, but doesn't have a lot of storage"**

#### Health tracking apps?

- Yes
  - 4 participants
  - **"The reminders are what keeps me going and the reminders make it...interactive" - P3**
- No
  - 2 participants
    - 1 participant had used default health tracking app from phone in past, but not regularly
- 1 participant mentioned using a Fitbit

##### Sharing with VA provider?

- Of the 4 participants that use helath tracking apps, 3 said they'd be comfortable sharing the data with providers.

### Prescription of an app

- 0 of 6 participants had every been prescribed an app for their health

### Awareness of VA apps

- 2 of 6 participants were aware of VA apps
  - Via emails. "No other ways to learn about new tools." - P3
  - Neither participant could name any apps, though 1 participant was aware that of VA mental health apps.
- Of the participants who had not heard of any VA apps, one said:
  - **"I don't know that I would really download those. Odds of me using it are slim. I don't want to clog things up." - P1**

### How useful do you think this is?

Over all, participants thought this kind of app would be very useful. (4,4, 5, 5, 5, 5)

- **"Gives you a way to always be in contact with the VA. For you outside of the VA to manage and get to know your important numbers. If there is a fluctation, you don't always need to be tied to your PC to do it." - P3**

- **"Speaking from my experinece having dealt with old VA for the last 5 years. Most of my doctors have been great and I've been very happy, but the process itself has been very frustrating. This would probably make me 90% more willing to interact with the VA." - P5**

- One participant qualified their rating as valuable because of PGD being available to doctor between appointments.

### How likely is it you would use something like that?

Most participants expressed that they were likely to use something like this, though 2 participants were less sure. (5,5,5,5,3,2)

- **"If I do use it, it would probably be for the accessibility I use it for now, MHV. I like to keep [my health care data] a little more secured. I want to be able to close it down and keep it secured" - P1**

- **"I just don't have the need...most of them are just websites broken down in a more convenient way, but I don't having a problem just going to the websites." - P2**

- **"You don't have to deal with the frustration of haveing to call in and try to reach someone or wait an extended time period to manage your health." - P3**

- One participant qualified their rating as valuable because of PGD being since their provider visits are infrequent. (This was the same participant as above.)

## How our research questions were answered

### How receptive are participants to how PGD data is accessed and organized?

- All participants navigated to their PGD data on the first try.
- Some participants expected subsequent screens to go directly to device management rather than more details about the data.
- 1 participant assumed weight data was based on records entered during each doctor's visit.

### What were participants expectations of and reception to the notification intercept?

#### On notifications

- Notifications as method of communication was generally well-received.
- Concerned about email notifications and app notifications at the same time.
  - **"It's nice that it just shows up there for you. You don't need to go find it in mail or chat box." - P2**
  - **"It should just come up as a regular notification on my phone." - P6**
- Missperception about reason for notification, but understood result
  - **"Historically with the VA, you don't find out about a cancellation or an adjustment until day of. It cuts out all of that frustration. Instead of canceling, they're giving me a VA appointment." - P3**
- Perception that VVC appointment might not be at same time/date.

#### Other App Observations

##### On VA Health Chat

- Common misperseption that Chat was just an alternative to functions you'd get from the contact center.

##### On VVC

**"And that's pretty convenient to not have to go into an office." - P2**

**"Have not used VVC, but I would love to, especially for mental health." - P3**

1 participant expressed both enthusiam about the time savings and concern about the effectiveness 

- **"That would be really cool, actually. ... To just go from this app and set up a VVC appointment in a certain amount of time. I know for myself in the past I used to drive about an hour." - P5**
- **"Don't need to show up, take time off, gas and money. Two advantages basically." - P5**
- **"It's good...and then it's bad. Me, myself, I'd rather go into the doctor's office so they can check blood pressure and stuff and they can check things I'm not aware of." - P5**

1 participant had a mispercption about how VVC would work, then later seemed to get it as they expressed enthusiasm for the time savings.

- **"Instead of calling a phone number I'd be able to video chat to set an appointment for me according to what primary care manager I see." - P6**
- **"I would rather have an appintment online rather than take so much time out of my day." - P6**

##### On the crisis line

- Positive reaction to crisis line. Suggested access on login screen as well.

##### On appointments

- Interested in ability to add appointments to their calendar

## Overall Observations

#### On the app overall

**"Looks a little more...Phone friendly, if you will" - P1**

**"So far the layout is beautiful and consistent. You're working with something that's familiar, so it's easy for you to interact with." - P2**

**"Again, it looks very familiar to what I've seen on the web version. Pretty clear and easy to understand." - P5**

**"It would be convenient over the desktop. Quicker than having to log into a site, having to go to another site." - P6**

**"If there's an issue with [the app], I probably wouldn't use it again." - P6**

#### On interacting with providers

**"Messaging back and forth is biggest single use that I really enjoy about [MHV]." - P1**

**"Being able to contact my doctors has pretty much changed everything about the VA that I had a problem with. So if there's even more like this video chat thing? ... This app? I'd be willing to try it." - P1**

#### Critique of information sharing from the VA

**"You find out more about VA health programs outside of the VA versus from the VA. Sometimes the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing" - P3**

**"They should be more forthcoming with what they have to offer as oppposed to you feeling like you need to research and fight for." - P3**
