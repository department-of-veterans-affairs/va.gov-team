## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Caitlin** and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about some of your interactions with VA tools and how you access healthcare from the VA.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30min.** 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. 

*Start audio and screen recording.*

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today?"

Alright. Thanks again for giving us some of your time today.

We have 3 different ideas we want to talk to you about in the next 30 min, so it might feel like I'm jumping around a little.

## First Section: Urgent Care/Express Care Access - 10 minutes


### Questions
* How often do you get care in a VAMC or VA clinic during a given year?

* When you have an urgent care need, what do you do?
* If you had an urgent need, are there circumstances where you'd start by seeking out care or advice online?
* What kind of support or answers would you be looking for?

[**Show/share urgent**]

* Can you talk me through the process you're seeing here?
* Would you use something like this during an urgent care situation?
* Why? Why not?

## Second Section: Prescribing Mobile Application Use - 10 minutes

### Questions
* How would you react if a Provider recommended that you track your sleep?
* What would you do next?
  * If they don't assume it's mobile: What if it was mobile.
* What would be the most effective way for you to be reminded to use this app?

## Third Section: Managing Multiple Tools - 10 minutes

### Questions
* So let’s say your doctor has asked you to share your data with them through a few apps. 
* Let’s say your tracking and sharing all of these:
  * Blood pressure
  * Steps
  * Sleep
  * MyFitnessPal Food Tracking
* Do you want to see all of the data that you’re sharing with your provider?
  * If so, what would that access help you with?
  * If so, how would you expect to access it?
* What would be your approach to managing the use of all of these tracking activities?

## Post-Task Wrap Up - 5 minutes

On a scale of 1 -5 (1 as not useful at all, 5 as extremely useful)
* How useful would it be for you to have a single portal to show all of the data?
  * Why or why not?
* How useful would it be for you to have access to all of these tracking tools one place?
  * Why or why not?
* How likely is it you would use something like that?
  * Why or why not?


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
