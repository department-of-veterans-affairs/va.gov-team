# Exploration of Veterans Perspectives of their VA Health Data

## Overview
VEO did a small discovery project around health data in June 2019, led by Jane Newman. A few folks from the VA National Center for Ethics in Health Care  drafted a pledge for VA employees around principles for handling of Veteran health data. Weâ€™ve been asked to get some perspectives from Veterans about what they think before these principles become final.
