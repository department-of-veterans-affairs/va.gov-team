# **What's New Page Conversation Guide**

**Moderator logistics**

**2-3 days before the session**

- Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Checklist.1958773011.html#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions).
- Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below)
-  Step 1: Write up research plan
-  Step 2: Create desktop and mobile prototypes

**Day of the session**

- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).

**Starting the session**

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro\*

**Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about the new What's New Page feature.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:]  **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be interactable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going.  **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
  - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes:  **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**Warm-up Questions - 8 minutes**

Before we look at the design, let's start with a few warm-up questions.

1. When you think of a My HeatheVet What's New Page, what are the first things that come to mind? What would you expect from that feature?
2. How often would you say you log into My HealtheVet?
3. What are some ways you look for site updates? How do you find out about site changes?

**First Task: You are logged out of your account on My HealtheVet and want to check the What's New Page. Please go to the What's New Page main page. - 8 minutes**

Ok, now we will start looking at the site. I am going to share my screen and have you take control.

I'm going to ask you to perform a series of tasks, even though this is a prototype with fake information. For the purpose of these tasks, please show me how you would navigate to view notifications and narrate how you would do this.

- Step 1: Participant will click/tap on either the blue banner or "What's new" link to get to the main page.

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant use the blue bar or the "what's new" link?
- Does the participant see where the options are to get to the What's New Page main page?

**Post-Task Question:**

- On a scale of 1-5 what is the level of difficulty to complete the task? 1 being very difficult, 2 being difficult, 3 being neutral, 4 being easy, 5 being very easy. What made you choose [that number]? Why [X] and not [Y]?

- How do you feel about the placement of the What's New Page Links? Is this where you would have expected them to be?

- Did you notice the path that you didn't take to get to notifications?
- How did you feel about having both the banner and the "what's new" link?
- What thoughts do you have about the current page?

**Second Task: You are now in the What's New Page main page. Please take the next steps you would take to see your personalized notifications. - 8 minutes**

- Step 1: Participant will click/tap on the log in link to access personalized notifications.

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant notice the log in link?

**Post-Task Question:**

- On a scale of 1-5 what is the level of difficulty to complete the task? 1 being very difficult, 2 being difficult, 3 being neutral, 4 being easy, 5 being very easy. What made you choose [that number]? Why [X] and not [Y]?
- What thoughts do you have about the current page?

**Third Task: Now that you are logged in, you have access to your personalized notifications. Please go to the time sensitive alert in your feed and deal with the issue. - 8 minutes**

- Step 1: Participant will click/tap the yellow time sensitive alert

- Step 2: A placeholder prompt will come up and the participant will click/tap next

**Things to watch for:**

- What is the participants first instinct to click when dealing with a notification card?

**Post-Task Question:**

- On a scale of 1-5 what is the level of difficulty to complete the task? 1 being very difficult, 2 being difficult, 3 being neutral, 4 being easy, 5 being very easy. What made you choose [that number]? Why [X] and not [Y]?

- What would be good indicators of a time sensitive alert?
- Did you feel the color for the time sensitive alert was appropriate?
- On this page, can you confirm that your sign in credentials have been verified?
- What thoughts do you have about the current page?

**Fourth Task (Desktop only): Please go back to the homepage. Please show me the different ways to view notifications without going directly to the What's New Page page. - 8 minutes**

- Step 1: Participant will hover (or click the arrow) over the "what's new" link to see the drop-down menu.

**Things to watch for:**

- Did the participant successfully find the drop-down menu?

- Did the participant find it helpful/easy to understand?

**Post-Task Question:**

- On a scale of 1-5 what is the level of difficulty to complete the task? 1 being very difficult, 2 being difficult, 3 being neutral, 4 being easy, 5 being very easy. What made you choose [that number]? Why [X] and not [Y]?

- What use would you have for a drop-down preview like this?
- What do you expect to happen if you hover on this while signed out?
- What thoughts do you have about the current page?

**Post-Task Interview - 8 minutes**

Look at What's New Page main page (once again). I would like you to scroll around the page and describe your first impressions to me, what do you think you can do, is there anything that stands out to you, etc.

- You can see on the screen that you have "new" notifications. How long do you expect those notifications to keep the "new" tag?

- If you were to put a log/archive of older notifications, where would you put it? What would you expect it to look like?

- If you could have a magic wand to make this new What's New Page feature better, what would you do?
- Is there anything I didn't ask, and you were expecting me to ask you?

- Any questions, comments or feedback for me?

**Thank-You and Closing - 1 minutes**

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

**Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

- **Out of questions:** We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
- **Blame technology:** I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
- **Backup Moderator:** This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say "for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate." They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
