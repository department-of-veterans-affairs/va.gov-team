**Research Goals**

Our project is a new What's New Page, which aims to be one central place to notify and communicate with Veterans about My HealtheVet website changes and alerts that are important for to them to know, while keeping consistent with VA Design Patterns and migration efforts. This is a new concept that we hope to introduce to the My HeatheVet home page. Veterans need to be updated and communicated with regarding the events of their personal My HealtheVet accounts, as well as the general updates within the site. This need exists in the Veteran Journey at various points, including joining, starting up, putting down roots, and aging.

The goals of this study are to:

- Identify any usability issues with the What's New Page flow, specifically with older Veterans.
- Assess user experiences with introduction of new major notification feature.
- Measure Veterans' expectations of the "new" tag timeframe.
****
**Research Questions**

1. How will Veterans react to the new What's New Page flow?
2. Does the new flow improve the likelihood that the "What's New" link will be noticed and read?
3. Does the "new" tag help Veterans understand how recent a notification was posted?
4. Do Veterans feel having both a banner and "what's new" link necessary?
5. How often do Veterans log in and does that affect any of the features within the What's New Page?
6. If there were to be a log or archive within this feature, how to Veterans expect it to look and function? Is it necessary?
****
**Methodology**

We conducted hour-long moderated remote sessions via Zoom from March 24 – April 7, 2023. Participants were asked to perform the following tasks on the prototype:

Task 1: What's New Page

1. Identify where the What's New Page link options
2. Click on either option
3. Identify What's New Page main page

Task 2: Personalized notifications

1. Identify how to access personalized notifications via link
2. Log in from sign in page

Task 3: Time Sensitive Alert

1. Find a specific notification card
2. Identify it as time sensitive
3. Use card to update sign in credentials
4. Verify that the credentials were updated

Task 4: Drop Down

1. Identify drop down feature from homepage
****
**Hypotheses and Conclusions**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Older Veterans will tolerate the new What's New Page flow.

- MAYBE TRUE – Most older Veterans understood the flow once they knew what they were looking for but were confused by verbiage. Some preferred bigger sizes to text and boxes. Some had different preferences to format but understood the main idea of the new feature.

_Hypothesis 2:_ The new notification feature will help Veterans understand changes and updates to the My HeatheVet website.

- MAYBE TRUE – Most participants said they used email or social media for general updates. Some said they would use the notification feature once the formatting was polished.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Veterans will have a set timeframe for how long they expect a new notification to last.

- TRUE – All participants had an expectation and timeframe on when the "new" tag would disappear.
****
**Key Findings**

1. Most participants (15 of 20) liked having both the blue banner and What's New link available on the homepage.
2. Some participants (10 of 20) wanted the link placements to be more noticeable or higher up on the page.
3. Most participants (14 of 20) wanted to sign in to My HeatheVet immediately before using the What's New feature.
4. Most desktop participants (5 of 9) did not expect the drop-down feature to be there when they were signed out of My HeatheVet.
5. Most participants (12 of 20) wanted the "new" tag to disappear when interacting with a notification.
6. Some participants (5 of 20) did not like the categories of "General" and "Personalized" and wanted the notifications to be under one umbrella.
7. Most participants (17 of 20) did not register the unified sign in card as time sensitive.

**Details of Findings**

1. **Most participants liked having both the blue banner and What's New link.**

**15 of 20) liked having both the blue banner and What's New link available on the homepage.** Participants liked that there are multiple ways to get to the new feature. Those that didn't like it in particular felt indifferent to having both options.

2. **Half of the participants wanted more noticeable link placements.**

**Half of the participants (10 of 20) wanted the link placements to be more noticeable or higher up on the page.** Participants wanted the link placements to be more noticeable, and some wanted the banner to be before the sign in section - or even in the header. There was even a participant who felt like the banner was more important than the talk to the Veterans crisis header. Their line of thinking was that if they were in a crisis, they wouldn't be going on a website, they would probably be calling somebody.

Additionally, they wanted the what's new link to be before the "home" link on the menus or more to the left of the screen. Desktop/laptop viewers were hoping for more noticeable links, shifting them upwards and to the left.

3. **Most participants wanted to sign in immediately.**

**Most participants (14 of 20) wanted to sign in to My HeatheVet immediately before using the What's New feature.** Most participants commented that it was their initial instinct to log in first, before looking through the website. They wanted to go from point A to point B, dealing with their personal priorities first before anything else.

Once the participants were signed in, some (10 of 20) commented positively on the right-hand drop-down links as seen on the homepage. One recognized it as where the most traffic is, even saying "all we need is right here". One liked that the right side went directly to the options without needing to go to the homepage. Those that didn't comment positively had no comment.

_Quote: "My response to that would be to sign in first."_

4. **Most desktop participants did not expect the drop-down feature when signed out.**

**Most desktop participants (5 of 9) did not expect the drop-down feature to be there when they were signed out of My HeatheVet.** Most participants did find the drop-down feature (5 out of 9 desktop users). Participants found it helpful to have the drop down there to see an overview of their notifications without actually having to go to the page. However, they weren't expecting the drop down to be there if they were signed out. Some commented that if the drop down was there when signed out, they expected to see only general alerts.

_Quote: "I wouldn't necessarily expect this when signed out."_

5. **Most participants wanted the "new" tag to go away once interacted with.**

**Most participants (12 of 20) wanted the "new" tag to disappear when interacting with a notification. If they had to choose a timeframe for how long the tag would stay, 8 participants said 30 days and 4 participants said 3 months.** There was variation on how long of a timeframe was considered "new". However, most of them agreed that the new tag should disappear after it was interacted with. Or, alternatively, there should be some sort of red validation showing that they've interacted with the card and it's no longer relevant. Also, some participants wanted dates on the notification cards. For example: "This was posted on April 27th, 2023". They wanted something to show the relevancy of said notifications.

_Quote: "Possibly the effective date of the new item… when you start looking at a list, your mind won't remember when it went into effect."_

6. **Some participants did not like the notification categories.**

**Some participants (5 of 20) did not like the categories of "General" and "Personalized" and wanted the notifications to be under one umbrella.** Some felt that it would be less confusing for the user to have all the notifications under one bucket. When they arrived at the logged in flow, they felt that nothing had happened and that they were still on the signed-out page. Some participants felt that the "Personalized" section should be at the top of the order since they wanted to see that first. Additionally, they wanted a better indication of a personalized page.

_Quote: "On this page, there should only be one bucket of notifications. I would eliminate the term personalized."_

7. **Most participants did not see the unified sign in card as time sensitive.**

**Most participants (17 of 20) did not register the unified sign in card as time sensitive.** There was a lot of confusion in regard to this card. Some of it may have been due to the past frustration with the sign in process, especially with the new credential update; but for the most part in relevancy to the What's New Page, they felt the color coding was a bit random. It was not clear enough to most participants. For one colorblind participant, they said they felt there was no significance to the color coding. Additionally, some participants wanted clear, plain language and visuals. For example, participants wanted more explanation as to what this card was going to do, where this card was going to send them to, and more step-by-step instructions.

_Quote: "I can see now that the titles are color coded, but it's not obvious when you log in."_

**Additional Insights**

- Various answers on what the formatting would be to include an archive system, although most agreed they wanted it at the bottom of the page and/or in an inbox-like system.
- Current and past studies have had multiple instances of Veterans requesting more visuals and videos on My HeatheVet.
- Changing name and instructions from "Notification Center" to "What's New Page" during testing caused less confusion about the feature's main purpose.
- Previous data has indicated that the lock icon by messages have made some Veterans believe that they do not have access/must "unlock" something.
****
**Recommendations**

- **What's New links:** Keep the blue banner and What's New link at the same placement as they were during the test.
  - _The placement of the blue banner and What's new link are not able to move due to accessibility and dev limitations._

- **Flow:** Website should open to the What's New page immediately after sign-in to allow better ease of access and maintain VA consistency.
  - _This would allow users to find the What's new page immediately and see any site updates along with their homepage quick links._

- **Drop down feature:** The desktop version should only show the drop-down feature once the user has signed in.
  - _Users will be able to view their information quickly._
  - _Dev team will not have to code a signed out drop down that users will most likely not see._

- " **New" tag:** The "new" tag will go away once a user has interacted with a notification. Also, Notification cards should be dated.
  - _This will help the user organize what information has been dealt with and what is still unknown to them._
  - _This will help users prioritize information._
- **Categories:** We should get rid of the "General" and "Personalized" categories and any color coding.
  - _This will take away any prior confusion users were having during testing and allow for easier organization of Information._
- **Time Sensitive:** We should keep time sensitive cards at the top of the order and add a yellow urgent tag to indicate time sensitive and due dates.
  - _This is to prioritize information that's more urgent to the user and give them visual indicators that it is time sensitive._

**Next Steps**

- Get business approval
- Finalize requirements
- Work with content
- Hand off to development
- Monitor analytics after deployed
