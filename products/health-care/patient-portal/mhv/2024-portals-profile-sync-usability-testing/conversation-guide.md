# **Conversation Guide: Portals, Profile Sync, January 2023**

# **Intro - 5 minutes**  

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]? 

My name is [name]. I'm a researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs. 

Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like: 

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. 
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be selectable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**  

I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session? 

_[If yes: ]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction. 

_[If no:]_  I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know. 

_[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves]_

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
- _[If yes: ]_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. 

_[Start recording.]_ 

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

 

# **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**  

- Do you use My Health_e_Vet? 

    - How often?

- Are you familiar with your profile in My HealtheVet or VA.gov?

    - What do you know about it?

- What type of device are you using today? 

_[If on Desktop/Laptop/Tablet:]_ I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get set up, I will give you instructions on what to do.  _[when ready]_ I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen and then you will be able to control my screen. Ready? 

_[If on mobile: ]_ Have you shared your screen over Zoom with your phone? 

_[If yes: ]_ I dropped the link to the prototype in the chat. Go ahead and pull it up and when you are ready to share, please do so. 

_[If no, follow protocol for particular OS (Android/iOS)]_ 

## **Participant Coaching**

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own. Of course, we are here and using a prototype, so to make it as natural as possible, we placed an arrow in the top left that will act as your back button, should you need it.

Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can't see your screen. Does that make sense?

If you are ready, we can begin.

# **First Task: My Profile Page - 5 minutes**

# **Second Task: Connecting Contact Information - 10 minutes**

_**[Connect your contact information to your VA profile page]**_

Let's walk through each section together. Our example emails and phone numbers are for Jamie Lee, but I would like you to think about your own profile. After I ask you some questions, I will let you know which one to choose for each section.

_**Email**_

_[Desktop]_ Next to each email it says from your VA profile, from your Secure Messaging account, and from your My HealtheVet profile.

- Considering only where these emails are already used, would you select one of these or provide a new one? What makes you say that?

_[Mobile]_ Below each email it says from your VA profile, from Secure Messaging, and from your My HealtheVet profile.

- Considering only where these emails are already used, would you select one of these or provide a new one? What makes you say that?

Please select the first email, 'jamie.lee@gmail.com'

_**Phones**_

The next three sections are about phone numbers. We realize not everyone has multiple phones, but we would love your input so we can be sure to serve those that do.

_**Mobile**_

- Do you have a mobile phone?
  - Do you have more than one?

Please select the first option with the phone number.

_**Home**_

- Do you have a home phone? (Landline)

[_if no]_

- If you were filling this out on your own, what would you do?

Please select the first option with the phone number.

_**Work**_

- Do you have a work phone?

[_if no]_

- If you were filling this out on your own, what would you do?

_[if they say they use their mobile for work]_

- If you were filling this out on your own, would you add your mobile number here?

Please select the first option.

_**Preferred Name**_

Please share your thoughts on this section.

- Do you use a nick name?
- Is it important that the VA provides this option to Veterans rather than just using their legal name? What makes you say that?

- Have you noticed any type of personalization anywhere in this prototype?

_[If yes]_ Please tell me about it.

_[if no – or if yes and they don't go to the header]_ Can you please scroll to the top of the page?

- What do you notice? _[point out branches and name if necessary]_
  - How do you feel about this?
  - Would you change anything?

Please return to the bottom of the page where it says 'Preferred name.'

Please select 'Jay' and then let's pause for a few more questions before we continue.

_**Process**_

We just completed our selections on this page. Share any thoughts you have about the process.

- Without clicking anywhere – just tell me – What would you do next?
- What do you think 'Share with all the VA' means?

# **Third Task: Confirmation page - 5 minutes**

_**[Your contact information has been saved page]**_

- What do you think is the purpose of this page?

It says at the top that 'Your contact information has been updated and shared with the VA and all affiliated services.'

- What do you think that means?
- Now where do you think the other contact information we saw earlier went? 

The previous page that we completed is all we had to do.

- What would you tell a fellow Veteran about your experience?
  - What would you say if they asked you what making selections on the previous page accomplishes?
  - What would you say if they asked you why it needs to be done?

Let's say you came to this page and decided you really do prefer JJ instead of Jay.

- What would you do?

  - Is there anything here that can help with that?

Please select 'Go to your My HealtheVet Profile.'

_**[My Profile page]**_

Let's say you haven't been on My HealtheVet in a few months when your buddy, a fellow Veteran, asks if you connected your contact information with your VA profile. You aren't sure, so you come to this page.

Based on what you see here, what do you tell your buddy? What makes you say that?

**Things to watch for:**

- How would the participant change their preferred name?
- Does the participant understand that their contact information is merged?
- Does the participant understand that this is a confirmation page?
- Can the participant tell if they have completed the update?

# **Fourth Task: Edit Contact Information - 5 minutes**

_**[My Profile page]**_

Let's say you decided to get rid of your land line and you want your mobile phone number listed under your home phone number in your profile. How would you do that?

_[if they scroll first]_

- Do you see a place where you can change your number here? Why do you think that is?

Please return to the top of the page.

Tell me your thoughts on this box with 'You can edit your contact information at any time.'

Tell me about this page.

You want to change your home number to match your mobile number. Can you show me how you would do that?

_**Home Number**_

_[clicking the text box will clear it out – the participant will not be able to type in the text box]_

- Can you tell me what that American flag and the +1 means?
- Let's say you wanted to change it to a different country. What would you do?

Because this is a prototype, you can't choose another country. Please select the United States.

If you click in the text box where you would type the number, you will see it appear.

_[when number appears]_

- What would you do next? _[guide them to save if needed]_
- Were you successful? How do you know?
- We are in My HealtheVet right now, will this update just here? What makes you say that?

# **Screener Interview – Users with CD**

Thank you for taking the time to get through all those tasks with me today and answering all our questions. It has been super helpful.

Before I let you go, I would like to confirm an answer to one of our screener questions. Please note that this is completely optional, it is up to you to answer these questions or decide not to. We just want to make sure that we accurately represent all the information you presented.

Like I said, this is regarding a response you gave us upon your submission to be a part of this study. May I go ahead and ask these confirmation questions? Again, it is up to you to answer or opt out.

_When confirmed:_

- In your screener, you answered yes when asked about a cognitive disability. Could you confirm if this is correct information?

_If yes_

- Would you mind sharing a little about how your cognitive disability affects your use of My HealtheVet or other websites?
  - _[possible follow up]_ Can you share an example of a time when you struggled with My HealtheVet because of your disability?

# **Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes**

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
