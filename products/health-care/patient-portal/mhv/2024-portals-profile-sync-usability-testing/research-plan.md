# **Research Plan for Portals, Profile Sync, January 2024**

## **Background**

As My HealtheVet migrates to VA.gov, Veterans need to sync their contact information between the two sites. Veterans may not access their profile information often after their initial set up, so they may not retain familiarity with it. We have built a prototype of the profile sync experience that we will be testing as part of this research study.

 ## **OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online.
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

## **Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## **Research Goals**

- Ascertain Veterans' understanding of the need for the sync and how the process will affect their contact information.
- Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience with syncing their email and phone numbers.

## **Outcome**

The results of this study will help us determine if our designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to sync their profiles and help to identify any pain points. This will inform later iterations of the design.

## **Research questions**

1. Can Veterans select, edit, add, remove, and verify their contact information?
2. Do Veterans understand the process of syncing their MHV and VA contact information?
  1. Do they understand why this step is necessary?
  

## **Hypothesis**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will successfully connect their MHV and VA contact information without assistance.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Many Veterans will struggle to understand that they will only have one set of contact information after the sync.


## **Methodology**

We will conduct moderated usability testing interviews in which we will ask users to navigate the prototype, observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

## **Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.

## **Recruitment**

### **Recruitment approach**

We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans.

###  **Recruitment criteria**

We will schedule a total of 24 Veterans for an expected completion rate of 18 usability tests.

2. Age distribution:
  - (5) 75+
  - (8) 65 – 74
  - (4) 55 – 64

5. (6) Rural, (18) Urban
6. (12) mobile users, (12) desktop/laptop/tablet
7. (12) frequent MHV users, (6) infrequent MHV users, (6) non MHV user (see screener question)
8. (4) with Cognitive Disability (see screener question)

**Screening questions for recruitment**

   a) _Yes (Recruit 4 – proceed to question 3)_

   b) _No (Recruit 20)_

3. Based on your response to the previous question, how would you rate the severity of your cognitive disability? (Recruit all answers)

    a) Mild - (Symptoms have a limited effect on daily life)
  
    b) Moderate – (Symptoms make daily life much more difficult than my peers.)

    c) Severe - (Symptoms make daily life extremely difficult and I require assistance.)

    d) I prefer not to answer

    e) Not applicable

4. What type of device will you be using to connect to Zoom?

    a) Desktop/Laptop?
   
    b) Smartphone: Android or iPhone?
