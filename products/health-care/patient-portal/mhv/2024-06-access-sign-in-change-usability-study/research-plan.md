# **Research Plan for MHV Access, Sign in Changes, June 2024**

## **Background**

Protecting Veterans’ personal information is paramount, so the VA is mandating sign in changes to take affect January of 2025 in which access to My HealtheVet will be limited to ID.me or Login.gov. To prepare for that, Veterans are being encouraged to retire their My HealtheVet user IDs and passwords.

### **OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online.
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

### **Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## **Research Goals**

- Ascertain Veterans’ understanding of the content that communicates the sign in changes.
- Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience with sign in messaging and interactions.

### **Outcome**

The results of this study will help us determine if our designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to make changes to their sign in options and help to identify any pain points. This will inform later iterations of the design.

## **Research Questions**

1. Do Veterans understand the process and consequence of removing their MHV user ID and password?
2. Do Veterans understand that they must have Login.gov or ID.me account before retiring their MHV user ID and password?
3. Do Veterans know what to do if they blocked their Login.gov or ID.me accounts?  

## **Hypothesis**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Some Veterans will understand the process and consequence of retiring their MHV user ID and password.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Many Veterans will struggle to follow the instructions for retiring their MHV user ID and password.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most participants will understand how to unblock their accounts.

## **Methodology**

We will conduct moderated usability testing interviews in which we will ask users to navigate the prototype, observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

### **Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.

### **Recruitment approach**

We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans.
