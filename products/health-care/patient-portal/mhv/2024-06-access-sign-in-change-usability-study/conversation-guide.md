# **Conversation Guide: My HealtheVet, Access, June 2024**

## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you \[first name\]?

My name is \[name\]. I'm a researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be selectable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_\[If yes: \]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_\[If no:\]_  I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

_\[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves\]_  

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- _\[If yes: \]_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_\[Start recording\]_

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Screen share/Remote share - 2 minutes**

_\[If on Desktop/Laptop/Tablet:\]_ Do you have an external mouse or are you using a trackpad today?  
<br/>_\[if trackpad, follow mobile instructions\]_

_\[If external mouse:\]_

 I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get set up, I will give you instructions on what to do.  _\[when ready\]_ I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen and then you will be able to control my screen. Ready?

_\[If on mobile: \]_ Have you shared your screen over Zoom with your phone?

_\[If yes: \]_ I dropped the link to the prototype in the chat. Go ahead and pull it up and when you are ready to share, please do so.

_\[If no, follow protocol for particular OS (Android/iOS)\]_

### **Participant Coaching**  

As I mentioned earlier, this is a prototype, and it will have some limitations. It looks like a working website, but it does not behave that way. I am going to ask you to only click inside the prototype and not into your browser. If you would like to go back to a previous screen, you just need to click on the VA logo in the top left of your screen

For this session, we have created a test user named Pat Wilson. Since we are not on your account, we will be approaching all of today’s tasks from Pat’s point of view. At times I may ask you what you would do if you were Pat. Does that make sense?


Can I answer any questions before we get started?



## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

- Do you use My HealtheVet?
- How do you normally sign in?
  - Why do you use \[option\] instead of the other options?

\[If they mention specific thoughts/feelings about multi-factor authentication\]

- Can you share more about that?
- Do you have other accounts in which you need to authenticate? How do you feel about that?

## **First Task: Retire MHV Credentials Pt 1- 5 minutes**

_\[MHV landing page – not signed in\]_

- Let’s say our test user, Pat, does not have a My HealtheVet account. How would they create one from here?
  - _\[if participant doesn’t see the ‘Register’ button\]_ What would you do next?
  - Do you see anywhere to create an account?

_\[Sign in page\]_

- What would you do next?
  - _\[if participant says they would create and account\]_ Which option would you choose? Why?
  - Go ahead and select that option.

_\[MHV landing page – not signed in\]_

Pat actually does have a My HealtheVet account so please click on ‘Sign in.’

_\[Sign in page 1\]_

Let’s get Pat signed in to My HealtheVet using option 2.

_\[Sign in page 2\]_

We already filled out the information, so please select sign in.

_\[MHV landing page – signed in\]_

- Does this look familiar to you?

I would like to pause here for a moment before we move to another page.

- Do you ever look at the “What’s new” page?
  - _\[if yes\]_ What types of information have you found helpful?
  - _\[if no\]_ Why is that?
  - Do you know where to find it?

Let’s check it out.

_\[Desktop\]_

Please click on “What’s new” at the top right.

_\[Mobile\]_

Please click on the menu on the top right. “What’s new” is the last one.

_\[What’s New at My HealtheVet\]_

I would like to focus on just that first post, “Retire your My HealtheVet user ID and password to better protect your identity.”

- What do you think is meant by “retire”?
- Why do you think someone would want to retire their user ID and password?
  - _\[if they mention “protect your identity”\]_ What do you think that means?
  - Is protecting your identity online a concern for you? What makes you say that?

- Is protecting your identity online a concern for you? What makes you say that?
- What do you think is meant by “unblock your access” in the second paragraph? What makes you say that?

Please click on the title of this post for me. _\[this will make the link accessible\]_

- Where might you go to get more information on this?
  - \[if they notice “learn how” link\] Go ahead and select that link.
  - \[if they don’t notice “learn how” link\] Please select the link that starts with “Learn how to retire your My HealtheVet user ID and password.”

_\[Retire your My HealtheVet user ID and password to better protect your identity page\]_

Let’s say our test user, Pat, does not have a login.gov or ID.me account, but they want to retire their My HealtheVet user ID and password.

Please review this page so we can do that for Pat. Please let me know when you are ready.

_\[Do not interrupt participant – collecting time on task\]_

_\[When participant ready\]_

- What would you do next?
- _\[if participant is unsure\]_ Remember, Pat does not have a Login.gov or ID.me account, but they want to retire their My HealtheVet user ID and password.
  - _\[if still not sure\]_ Is there somewhere on this page that might start that process?

_\[ID.me page 1\]_

    - Do you see somewhere on here where you can do that?

_\[Do not interrupt participant – collecting time on task\]_

_\[Want to retire your My HealtheVet user ID and password to better protect your identity? page\]_

_\[if participant comments on anything on this page, try to not respond. If needed, say\]_ Let’s finish this task, then we can discuss it.

We have the credentials all loaded in like before.

Please sign in for Pat.

_\[if participant asks which to choose\]_ Choose whichever one you would choose if I weren’t here.

_\[If they choose option 1\]_

_\[MHV landing page – signed in\]_

- What made you choose that option?

_\[the only thing clickable on this page is the option 1 button. If the participant wants to select it, le.t them. Otherwise, you can stop here.\]­­_

### **Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant remember to not use option 2?

## **Fifth Task: Feedback - 5 minutes**

I’m going to stop your screen share before asking you a few final questions.

_\[stop screen share – this will also end remote mouse control\]_

I would like to hear your thoughts on the process of retiring your My HealtheVet user ID and password.

- Did you understand the instructions?
  - Is there anything that would have made them easier to understand?
- Do you think you would retire your My HealtheVet account if this option were made available? Why? Why not?
- Is there anything else you would like to share about what we reviewed today?

## **Cognitive Disability Interview – 5 minutes**  

Thank you for taking the time to get through all those tasks with me today and answering all our questions. It has been super helpful.

Our goal in these studies is to make sure we represent the point of view of all Veterans. This is why we are committed to recruiting participants with cognitive disabilities so that we are designing an experience that meets their needs.

In your screener, you answered yes when asked about a cognitive disability.  

- Could you confirm if this is correct information?

_\[if no\]_

We will be sure to make that correction. Thank you.

_\[if yes, continue\]_

We are collecting information on how Veterans’ cognitive disabilities may affect their ability to use My HealtheVet. Would you be willing to answer a couple of questions today?

_\[if no\]_

That’s no problem.

_\[if yes\]_

- Would you mind sharing a little about how your cognitive disability affects your use of My HealtheVet or other websites?
- Can you share an example of a time when you struggled with My HealtheVet because of your disability?

## **Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes**

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
