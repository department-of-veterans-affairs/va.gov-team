The VA will likely take on fourth mission activities to administer covid-19 vaccinations to groups outside of the VA. To accomplish this, there is a need to recruit people to volunteer at these sites for both administering the vaccine and administrative tasks. The Office of the CTO has been asked to support this effort by creating a tool for VA employees to state their interest in volunteering. The plan is for this tool to be limited to VA employees, though there is potentially a separate effort to recruit non-va employees.

We've decided to use LEAF for this purpose. The tool contains the following features: frontend form with questions (demographics, location, medical license). The results of the form go into a database that will be filterable by VISN, zip code, speciality, etc. Local site coordinators will be given access to this database and can filter in the tool or export the results to excel. Downstream processes to contact and enroll volunteers are out of scope for this tool.
