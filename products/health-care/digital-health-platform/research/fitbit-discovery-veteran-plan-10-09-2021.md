**Research Plan for Digital Health Platform (DHP) October 29, 2021**
====================================================================

*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.*

**Background**
--------------

Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:

What problem is your product trying to solve? **Improve care for Veterans through the use of patient-generated health data sharing with VA.**

Where is your product situated on [VA.gov?](http://va.gov/) (ex: auth vs. unauth) **Not on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)**

What is Veterans' familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one? **None, new tool**

### **OCTO Objectives**

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

**Not directly related to OCTO goals associated with [VA.gov](http://va.gov/), but aligns to these two North Star objectives:**

-   **Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome**
-   **Increase the quality and reliability of VA services**

### **Veteran Journey**

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter? **Taking Care of Myself**

**Research Goals**
------------------

What are you trying to learn from this research?

-   **Understand how Veterans use activity trackers.**
-   **Understand if Veterans share their activity tracker data with their care team. And if so, how they share it. **
-   **Understand how comfortable Veterans are sharing activity tracker data and for what purposes.**

### **Outcome**

How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

**This research is intended to expand on [a study done by the Lighthouse team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-ux/blob/master/Health%20Research/2020-08-Perception-of-Patient-Generated-Data-with-veterans/PGD%20discovery%20report.pdf) to focus specifically on PGD from activity trackers such at Fitbit.**

**This is discovery research that will help determine the value of bringing activity tracker data into VA and identify areas of opportunity for a proof of concept.**

### **Research questions**

-   What data do you track with an activity tracker?
-   Why do you track certain metrics?
-   Do you share any data with health care providers?
-   What are your expectations of VA if you share your data?
-   Are you comfortable sharing your data?

Reference [discussion guide](https://community.max.gov/display/VAExternal/Fitbit+-+Veteran+-+Discussion+Guide) for full list

### **Hypothesis**

-   Veterans have a variety of goals that activity trackers help them achieve.
-   Veterans using activity trackers are willing to share their data with their care team. 
-   Veterans expect improved care in return for sharing their data.

**Method**
----------

Describe the method you're planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. - **Moderated interview**

### **Location**

**Remote over Zoom**

### **Research materials**

*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials -- including this plan -- prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

For moderated interviews:
