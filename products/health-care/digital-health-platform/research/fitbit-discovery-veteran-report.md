Research Goals
--------------

-   Understand how Veterans use activity trackers.

-   Understand if Veterans share their activity tracker data with their care team. And if so, how they share it. 

-   Understand how comfortable Veterans are sharing activity tracker data and for what purposes.

Methodology
-----------

Remote moderated interviews

Participants
------------

Six total participants recruited through Perigean. Three male and three female.

Participant devices:

-   4 Fibits (provided by VA)

-   2 Apple Watches

-   1 Virgin Pulse

Hypotheses and Conclusions
--------------------------

### Veterans have a variety of goals that activity trackers help them achieve.

Definitely true - Participants tracked a variety of different metrics that were important to them. Each participant had different goals and different ways the activity trackers help them achieve their goals.

### Veterans using activity trackers are willing to share their data with their care team. 

Definitely true - All participants in this study were willing to share their activity tracker data with their care team at VA.

### Veterans expect improved care in return for sharing their data.

Likely true - Participants suggested providing data at the request of their care team would help clinicians make more informed decisions related to their care.

Summary
-------

Veterans interviewed during this study shared positive experiences using activity trackers for their personal health. The data makes them more accountable, aware, and motivated to monitor and achieve their goals. Participants expressed few barriers to their willingness to share data with their care team at VA and some participants already do this through manual processes. 

Key themes highlighted below:

1.  Activity trackers empower Veterans with data to be more accountable, aware, and motivated to achieve their goals

2.  Some Veterans are already sharing their activity tracker data with their care team through manual processes

3.  All participants are willing to share their data with VA with the expectation it would improve their care

4.  Participants expect to be able to stop sharing data, but not necessarily delete any data already shared

Key Findings
------------

### Activity trackers empower Veterans with data to be more accountable, aware, and motivated to achieve their goals

This theme was first observed during research with clinicians and further validated through conversations with Veterans. Participants shared how seeing data from their activity trackers helped motivate them and make them more aware of certain aspects of their health. This awareness led to behavior changes such as adding extra activity throughout their day. ***Validate with recordings - topics for discussion with clinician***

>"Usually when I get my weekly report, I try and go back to see what activities I did that day that made me more successful" - P1

>"It [Fitbit] made a big difference for me along with the [VA] trainings. It helped improve my bloodwork." - P2

>"I didn't realize how much it would help me keep track of things and keep me motivated." - P2

>"I wanted to keep track of how much I walk, accent my workout, and overall be healthier." - P4

>"If there is a day I'm feeling bad and I don't really get out of bed, it [Fitbit] will send me a notification and I'll make sure to get up and move around." - PP6

### Some Veterans are already sharing their activity tracker data with their care team through manual processes

Some participants already share some data with their care team. However, the process of sharing their data is not consistent. The most common way data is shared is through conversations with clinicians. Additionally, some participants email their weekly Fitbit summary report.

>"I would show the app if I could sign in or pull up the weekly email and show that" - P1

>"Every time we have a class, we submit the Fitbit data along with our weight through email. The instructor said eventually they will be able to pull the information by logging in and linking our accounts with VA. I'm not sure if they were able to finally get it done prior to me leaving." - P2

>"I talk every week with my health coach and we talk about how many miles I'm walking" - P6

### All participants are willing to share their data with VA with the expectation it would improve their care

All participants in this study were willing to share their activity tracker data with VA with little hesitation. In general, the activity tracker data was not considered especially sensitive data by the participants. The expectation for sharing data was that it would better inform their clinician about their situation leading to improved care and decisions by the clinician.  

>"If it was something that would help me, I absolutely would share my [Fitbit] data." - P1

>"I would have no problem what so ever [connecting Fitbit to share data with VA], I thought that was the purpose when I got it [Fitbit]." - P1

>"I would want to know if what I'm transmitting is meeting the expectations within the MOVE program." - P4

>"I was led to believe initially I would be discussing the data with my doctor when I have an appointment. But so far that hasn't happened." - P5

>"That would be fine with me [linking Fitbit data to VA]. When you see your VA provider and talk to them about your lifestyle and sometimes they don't really understand unless they can actually see it." - P6

### Participants expect to be able to stop sharing data, but not necessarily delete any data already shared

All participants expected to be able to stop sharing data with VA if they decided to. Most expected that any data already shared with VA would remain with VA and not be deleted.

>"I would like to think I could [delete all my shared data], in all honestly I wouldn't expect that to be possible." - P4

>"I'd like to have the option to stop sharing data. Depending on the reason, I'd want to delete" - P5

Additional Insights
-------------------

-   Some participants would be open to VA proactively contacting them based on their activity tracker data as long as they knew ahead of time it was a possibility.

-   One participant used the Apple Health app to track additional PGD such as migraines. The participant noted after tracking the migraines and sharing data with their clinician, the clinician understood the migraine pattern differently than the participant had described it. This ultimately led to a change to the participant's disability rating and an increase in their monthly benefit.

-   One participant shared activity tracker data with their employer in order to receive a quarterly health bonus.

Recommendations
---------------

### Communicate with Veterans about how they will benefit from sharing data with VA

Participants were willing to share their data, and would like to know how it is used if they do share data. While knowing exactly how their data would be used was not a requirement for some participants to share data, it increased their understanding of how they could benefit from sharing the data. Some participants who received Fitbits through VA thought they were already sharing data with VA and assumed it was not being used.

"The more transparent the better. Clear and concise about what the data is being used for, how it might benefit myself, how it might benefit others, how it might make my care better or easier, what security measures are in place." - P5

### Provide a clear way for Veterans to connect and manage their shared data

Participants expressed a willingness to connect their activity tracker data to VA through an app or website. The expectation was this would be a clear process with an easy way to pause or stop sharing data.

### Next steps and further research

-   Usability testing should be conducted around any solutions for consent flow and management of data sharing.
