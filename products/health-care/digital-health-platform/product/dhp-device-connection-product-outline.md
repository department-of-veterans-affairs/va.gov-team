Digital Health Platform Device Connection Product Outline
========================

Overview
--------

The Digital Health Platform (DHP) enables Veterans to connect and share their patient generated data (PGD) with their care team at VA. The PGD provides care teams with information to form a more complete picture of the Veteran's health. This product brief is focused on the Veteran experience of connecting their accounts and devices such as Fitbit and continuous glucose monitors to VA through VA.gov. 

Problem Statement
-----------------

Veterans are generating patient-generated health data today through the use of devices such as Fitbits and continuous glucose monitors. Care teams do not have consistent access to this data today and Veterans do not have a consistent way to share the data. Currently, it is shared through conversations, email, or by viewing data on a Veteran's device.

Desired User Outcomes
---------------------

-   Veterans have an intuitive, central location to connect their digital health devices and accounts to share data with VA.

-   Veterans can self-serve the connection of their PGD accounts to VA.

Desired Business Outcomes
-------------------------

-   VA has access to Veteran PGD to improve Veteran care and better inform care teams.

Solution Approach
-------------------

-   The initial launch will be scoped to a small group of users at our pilot site (Atlanta VA Whole Health). Future iterations will likely expand this to a larger group as the value of the DHP is proven. 

-   VA.gov was selected as the location for this experience because it is a centralized location Veterans are familiar with and provides much of the needed base functionality such as authentication. Future iterations may expand to include the flagship mobile app. 

-   The MVP will focus on Fitbit data and connecting a Veteran's Fitbit account to their VA account. Future iterations will allow for other device/account types to be connected.

-   In order to connect their Fitbit account and data a Veteran must:

-   Navigate to a page about connecting their PGD to VA

-   Sign in with their VA account

-   Select the type of account they would like to connect (Fitbit)

-   Be redirected to the Fitbit website to sign in 

-   Select the data (steps, heart rate, sleep, activity, etc) they would like to share (On Fitbit's website)

-   Be redirected back to a confirmation page on VA.gov indicating the account was successfully linked

Go-to-market Strategy
---------------------

Our initial users will be part of a pilot site at the Atlanta VA. Veterans in this group will learn about the program through their care team at this site.

Launch Dates
------------

We are planning to start development on the Digital Health Platform in January 2022 and launch in the first half of 2022.
