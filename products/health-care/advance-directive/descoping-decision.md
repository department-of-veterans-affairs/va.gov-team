## Decision for VA Form 10-0137 
Form name: VA ADVANCE DIRECTIVE DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE AND LIVING WILL  
**Background**  
This form was on a list of forms that that IVC team asked to digitize on VA.gov, however upon inspection of the form by the IVC forms modernization team, the form didn't seem relevant to the VFMP (Veterans foreign medical program).  The form is actually used by the VHA medical centers to indicate preferences for health care.  
**Steps to decision**  
The PO (Premal Shah), of the OCTO (Office of CTO), confirmed with the following that this form wasn't used by the VFMP program and it was agreed to descope the form from the current IVC forms modernization initiative. 

 1. CHAMPVA enrollment lead. 
 2. IVC Contact Center 
 3. IVC PMO Team 

Note: This form have been a challenge to deploy to VA.gov as it includes a notary and a witness signature, which deviates significantly from our design patterns and forms system on VA.gov.
