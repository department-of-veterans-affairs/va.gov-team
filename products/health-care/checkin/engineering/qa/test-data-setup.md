# Overview
Check In Experience is a mobile workflow that will be tested on mobile device browsers, or mobile device simulators on a computer.

To test the Check in process, an appointment must exist in the test VistA instance for a user with a specific phone number.

Additionally, to initiate the Check In Experience workflow, the tester must send an SMS message from a phone number known to the vetext system.

Endpoints are available to allow test users to view thier existing appointments, create a new appointment, delete an existing appointment and update the phone number associated with their assigned test user. An additional endpoint is available to see the available appointment slots for a specific clinic; a slot must be available to make an appointment.

These endpoints require entering the `patientDfn` (this is the patient Identifier in a VistA system) and `ClinicIen` (this is the clinic identifier in a VistA system). The `patientDFN` and `clinicIen` values configured in the test VistA syteme are noted below.

Make sure you have an assigned test user DFN before setting up appointment tests. Update the [assigned DFN table](#assigned-dfns) after you are assigned a test user.

# Pre check-in and day of check-in Testing Workflow

## Network access

You must use CAG or GFE to follow this testing workflow, the endpoints are not accessible via SOCKS.

## Test harness

You will need the CHIP Insomnia collection, ask a CHIP team member for it. When using Insomnia make sure to have `Validate certificates` unchecked in the Request/Response section of the Insomnia preferences.

You can download Insomnia at [http://insomnia.rest](http://insomnia.rest)

## Create Appointment

Using the 'Make Appointment' endpoint under the `VEText Appointments` heading, create an appointment for any time between tomorrow and 14 days from now. Note the `appointmentIEN` in the response, you'll need it for the next step.

- **Note**: use the `/appointments/slots` GET request to find available appointment slots to schedule into. Use the `startDatetime` from the slot you wish to use and set the endDatetime to be 30 minutes after the start.

## Call the pre-checkin endpoint

Using the CHIP/Test Harness Insomnia collection:

- Select the "CHIP Preprod" environment at the top left
- Select "Pre Check In" Under the CHIP collection on the left
- Ensure that the station number, appointment IEN, patient IEN and patient details match those used for the appointment you created
- After re-sending the request with the correction `appointmentIEN`, you should receive a UUID back - to test pre-checkin, go to:

http://staging.va.gov/health-care/appointment-pre-check-in/?id={uuid}

# End to End Testing Workflow

## Network access

You must use CAG or GFE to follow this testing workflow, the endpoints are not accessible via SOCKS.

## Assign Phone Number
If you have not already done so, [use the `/patients` endpoint to add your phone number to your assigned VistA test patient](#put---update-only-the-phone-number-for-a-specific-test-user).

## Create Appointment

Execute the POST to the `/appointments` endpoint described above to create a new appointment. There must be an open time slot for the `clinicIen` at the time specified in `startDateTime`.

- **Note**: use the `/appointments/slots` GET request to find available appointment slots to schedule into. Use the `startDatetime` from the slot you wish to use and set the endDatetime to be 30 minutes after the start.

## Send Text
Once the appointment has been scheduled, send a text message to initiate the Check In Experience workflow.

- **Note**: Currently the time window that an appointment can be checked in to is 30 minutes prior to and 5 minutes past the appointment start time.

- **Note**: The text message must come from the phone number associated with the test Patient.

Once an appointment has been created, send `check in` as a text message to `254-278-2622`. An SMS similar to this will be returned:

```
Check in for your VA appointment at https://go.usa.gov/xyz123
```

## Access Check In Experience va.gov Workflow

Click on the link returned in the SMS to access the va.gov Health Care Experience workflow.

- **Note**: You will need the test Patient's last name and the last four digits of their social security number to complete the workflow.  These can be retrieved by using the `/patients` GET request to view the demographic data associated with the test patient.

### Assigned DFNs
You will be assigned a specific test user in VistA that will have an identifier associated with it referred to as the `DFN`, or Data File Number. The `DFN` will be used when making calls to many of the endpoints. The `DFN` represents the Internal Entry Number (`IEN`) of the VistA record associated with this test Patient. For our use, `patientDfn` and `patientIen` can be used interchangeably.

## Patients Endpoint
This RESTful endpoint provides `GET` and `PUT` actions on Patients in the test VistA.

`https://vpce-06399548ef94bdb41-lk4qp2nd.execute-api.us-gov-west-1.vpce.amazonaws.com/dev/patients`

<a name="getPatient"></a>
## `GET` - Get all demographics data for a specific test user
This endpoint provides a GET action to fetch all demographics information associated with this test VistA user

### Parameters as Example 

```json
{
  "body": {
    "patientDfn": "<DFN>",
  }
}
```

### curl Statement

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://vpce-06399548ef94bdb41-lk4qp2nd.execute-api.us-gov-west-1.vpce.amazonaws.com/dev/patients \

  }
}'
```

<a name="putPatient"></a>
## `PUT` - Update only the phone number for a specific test user

This endpoint provides a PUT action to allow a tester to update the phone number associated with their assigned test patient. This endpoint will update both the VistA Patient record and the vetext database used to receive SMS messages for Check In Experience. The primary use case for this is to allow testing teams to share a VistA test user by modifying the phone number to be that of the current tester, such that the SMS workflow will work from that tester's mobile phone.

### Parameters as Example 

```json
{
  "body": {
    "patientDfn": "<DFN>",
    "cellPhone": "5554443322"
  }
}
```

### curl Statement

```bash
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://vpce-06399548ef94bdb41-lk4qp2nd.execute-api.us-gov-west-1.vpce.amazonaws.com/dev/patients \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <API KEY>' \
  --header 'x-apigw-api-id: ij4ry1zth2' \
  --data '{
    "body": {
    "patientDfn": "<DFN>",
    "cellPhone": "5554443322"
  }
}'
```
# VistA Access 

There may be a need to access VistA directly to schedult an appointment or checnge data for a test patient. 

## ssh connectivity for dev. 

To access Vista, ssh to the follwoing system using port 2222 instead of 22.  For example:

ssh -p 2222 vista@oitdvrappclin03.r01.med.va.gov

email shane.elliott@va.gov for Access and Verify Code.
