## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the approach to test the performance of Check-in and Pre Check-in Experience. Our current target is the upcoming rollout to VISN8 with facilities in FL, PR, and Virgin Islands.

## 2. Introduction

*TODO*
## 3. Test Methodology

### Load Estimates

Mobile Check-in will be enabled in the VISN8 stations in a staggered manner. The table below shows weekly deployment schedule and the actual appointments in those stations for the week of 4/22/2022.

The cumulative total number of daily appointments at the end of the rollout for all stations is **282,076**.

Questions:
- What % of these appointments will be eligible for mobile check-in?
- What estimated % of these appointments will result in a pre check-in link being sent out?

Check-in scenario: Assuming that these are equally distributed throughout the business day (8 - 5), the hourly load is 35,260 check-ins per hour.

Pre check-in scenario: The pre check-in process is run in the morning with VEText calling the CHIP initiate-pre-checkin lambda. TBD the load profile for pre check-in components.

Questions:
- Do we also need to include the reminders that are sent out 2nd or 3rd time (3 days or 1 day before the appointment)?
- How does VEText invoke the CHIP lambda to initiate pre-checkin? Is this multi-threaded, how many threads and can that be staggered?


### User Scenarios
Check-in: This scenario is invoked by the Veteran when they arrive at the facility for their appointment and send a text to initiate the check-in process. See sequence diagrams for check-in [here](../architecture-diagrams/sequenceDiagram_checkInExp.md).

Pre check-in: This sceanrio is initiated by VEText which calls the initiate pre check-in lambda, which ultimates sends a text to the Veteran to start the pre check-in process. See sequence diagrams for pre check-in [here](../architecture-diagrams/sequenceDiagram_preCheckInExp.md)


### Sub Systems

Check-in system comprises of various sub-systems that are shown in the container diagram below.

![C4 Container Diagram for check-in experience](../architecture-diagrams/containerDiagram_checkInExp.png "Check In Experience container diagram")

We're going to load test the individual sub-systems in addition to the end to end load testing.

#### vets-website/vets-api

This subsystem comprises of user facing va.gov website (vets-website) and vets-api. These components are supported and deployed by the VA platform team. vets-website is a React.js app which is hosted in S3. vets-api is a Rails application and hosts the modules/engines that support various VA functionality built by different teams. It is deployed *TODO: add deployment methodology* in US GovCloud.

The goal of testing this subsystem is to ensure that vets-website front-end and vets-api backend can handle increased load due to check-in traffic.

#### LoROTA

LoROTA application is a set of lambdas that provide api endpoints for low risk token authentication.

### Test Environment

We will be running these tests in Staging Environment.
