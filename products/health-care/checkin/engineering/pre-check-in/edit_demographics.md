## Pilot Site

- Clinic: Martinsburg, WV

## Problem Statement

### Ideal situation

Veterans can update their _demographics data_[^2] for upcoming care(appointemnts) during their Pre-Check-In workflow through the va.gov website and their updated _demographics data_[^2] is saved instantly to all of the internal systems which require and rely on that data for business needs.

### Reality

Veterans **cannot** update their _demographics data_[^2] for upcoming appointments during their Pre-Check-In workflow through the va.gov website. Veterans can update the **contact** information portion of their total demographics set through their **VA.gov profile**, after they have _fully authenticated_[^1] on the va.gov website. However, currently, there are no workflows, business or engineering, which facilitate a veteran to update their next-of-kin or emergency contact information, and save that updated information to relevant internal VA systems through the va.gov website.

### Consequences

Not having the ability to update _demographics_data_[^2] is a loss of value to veterans and the Pre-Check-In feature.

### Proposal

The Check-In-Experience team seeks to resolve this issue iteratively by collaborating with existing teams and leveraging the appropriate services, APIs and databases in-order to provide the demographics edit functionlity to veterans through the Pre-Check-In flow on va.gov.

## Measuring Success

_What user and systems metrics do we want to track?_

## Exploring User Scenarios

### Happy Path Stories

> **In order** to provide all concerned parties my latest demographics changes before a scheduled appointment  
> **As a** Veteran  
> **I want** the ability to securely edit and save my _demographics data_[^2] to the va systems during my Pre-Check-In work flow  

#### Scenario Setup

**Given** I have an upcoming appointment in the system at a facility/clinic where I'm registered at  
**And** currently it's before the day of the appointment  
**And** I have received a SMS notification with a shortened URL to the Pre-Check-In flow for the appointment  
**And** I have clicked on the shortened URL  
**And** I have been successfully redirected to Pre-Check-In starting page on the va.gov site  

**Scenario:** User has NOT _fully authenticated_[^1] with their va.gov credentials prior to clicking on the URL  

**Given** I have not _fully authenticated_[^1] prior using my va.gov credentials  
**And** I have successfully, minimally authenticated using my last name and the last four digits of my SSN  
**And** I am looking at my pages with Contact, Next-of-kin, and Emergency Contact information  
**When** I attempt to edit Contact OR Next-of-kin OR Emergency Contact information  
**Then** I am successfully redirected to the edit page for a specific demographic (such as mailling address) and submit the changes
**Then** I return to the main demographics page upon cancel, submission of chnages, or navigating via breadcrumbs  
**when** I login using my va.gov credentials  
**Then** I am successfully redirected back to my Pre-Check-In demographics page  
**And** I have the ability to edit all of my _demographics data_[^2]  
**When** I edit any or all of my _demographics data_[^2] and submit the changes  
**Then** I can see that my changes have been validated  
**And** can see that my validated changes have been successfully saved in the va systems so that all relevant parties can view it  

**Scenario:** User HAS _fully authenticated_[^1] with their va.gov credentials prior to clicking on the URL  

**Given** I have _fully authenticated_[^1] prior using my va.gov credentials  
**Then** my minimal authentication was automatically handled using the information from my profile  
**And** I'm not shown the minimal authentication page  
**And** I am looking at my pages with Contact, Next-of-kin, and Emergency Contact information  
**When** I attempt to edit Contact OR Next-of-kin OR Emergency Contact information  
**Then** I am NOT redirected to the main va.gov login page  
**And** I remain on the Pre-Check-In flow demographics page  
**And** I now have the ability to edit all of my demographics information
**Then** I am successfully redirected to the edit page for a specific demographic (such as mailling address) and submit the changes
**Then** I return to the main demographics page upon cancel, submission of chnages, or navigating via breadcrumbs
**When** I edit any or all of my demographics info and submit the changes  
**Then** I can see that my changes have been validated  
**And** I can see that my validated changes have been successfully saved in the va systems so that all relevant parties can view it

### Error Path Stories

> **In order** to understand why my demographics update failed and what actions I need to take next  
> **As a** Veteran  
> **I want** to be shown clear and easy to understand failure notifications  

**Scenario:** User attempts to submit demographics information without any edits

**Given** I have _fully authenticated_[^1] using my va.gov credentials  
**And** I am looking at my demographics page with Contact, Next-of-kin, and Emergency Contact information  
**And** I have entered into edit mode on the form  
**And** I have not made any changes to my current _demographics data_[^2]  
**When** I submit the form to update and save my information to the VA systems  
**Then** I should be shown a message which requires me to make a change to my information before submitting  
**And** my browser should not initiate a request to any APIs inorder to update my information  
**And** I should continue to remain on the demographics page  

**Scenario:** User attempts to submit blank demographics information

**Given** I have _fully authenticated_[^1] using my va.gov credentials  
**And** I am looking at my demographics page with Contact, Next-of-kin, and Emergency Contact information  
**And** I have entered into edit mode on the form  
**And** I have cleared the form of all or some of my demographics information  
**When** I submit the form to update and save my information to the VA systems  
**Then** I should be shown a message which requires me to enter valid demographics information in all required fields  
**And** my browser should not initiate a request to any APIs inorder to update my information  
**And** I should continue to remain on the demographics page  

**Scenario:** User attempts to submit demographics information after browser session has timed out

**Given** I have _fully authenticated_[^1] using my va.gov credentials  
**And** I am looking at my demographics page with Contact, Next-of-kin, and Emergency Contact information  
**And** I have entered into edit mode on the form  
**And** I have made changes to my current demographics information on the form
**And** I wait on the edit page until my va.gov session times out  
**When** I submit the form to update and save my information to the VA systems  
**Then** I should be shown a message which informs me that my va.gov session has timed out and that I need to re-autheticate fully again before editing
**And** I should continue to remain on the demographics page

**Scenario:** User submits valid demographics information changes and their is an error downstream in the services layer  

**Given** I have _fully authenticated_[^1] using my va.gov credentials  
**And** I am looking at my demographics page with Contact, Next-of-kin, and Emergency Contact information  
**And** I have entered into edit mode on the form  
**And** I have made valid changes to my current demographics information  
**When** I submit the form to update and save my information to the VA systems  
**And** there is an error processing the data downstream or the service is simply unavailable  
**Then** I should be shown a message which apologizes to me and asks me to retry again or see a staff member
**And** I should continue to remain on the demographics page  
**And** the edits I made prior to the error should still be available in the form

### Clever Case Stories

> **In order** to not have a bad user experience when I use the demographics update feature in a way that it's not meant to be  
> **As a** Veteran  
> **I want** the website to catch my actions and show me meaningful messages

**Scenario:** User attempts to submit invalid demographics

**Given** I have _fully authenticated_[^1] using my va.gov credentials  
**And** I am looking at my demographics page with Contact, Next-of-kin, and Emergency Contact information  
**And** I have entered into edit mode on the form  
**And** I have entered meaningless information(random words or strings) into the form
**When** I submit the form to update and save my information to the VA systems  
**Then** the backend services should be smart enough to recognize that something is not right with the submitted information  
**And** I should be shown a message asking me to talk with a staff member first  
**And** I should continue to remain on the demographics page  

**Scenario:** User performs partial edits but does not submit the changes

**Given** I have _fully authenticated_[^1] using my va.gov credentials  
**And** I am looking at my demographics page with Contact, Next-of-kin, and Emergency Contact information  
**And** I have entered into edit mode on the form
**And** I have entered partial updates into the form  
**And** I take no further action  
**And** I return to my demographics page again before my the time of my appointment  
**And** I fully authenticate  
**When** I get redirected to my demographics page  
**Then** I should see my demographics information from when I first got the pre-check-in flow SMS  
**And** I should see that my partial edits to my demographics were not saved  

**Scenario:** Address Validation with Postal Service

Needs to be filled out. There are many use cases in the wireframes, which was copied from the profile team.

## Exploring Workflows

### Use the existing VA.gov Profile exclusively

**This workflow is not being considered at this time**  

- User clicks on SMS for the Pre-Check-In workflow on their mobile device or desktop
- Vets-Website requests pre-stored _demographics data_[^2] for the user from Vets-API
- Vets-API Check-In service requests for the latest user data from the LoROTA service
- Vets-API returns the user data back to the Vets-Website(VA.gov FE)
- User edits ALL of their demographics information in the UI and submits the changes
- Vets-Website POSTs the updated information to a Vets-API endpoint in the Check-In module
- Vets-API then internally leverages the VA.gov Profile interface and directly submits the updated _demographics data_[^2] to the VA.gov Profile
- VA.gov Profile, through it's set of down stream services, updates and saves the user's demographics information in the VA systems
- VA.gov Profile returns a success status and message back to the Vets-API
- Vets-API invokes the data refresh endpoint on the CHIP service
- CHIP service pulls the user's latest demographics information and then updates LoROTA with that data
- CHIP returns a success status and message back to Vets-API
- Vets-API queries LoROTA for the user's latest _demographics data_[^2] with the appropriate UUID
- Vets-API returns a success message as well as the newly updated _demographics data_[^2] back to the Vets-Website
- User is able to view their updated demographics information in the UI on their modbile device or desktop

#### Challenges and Questions

- Currently, we can only submit a veteran's updated _contact_ information to the VA.gov Profile
- We cannot submit a veteran's updated _Next-of-Kin_ or _Emergency Contact_ information to the VA.gov Profile
- VA.gov Profile team has no plans in their roadmap to support showing/updating _Next-of-Kin_ or _Emergency Contact_ information
- How can we get the VA.gov Profile team to support the additional demographics feature requirements?
- Who will be responsibile for initiating this conversation and overseeing this initiative?
- How long will it take for this additional ability to be delivered by the VA.gov Profile team?
- How will this addition affect other teams on va.gov?
- If the VA.gov Profile team decides not to support showing or updating next-of-kin and emergency contact information, do we(Check-In) provide partial functionality for updating only the veterans contact information through them?
- Will the user demographics changes be reflected instantaneously across the relevant VA systems?
  - What all systems are we updating? Are VBA databases impacted too? What does VA.gov Profile integrate with? We need to know, because Veterans want to know what is impacted when making a change within pre-check-in.(We will surface this information in the UI.)

### Use the existing VA Profile service(different from VA.gov Profile) exclusively

- User clicks on SMS for the Pre-Check-In workflow on their mobile device or desktop

- Vets-Website requests pre-stored _demographics data_[^2] for the user from Vets-API
- Vets-API Check-In service requests for the latest user data from the LoROTA service
- Vets-API returns the user data back to the Vets-Website(VA.gov FE)
- User edits ALL of their demographics information in the UI and submits the changes
- Vets-Website POSTs the updated information to a Vets-API endpoint in the Check-In module
- Vets-API uses a new downstream integration with the VA Profile, yet to be established via the CHIP service, to submit the updated _demographics data_[^2] to the VA Profile service
- VA Profile updates and saves the user's demographics information in the VA systems
- VA Profile returns a success status and message back to the CHIP service
- The CHIP service responds back with a success message and status to the Vets-API
- Vets-API invokes the data refresh endpoint on the CHIP service
- CHIP service pulls the user's latest demographics information(updated previously by VA Profile) and then updates LoROTA with that data
- CHIP returns a success status and message back to Vets-API
- Vets-API queries LoROTA for the user's latest _demographics data_[^2] with the appropriate UUID
- Vets-API returns a success message as well as the newly updated _demographics data_[^2] back to the Vets-Website
- User is able to view their updated demographics information in the UI on their modbile device or desktop

#### Challenges and Questions

- Establishing an integration with the VA Profile service from the CHIP service
- Who is responsible for initiating the conversation with the VA Profile team?
- What is the engineering scope for establishing the integration between the CHIP service and the VA Profile service?
- Currently, VA Profile only supports updating a veteran's contact information.
- We cannot submit a veteran's updated _Next-of-Kin_ or _Emergency Contact_ information to the VA Profile service
- Can we get the VA Profile team to support updating _Next-of-Kin_ or _Emergency Contact_ information?
- Who will be responsible for spear heading this initiative?
- How long will it take the VA Profile team to provide this additional functionality if they agree to implement our request?
- How will this affect other teams on va.gov?
- Will the user demographics changes be reflected instantaneously across the relevant VA systems?
  - What all systems are we updating? Are VBA databases impacted too? What does VA Profile integrate with? We need to know, because Veterans want to know what is impacted when making a change within pre-check-in.(We will surface this information in the UI.)

### Build additional systems and services in-order to handle updated demographics information

**This workflow is not being considered at this time**  

- User clicks on SMS for the Pre-Check-In workflow on their mobile device or desktop
- Vets-Website requests pre-stored _demographics data_[^2] for the user from Vets-API
- Vets-API Check-In service requests for the latest user data from the LoROTA service

- User edits ALL of their demographics information in the UI and submits the changes
- Vets-Website POSTs the updated information to a Vets-API endpoint in the Check-In module
- Vets-API submits the updated _demographics data_[^2] to a new service or a set of services
- Proposed new services update the user's demographics information, saving it to the appropriate VA systems
- Proposed service returns a success message and status back to the Vets-API
- Vets-API invokes the data refresh endpoint on the CHIP service
- CHIP service pulls the user's latest demographics information and then updates LoROTA with that data
- CHIP returns a success status and message back to Vets-API

- Vets-API returns a success message as well as the newly updated _demographics data_[^2] back to the Vets-Website
- User is able to view their updated demographics information in the UI on their modbile device or desktop

#### Challenges and Questions

- Who can give our team the authorization to build this new service or services?
- Is it even possible to get the green light to do this from a business/legal/political standpoint?
- Who will be responsible for building these services?
- Will we get additional resources to accomplish this undertaking?
- What will be the responsibilies of this service or set of services?
- Where will these services be hosted?
- What tech stack will the services utilize?
- How long will it take to get these services up and running in all of our environments?
- How will these services ultimately update a veteran's demographics information in the VA systems?
- How long will it take to integrate Vets-API with the new services?
- Can we get another team to do the work on our behalf?
- Will we be duplicating functionality by not going with VA.gov Profile or VA Profile?

## Engineering Proposals

**Recommended Workflow**

### Use the existing VA Profile service exclusively

- User clicks on SMS for the Pre-Check-In workflow on their mobile device or desktop

- Vets-Website requests pre-stored _demographics data_[^2] for the user from Vets-API
- Vets-API Check-In service requests for the latest user data from the LoROTA service
- Vets-API returns the user data back to the Vets-Website(VA.gov FE)
- User edits ALL of their demographics information in the UI and submits the changes
- Vets-Website POSTs the updated information to a Vets-API endpoint in the Check-In module
- Vets-API uses a new downstream integration with the VA Profile, yet to be established via the CHIP service, to submit the updated _demographics data_[^2] to the VA Profile service
- VA Profile updates and saves the user's demographics information in the VA systems
- VA Profile returns a success status and message back to the CHIP service
- The CHIP service responds back with a success message and status to the Vets-API
- Vets-API invokes the data refresh endpoint on the CHIP service
- CHIP service pulls the user's latest demographics information(updated previously by VA Profile) and then updates LoROTA with that data
- CHIP returns a success status and message back to Vets-API
- Vets-API queries LoROTA for the user's latest _demographics data_[^2] with the appropriate UUID
- Vets-API returns a success message as well as the newly updated _demographics data_[^2] back to the Vets-Website
- User is able to view their updated demographics information in the UI on their modbile device or desktop

## Engineering Questions

- **What all systems are we updating? Are VBA databases impacted too? What does VA Profile integrate with? We need to know, because Veterans want to know what is impacted when making a change within pre-check-in.(We will surface this information in the UI.)**  
- Can we programatically access a user's last name and SSN, necessary for performing minimal auth against LoROTA, after the user has fully authenticated on va.gov?
- Where does user demographics information(contact, next-of-kin, emergency-contact) belonging to a veteran live?
  - The VA Profile team is responsible for the veterans contact information.
  - The VA Profile team will be responsible for the next-of-kin and emergency-contact data belonging to veterans(once the team has agreed to support these)
  - We're not certain at this point about what databases or systems house the veterans _demographics data_[^2]
- Where can we find the contact information for the VA Profile team?
  - Corey to find out
- Who is responsible for initiating the conversation with the VA Profile team?
  - Stephen Barrs will serve as a potential point of contact while we explore the integration
  - Product to Product communication to be established
- How can we validate an address which a veteran might update or enter from the UI?
  - VA Profile API provides its clients an address validation endpoint which we can use to make sure that the provided address is valid
  - Do we need to validate next of kin and emergency contact addresses in addition to Veteran addresses?
- Can we get the VA Profile team to support updating _Next-of-Kin_ or _Emergency Contact_ information and who will be responsible for spear heading this initiative?
  - Discussion held on 2/4/22 with VA Profile, _Next-of-Kin_ is housed in the _Associated Party_ payload and is already supported. Need to verify data structure.
  - _Emergency Contact_ still to be determined.
- How long will it take the VA Profile team to provide this additional functionality if they agree to implement our request?
  - Pending
- How will this affect other teams on va.gov? Will this have a negative effect on the VA.gov Profile system?
- Will the user demographics edits/changes be reflected instantaneously across the relevant VA systems?
  - What all systems are we updating? Are VBA databases impacted too? What does the system we are integrating with integrate with? We need to know, because Veterans want to know what is impacted when making a change within pre-check-in.(We will surface this information in the UI.)
- Will it be confusing for the user to navigate to their profile page after editing their next-of-kin or emergency-contact information and not see that information populated in the profile?
- Does VA Profile have the ability to update the timestamp on file 41.41 if the veteran confirms that none of their demographics information has changed using their mobile device or desktop computer?
- What happens when a veteran updates their contact information from the VA.gov Profile today? Are the staff members able to view that information immediately through the VSE application? If so, was the timestamp on file 41.41 updated? Is the update associated with an external system?
- Can we still provide this(demographics edit) functionality to the veteran through the Pre-Check-In flow if our ability to update file 41.41 is denied?

## Staff Facing Questions

- VSE Clinical Staff will need access to the veterans updated _demographics data_[^2]. What additional work(integrations/endpoint-support/components/lambdas) will CHIP need to provide in-order to facilitate this access for VSE?
- When a staff member confirms a veterans information on site, the timestamp on file 41.41 is updated and the staff members ID is associated with the file and the updated timestamp. This action that a staff member takes on multiple occasions with several veterans on site is taken into consideration when the staff members receives a performance evaluation. Will an external system(the pre-check-in flow) performing the same job as a staff member cause an issue?
- Will an external system(VA Profile for instance) be given permission to update file 41.41 without confirmation by a staff member?

## UX Questions

- Do we need address validation on emergency contact and next of kin?
- Do we need error message wording if the Veterans hits "update" and the information isn't immediately seen on the review pages? Check with the profile team on how they handle this and if they have any wording already created.
- Look into the zip code component. How does it handle the zip 4? There is a backlog ticket in platform to improve it. Do we need to do the work ourselves?
- Should we reuse any of this information from VA.gov profile? [Test cases](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/contact-information/address-validation/qa-508/test-cases.md) and [Error messages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/contact-information/address-validation/error%20messages/ErrorCodesForOverride_withExamples.xlsx)

## Goals and milestones

## Prioritization

## Timeline

## Applications and Services

### Vets Website

- This is the application that powers the main va.gov website.  
- Day of Check-In: This application is for veterans to check into their health appointments on the day of care.
- Pre-Check-In: This application is going to be filled out by veterans days before the appointment. The veteran will be able to confirm various aspects of their appointment and information.
- Built with reactJS
- Uses Vets-API as the main backend API and service bus
- [Day of Check-In Readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/tree/master/src/applications/check-in/day-of#readme)  
- [Pre-Check-In Readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/tree/master/src/applications/check-in/pre-check-in#readme)  

### Vets-API

- This project provides common APIs for applications that live on VA.gov (formerly vets.gov APIs)
- The Check-In module engine inside the Vets-API acts as general purpose service and as a service bus to the LoROTA service and the CHIP API.

### VA Profile

- This is a backend system that was formerly known as Vet360.

- It came about in 2018 to act as a connector between a bunch of VA backends and frontends, so that veterans could update their info in one place and it would save everywhere (or almost everywhere).
- The VA Profile team is not part of the OCTO/DEPO contracts. They are an entirely separate team that we work with, and they work with a lot of other teams.
