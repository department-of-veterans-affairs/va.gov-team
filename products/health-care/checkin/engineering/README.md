# Check In Experience Architecture

## What is Check In Experience (CIE)?

Check In Experience is a VA.gov product that will allow a Veteran with an appointment to check in for that appointment on the va.gov website using a mobile device. The Check In Integration Platform (CHIP) integration layer also supports functionality required by two staff facing applications.

## Check In Experience System Architecture:

Check In Experience consists of muliple code bases deployed to two different AWS environments. vets-website and vets-api are deployed to the `dsvagovcloud` AWS account and CHIP, LoROTA and clinician-workflow are deployed to the `vaec-cms` AWS account.  CIE also makes calls to Twilio for SMS support and to VA On-Prem services to access VistA data.
