# BTSSS VA Notify SMS Content

**Note:** The Draft document is where we work locally (in the cloud), prior to sending to VA Notify for implementation. VA Notify then manages their own source of truth, which is the VA Notify Document. In order to expedite processes, we are allowed to also suggest our edits to the VA Notify Document, to help the VA Notify Team with their implementation. 

Documents are hosted in SharePoint because OCTO, IVC, VEText often have collaborators in these documents. 

Contacts at VA Notify are Melanie Jones (accessible in Slack via #va-notify-public channel) and Beverly Nelson (although, Beverly might be leaving per their Slack status).
