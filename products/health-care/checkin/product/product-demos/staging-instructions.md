# Instructions for Accessing Patient Check-in in the Staging Environment

You will need to create 2 appointments in VistA's Staging environment in order to test the Pre-Check-in and Mobile Check-in applications.
- One appointment should be within a half hour of the current date & time (ET) so that you can test the Mobile Check-in 
- One appointment should be after today so that you can test Pre-Check-in

There is a VistA Staging tool available that makes creating VistA appointments in staging easy. **Note that this tool is only available to VA users with a GitHub account.**
