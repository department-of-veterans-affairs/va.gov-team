# Instructions for Accessing Patient Check-in in the Staging Environment

You will need to create 2 appointments in VistA's Staging environment in order to test the Pre-Check-in and Mobile Check-in applications.
- One appointment should be within a half hour of the current date & time (ET) so that you can test the Mobile Check-in 
- One appointment should be after today so that you can test Pre-Check-in

There is a VistA Staging tool available that makes creating VistA appointments in staging easy. **Note that this tool is only available to VA users with a GitHub account.**

## Authentication
- The eCheck-in and Pre-Check-in applications are un-authenticated. The URL is unique per appointment as it contains a token parameter that is a UUID and is generated for each appointment
    - UUIDs are constructed in a sequence of digits equal to 128 bits. The ID is in hexadecimal digits, meaning it uses the numbers 0 through 9 and letters A through F. The hexadecimal digits are grouped as 32 hexadecimal characters with four hyphens: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX.
