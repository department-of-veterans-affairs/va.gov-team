# Responding to Application Issues

## Process for Veterans to Report an Application Issue
- Veteran contacts the VA help desk when they have an issue with the eCheck-in, Pre-Check-in, or stand-alone Travel applications
- Help desk uses the appropriate application's SNOW Knoweldge Article to determine how to escalate incident tickets

## Process for VA Employees (e.g. engineers, training, OCTO) to Report an Application Issue
From time-to-time we are alerted internally to application issues that may or may not be causing a system down.

### System Down Issues
- VA Employee (or on-call Production Support engineer) reports a system down issue in [Slack channel 'check-in-production-support'](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C02UP02HHGX)  
- CIE On-call Production Support engineer sees the issue and investigates per the [PCI API Tier 3 Production Support Team On-Call Monitoring Playbook](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/checkin-devops/blob/master/docs/PCI%20API%20Tier%203%20Team%20Playbook.md)
