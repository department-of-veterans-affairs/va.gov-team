## Overview
This product reimagines the process by which Veterans check-in for a medical appointment by allowing them to perform pre-check-in and check-in from their mobile device.

#### Undesired

## Solution Approach

### Key Decisions
- All data for the product will be available via a single API (vets-api)
- Work to aggregate data from disparate systems will be completed by the CHIP team
- VetText has existing functionality that will be leveraged - at this time the technical integration is the biggest unknown and risk. The risk will decrease as Vets API migration gets underway.
- Full authentication is necessary in order to allow Veterans to update their personal contact, emergency contact, and/or next-of-kin contact information.
