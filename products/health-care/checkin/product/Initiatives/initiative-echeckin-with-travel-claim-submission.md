# Initiative Brief - eCheck-in with Travel Claim Submission

## Overview
In June 2022, the Beneficiary Travel Reimbursement Path Analysis Team completed a review of the VA general health care travel reimbursement program, which included recommendations on improvements the Veteran experience. One of those recommendations was to integrate travel reimbursement into the patient check-in ecosystem. The Modernized Check-in team conducted a Veteran research study to ask the following questions:

- Do Veterans prefer to be asked if theyʼre interested in filing for travel reimbursement as a precursor to reviewing and confirming their eligibility within PCI?
- Is it confusing to check in for an appointment and submit a travel reimbursement claim at the same time?
- Does knowing that VA checks travel reimbursement and claim eligibility after a claim has been submitted deter Veterans from filing a travel reimbursement claim?
- What is the cognitive load required for Veterans when they review and confirm their travel reimbursement claim eligibility?
- How well or not so well do Veterans understand the status of their submitted claim or how to file a claim later on the PCI applicationʼs confirmation page? 

Findings from the research study led then team to design a workflow where a Veteran, when using eCheck-in to check-in for an in-person VA health appointment, and after confirming their personal, emergency, and next-of-kin contact information, will be asked if they would like to file a Travel Reimbursement claim. If they choose to file, the Veteran will be asked if they meet the criteria necessary to file a claim through eCheck-in:
 - Question 1: Did you travel in your own vehicle?
 - Question 2: Did you travel from your home address?
 - Question 3: Are you claiming only mileage for your trip?

If all criteria is met, a claim will be submitted to the BTSSS API when the Veteran completes the check-in process for their appointment.
 
## Outcome Summary
Veterans will have an easy way to submit a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim.
