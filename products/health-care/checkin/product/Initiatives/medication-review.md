# Initiative Brief - How to Prepare for Your Appointment

## Overview
 
## Outcome Summary
The VA wants Veterans to come prepared to their health appointments. This includes brining their insurance card, their list of medications and supplements, and any other information that will help their provider have all the information they need to supply the Veteran with the best medical care possible.

## Problem
Medical providers at the VA often do not have all of the information they need from Veterans that could help inform the course of treatment.

## Desired Outcomes
Veterans show up for their health appointments with all of the information their provider needs to inform their course of treatment.

## Undesired Outcomes
Providers do not have all of the information they need from Veterans to inform their course of treatment.

## Launch Planning

## Feature Description
A link to a dedicated page that provides information to help Veterans prepare for their VA health appointment will appear on the appointment details page and on the Pre-Check-in completion page.
