# Initiative Brief - Check in with MSAs after eCheck-in
## Overview

For decades, when a patient was checked in, clinical staff rightfully assumed that a patient has arrived, checked in with MSAs, and is now sitting in the clinic waiting room ready to be called back for their appointment.  

With the introduction of eCheck-in in early 2022, Veterans could check in remotely from their smartphones, initially, 15 minutes before their appointment, which has since increased to 45 minutes since, 1) Veterans are often told by clinical staff and MSAs to arrive early for their appointment, and 2) cellular signal can often be problematic once inside VA facilities. 

Completing eCheck-in shows the patient as checked in within VistA and VSE-CS, but Veterans do not have to be physically in the clinic waiting room at the time they complete eCheck-in. 

With the introduction of eCheck-in, these additions to the check in process has caused clinical staff to lose patients, patients going to the wrong floor/clinic, miss appointments, wait longer than anticipated if eCheck-in wasn't completed, etc.

**Is there value in patients using eCheck-in to complete pre-registration (and having the option to file a travel reimbursement claim) and have their check in status updated in VistA (knowing that MSAs find eCheck-in helpful to speed up lines in the clinic waiting rooms), but require Veterans to "check in" with an MSA to resolve these known concerns?**

Would this resolve the identified concerns or add burdens we haven't considered for the Veteran, clinical staff, or MSAs?

Further complicating these issues, clinics aren't required to use PCI and VSE-CS (PCI-CSV). And, not all clinical staff and MSAs are trained on how PCI and VSE-CS work. 

## Problem
- **What is the problem and who is affected?**
  - Veterans using PCI, specifically eCheck-in, without VHA mandating clinical staff and MSAs to use VSE-GUI and VSE-CS to review a patient's check in status and understand that although checked in, they might not be in the clinic, has caused clinical staff to lose patients, patients going to the wrong floor/clinic, miss appointments, wait longer than anticipated if eCheck-in wasn't completed, etc.
  - Veterans using eCheck-in at clinics who's clinical staff and MSAs aren't using VSE-GUI and VSE-CS to monitor patient check ins are frustrated that VA's digital services aren't working as expected, causing mistrust, missed appointments, wait longer than anticipated to see their provider, etc.
- **Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?**
  - Clinical staff and MSA's don't understand PCI and/or know how to use VSE-GUI and VSE-CS to review a patient's check in status and understand that although checked in, they might not be in the clinic waiting room
  - Clinics aren't mandated to use PCI by VHA
  - No consistently governed patient friendly data source for clinic name and physical location across VistA instances and VISNs to provide to Veterans
- **How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?**
  - Veterans can manage their health services online
  - Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

## Evidence of the Problem

#### Complaints from facilities 

- The Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) department received ~80-90 complaints about eCheck-in from facilities in early 2024.

#### Complaints from Veterans 

- Out of ~574 responses in early 2024, there were 44 complaints from Veterans specifically about either, 1) clinic staff ignoring eCheck-ins, or 2) not enough information in appointment reminders and eCheck-in for them to find the clinic for their appointment(s).

## Initiative Research Questions to Answer

#### Staff-facing 

- What's the impact on MSAs workload if Veterans who completed eCheck-in had to still check in with an MSA (or clinician) to complete the process?
- Would MSAs recheck health insurance and demographics of Veterans checking in even if those flags were set to completed during a eCheck-in? If so, why? 
- What's the impact on clinical staff operations (e.g., see more or less patients on time, see more or less patients per day, etc.) if Veterans who completed eCheck-in had to still check in with an MSA (or clinician) to complete the process?
- What's the impact on the line in the waiting room of patients checking in? E.g., longer or shorter lines? 
- Has the number of Veterans missing appointments or checking in late increased or decreased?  

#### Veteran-facing

- What's the impact on Veterans' perceived value of eCheck-in if they had to still check in with an MSA (or clinician) after completing eCheck-in?
- Would Veterans use eCheck-in again knowing that they'd be required to check in with an MSA after completing eCheck-in?

### Desired Veteran Outcomes

- Increase trust in VA (and PCI) due in part to fewer canceled or missed appointments, or waiting in the clinic waiting room without a MSA or clinician acknowledging them before or at their scheduled appointment time.
- Increase trust in VA digital services, with an emphasis on eCheck-in. 

### Undesired Veteran Outcomes

- Decrease in eCheck-in volume.
- Increase in frustration towards VA due to perceived lower value of VA digital services, specifically eCheck-in. 
- Increase in frustration towards VA due to longer wait lines to check in at clinics.
- Increase in frustration towards VA due to completing pre-registration twice; in eCheck-in, and then with a MSA or clinician 

### Desired Business Outcomes

- Decrease in MSA workload, e.g., less time spent with each Veteran during check in at the clinic, using fewer applications on their computers, fewer occasions attempting to locate a Veteran who has completed eCheck-in, but is not in the clinic waiting room, etc.
- Decrease in canceled or missed appointments from those with eCheck-in completed.
- Decrease in number of occasions MSAs or clinicians spend time locating a Veteran who has completed eCheck-in, but is not in the clinic waiting room. 
- Decrease in complaints about PCI to IVC from facilities.
- Increase in employee satisfaction. 
- Increase in perception of PCI.
- Increase in usage of PCI, e.g., PCI being enabled at more clinics. 
- Increase in usage of VSE-CS by clinical staff.
- Increase in clinical staff operations, e.g., see more patients on time, see more patients per day, fewer canceled or missed appointments, less time attempting to locate a Veteran who has completed eCheck-in, but is not in the clinic waiting room, etc.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- Increase in MSA workload, specifically time spent checking in patients.
- Increase in long wait lines to check Veterans in at clinics.
- Decrease in MSA and clinician use of VSE-GUI and/or VSE-CS to, 1) check if patients have completed eCheck-in and, 2) confirm their health insurance and demographics don't need to be rechecked at the clinic.
- Decrease in perceived value of PCI and VSE-GUI and/or VSE-CS to manage patient encounters at clinics.
- Decrease in Veteran usage of VA digital services, specifically PCI.
- Decrease in digital application submissions, specifically beneficiary travel reimbursement through PCI.
- Decrease in Veteran satisfaction with VA digital services, i.e., value of tool and/or frustration as a result of constant changes or removal of effective digital tools.

### What're you building
[//]: # (*What's in scope for you to build with this initiative? Describe key features/flows.*)
[//]: # (*What have you explicitly decided to **not** include and why?*)
[//]: # (*How does this solution address your Assumptions & Risks?*)

- A feature of the eCheck-in application that will be tested and researched at an initial small scale with the possibility of national expansion.
- eCheck-in will include a maximum of 5 steps for Veterans to complete, which are variable based on the status of their demographics flag in VistA and Insurance Capture Buffer (ICB). The 5 steps include health insurance check (that happens as a background process prior to authenticating in to eCheck-in), demographics check, option for filing a travel reimbursement claim, online check in, and going to a clinic MSA or clinician to check in face-to-face. (However, we won't be able to track and measure the 5th step.) 
- If a Veteran does complete online check in within eCheck-in, E-CHECK-IN status will still be set to COMPLETE in VSE-GUI and VSE-CS. (No change from existing functionality in PCI.)
- The biggest Veteran-facing and process change for this initiative is telling the Veteran to check in with staff at the clinic to complete the appointment check in process. (For example, there might be less of an emphasis on asking "Have you arrived at the facility?" compared to telling Veterans to "Go to %CLINIC_NAME% at %PHYSICAL_LOCATION% and check in with an MSA to let them know you've arrived.")

#### What's not changing 

- 45 minute appointment reminder eCheck-in text sent from VeText. 

#### Future iteration 

- Add, and, send a text notification (from VeText) to Veterans asking them to check in with an MSA at the clinic if it's past their scheduled appointment time, completed eCheck-in, but no patient status in VSE-CS has been updated for X number of minutes. (Which would be a rule that clinical staff would need to advise on.)
- Integration between eCheck-in and VA Backend Systems to enable clinics, 3-digit stations, 5-digit stations, or VISNs to toggle new feature on or off in VistA or VSE-CS.
  
### Risks

- Decrease in Veteran usage of VA digital services, specifically PCI.
- Decrease in Veteran satisfaction with VA digital services, i.e., value of eCheck-in and/or frustration as a result of constant changes that lower its value to Veterans.
- Increase in wait time for Veterans to check in at clinics. And, average amount of time it takes to check Veterans in, including eCheck-in and in person check in. 
- Decrease in ease of access to checking in for an appointment and inclusivity, e.g., Veterans with mobility or vision challenges don't want to wait in line.
- Negative impact on satisfaction for Veterans and staff at operationally high-performing clinics. 

### Go-to-market strategy 
[//]: # (*What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful? Which groups/orgs are necessary to make this happen?*)

- To gauge impact on the spectrum of PCI usage across clinics, pilot this feature at 1 CBOC that has reported complaints about PCI to IVC and 1 CBOC that has a higher utilization rate of PCI than other sites.
- Required training for administrative and clinical staff on changes to PCI and their impact on clinic operations.
- Researchers from PCI Veteran-facing Team and SPL Team to visit CBOCs for in-person UAT with Veterans and semi-structured interviews with MSAs, clinic managers, clinicians using VSE-CS, and/or facility managers. Conduct in-person research during the start of the pilot in order to capture feedback during first encounters of this new step. I.e., otherwise, waiting too long could impact usage of PCI, which we want to avoid until we've collected enough feedback to understand its impact.
