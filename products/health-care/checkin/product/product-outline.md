## Hypothesis & assumptions
The VA kiosks are a familiar, simple experience for Veterans. Experience with the other methods will vary.
Authentication could be a pain point for Veterans within the new check-in workflow due to how they currently authenticate when using a kiosk.
The kiosks are not accessible for Veterans, who are non-sighted.

#### Value Propositions


## Assumptions and Risks

- Administrative Software the registration clerks use today will not be availalbe any longer and a replacement is not identified.  This will impact the checkin process as there is no system to talk to as of now for the status to be sent.  In addition to all technical requirements the workflow or system will have
- Workflow will be in new Mobile Framework app and on VA.gov so tech feasability for transitioning questionnaires into the check flow potentially needed.
- Authentication for Veterans today via kiosk and reception desk is their insurance card scanned and if no insurance card they enter their SSN.  Will need to figure ou the identity/authentication requireents as neither of these are used or can be used on va.gov. ie. SSN
- e-Signatures of consent forms with handwritting requirements are unknown.
- Checkin workflow will be launced from VAOS appointment on VA.gov

## Solution Approach

- _What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?_
- _Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?_
- _What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?_
- _How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?_
- _ROI_
