# Research plan - Unmoderated Content Evaluation for Multiple Facilities Selection in BT Oracle Health App

## Background
Veterans who have medical appointments at VA health facilities that use Oracle Health EHR software (formerly Cerner) have a need to be able to easily file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim online on the day of their appointment.

The greatest value right now for this consortium of Veterans, based on the success of filing a mileage-only claim in eCheck-in at VistA-based VA health facilities, is to allow Veterans to initiate a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim through text and using Low Risk One Time Authentication (LoROTA) to streamline the authentication process for Veterans.

This online travel reimbursement feature for smartphones will be piloted at a VA health facility that’s use of Oracle Health is mature. E.g., Portland or Columbus. We will be collaborating with Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) on selecting a pilot facility and scheduling an in-person research visit later in the year.

### OCTO Priorities
The online mileage-only travel reimbursement feature for smartphones aligns with the following OCTO-DE Priorities: 
- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits. 

### Veteran Journey
This research corresponds to the following points of the Veteran journey:
- Taking care of myself

## Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to **get feedback from Veterans on how easy it is to understand the instructions on the multiple facilities selection page of the text “travel” to 54804 tool for Oracle Health facilities** and evaluate if the page clearly conveys how Veterans can use this tool to file travel reimbursement claims for their appointments. 

### Outcome
This study will give us insight into whether or not we need to make content changes in order to help Veterans better understand how to file their mileage-only travel reimbursement claims using this online tool. 

### Research Questions
1. Do Veterans understand that this tool can be used for mileage-only travel reimbursement claims and that they need to use the BTSSS portal to file claims with receipts?
2. Do Veterans understand how many/which claims they are filing when selecting facilities? 
3. Do Veterans understand how to file a claim for any of the facilities NOT selected on the facility selection page?

### Hypothesis
1. Do Veterans understand that this tool can be used for mileage-only travel reimbursement, and that they need to use the BTSSS portal to file with receipts?
     - LIKELY TRUE
3. Do Veterans understand how many/which claims they are filing when selecting facilities?
     - LIKELY TRUE
3. Do Veterans understand how to file for the facilities NOT selected?
     - MAYBE FALSE

## Methodology
This research will be conducted as an unmoderated study using Optimal Workshop.

### Location
The tests will be conducted online at the participant’s leisure.
