## Recommendations
The content results of this study were not directly applied to our application due to a change in the business rules around which and how many appointments can be filed each day. However, we were able to use this feedback towards a different version of this page, in which Veterans choose between two appointments at the same facility. 

- Ensure clear information is included for which appointments you can file a claim for using this tool vs. BTSSS.
