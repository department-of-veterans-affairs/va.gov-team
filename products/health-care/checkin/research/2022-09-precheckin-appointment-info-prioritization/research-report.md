# Research Goals

The Modernized Check-In Team is reimaging the experience between a Veteran scheduling a medical appointment and having their appointment. In particular, the Modernized Check-In Team has created the portion of the ecosystem that enables Veterans to utilize their smartphone to “check in” to their appointments through VA.gov, which lets the VA know the patient has arrived for their appointment.

Check-in has expanded our access to more appointment data, which we can display to Veterans within the pre-check-in experience. The list of all appointment data that we can display includes:
- Recently added
  - provider's name 
  - type of care 
  - location (floor and room numbers)
  - modality (in-person, telephone, etc)
- Added awhile ago
  - clinic name
  - facility name
  - date
  - time (timezone - recently added) 
  - clinic phone number
  - facility phone number and TTY
- Could add
  - weekday
  - address
  - instructions on how to attend video or telephone appointments
  - reason for visit
  - facility directions (map link)
  - cancel status
  - patient name

The goal for this study is to identify what appointment data is most important within certain portions of the pre-check-in experience.

The mobile app and VAOS teams have looked into similar topics. Once our pre-check-in appointment information survey is complete, we will compare all of the studies to determine where we can align with the other products and where we need to differ due to unique pre-check-in needs.

# Research Questions
- What appointment information is important to review when confirming and answering questions for your VA appointment (AKA pre-check-in)?

# Methodology 

We conducted two unmoderated studies: one focusing on pre-check-in and one focusing on check-in.  Veterans were invited by Perigean via email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants received a link to an online survey that contains a scenario (pre-check-in or check-in) in which the participant will prioritize appointment data. The online survey will be built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions.

We wanted to get complete survey responses from at least 30 Veterans and others (ideally 40-50) for each study, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA).

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

- Veterans and caregivers will generally agree on which data is most important when confirming and answering questions for your VA appointment (AKA pre-check-in).
  - TRUE: They were able to rank the appointment data.

# Key Findings

## Check-in
- Over 80% of participants deemed a clear set of appointment information as “extremely important” or “very important.”
  - Type of care (Cardiology, primary care, etc.)
  - Appointment time and timezone
  - Canceled status
  - Date of the appointment (Sept. 30, Feb. 3)
  - Location (Floor and room number)
  - Patient's name
  - Visit type (In-person, telephone, video, etc.)
  - Day of appointment (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
  - Provider's name
- A secondary group of appointment information received over 50% of participants stating they are “extremely important” or “very important.”
  - Clinic name
  - Clinic phone number
  - Facility phone number
  - Reason for visit (Follow-up, physical, etc.)
  - Conditions and symptoms you’re experiencing
- Facility-based information is the lowest ranking grouping of information.
- The caregiver cohort ranked the most pieces of information differently compared to the other cohorts.
  - “Conditions and symptoms you're experiencing” and “Reason for visit (Follow-up, physical, etc.)” were ranked much higher than the other cohorts. 
  - “Day of appointment (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)” was ranked much lower.

## Pre-check-in
- When analyzing the “extremely important” or “very important”appointment information for pre-check-in, there weren’t clear groupings like with check-in.
- Most facility information (except address) and condition-based information ranked lower than other appointment information.
- The cohorts varied in their pre-check-in importance ranking more than check-in.

## Pre-check-in compared to check-in
- A lot of the top ranked appointment information is similar across the pre-check-in and check-in scenarios.
  - Appointment time and timezone
  - Canceled status
  - Date of the appointment (Sept. 30, Feb. 3)
  - Day of appointment (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
  - Location (Floor and room number)
  - Type of care (Cardiology, primary care, etc.)
  - Visit type (In-person, telephone, video, etc.)

# Details of Findings 

## Check-in
**Question asked:** Pretend that you are checking in on the day of your VA medical appointment using your smartphone. How important is each of the following to you to see when letting VA know you have arrived for your appointment? The information should help you feel good that you checked into the correct appointment and know what to do next.

### Over 80% of participants deemed a clear set of appointment information as “extremely important” or “very important.”

### The caregiver cohort ranked the most pieces of information differently compared to the other cohorts.
The data points that specific cohorts ranked very differently than other cohorts are outlined in red.

## Pre-check-in
**Question asked:** Pretend it is 3 days before your upcoming appointment and VA has texted you a link to confirm your appointment. When you click the link, VA is asking you to confirm your information prior to your appointment, such as reviewing your contact information or medication list. How important is each of the following to you to see when confirming and answering questions for your VA appointment? The information should help you feel good about confirming your appointment and knowing what to do on the day of your appointment.

### When analyzing the “extremely important” or “very important”appointment information for pre-check-in, there weren’t clear groupings like with check-in.
<img width="993" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 11 11 39 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66287082/196588735-68a0a1cd-4692-4111-9646-1edcb55fb927.png">
- There is a gradual decrease in the percentages, but the percentage don’t have a large gap or jump causing clear groupings like check-in.

### Most facility information (except address) and condition-based information ranked lower than other appointment information.
<img width="997" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 11 11 53 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66287082/196588786-3869b8fc-f813-4ca8-9134-aff7439eff64.png">

### The cohorts varied in their pre-check-in importance ranking more than check-in.

- Similar to check-in, caregivers had more deviation in their importance rankings compared to other cohorts.

## Pre-check-in compared to check-in

### A lot of the top ranked appointment information is similar across the pre-check-in and check-in scenarios.
Top ranked = over 80% of participants deemed it “extremely important” or “very important”

- Ranked highly for both
  - Appointment time and timezone
  - Canceled status
  - Date of the appointment (Sept. 30, Feb. 3)
  - Day of appointment (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
  - Location (Floor and room number)
  - Type of care (Cardiology, primary care, etc.)
  - Visit type (In-person, telephone, video, etc.)
- Ranked differently
  - Facility address (High for pre-check-in only)
  - Patient's name (High for check-in only)
  - Provider's name (High for check-in only)

# Recommendations
- Emphasize the top ranked group visually within any redesigns of check-in and pre-check-in.
  - Appointment time and timezone
  - Canceled status
  - Date of the appointment (Sept. 30, Feb. 3)
  - Day of appointment (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
  - Location (Floor and room number)
  - Type of care (Cardiology, primary care, etc.)
  - Visit type (In-person, telephone, video, etc.)
- Within check-in, explore creating a summary page with only the information in Recommendation #1 as well as a details page with all of the appointment information.
  - Focusing on the most valuable information that enables a Veteran to determine what appointment to check into on a summary page follows the previously proven mental model:
    - Check-in is a time-sensitive experience, where Veterans try to make decisions quickly.
- Since the pre-check-in rankings was more split, emphasize visually the data in Recommendation #1, but all available appointment data should be displayed somewhere within the pre-check-in experience, such as the confirmation page.
- This study showed that caregivers want to view different appointment data compared to Veterans. In previous studies, we observed caregivers checking in for Veterans, but we aren’t 100% sure how big our caregiver audience is. The team should meet to discuss how to address the caregiver persona.
- Veterans placed more importance on the clinic name compared to facility, but the data within the clinic name field is often not understandable by Veterans. In the future, explore updating the clinic names to something more Veteran-friendly.
