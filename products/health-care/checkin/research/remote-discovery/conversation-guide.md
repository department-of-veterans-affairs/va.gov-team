## Project-specific setup and introduction (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kristen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to discuss the process of checking into an appointment.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- The timing of this session may vary a little bit based upon your different experiences with check-in, but **this entire session will take no longer than an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Recording Instructions**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording to the cloud.
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?”

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions/General Check-in Questions - (10 minutes)
To get started, I’d like to get a little background information about you.
- How many in-person appointments have you had since the beginning of the pandemic/COVID-19?

Now, I’m going to ask you to think about your very last medical appointment that you actually went to the VA facility for.

- How did you schedule your last in-person medical appointment? Did you go online, talk to someone in-person at the VA, call, etc?
  - Is that how you typically schedule in-person appointments?
  - Has your method for scheduling changed since COVID began?
- How do you keep track of your upcoming appointments?
- How did you check-in for your appointment?
  - Overall, how would you describe that check-in experience? Was it a good or bad experience? Easy or hard?
    - What did you like about it?
    - What did you not like about it?
  - How has checking in for an appointment changed with COVID-19?
    - Did you have to complete a form before entering the facility? If yes, probe on if it was something completed in advance/on their mobile device/paper/something else.
- After you checked-in, how did you know where to go next? Where were you directed to go (directly to the doctor’s office area, a central waiting room, or somewhere else)?
- Which check-in method do you use most often? This could be using the kiosk, talking directly with VA staff, using text messaging , or how your access virtual appointments. (Note for researcher: there is the “I am here” system as well as a separate solution only available in South Carolina)
