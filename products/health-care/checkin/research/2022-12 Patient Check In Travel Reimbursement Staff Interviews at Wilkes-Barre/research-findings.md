## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans on the new travel reimbursement feature in eCheck-in on ease of use and what, if any, expectations were unmet, specifically around travel reimbursement tasks.

### Research Questions

### MSAs

#### Primary Questions
1. What feedback have Veterans had on how easy or difficult it is to file a travel reimbursement claim during check in?
2. What type of questions have you received from Veterans about travel reimbursement within eCheck-in?
3. How has the addition of travel reimbursement within eCheck-in impacted your work?
4. What would you change or add, if anything, to improve the process for Veterans filing a travel reimbursement claim during check in?
5. Would it be helpful to Veterans if MSAs could file a travel reimbursement claim for them during check in within VistA Scheduling Enhancements (VSE)?
6. How would adding travel reimbursement into VSE impact your work?

#### Secondary Questions
7. What’s been the most confusing or difficult part about the mobile check in process (including pre-check-in) for Veterans?
8. What do you think Veterans would change or add, if anything, to make the mobile check in process easier?
9. Would Veterans be more likely to complete mobile check in by responding to 1 or 2 text messages versus the current experience?

### Travel Office Staff
1. How, if at all, has the addition of travel reimbursement within eCheck-in impacted your, or your staff’s, work?
2. Has there been any increase or change in the amount of claims received with issues? E.g., doesn’t meet specific eligibility requirements, increase in denied claims, missing information, etc.
3. What would you change or do differently, if anything, to increase the number of correct or complete claims received from eCheck-in?
4. What would you change or add, if anything, to improve the process for Veterans filing a travel reimbursement claim during check in?
5. What upcoming changes or initiatives, if any, should the Patient Check-In Team be aware of to the travel reimbursement program that might impact the travel reimbursement feature within eCheck-in? E.g., changes to travel office staffing, changes to the business rules, changes to the Beneficiary Travel Self-service System (BTSSS), etc.

<br>

## Methodology
This research was conducted as Veteran intercepts during the check in process at Allentown CBOC and Wilkes-Barre VAMC, two Wilkes-Barre Health Care System clinics that have eCheck-in enabled.

We worked with Wilkes-Barre Health Care System Health Administration Services (HAS) staff to determine the best approach for Veteran intercepts.

We completed the following in-person research to evaluate Veteran and staff experiences and feedback:
- Combined Veteran-facing and staff-facing research
- Interviews with clinic staff and travel office staff
- Veteran intercepts with MSA/staff assistance - worked with Wilkes-Barre Health Care System Health Administration Services (HAS) staff to determine the best approach for Veteran intercepts
  - Assisted and observed as they went through eCheck-in
  - Asked questions about the process


<br>

## Hypothesis and Conclusions

### MSAs
#### Primary
1. Veterans will think filing a travel reimbursement claim during check in is easy, but those that aren’t eligible may think it’s neither easy nor difficult.
    - LIKELY TRUE
2. Some Veterans will have questions about why their travel reimbursement claim couldn’t be filed, while others will have suggestions for supporting other travel types and other travel reimbursement tasks. E.g., edit the address, upload receipts, file later, file for other appointments, etc.
    - LIKELY TRUE
4. Staff will receive an inconsequential amount of questions related to travel reimbursement, but it will not impact their work as they’re trained to direct those questions to the travel office or provide instructions on how to file a claim online.
    - LIKELY FALSE 
6. Staff will recommend support for filing a claim up to 30 days after an appointment.
    - NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION
8. Staff will think it would be incredibly beneficial for them to file a travel reimbursement claim for Veterans within VSE, however worry that it will negatively impact the Veteran experience at the clinic. E.g., longer lines of Veterans waiting to be checked in.
    - LIKELY FALSE
10. Staff will think that adding more functionality into VSE will increase the average time spent checking in a Veteran.
    - NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION

#### Secondary
7. Staff will think that Veterans don’t understand eCheck-In and think it’s too complicated.
    - LIKELY TRUE
9. Staff will indicate that Veterans would recommend removing the scanning the QR code and texting VA step of the PCI workflow.
    - LIKELY TRUE
10. Staff will think that Veterans would prefer responding to 1 or 2 text messages to check in for their appointments.
    - DEFINITELY TRUE

### Travel Office Staff
1. Staff will indicate that the addition of travel reimbursement within eCheck-in has not impacted their work.
    - DEFINITELY TRUE
3. Staff will indicate that there has been no change in the amount of claims received with issues since travel reimbursement was added within eCheck-in.
   - DEFINITELY TRUE
5. Staff will not have any specific recommendations for increasing the number of correct or complete claims received from eCheck-in
   - DEFINITELY TRUE
7. Staff will have suggestions for supporting other travel types and other travel reimbursement tasks. E.g., edit the address, upload receipts, file later, file for other appointments, etc.
   - LIKELY FALSE
9. Staff will disclose some upcoming changes to the travel reimbursement program that the Patient Check-In Team should be aware of.
   - DEFINITELY FALSE

## Key Findings

**Reception of eCheck-in with travel reimbursement**
1. Veterans found the travel reimbursement feature “awesome” and “easy to use” and would not change anything about the process
2. Staff and Veterans noted various benefits to travel reimbursement within eCheck-in compared to the other ways of filing for travel reimbursement (e.g., BTSSS, Form 10-3542, or in person)
3. The inclusion of travel pay is an incentive for Veterans to use eCheck-in
4. Some Veterans chose not to file for travel due to eligibility and distance when shown the travel screens 
5. MSAs described Veterans’ lack of trust in technology and concerns with privacy as potential factors for not trying eCheck-in
6. MSAs are seeing slow adoption of PCI, but have a positive outlook based on similar rollouts, including the BTSSS portal and VetLink kiosks

**Factors that affected utilization of travel reimbursement within eCheck-in**
1. It was difficult to find Veterans who wanted to use eCheck-in with their main reasons being they did not want to use their smartphone to check in or because they did not have smartphones
2. Veterans faced a variety of hurdles that prevented them from reaching travel reimbursement 
3. It was not clear if the current poster information and locations within clinics were helpful in getting Veterans to and through eCheck-in

**Staff perceptions of eCheck-in and interactions with Veterans**
1. MSAs don’t always trust eCheck-in is working as intended, leading to some confusion with the process and significant improvisation when assisting Veterans
2. MSAs spend time helping and educating Veterans on eCheck-in and travel reimbursement
3. Some MSAs haven’t seen their workloads increase, but other MSAs have seen a drastic increase in workload related to fielding questions around travel reimbursement and eligibility
4. Travel office work has not increased, with few issues reported
5. To reach Wilkes-Barre HAS leadership goals for the pilot, MSAs encouraged Veterans to try eCheck-in. However, eCheck-in isn't always right for everyone. E.g., Veterans who have a hard time using their phones, etc.

<br>

## Details of Key Findings

### Reception of eCheck-in with travel reimbursement

#### 1. Veterans found the travel reimbursement feature “awesome” and “easy to use” and would not change anything about the process
  - 3/3 Veterans who completed travel successfully submitted claims and found the feature helpful and easier than the usual reimbursement process
  - 5/5 Veterans who were shown travel reimbursement said they would not change anything about that part of the eCheck-in process
  - Metrics show the same pattern - nearly 100% of submitted claims are being filed successfully

> "That's awesome. 
Last time I couldn't do this until I got home.”

> “Nothing. It was perfect.” 
(when asked what they’d change about the process)

> “Quite a bit easier than going downstairs."

#### 2. Staff and Veterans noted various benefits to travel reimbursement within eCheck-in compared to the other ways of filing for travel reimbursement (e.g., BTSSS, Form 10-3542, or in person)
  - Shorter claim adjudication and claim review times: staff reported one week to a couple days for Veterans to receive claim feedback when filing through PCI
  - Lack of a full login: BTSSS login process is time-consuming and difficult, so being able to file without fully logging in is great
  - Veteran-Staff interactions: learning eCheck-in process is rewarding for both staff and Veterans, and facilities are developing fun ways to promote eCheck-in
  - Options for Veterans: eCheck-in/travel process is helpful for Veterans who aren’t as social or don’t feel like talking that day

“Lack of login is great! Trying to get into the BTS3 system can be the hardest part.” - Travel Office Supervisor

#### 3. The inclusion of travel pay is an incentive for Veterans to use eCheck-in
  - 2 veterans, after saying they did not want to try eCheck-in, changed their minds upon learning they could submit their travel pay during the process
  - MSAs also reported this being an incentive for Veterans to try eCheck-in and have taken to calling it a “one-stop shop”
  - We observed similar enthusiasm for the travel reimbursement screens during our recent Unified Check-in Generative Research Study

#### 4. Some Veterans chose not to file for travel due to eligibility and distance when shown the travel screens
  - Eligibility: 2/5 Veterans chose not to file because they did not think they were eligible / did not normally file
  - Distance: Others who did not try eCheck-in and travel mentioned not filing because they knew they lived too close to benefit from the program

#### 5. MSAs described Veterans’ lack of trust in technology and concerns with privacy as potential factors for not trying eCheck-in
  - Veterans sometimes "freak out" and interpret seeing the travel reimbursement screens as an error if travel pops up unexpectedly when Veterans thought they were ineligible for travel (MSA feedback)*
  - Occasionally Veterans complete their travel reimbursement claim through PCI, then still fill out the paper form because they didn’t trust the electronic confirmation (MSA feedback)*
  - Veterans often complete eCheck-in while standing in line in case something goes wrong (MSA feedback)

*Note: we heard this feedback from MSAs, but did not directly observe these occurrences during our intercepts.

#### 6. MSAs are seeing slow adoption of PCI, but have a positive outlook based on similar rollouts, including the BTSSS portal and VetLink kiosks
- Veterans have been slow to transition to using eCheck-in, but this pattern mimics initial adoption to the kiosks and Beneficiary Travel Self Service System (BTSSS) BTSSS. (MSA feedback)
- A travel office supervisor emphasized that at first barely anyone used BTSSS portal, but is now split 1/2 portal and 1/2 paper (Travel Office Supervisor feedback)
- MSA said that once they walk Veterans through the process, “they are pretty ok with it.” (MSA feedback). We also saw evidence of this during our intercepts with 2 Veterans who started eCheck-in on their own while walking into the waiting room, after having tried it previously with MSAs

### Factors that affected utilization of travel reimbursement within eCheck-in

#### 1. It was difficult to find Veterans who wanted to use eCheck-in with their main reasons being they did not want to use their smartphone to check in or because they did not have smartphones
  - Veterans like 1-on-1 interactions with MSAs when they come to the clinic (Veteran and MSA feedback)
  - Veterans often don’t have a smartphone or don’t trust technology, and can be hesitant about entering personal information on their phones because they’re concerned about hacking and privacy (MSA feedback)
  - Some Veterans do not have a personal device at all or leave them in their cars (MSA feedback). We also observed this during our intercepts.
  - Many Veterans have disabilities, such as low vision or tremors, that make it difficult to use their smartphone (MSA and Travel Office Supervisor feedback)

#### 2. Veterans faced a variety of hurdles that prevented them from reaching travel reimbursement 
  - Connecting to WiFi - Veterans at most facilities have difficulty connecting to WiFi or experience cell phone dead zones 
  - Incorrect matching cell phone numbers in VistA - A big issue is phone numbers not matching in system, so Veterans can’t log in 
  - Multiple appointments - Travel reimbursement feature is currently not supported for multiple appointments, which are common, especially for Veterans that travel long distances 
  - Appointment timing - Veterans don't want to use eCheck-in when they are running late or feel they don't have time to figure it out
  - Delays and other challenges - Delayed text responses (because of cell phone dead zones) or being unable to complete check-in can be frustrating for Veterans 
  - User errors - Veterans sometimes think they've finished check-in when they haven't or don’t know how to get into settings to connect to WiFi or how to send a text 

#### 3. It was not clear if the current poster information and locations within clinics were helpful in getting Veterans to and through eCheck-in
  - In some waiting rooms, MSAs replaced posters with more noticeable versions
  - MSAs added or attached information about WiFi access - with some versions focusing on WiFi instructions more than eCheck-in instructions
  - MSAs noted posters placed too close to the MSA windows were not helpful

----
### Staff perceptions of eCheck-in and interactions with Veterans

#### 1. MSAs don’t always trust eCheck-in is working as intended, leading to some confusion with the process and significant improvisation when assisting Veterans
  - A known system lag was resolved, yet appeared to remain a problem due to MSAs checking the system too soon after a Veteran completed checking in 
  - MSAs told us they don’t trust that the system has confirmed check-in on their end because they don't feel like they have practical evidence (e.g., they may not see a Veteran complete eCheck-in) 
  - 4 MSAs explained that sometimes Veterans say “it’s easy,” but MSAs still respond with, “let me check and make sure [you’re checked-in]”

> “If we don’t check, how would we know they’re here?” - MSA

#### 2. MSAs spend time helping and educating Veterans on eCheck-in and travel reimbursement
  - If Veterans are hesitant to use eCheck-in, MSAs have found them to be receptive to learning the process for their next appointment, so they often promote this approach
  - MSAs often take the phone and guide them (with permission)
  - MSAs often tell Veterans to put the check-in number in their contacts as VA check-in
  - MSAs often tell Veterans eCheck-in is "a mini-kiosk on your phone" or a "one-stop shop" where they can complete travel as well as Check-in

> “I tell them it’s a one-stop shop.” - MSA

#### 3. Some MSAs haven’t seen their workloads increase, but other MSAs have seen a drastic increase in workload related to fielding questions around travel reimbursement and eligibility
  - Roles vary for MSAs by clinic - Allentown MSAs are very involved and assigned to certain Veterans, while Wilkes-Barre MSAs are not as involved
  - One MSA said it hasn’t changed the workload, while another MSA said travel reimbursement’s inclusion in eCheck-in has created extra work, due to needing to help Veterans navigate submitting travel claims and fielding questions around eligibility
  - MSAs did not show interest in the possibility of having the capability to file claims for Veterans in VSE, and overall expressed a desire to have less to do with the actual claim process, but more research into this could be helpful the future

> “In general it takes up a lot of time."

> "We get everything, like ‘can you send my team a message?’ We're like personal assistants.”

> “Not many Veterans have used it, so it hasn’t changed the workload.”

#### 4. Travel office work has not increased, with few issues reported
  - No noticeable increase in work or claims, other than one claim from a Veteran who said yes to filing, but wasn’t eligible
  - One issue on the travel office side: claims aren't including the correct payment facility, which is needed to adjudicate the claim
  - Otherwise nothing has been missing with fields and the feature is going well with all proper steps included
  - Partially manual process: If a Veteran has filed before, the travel office staff sends the claim through right away - if it's the first time they're filing a travel claim, staff then checks manually
  - Because there are many nuances to the business logic of approving a claim, the claims from PCI still add to that workload for staff

#### 5. To reach Wilkes-Barre HAS leadership goals for the pilot, MSAs encouraged Veterans to try eCheck-in. However, eCheck-in isn't always right for everyone. E.g., Veterans who have a hard time using their phones, etc.
  - MSAs spoke about feeling pressure to get Veterans to use eCheck-in. On one occasion we observed an MSA having a Veteran with a cane and tremors use their phone to check in, though he was visibly having trouble doing so.

#### ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS FROM STAFF
  - Receiving a text message: Multiple staff mentioned sending Veterans a text would be a lot simpler than having them text the number, which would also allow Veterans to access the process earlier
  - Travel-specific assistance: MSAs recommended specific clinic services or employees dedicated to travel-related questions
  - VA-owned devices: Travel Office Staff and MSAs suggested incorporating VA-owned devices such as computers, iPads, or mini-kiosks into the eCheck-in process 
  - Additions or improvements to promotional materials: An MSA suggested a small instructions card that could be carried in a Veteran’s wallet, or an FAQ to take home and study would be excellent
  - Scanning VA ID cards with smartphones

> “It’d be best if Veterans get set up with it before the appointment.” - MSA

> “It’s unfortunate that PCI doesn’t pair with an iPad or computer.” - Travel Office Supervisor

> “An FAQ to take home and study would be excellent.” - MSA

<br>

## Secondary Findings

### Veteran suggestions

#### Outside of the travel screens, Veterans suggested changes for a few areas within eCheck-in 
  - **Input text box:** The input text box on the low auth sign in page does not accept an apostrophe, so a Veteran was not able to properly enter his last name
  - **Addressing incorrect demographics:** Two Veterans said they didn't know what they’d do if their demographics were incorrect
  - **Satisfaction survey:** A Veteran said it’d be helpful to have a direct way to get to the satisfaction survey after checking in

### Appointment reminders

**We heard feedback from MSAs pointing to confusion surrounding the appointment confirmation text reminders**
  - "The N should have a “contact so and so” with it" - MSA referring to additional instructions when canceling an appointment
  - "The number thing is an issue. They should just be able to hit Y." - MSA referring to the PCI text message and how Veterans might have to enter Y48, for example (which VeText has discussed)
  - An MSA noted that Y and N were once flipped and Veterans were accidentally canceling many appointments

### BTSSS challenges

**Veterans and staff face challenges with BTSSS portal and process**
- After completing travel reimbursement via eCheck-in, Veterans occasionally still think they need to file on the BTSSS portal
- In general, it’s common for Veterans to accidentally open duplicate claims in the portal, but staff can’t easily distinguish between duplicate claims and aren’t sure why so many duplicates are filed 
- Staff have trouble identifying claim issues and aren’t alerted to issues as they occur
- Staff don’t have a test account to access the portal and must be helping a Veteran on their account to view the interface
- The interface is challenging for Veterans and changes often, so staff assisting Veterans aren't always sure what changes have occured. “Even for people who know the system it's confusing” - BTSSS help center supervisor

<br>

## Recommendations

### Recommendations for further improving reception of travel reimbursement within eCheck-in
1. Prioritize 45-min text for fewer steps and earlier check-in (in early stage discussions)  
2. Include more information on travel reimbursement screens to encourage Veterans to file who might not know they’re eligible and prevent the perception that an error has occurred because they think they’re not eligible (in early stage discussions) 
3. Update content on the low authentication (last name, DOB) page to clarify that Veterans are starting the check in process, not completing it (in early stage discussions)
4. Adjust text message response indicating a successfully submitted travel reimbursement claim to ensure Veterans know they have finished the process and don’t need to fill out the paper form
5. Add information to demographics pages and confirmation pages to help Veterans understand how to update their information, even if it’s correct at the time of check in


### Recommendations for increasing the volume of Veterans who can access travel reimbursement within eCheck-in
1. Allow travel reimbursement in eCheck-in when a Veteran has multiple appointments on the same day (in early stage discussions)
2. Discuss the need to educate MSAs on how to update smartphone numbers in VistA (in order to be eligible for eCheck-in) with product owners and IVC


### Recommendations for improving staff perceptions of eCheck-in and interactions with Veterans to increase eCheck-in utilization 
1. Discuss feedback received about the need for additional education around PCI and travel reimbursement for staff and Veterans, and opportunities to encourage utilization, with product owners (and IVC) – as well as how to identify, engage, or not engage Veterans who might not be an ideal candidate for using PCI
2. Discuss refresh rate of VSE that causes MSAs to think "check in is not working" with PCI staff-facing team and IVC about the concern and how to better communicate with staff about how eCheck-in and VSE works together
3. Continue to discuss with product owners (and IVC) the potential for including the ability for MSAs to file a travel reimbursement claim on behalf of Veterans (potentially, within VSE), while also sharing feedback received that MSAs wouldn’t want to add to their workload   
4. Fix issue on the BTSSS API side to ensure the correct payment facility is appearing in claims from eCheck-in


### Other recommendations to socialize with other teams or prioritize in our backlog
1. Confirm and resolve issue with not being able to use a special character in the text input component, which PCI uses for authentication
2. Discuss with Platform Design and Accessibility the potential of making PCI more accessible by increasing mobile font sizes  
3. Pass along Veteran feedback to Appointments and VeText teams the issues and suggestions from Veterans and staff surrounding formatting of appointment text reminders, e.g., Y1.  
4. Pass along feedback to Beneficiary Travel Office team related to challenges with using BTSSS from both Veterans and Travel Office staff  
5. Build and/or open access to a BTSSS database to check Veterans beneficiary travel eligibility to personalize the PCI experience to the Veteran
6. Continue discussing the need and value  for a customer satisfaction survey at the end of check in to collect Veteran feedback (since a Veteran did mention it), especially knowing that VA: Health and Benefits app have implemented something similar recently 

<br>

## Who we talked to

**We spoke to 9 clinic and travel office staff members:**
- 2 staff members from the travel office
  - Formal interview with Travel Office Supervisor
  - Feedback from travel office staff during facility visits
- 7 MSAs in two facilities across four clinics, with 3 of these being informal interviews (versus speaking 1 on 1 at their work stations). 

**We completed 32 Veteran intercepts with clinic staff assistance. 11/32 Veterans tried eCheck-in:**
- 7 completed Check-in
    - 5 were shown travel reimbursement (3 completed travel reimbursement and 2 did not because they knew they were not eligible)
    - 2 were not shown travel because they had multiple appointments. Note: The MVP enables Veterans with one appointment to file for a mileage reimbursement claim. Subsequent releases will extend the reach.
- 4 did not complete Check-in
    - 2 received an error message because they tried to access eCheck-in before the check-in window (1 was 30 min before the appointment and within the check-in window but still received this message, likely due to an unexpected system error)
    - 1 received the “phone number doesn’t match” error message - to resolve this, MSAs can update home phone to cell in VistA Scheduling Enhancements (VSE) or use the appropriate VistA menu to update cell phone if they have access to it
    - 1 could not authenticate because of incorrect information. (login info possibly entered incorrectly)
