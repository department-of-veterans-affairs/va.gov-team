# Research Plan for Patient Check-In Travel Reimbursement Staff Interviews at Wilkes-Barre 2022-12

Last modified: December 22, 2022


## Background 

The Patient Check In (PCI) product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The Modernized Check-In Experience Team created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check in” through VA.gov. I.e., letting clinic staff know that the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 

     - Confirming their appointment
     - Reviewing their contact information 
     - Reviewing their emergency contact information
     - Reviewing their next of kin information 

- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment

### Travel Reimbursement 

In June 2022, the Beneficiary Travel Reimbursement Path Analysis Team completed a review of the VA general health care travel reimbursement program, which included recommendations on improvements to the Veteran experience. One of those recommendations was to integrate travel reimbursement into the patient check-in ecosystem. 

As a result of that work, the Modernized Check-In Experience Team began developing user flows and wireframes to visualize the integration and gather feedback from Veterans. 

The travel reimbursement feature within the PCI application will be piloted in late January or early February with Wilkes-Barre Health Care System clinics that have eCheck-in enabled.

## Research Goals 

The purpose of this research is to **get feedback from clinic and travel office staff on the new travel reimbursement feature in eCheck-in** on ease of use for Veterans and how it’s impacted staff workload. 

### Research Questions

#### MSAs 

##### Primary Questions

1. What feedback have Veterans had on how easy or difficult it is to file a travel reimbursement claim during check in? 
2. What type of questions have you received from Veterans about travel reimbursement within eCheck-in? 
3. How has the addition of travel reimbursement within eCheck-in impacted your work?
4. What would you change or add, if anything, to improve the process for Veterans filing a travel reimbursement claim during check in?
5. Would it be helpful to Veterans if MSAs could file a travel reimbursement claim for them during check in within VistA Scheduling Enhancements (VSE)? 
6. How would adding travel reimbursement into VSE impact your work?  

##### Secondary Questions 

7. What’s been the most confusing or difficult part about the mobile check in process (including pre-check-in) for Veterans? 
8. What do you think Veterans would change or add, if anything, to make the mobile check in process easier?
9. Would Veterans be more likely to complete mobile check in by responding to 1 or 2 text messages versus the current experience?   

#### Travel Office Staff

1. How, if at all, has the addition of travel reimbursement within eCheck-in impacted your, or your staff’s, work?
2. Has there been any increase or change in the amount of claims received with issues? E.g., doesn’t meet specific eligibility requirements, increase in denied claims, missing information, etc. 
3. What would you change or do differently, if anything, to increase the number of correct or complete claims received from eCheck-in? 
4. What would you change or add, if anything, to improve the process for Veterans filing a travel reimbursement claim during check in?  
5. What upcoming changes or initiatives, if any, should the Patient Check-In Team be aware of to the travel reimbursement program that might impact the travel reimbursement feature within eCheck-in? E.g., changes to travel office staffing, changes to the business rules, changes to the Beneficiary Travel Self-service System (BTSSS), etc.    

### Hypothesis 

#### MSAs

##### Primary 

1. Veterans will think filing a travel reimbursement claim during check in is easy, but those that aren’t eligible may think it’s neither easy nor difficult.
2. Some Veterans will have questions about why their travel reimbursement claim couldn’t be filed, while others will have suggestions for supporting other travel types and other travel reimbursement tasks. E.g., edit the address, upload receipts, file later, file for other appointments, etc. 
3. Staff will receive an inconsequential amount of questions related to travel reimbursement, but it will not impact their work as they’re trained to direct those questions to the travel office or provide instructions on how to file a claim online. 
4. Staff will recommend support for filing a claim up to 30 days after an appointment.
5. Staff will think it would be incredibly beneficial for them to file a travel reimbursement claim for Veterans within VSE, however worry that it will negatively impact the Veteran experience at the clinic. E.g., longer lines of Veterans waiting to be checked in. 
6. Staff will think that adding more functionality into VSE will increase the average time spent checking in a Veteran. 

##### Secondary 

7. Staff will think that Veterans don’t understand eCheck-In and think it’s too complicated.  
8. Staff will indicate that Veterans would recommend removing the scanning the QR code and texting VA step of the PCI workflow. 
9. Staff will think that Veterans would prefer responding to 1 or 2 text messages to check in for their appointments. 

#### Travel Office Staff

1. Staff will indicate that the addition of travel reimbursement within eCheck-in has not impacted their work. 
2. Staff will indicate that there has been no change in the amount of claims received with issues since travel reimbursement was added within eCheck-in.  
3. Staff will not have any specific recommendations for increasing the number of correct or complete claims received from eCheck-in
4. Staff will have suggestions for supporting other travel types and other travel reimbursement tasks. E.g., edit the address, upload receipts, file later, file for other appointments, etc. 
5. Staff will disclose some upcoming changes to the travel reimbursement program that the Patient Check-In Team should be aware of. 
 
## Method

This research will be conducted as semi-structured staff interviews at Wilkes-Barre Health Care System clinics that have eCheck-in enabled and the travel office. 

We will work with Wilkes-Barre Health Care System Health Administration Services (HAS) staff to determine the best approach for interviewing clinic and travel office staff. 

Our goal is to interview clinic staff at no fewer than 5 clinics and interview at least one travel office director or staff member 

1 or 2 researchers will be conducting this research.
