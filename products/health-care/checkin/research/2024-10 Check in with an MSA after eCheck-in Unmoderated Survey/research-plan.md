# Research Plan - Check in with an MSA after eCheck-in Unmoderated Survey

_[DRAFT]_

## Background
For decades, when a patient was checked in, clinical staff rightfully assumed that a patient had, most importantly, arrived, checked in with MSAs, and was now sitting in the clinic waiting room ready to be called back for their appointment.

With the introduction of eCheck-in in early 2022, Veterans could check in remotely from their smartphones, initially, 15 minutes before their appointment, which has since increased to 45 minutes due to feedback that, 1) Veterans are often told by clinicians and MSAs to arrive even earlier to their appointments, and 2) cellular signal, which is required to complete eCheck-in, can more often be problematic once inside VA health facilities.

Completing eCheck-in shows the patient as checked in within VistA and VSE-CS (i.e., both staff-facing applications), but Veterans do not have to be physically in the clinic waiting room at the time of completion, which is a mental model and process change for clinic staff.

As part of improvements to the PCI experience, we’ll be piloting Veteran-facing changes that clearly outline the steps involved in check-in and include a new step for Veterans to let a staff member know they’ve arrived once they complete their online check-in. These changes will be paired with changes to the staff-facing process that aim to further streamline the process for MSAs and clinicians.

This study aims to get Veteran feedback on UI and content changes to three pages within the online Check-in process, which will inform future interactions of these pages ahead of the pilot.

### OCTO Priorities
The Check in with an MSA after eCheck-in initiative aligns with the following OCTO-DE Priorities:
- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey
This research corresponds to the following points of the Veteran journey:
- Taking care of myself

## Research Goals

### Outcome
This study will give us insight into if Veterans notice and understand the information added to the Check-in flow around seeing a staff member after completing eCheck-in, as well as gauge Veterans reactions to this new step in the process.

### Research Questions
General questions about Veterans’ experience with eCheck-in
- What do Veterans value most about online check-in?
- What do Veterans value least about online check-in? 
- How do Veterans rate and describe their experience with online check-in?
- How do Veterans rate and describe their interactions with staff during or after online check-in?
- What do Veterans consider to be the biggest challenges/problems with online check-in?

Understanding and reaction to specific changes
- Do Veterans notice the new information telling them to see staff?
- How do Veterans interpret the information to see staff? 
- How do Veterans react to needing to see staff as part of online check-in?
- Would Veterans still use online check-in if they are required to see staff?
- What is the benefit of online Check-in to Veterans if they are required to see staff?

### Hypotheses
General questions about Veterans’ experience with eCheck-in
- What do Veterans value most about online check-in?
	- HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will most value the ability to file for travel reimbursement and check their demographics.
- What do Veterans value least about online check-in? 
	- HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will consider the actual action of checking in to be the part of check-in with the least amount of value for them.
- How do Veterans rate and describe their experience with online check-in?
	- HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will generally rate their experience at a 2 (positive). 
- How do Veterans rate and describe their interactions with staff during or after online check-in?
	- HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will rate their experience with staff at a 4 (negative) due to confusion around not getting called back in time or having staff say that they don’t use check-in.
- What do Veterans consider to be the biggest challenges/problems with online check-in?
	- HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will consider the touchpoints with staff and confusion around getting called back for appointments to be the biggest problem with check-in.

Understanding and reaction to specific changes
- Do Veterans notice the new information telling them to see staff?
	- HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will notice the information telling them to see staff, particularly on the introduction page and the confirmation page. 
- How do Veterans interpret the information to see staff? 
	- HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will interpret the information to see staff as needing to complete an added step for the check-in process. 
- How do Veterans react to needing to see staff as part of online check-in?
	- HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will convey confusion and concern around why they need to see staff after completing online check-in. 
- Would Veterans still use online check-in if they are required to see staff?
	- HYPOTHESIS: Veterans who file for travel reimbursement via check-in will still want to use online check-in, while those who do not file for travel reimbursement will be hesitant to use it.
- What is the benefit of online Check-in to Veterans if they are required to see staff?
	- HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will consider the remaining benefit to be filing for travel reimbursement. Depending on how staff handle the demographics, Veterans will also consider completing demographic checks to be a remaining benefit.

## Method
This research will be conducted as an unmoderated survey study using Optimal Workshop. The study will be an A/B test in which half of our participants will review version 1, while the other half will review version 2.

### Location
The tests will be conducted online at the participant’s leisure.
