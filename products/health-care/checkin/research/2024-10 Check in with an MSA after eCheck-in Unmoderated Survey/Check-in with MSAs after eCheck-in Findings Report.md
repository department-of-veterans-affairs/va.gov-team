## Research Goals

This study will give us insight into whether Veterans notice and understand the information added to the Check-in flow around seeing a staff member after completing eCheck-in, as well as gauge Veterans' reactions to this new step in the process.


## Research Questions

General questions about Veterans’ experience with eCheck-in



* What do Veterans value most about online check-in?
* What do Veterans value least about online check-in?
* How do Veterans rate and describe their experience with online check-in?
* How do Veterans rate and describe their interactions with staff during or after online check-in?
* What do Veterans consider to be the biggest challenges/problems with online check-in?
* Understanding and reaction to specific changes

Do Veterans notice the new information telling them to see staff?



* How do Veterans interpret the information to see staff?
* How do Veterans react to needing to see staff as part of online check-in?
* Would Veterans still use online check-in if they are required to see staff?
* What is the benefit of online Check-in to Veterans if they are required to see staff?


## Methodology

We conducted an unmoderated study from Nov 20, 24 to Dec 4, 24, with a total of 44 participants who have utilized eCheck-in with their smartphone in the past.

Groups of participants were shown two different versions of the intro page and a new confirmation page so the responses could be compared afterward.

The questions presented were a combination of Likert, multiple choice, and open-ended.

All results were coded, synthesized, and analyzed with various tools (Spreadsheets, Digital Whiteboard, Word processor) to produce the report.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

General questions about Veterans’ experience with eCheck-in

What do Veterans value most about online check-in?



* HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will most value the ability to file for travel reimbursement and check their demographics.
* CONCLUSION: This may be true; filing for travel reimbursement was among the most commonly mentioned advantages.

What do Veterans value least about online check-in?



* HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will consider the actual action of checking in to be the part of check-in with the least amount of value for them.
* CONCLUSION: This was false based on the findings; when presented with the new content, participants were very expressive about the positive benefits of e-Checkin.

How do Veterans rate and describe their experience with online check-in?



* HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will generally rate their experience at a 4 (positive).
* CONCLUSION: This was false based on the findings; most participants rated their overall experience as 5 (very positive).

How do Veterans rate and describe their interactions with staff during or after online check-in?



* HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will rate their experience with staff at a 4 (negative) due to confusion around not getting called back in time or having staff say that they don’t use check-in.
* CONCLUSION: This was somewhat true; there was significant frustration with staff expressed in the findings. Most of the frustrations voiced were centered around the staff not understanding echeck-in or just stating that it didn’t work correctly and dismissing it entirely.

What do Veterans consider to be the biggest challenges/problems with online check-in?



* HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will consider the touchpoints with staff and confusion around getting called back for appointments to be the biggest problem with check-in.
* CONCLUSION: Somewhat true; both staff interactions and failure to be called back were mentioned. In the case of the content that was tested this time, however, the biggest problems were expressed as the misalignment of mental models about echeck-in and how the content was presented in these mocks, in addition to connectivity inside facilities.

Understanding and reaction to specific changes

Do Veterans notice the new information telling them to see staff?



* HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will notice the information telling them to see staff, particularly on the introduction page and the confirmation page.
* CONCLUSION: Definitely true; there was a significant response directly to the content in question.

How do Veterans interpret the information to see staff?



* HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will interpret the information to see staff as needing to complete an added step for the check-in process.
* CONCLUSION: Likely true; this aligns with the mental model that many participants demonstrated with their responses.

How do Veterans react to needing to see staff as part of online check-in?



* HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will convey confusion and concern around why they need to see staff after completing online check-in.
* CONCLUSION: Definitely true; participants were particularly concerned that this defeated the purpose of echeck-in according to their expectations.

Would Veterans still use online check-in if they are required to see staff?



* HYPOTHESIS: Veterans who file for travel reimbursement via check-in will still want to use online check-in, while those who do not file for travel reimbursement will be hesitant to use it.
* CONCLUSION: Maybe true; many participants stated that they no longer saw the point of echeck-in with this content added, but most participants responded that they would still use echeck-in.

What is the benefit of online Check-in to Veterans if they are required to see staff?



* HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will consider the remaining benefit to be filing for travel reimbursement. Depending on how staff handle the demographics, Veterans will also consider completing demographic checks to be a remaining benefit.
* CONCLUSION: Not enough information; participants did not provide much insight into their reasoning behind continuing to use echeck-in with this content included.


## Key Findings



1. Most participants, 75% (33 of 44) found the content in both versions easy to understand and straightforward and had an overall favorable impression of the eCheck-in experience.
2. When told to see staff after checking in, participants were frustrated and expressed a preference to not talk to staff after completing eCheck-in.
3. Connectivity and staff interactions are the most challenging issues for participants with eCheck-in, according to responses in this study, 50% (20 out of 40) mentioned this as their biggest challenge.
4. Most participants, 85% for v1 (23 of 27) and 75% for v2 (15 of 20), responded that they would continue to use eCheck-in if required to see staff; however, comments were negative regarding perceived benefit.


## Details of Findings


### Finding 1: Most participants found the content in both versions easy to understand and straightforward and had an overall favorable impression of the eCheck-in experience.

Labels: AUD: Veterans, BNFT: Healthcare, PRDT: health-care-check-in

Participants found each version clear and understandable, and most noticed the new information instructing them to see staff. Participants’ impression of the eCheck-in experience was “Good,” as measured by a CSAT of 75. Most participants described their experience favorably with comments such as “Check in was intuitive,” and “(Check-in has) User friendly and clear instructions.” Participants seemed to value the potential time savings when using eCheck-in. No feature, interaction, or otherwise stood out in the responses as the “least” valuable.

“It's quick and easy, and I don't have to stand in line to check-in. It also allows me to review my emergency contact information.”

“It's very easy to confirm an appt. You select Y(#) for YES, or N(#) for NO. Then you get a text confirming it went through.”

“You can start the check in process when arriving at VA to expedite check in”

“Don't have to wait in line and then say personal information out loud to the check in person”


### Finding 2: When told to see staff after checking, participants were frustrated with the perception that the scenario they were being presented wasn’t how they would prefer to use eCheck-in.

Labels: AUD: Veterans, BNFT: Healthcare, PRDT: health-care-check-in

Many Participants, 21% (59 out of 275) of responses to open ended questions expressed frustration, and referred to the changes as “Redundant, Pointless, etc.” According to responses, some facilities allow Veterans to use eCheck-in without seeing staff. When this mental model was established, participants seemed averse to the potential change. Those who expressed concern frequently mentioned avoiding lines as the major advantage of eCheck-in.

“The whole purpose of checking in online is so I don't have to bother staff. I check in online and have a seat.”

“Why is this necessary; either I'm checked in or I'm not. If I check in in the lobby, but need to check in again at the clinic "tell a staff member...", this process has almost no practical advantage. “

“I feel it defeats the point of online check-in if you still have to wait in line to approach the desk.”


### Finding 3: Connectivity and staff interactions are the most challenging issues for participants with eCheck-in, according to responses in this study.

Labels: AUD: Veterans, BNFT: Healthcare, PRDT: health-care-check-in

Participants considered connectivity inside VA facilities to be the most challenging aspect of using eCheck-in, based on the survey responses. 18% (8 out of 44) responses to the open ended question “Why did you choose that rating,” referring to eCheck-in were negative comments relating to connectivity. Interactions with staff were also mentioned as a pain point when using eCheck-in. There were participants who mentioned that staff informed them that eCheck-in did not work or not to use it.

“It only works where wifi is available.”

“Link did not work, app spinning, and info never processed.“

“Staff advised the app never works, and they advised to not use it. This happened at labs and at Radiology both.”

“They weren’t really sure on how to do it via phone so they just physically checked me in on their computer”


### Finding 4: Most participants responded that they would continue to use check-in if required to see staff; however, responses about the benefits of doing so were mixed.

Labels: AUD: Veterans, BNFT: Healthcare, PRDT: health-care-check-in

Overall, 85% (23 of 27) and 75% (15 of 20) of participants responded that they would continue to use eCheck-in even after reviewing the changes proposed. The mixed responses participants provided about their perception of the advantages of eCheck-in, after seeing the changes regarding speaking with an MSA, were weighted toward it being less effective. Some saw advantages in not being required to repeat their information when they approached the desk, while others expressed sentiments that this change would invalidate the usefulness of eCheck-in from their perspective. This seems to depend on how facilities are currently utilizing eCheck-in and how that has shaped the mental models of the participants in this study.

“Why check in online when you still have to see a live person?”

“Don't know why its called online checkin if I still have to check in with a person”

“Not confusing but they will ask you to repeat the same information in person so I do not see the point”

“If I'm checking in online I do not need to bother with staff. They have long lines of people who are making follow-up appointments or who aren't tech savvy for online check-in. When I check in online, they know I'm in the waiting room.”


## Recommendations



* Finding 1 Recommendations
    * Continue with the direction of providing a streamlined flow for eCheck-in experience that makes it as easy as possible for Veterans to utilize.
* Finding 2 Recommendations
    * Barring changes to facility standard operating procedures, consider realigning the content with additional reasoning to help alleviate the negative impression of this new interaction.
* Finding 3 Recommendations
    * Continue to work with VA facilities and recommend improvements to WIFI infrastructure to allow more Veterans to access eCheck-in inside facilities easily.
    * Consider ways the digital team can provide updated or improve existing training materials or outreach to staff to help them more effectively assist Veterans who use e-check-in.
* Finding 4 Recommendations
    * “Why check in online when you still have to see a live person?”
    * “Don't know why its called online checkin if I still have to check in with a person”
    * “Not confusing but they will ask you to repeat the same information in person so I do not see the point”
    * “If I'm checking in online I do not need to bother with staff. They have long lines of people who are making follow-up appointments or who aren't tech savvy for online check-in. When I check in online, they know I'm in the waiting room.”


## Next Steps

The UAE-UX team will disseminate the information to stakeholders and look for opportunities to collaborate on potential solutions or future research needed.


## Further research needed

Additional research related to some of the findings that explore what makes different facilities more successful than others may be considered.
