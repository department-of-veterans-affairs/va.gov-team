## **Initial Findings**


---

Most participants found the content in both versions easy to understand and straightforward.



* More details on Finding #1

Quote: No, there is nothing confusing. 

Participants were frustrated with the perception that the scenario they were being presented wasnâ€™t how they would prefer to use eCheck-in.



* More details on Finding #2

Quote: I would think if you have to tell staff member you are there, it's the same as checking in with the staff and negates the online check in process unless you are updating info or filing for travel reimbursement

Internet connectivity at VA facilities continues to be a blocker to effective use of eCheck-in



* More details on Finding #3

Quote: Several times it went smoothly, at least one time though it showed I was checked in, the system didn't send it to the clinic and I had to check in again.

Uncertainty prompted participants to check in with staff
