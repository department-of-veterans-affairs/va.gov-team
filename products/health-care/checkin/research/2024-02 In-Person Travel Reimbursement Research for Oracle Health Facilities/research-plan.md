In-Person UAT for Travel Reimbursement on Smartphone at VA Oracle Health Facilities  
======================

[DRAFT]

## Background

Veterans who have medical appointments at VA health facilities that use Oracle Health EHR software (formerly CERNER) have a need to be able to file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim on the day of their appointment. 

While there is a roadmap for including pre-check-in and eCheck-in at facilities using Oracle Health EHR software, the greatest value right now for Veterans and patient tracking at clinics is to offer Veterans the ability to file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim using VA's Low Risk One Time Authentication (LoROTA) to streamline the "sign in" process for Veterans. 

The online travel reimbursement feature for smartphones will be piloted at a VA health facility that's use of Oracle Health is mature. E.g., Portland or Columbus. We will be collaborating with Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) on selecting a pilot facility and scheduling an in-person research visit.

## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to **get user acceptance feedback from Veterans and staff on the travel reimbursement feature's ease of use, identification of any challenges created for staff, and what, if any, expectations were unmet.**

### Research Questions (Veterans)
#### Primary Questions - UAT for Travel Reimbursement on Smartphone 
1. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to initiate a claim?
2. How easy or difficult is it to complete filing a claim?
3. How easy or difficult is it to file more than 1 claim? (If applicable.)
4. Which step of the process was most difficult to understand or challenging?  
6. Do Veterans understand how to file a claim with receipts?
7. What would Veterans change about this process to make it easier?

#### Secondary Questions - Understanding Check-in Ecosystem at Cerner facilities
1. What process do Veterans currently follow to check in at OH sites?
2. What are the current pain points for the check-in process at OH facilities?
3. Where are opportunities for improvement from the Veteran point of view?

### Research Questions (Staff)
#### Primary Questions - UAT for Beneficiary Travel
- **MSAs**
  1. How has the "text travel" method affected MSA workflow?
  2. What feedback have they received from Veterans about the "text travel" process?
  3. How has the travel reimbursement feature impacted the Check-in process?
- **Travel office staff**
  1. How has the "text travel" method affected travel office staff workflow?
     -   How has the "text travel" method affected the number of claims filed?
     -   How has the "text travel" method affected the number of denied claims?

#### Secondary - Understanding Check-in Ecosystem at Cerner facilities
1. What process does staff currently follow to check Veterans in at OH sites?
2. What are the current pain points for the check-in process at OH facilities?
3. Where are opportunities for improvement within check-in (preparing for and attending appointments) from the staff point of view? 
4. Is there a process at Cerner facilities for Veterans to check in on their own?

### Hypotheses

#### Primary Questions - UAT for Beneficiary Travel
1. From the posters and marketing materials, how well do Veterans discovery and understand how to initiate the claim process?
   - MAYBE TRUE - Veterans will not always notice the promotional materials.
2. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to initiate a claim?
   - MAYBE TRUE - Some Veterans will encounter difficulties initiating their claim due to internet connectivity or cell service.
3. Is there any confusion around initiating a claim via "text travel" compared to other methods of initiating claims at VistA facilities ("text Check-in" or 45 minute reminder message)?
   - MAYBE TRUE - Veterans who have filed for travel in Check-in at other facilities will report minor confusion with the difference between the two processes.
4. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to complete their claim?
   - LIKELY FALSE - Due to the success of mileage-only travel within Check-in, we expect Veterans to easily complete their claims.
5. Do Veterans understand how to select and file claims for appointments at multiple facilities?
   - MAYBE TRUE - Veterans might report some confusion around which facilities they should select, how many claims they are filing, and what happens to those selected or not selected. 
6. Do Veterans understand this process allows them to file for ONLY mileage, and how to proceed if they need to file with receipts for any of their appointments?
    - LIKELY TRUE - Because of the information about mileage-only on the intro and facility page, Veterans will understand the difference between filing for only mileage and filing with receipts.
7. What is the overall Veteran response to the "text travel" experience compared to other methods of filing?
    - LIKELY TRUE - Veterans will have positive responses to the possibility of texting travel to file a claim or multiple claims. 

#### Secondary Questions - Understanding Check-in Ecosystem at Cerner facilities
1. What process do Veterans currently follow to check in at OH sites?
2. What are the current pain points for the check-in process at OH facilities?
3. Where are opportunities for improvement from the Veteran point of view?

Method
------

This research will be conducted through Veteran intercepts and in-person interviews with staff at [FACILITY]. Our preference is to visit various clinics during times of high appointment check-ins.

We will work with facility contacts to determine the best approach for Veteran intercepts, and plan to intercept Veterans near travel posters before or after their appointments (depending on availability), and observe as they go through the travel reimbursement filing process. After assisting those Veterans through the filing process, we will ask them a few questions to get feedback on the experience.

We will also ask MSAs questions from our conversation guide to better understand the check-in ecosystem at Cerner sites and document responses, comments, improvements, etc.

1 or 2 researchers will be conducting this research.
