In-Person UAT for Travel Reimbursement on Smartphone at VA Oracle Health Facilities  
======================

## Background

Veterans who have medical appointments at VA health facilities that use Oracle Health EHR software (formerly CERNER) have a need to be able to file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim on the day of their appointment. 

The greatest value right now for this consortium of Veterans and patient tracking at clinics is to offer Veterans the ability to file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim using VA's Low Risk One Time Authentication (LoROTA) to streamline the "sign in" process for Veterans. 

The online travel reimbursement feature for smartphones will be piloted at a VA health facility that's use of Oracle Health is mature. E.g., Portland or Columbus. We will be collaborating with Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) on selecting a pilot facility and scheduling an in-person research visit.

## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to **get user acceptance feedback from Veterans and staff on the travel reimbursement feature's ease of use, identification of any challenges created for staff, and what, if any, expectations were unmet.**

### Primary Questions - UAT for Travel Reimbursement on Smartphone
#### Veterans
1. How do Veterans find out about filing a travel reimbursement claim by texting travel to 54804? 
1. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to initiate a claim?
1. How easy or difficult is it to complete filing a claim?
1. How easy or difficult is it to file more than 1 claim at multiple facilities? (If applicable.)
1. Do Veterans understand what claim types they can file with this tool?
1. Do Veterans understand when they can file claims with this tool?

##### MSAs
1. What feedback have MSAs or Clinic Managers received from Veterans about the new online travel reimbursement for smartphones tool?
1. How has it impacted MSA work or workload, if at all?
1. How has the clinic or facility helped Veterans learn about filing a travel reimbursement claim by texting travel to 54804?

##### Travel Office Staff
1. What feedback have travel assistants or Travel Office managers received from Veterans about the new online travel reimbursement for smartphones tool?
1. How has it impacted staff  work or workload, if at all ?
1. Has the new process caused any changes or issues with submitted claims? 

### Secondary Questions - Understanding the Check-in Ecosystem at VA Oracle Health Facilities
#### Veterans
1. How do Veterans check in for their appointment? 
1. What are the current pain points when checking in? 
1. Where are opportunities for improving the check-in process? 

#### MSAs
1. What's the process to check in a Veteran for a VA medical appointment?
1. What's the pre-registration process for Veterans, if any? E.g., confirming their contact information, confirming their health insurance, completing health questionnaires, etc. 
1. What are the current pain points for checking in a Veteran? 
1. Where are opportunities for improvement for checking in (or preparing for an appointment)?

## Hypotheses

### Primary Questions - UAT for Travel Reimbursement on Smartphone
#### Veterans
1. How do Veterans find out about filing a travel reimbursement claim by texting travel to 54804? 
   - Most Veterans will not know about this modality for filing a travel reimbursement claim. 
1. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to initiate a claim?
   - Veterans will find it extremely easy to initiate a claim, but some will have difficulties because of cellular reception. 
1. How easy or difficult is it to complete filing a claim?
   - Veterans will find it extremely easy to file a claim from their smartphones. 
1. How easy or difficult is it to file more than 1 claim at multiple facilities? (If applicable.)
   - Veterans will find it extremely easy to file more than 1 claim in a single form (and extremely easy to understand that they're filing for multiple facilities). 
1. Do Veterans understand what claim types they can file with this tool?
   - Veterans will be able to easily identify the two types of claims that they can file. 
1. Do Veterans understand when they can file claims with this tool?
   - Most Veterans will understand that they have to file today, while asking why that's different than the "30 day" rule. 
  
#### MSAs
1. What feedback have MSAs or Clinic Managers received from Veterans about the new online travel reimbursement for smartphones tool?
   - MSAs and Clinic Managers will have feedback from Veterans that it's an extremely helpful and needed tool. 
2. How has it impacted MSA work or workload, if at all?
   - MSAs and Clinic Managers will mention that they receive questions on occasion, which adds to their responsibilities. However, they're able to quickly direct them to contact the Travel Office.
3. How has the clinic or facility helped Veterans learn about filing a travel reimbursement claim by texting travel to 54804?
   - Posters have been placed at the exits of clinics and entrances of facilities.
     
#### Travel Office staff
1. What feedback have travel assistants or Travel Office managers received from Veterans about the new online travel reimbursement for smartphones tool?
   - Travel assistants and Travel Office managers will have feedback from Veterans that it's an extremely helpful and needed tool. 
2. How has it impacted staff  work or workload, if at all?
   - There are a lot more travel claims coming in that require manual review, which naturally increases staff workload. However, the number of complicated manual reviews is a small portion. 
3. Has the new process caused any changes or issues with submitted claims?
   - There are more claims that require manual review.

Method
------

This research will be conducted through Veteran intercepts and in-person semi-structured interviews with clinic and Travel Office staff. Our intention is to visit various clinics, at busy times, to see what differences exist between clinics and different types of clinics. 

We will work with IVC (Integrated Veteran Care) and facility leadership to determine the best approach for Veteran intercepts, but ideally plan to intercept Veterans after check out. While observing Veterans as they go through the travel reimbursement filing process on their smartphones, we will assist as needed, and ask them a few questions to gather feedback on their experience.

We will also ask MSAs and Travel Office staff questions from our conversation guide to better understand the check-in ecosystem and impact of the new travel claim tool on their workload, while documenting those findings.

1 or 2 researchers will be conducting this research.
