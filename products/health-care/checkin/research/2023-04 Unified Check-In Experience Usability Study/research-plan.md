# Patient Check In (PCI) Research Plan for Unified Check-In Generative Research Usability Study  

Last modified: May 31, 2023

## Background 

The Patient Check In (PCI) product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The Modernized Check-In Experience Team created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check in” through VA.gov. I.e., letting clinic staff know that the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 

     - Confirming their appointment
     - Reviewing their contact information 
     - Reviewing their emergency contact information
     - Reviewing their next of kin information 

- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment

### Creating a Unified Check-In Experience 

The Modernized Check-In Experience Team has received feedback from Veterans and staff that PCI is too complicated. Specifically, the feedback includes: 

- Veterans and staff don’t understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in. 
- Many Veterans use the pre-check-in link that was texted to them to initiate check-in on the day of their appointment, which does not actually allow them to check in. 
- Some Veterans skip checking in altogether when they arrive at the clinic because they think they’re checked in as a result of completing the pre-check-in process, which in fact does not initiate or complete the online check in process.

To mitigate these concerns, the Modernized Check-In Experience Team has decided to do some generative research around merging our two applications into one (i.e., a unified check-in experience) to remove the confusion between pre-check-in and check-in.

In this scenario, when Veterans access the new PCI web app, an appointment card component will be used to highlight the upcoming appointment that requires immediate attention. For example, the appointment needs to be confirmed or checked into.

In addition, we will start showing Veterans all of their upcoming appointments as a solution for making their health appointment information more accessible, creating better consistency between digital touchpoints across VA and enabling them to complete other appointment tasks during their encounter.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research plan supports the following OCTO objectives:

### Veteran Journey

This research plan maps to the following moment within the Veteran journey:

## Research Goals 

The purpose of this generative research is to **get feedback from Veterans on the new unified PCI experience idea** and, specifically, about ease of use and how well it meets expectations.

### Research Questions

#### Primary Questions 

1. Do Veterans find the day before appointment reminder and pre-check-in notifications confusing?
2. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand that you still need to complete the online check-in process even if you’ve completed the pre-check-in process a few days before?
3. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to check in to an appointment?
4. Do Veterans think the check in confirmation page provides enough information about the status of their check in and what to do next?
5. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand if their other upcoming appointments have tasks to complete? For example, another appointment needs to complete pre-check-in or can initiate a check-in.
6. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand the difference between the pre-check-in process and checking in to an appointment?
7. Do Veterans find it helpful to be able to review all of their other upcoming appointments during the pre-check-in and check-in processes?
8. Would Veterans find it helpful to receive a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments with instructions on how to check in? 

#### Secondary Questions 

9. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to find the call to action from the appointment detail pages?
10. Do Veterans expect to find information about whether an appointment has already completed pre-check-in? If so, from the appointment list page or detail pages?

### Hypothesis 

#### Primary Questions 

1. Do Veterans find the day before appointment reminder and pre-check-in notifications confusing?
     - LIKELY FALSE: Most Veterans will find the notifications easy to understand.
2. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand that you still need to complete the online check-in process even if you’ve completed the pre-check-in process a few days before?
     - MAYBE TRUE: Some Veterans will understand that completing the pre-check-in process does not replace checking in to an appointment, and, therefore, they will recommend making that more clear at the completion of pre-check-in.
3. How easy or difficult is it to check in to an appointment?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: Veterans will think the process for checking in to an appointment is easy.
4. Do Veterans think the check in confirmation page provides enough information about the status of their check in and what to do next?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: Veterans will think the information on the check in confirmation page is well organized and prioritized.
5. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand if their other upcoming appointments have tasks to complete? For example, another appointment needs to complete pre-check-in or can initiate a check-in.
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans will find it easy to understand that their other upcoming appointments have tasks to complete, but might recommend highlighting those tasks better in the appointment list.
6. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand the difference between the pre-check-in process and checking in to an appointment?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans will understand the difference between the pre-check-in process and checking in to an appointment.
7. Do Veterans find it helpful to be able to review all of their other upcoming appointments during the pre-check-in and check-in processes?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Veterans will like seeing all of their other upcoming appointments in one place, even if it’s within the context of completing the pre-check-in and check-in processes.
8. Would Veterans find it helpful to receive a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments with instructions on how to check in?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: Veterans will prefer receiving a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments compared to scanning a poster at the clinics. 

#### Secondary Questions 

9. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to find the call to action from the appointment detail pages?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Veterans will find it easy to locate where to start the pre-check-in and check-in processes from the appointment detail pages, but might recommend adding some separation between the appointment information and the action link to make it more noticeable.
10. Do Veterans expect to find information about whether an appointment has already completed pre-check-in? If so, from the the appointment list page or detail pages?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans will expect to see which of their upcoming appointments have already completed pre-check-in, especially if they just completed that process for one of their other appointments.
   
## Methodology 

This research will be conducted as a remote moderated user research study that utilizes an accessible prototype built for mobile devices. Participants will be asked to complete specific tasks for usability testing and asked follow-up questions to gain understanding of expectations and satisfaction.
