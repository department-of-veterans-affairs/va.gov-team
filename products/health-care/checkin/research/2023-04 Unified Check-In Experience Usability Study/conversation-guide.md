# Patient Check In (PCI) Conversation Guide for Unified Check-In Generative Research Usability Study 

## Moderator Logistics 

### 2-3 Days Before the Session 

- Review VA Platform’s [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions).
- Perigean will send you the sign in instructions for using Zoom accounts for user research. The first time you use their account you will need to coordinate with Perigean on 2FA. 

### Starting the Session 

- Sign out of personal Zoom. 
- Create thread in #feedback-backchannel. 
- Add observer instructions into the thread. 
- Connect earbuds. 
- Open up CodePen prototype in web browser: https://codepen.io/team/va-cie/live/NWORQEe
- Check that a11yInfoContainer is commented out in CodePen. 
- Open up the [Zoom guide](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-use-zoom-for-user-research) in a web browser. 
- Mute your Slack notifications. 
- After signing in to Zoom, you will be logged in as a presenter. Be sure to enter your name. 
- Check to see if recording is set to save in the cloud. 
- In the Participant “More” menu, make sure “Play Join and Leave Sound” is unchecked.
- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except for the participant is on mute.  
- In the Share menu, make sure all participants can share their screen. 
- Keep observers in the waiting room to ask the participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell the observers to have their full name displayed and be ready to turn their cameras on for a brief introduction to the participant when they are admitted to the session.

## Intro - 5 minutes 

Hello and thank you for joining today. My name is Ben. How are you doing today? 

Great. I wanted to quickly let you know that I have a colleague with me in this session who will be helping me to take notes.

*If the participant is using a screen reader:* And, I also have Sara (and/or Angela) with me to help with any technical needs, if they do arise, that’s related to using a screen reader or screen magnification during this session.  

So, today, I'm going to ask you to do some specific tasks using a prototype that I will share with you in just a few moments. 

But, before we start, I want to go over a few things: 

*Check to see if anyone is waiting to join the room. If not, skip the first bullet below.*  

- **First, I have some other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Previously, Perigean asked for your consent to allow observers during this session, but I wanted to ask again now to be sure before we get going. So, are you okay with letting observers in for this session?  
     - If “no,” ask the observers to leave Zoom via Slack. 
     - If “yes,” let other observers into the room. 
          - And, here are my colleagues. Team, please unmute your camera and microphone and quickly introduce yourself with your first name and role.
          - And now for my colleagues who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth and mute your audio, that would be great. Thank you.  
- **So, this session today should take about an hour, maybe a little less.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.  
- **And, in this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers. We are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We’re testing a prototype to learn how we can make it easier to use for Veterans. I welcome any and all of your feedback and I won’t be offended by opinions you express.  
- **If for any reason, and at any time, you want to stop this session, please just let me know.** 
- **And, lastly, are you comfortable if I record this session today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, but the recordings are deleted after we complete our analysis. Also, none of your comments will ever be attributed to you directly. So, is it okay to record this session? 

*If “no,” skip to [Warm-Up Questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/2023-04%20Unified%20Check-In%20Experience%20Usability%20Study/conversation-guide.md#warm-up-questions---1-minute).* 

Great. Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Okay, I’m going to start the recording now.   

*Start recording. Select “record to cloud” so that the recordings are saved to Perigean’s account.* 

Okay, I have started recording. Once again, are you comfortable if I record this session today? 

Great. Thank you. 

## Warm-Up Questions - 1 Minute

So, before we go to the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions. 

- What device are you using to join this session today?
- I will be sharing a web page link with you during this session. How would you prefer to receive the url? For example, I could send it through the Zoom (messages) chat or email it to you.   
- *If the participant is using a screen reader:* 
     - Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
     - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert? 
     - How long have you been using that technology? 
- *If the participant is using screen magnification:* 
     - Are you using a screen magnification tool today? If so, what type? (For example, Zoom.) 
     - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert? 
     - How long have you been using that technology? 
- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 12 months?
- Have you ever used your smartphone to check in to a VA medical appointment? 

Great. Thank you. 

## Screen Sharing Instructions - 2 Minutes

Now, I’d like to be able to see your screen so I can see how you’re using the prototype. Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me today? 

Great. Now, if there’s any apps, web pages or notifications on your device that you’d like to close or turn off before I’m able to see your screen, I’ll give you a moment to do that now. 

So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.  

Please tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap the screen a menu will open at the bottom of your screen. In that menu, tap (or select) "Share." If you can’t find “Share” in that menu, you may need to tap the menu and drag it to the left to uncover more options. And, when you find the “Share” option, go ahead and select it.   

Then, tap (or select) "Screen." Then, tap the words, “Start Broadcast.” Now, tap (or select) anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen that starts with "Everything on your screen." 

Perfect. 

### Can’t Share Screen Strategy (If Needed)

Well, it seems like we’re having some trouble sharing your screen, but that’s okay. I’m still interested in proceeding with our session today. Instead of sharing your screen, I’d like for you to use the prototype on your screen, but talk aloud for me to understand what you’re doing. Does that sound okay? 

## Usability Tasks

### Pre-Check-In Text Message Tasks - 5 Minutes

So, now we’ll review the prototype. And, the prototype that we’ll be reviewing today is for the process of preparing for your upcoming medical appointments. 

So, in the prototype, some things you’ll be able to select, while other things you won’t. Nothing in it is your information; it’s all just pretend.

As a reminder, I’m going to be asking you to do some specific tasks using the prototype. However, I’m going to be starting and stopping you to provide specific instructions and ask you questions along the way. Does that sound okay?  

Great. So, typically the first step of the process of preparing for your upcoming medical appointments starts with the VA sending you a text message on your smartphone a few days before your appointment.  

*If the participant prefers using email to receive information, skip to [Instructions for Using Email](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/2023-04%20Unified%20Check-In%20Experience%20Usability%20Study/conversation-guide.md#instructions-for-using-email).*

#### Instructions for using Zoom 

So, what I’d like to do is use the Zoom (messages) chat to pretend VA is sending you a text message and have you review it. Does that sound okay? 

Ok. Now go ahead and tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap (or select) the screen a menu will appear at the bottom of your screen. In that menu, tap (or select) “Chat.” 

Perfect. 

Now, let’s pretend that you have an upcoming appointment that’s on Monday, February 2 at 8:00 am. And, let’s pretend that that’s in a few days from now. 

Now, I’m going to send you the first text message. When you receive it, go ahead and review the message, pretending it’s a text message that you received on your smartphone. 

*Your VA appointment is on FEB 2 at 08:00.* 

*Reply:* <br>
*Y1 to CONFIRM*<br>
*N1 to CANCEL* <br>
*D1 for DETAILS* <br>

*For more info call 909-825-7084 options 2 or reply HELP.* 

*Got a fever, cold cough or flu-like symptoms? Stay home and phone VA first: (909) 825-7084 ext. 5085.* 

*Don't catch the bug. Ask your provider to receive your flu shot! Get yours at the VA or anytime at Walgreens Pharmacy.* 

*Find a location of the closest pharmacy here: https://go.usa.gov/xGQk2*

*Send STOP to end messages.* 

- Great. And, what would you do next? 

Great. Now, I’m going to send you an automated response back. When you receive it, go ahead and review the message. 

*Your appointment for FEB 2 at 08:00 is confirmed. To prepare for your appointment, check if your information is up to date: https://codepen.io/team/va-cie/live/NWORQEe*

*Skip ahead to [Pre-Check-In Text Message Task Questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/2023-04%20Unified%20Check-In%20Experience%20Usability%20Study/conversation-guide.md#pre-check-in-text-message-task-questions).*

#### Instructions for Using Email 

So, what I'd like to do now is send you an email and pretend it's VA sending you a text message and have you review it. Does that sound okay? 

Great. And, could you confirm your email address?

Perfect. Now, let's pretend that you have an upcoming appointment that's on Monday, February 2 at 8:00 am. And, let's pretend that that's in a few days from now. 

We're going to send you an email now with the information that would be included in those text messages from VA. And, when you receive the email, go ahead and review the message, pretending it's a text message that you received on your smartphone. 

*Text message 1 of 2.*

*Your VA appointment is on FEB 2 at 08:00.*

*Reply:*<br>
*Y1 to CONFIRM*<br>
*N1 to CANCEL*<br>
*D1 for DETAILS*

*For more info call 909-825-7084 options 2 or reply HELP.*

*Got a fever, cold cough or flu-like symptoms? Stay home and phone VA first: (909) 825-7084 ext. 5085.*

*Don't catch the bug. Ask your provider to receive your flu shot! Get yours at the VA or anytime at Walgreens Pharmacy.*

*Find a location of the closest pharmacy here: https://go.usa.gov/xGQk2*

*Send STOP to end messages.*

*Text message 2 of 2.*

*Your appointment for FEB 2 at 08:00 is confirmed. To prepare for your appointment, check if your information is up to date: https://codepen.io/team/va-cie/live/NWORQEe*

- Great. And, what would you do next after the first text message? 

Great. Now, go ahead and review the second text message. 

#### Pre-Check-In Text Message Task Questions

- Now, could you tell me if the information in these text messages is what you’d expect to find for an upcoming medical appointment? 
- Did you find any information in these texts confusing? 
- Is there anything you would recommend changing about these texts?
- Great. Now, what would you do next? 

### Pre-Check-In Webpage Tasks - 15 Minutes

*Veteran should be on the pre-check-in log in screen.*

Great. Now, as a reminder, some things in this prototype you can select, some things you can’t, and nothing in here is your actual information; it’s just pretend. 

Now, on this page, I’d like for you to review the information on the screen, and as you’re reviewing, I would like you to talk aloud as much as possible so that you share what you’re thinking about and what, if anything, you’re unsure about before advancing to the next page. So, please start reviewing the information on the screen, but remember, don’t advance to the next page yet. 

- Great. And, how easy or difficult was it to understand what to do next on this page?

*Switching gears to talk about pre-check-in overall.*

Great. So, you updated your contact information for your 8 am appointment and you confirmed another upcoming appointment. 

- So, overall, how easy or difficult has it been to confirm an upcoming appointment? And, why? 
- And, overall, has there been any information or any step that’s been unclear?  
- And, overall, has there been anything that you would change or add about this process to make it easier? 

Great. Thank you. 

### Check In Tasks - 15 Minutes
 
Now, I’d like for us to change gears a tiny bit and now review the process for checking in to an appointment from your smartphone on the actual day of your appointment. 

And, let’s pretend that it’s the day of your appointment and you’ve just arrived at the clinic. Then, you get a text message on your smartphone from the VA and it reads, “It’s time to check in for your VA appointment on February 2 at 8:00 am. If you have trouble with check-in, ask a staff member at your VA health facility for help.” And, there’s a link for you to follow.

Now, I’d like for you to imagine that you selected that link. 

So, now we need to open this prototype. So, I’d like for you to navigate down towards the bottom of this page and select the “Jump to Check-in start” link. This is going to jump us to the next prototype.  

*Veteran should be on the check-in authentication page.* 

Perfect. So, again, let’s pretend that you selected the link from your text message and it opened this page. 

Now, please start reviewing the information on this screen, but remember, don’t advance to the next page yet. 

*Veteran should still be on the check-in authentication page.*

Great. And again, for this session today, we don’t need you to provide your actual last name and date of birth. So, please go ahead and select the “Continue” button to advance to the next page.

*Veteran should be on the check-in appointment list page.*

Perfect. So, again, please start reviewing the information on this screen, but remember, don’t advance to the next page yet.

- And, how easy or difficult was that to find? 
- And, how would you recommend that we make that easier to find?

Great. Now, let’s go ahead and proceed to the next page. 

*Veteran should be on the “You’ve confirmed your appointment” page.*

Great. Thank you. 

### Post-Tasks Questions - 5 Minutes

Now, I have just a few follow up questions for you about the two prototypes that you reviewed today.  

- So, overall, how easy or difficult was it to understand the difference between confirming an upcoming appointment and checking in to an appointment?  
- And, overall, how easy or difficult was it to understand that you still have to check in on the day of your appointment even if you confirmed your appointment a few days before?
- And, overall, how helpful did you find it to be able to review all of your other upcoming appointments when you were confirming or checking in to your appointment? 
- And, which would you prefer? Receiving a text message from the VA when it’s time to check in for your appointment OR finding instructions on how to check in on a poster at the clinic?
- And, lastly, if the VA were to send you a text message when it’s time to check in for your appointment, would you prefer to receive one message before each of your appointments? Or one message at the start of the day?

Great. Thank you. 

## Closing - 1 Minute

Well, that is all the questions I have for you today. Is there anything else that we haven’t talked about that you’d like to share with me today?  

Great. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the appointment check in process and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you for your feedback and thank you again so much for joining us today. 

Have a great rest of your day.
