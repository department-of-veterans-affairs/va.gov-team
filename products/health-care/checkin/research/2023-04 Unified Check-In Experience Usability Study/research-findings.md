# Research Goals

The purpose of this generative research is to **get feedback from Veterans on the new “unified check-in” experience idea of enhancements to Patient Check In (PCI)** and, specifically, about ease of use and how well it meets expectations.

The new unified check-in experience hopes to address: 

- Veterans and staff don’t understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in.
- Many Veterans use the pre-check-in link that was texted to them to initiate check-in on the day of their appointment, which does not actually allow them to check in.
- Some Veterans skip checking in altogether when they arrive at the clinic because they think they’re checked in as a result of completing the pre-check-in process, which in fact does not initiate or complete the online check in process.

*Note: “Unified check-in” isn’t a new product or product name. It’s simply an internal term being used to describe a set of features and visual changes to add into the Veteran-facing PCI product to improve ease of use for Veterans and increase utilization at VISNs.* 

## Research Questions

#### Primary Questions 

1. Do Veterans find the day before appointment reminder and pre-check-in notifications confusing?
2. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand that you still need to complete the online check-in process even if you’ve completed the pre-check-in process a few days before?
3. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to check in to an appointment?
4. Do Veterans think the check in confirmation page provides enough information about the status of their check in and what to do next?
5. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand if their other upcoming appointments have tasks to complete? For example, another appointment needs to complete pre-check-in or can initiate a check-in.
6. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand the difference between the pre-check-in process and checking in to an appointment?
7. Do Veterans find it helpful to be able to review all of their other upcoming appointments during the pre-check-in and check-in processes?
8. Would Veterans find it helpful to receive a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments with instructions on how to check in? 

#### Secondary Questions 

9. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to find the call to action from the appointment detail pages?
10. Do Veterans expect to find information about whether an appointment has already completed pre-check-in? If so, from the appointment list page or detail pages?

# Methodology 

- Conducted a moderated usability study using a CodePen (accessible) prototype with 13 Veterans who had been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment in the last 12 months 
- 12 out of 13 Veterans used their smartphones
- 60 minute sessions with non AT users, 90 minute sessions with AT users 
- Veterans were tasked with completing the pre-check-in and check in processes, while providing feedback of their thoughts and actions along the way

# Hypothesis and Conclusions

## Primary Questions 

1. Do Veterans find the day before appointment reminder and pre-check-in notifications confusing?
     - LIKELY FALSE: All Veterans found the notifications easy to understand, but some didn't feel the pre-check-in content was actionable enough. 
2. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand that you still need to complete the online check-in process even if you’ve completed the pre-check-in process a few days before?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: All Veterans said that it was very clear that you still need to check in even after completing pre-check-in because it's a known behavior for VA medical appointments. 
3. How easy or difficult is it to check in to an appointment?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: All Veterans thought the process for checking in to an appointment was easy.
4. Do Veterans think the check in confirmation page provides enough information about the status of their check in and what to do next?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: All Veterans thought the information on the check in confirmation page was well organized and prioritized.
5. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand if their other upcoming appointments have tasks to complete? For example, another appointment needs to complete pre-check-in or can initiate a check-in.
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans will find it easy to understand that their other upcoming appointments have tasks to complete, but might recommend highlighting those tasks better in the appointment list.
6. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand the difference between the pre-check-in process and checking in to an appointment?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans will understand the difference between the pre-check-in process and checking in to an appointment.
7. Do Veterans find it helpful to be able to review all of their other upcoming appointments during the pre-check-in and check-in processes?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Veterans will like seeing all of their other upcoming appointments in one place, even if it’s within the context of completing the pre-check-in and check-in processes.
8. Would Veterans find it helpful to receive a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments with instructions on how to check in?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: Veterans will prefer receiving a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments compared to scanning a poster at the clinics. 

## Secondary Questions 

9. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to find the call to action from the appointment detail pages?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Veterans will find it easy to locate where to start the pre-check-in and check-in processes from the appointment detail pages, but might recommend adding some separation between the appointment information and the action link to make it more noticeable.
10. Do Veterans expect to find information about whether an appointment has already completed pre-check-in? If so, from the the appointment list page or detail pages?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans will expect to see which of their upcoming appointments have already completed pre-check-in, especially if they just completed that process for one of their other appointments.
