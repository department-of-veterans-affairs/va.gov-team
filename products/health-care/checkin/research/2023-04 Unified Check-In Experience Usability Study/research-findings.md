# Research Goals

The purpose of this generative research is to **get feedback from Veterans on the new “unified check-in” experience idea of enhancements to Patient Check In (PCI)** and, specifically, about ease of use and how well it meets expectations.

The new unified check-in experience hopes to address: 

- Veterans and staff don’t understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in.
- Many Veterans use the pre-check-in link that was texted to them to initiate check-in on the day of their appointment, which does not actually allow them to check in.
- Some Veterans skip checking in altogether when they arrive at the clinic because they think they’re checked in as a result of completing the pre-check-in process, which in fact does not initiate or complete the online check in process.

*Note: “Unified check-in” isn’t a new product or product name. It’s simply an internal term being used to describe a set of features and visual changes to add into the Veteran-facing PCI product to improve ease of use for Veterans and increase utilization at VISNs.* 

## Research Questions

#### Primary Questions 

1. Do Veterans find the day before appointment reminder and pre-check-in notifications confusing?
2. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand that you still need to complete the online check-in process even if you’ve completed the pre-check-in process a few days before?
3. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to check in to an appointment?
4. Do Veterans think the check in confirmation page provides enough information about the status of their check in and what to do next?
5. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand if their other upcoming appointments have tasks to complete? For example, another appointment needs to complete pre-check-in or can initiate a check-in.
6. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand the difference between the pre-check-in process and checking in to an appointment?
7. Do Veterans find it helpful to be able to review all of their other upcoming appointments during the pre-check-in and check-in processes?
8. Would Veterans find it helpful to receive a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments with instructions on how to check in? 

#### Secondary Questions 

9. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to find the call to action from the appointment detail pages?
10. Do Veterans expect to find information about whether an appointment has already completed pre-check-in? If so, from the appointment list page or detail pages?

# Methodology 

- Conducted a moderated usability study using a CodePen (accessible) prototype with 13 Veterans who had been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment in the last 12 months 
- 12 out of 13 Veterans used their smartphones
- 60 minute sessions with non AT users, 90 minute sessions with AT users 
- Veterans were tasked with completing the pre-check-in and check in processes, while providing feedback of their thoughts and actions along the way

# Hypothesis and Conclusions

## Primary Questions 

1. Do Veterans find the day before appointment reminder and pre-check-in notifications confusing?
     - LIKELY FALSE: All Veterans found the notifications easy to understand, but some didn't feel the pre-check-in content was actionable enough. 
2. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand that you still need to complete the online check-in process even if you’ve completed the pre-check-in process a few days before?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: All Veterans said that it was very clear that you still need to check in even after completing pre-check-in because it's a known behavior for VA medical appointments. 
3. How easy or difficult is it to check in to an appointment?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: All Veterans thought the process for checking in to an appointment was easy.
4. Do Veterans think the check in confirmation page provides enough information about the status of their check in and what to do next?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: All Veterans thought the information on the check in confirmation page was well organized and prioritized.
5. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand if their other upcoming appointments have tasks to complete? For example, another appointment needs to complete pre-check-in or can initiate a check-in.
     - LIKELY TRUE: All Veterans thought it was easy to understand and find out if their other upcoming appointments had tasks to complete from the confirmation pages and the appointments list. However, many Veterans didn't feel the content and design pattern on the confirmation pages was enough to incite action or, simply, had no interest in starting another task after their primary task was completed. 
6. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand the difference between the pre-check-in process and checking in to an appointment?
     - LIKELY TRUE: All Veterans understood the difference between the pre-check-in and check in process for VA medical appointments. However, it is difficult to simulate outside a real world scenario.
7. Do Veterans find it helpful to be able to review all of their other upcoming appointments during the pre-check-in and check-in processes?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans thought it was helpful to be able to review all of their upcoming appointments when completing pre-check-in or check-in. However, some Veterans had some concerns to make sure that it doesn't impose on the primary task that needs to be completed. 
8. Would Veterans find it helpful to receive a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments with instructions on how to check in?
     - LIKELY TRUE: All Veterans preferred receiving a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments compared to scanning a poster at the clinics. 

## Secondary Questions 

9. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to find the call to action from the appointment detail pages?
     - NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION
10. Do Veterans expect to find information about whether an appointment has already completed pre-check-in? If so, from the the appointment list page or detail pages?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans expected to see which of their upcoming appointments have already completed pre-check-in, especially if they just completed that process for one of their other appointments when returning to the appointments list.

# Key Findings

**1. 12 out of 12 Veterans felt that the two pre-check-in text reminders were not confusing.** However, 5 out of 12 Veterans expected a better call to action in the second text message to encourage them to select the pre-check-in link. 

**2. 10 out of 10 Veterans thought it was easy or very easy to check in to an appointment.** I.e., the design and content cues from the appointment page to the confirmation page were easily findable and felt very guided. 

**3. 9 of out 9 Veterans said that nothing was confusing about the organization or prioritization of the check-in confirmation page.** Veterans thought the most important information on the page was that they were checked in successfully, their appointment details, and that their travel reimbursement claim was submitted.  

**4. Similar to how some Veterans find the check in status on the appointments list helpful, Veterans expected to find a similar appointment confirmation or “your information is up to date” status for pre-check-in on the appointments list.**

**5. 9 out of 11 Veterans thought that it was helpful to be able to review all of their upcoming appointments when completing a pre-check-in or check-in task.** However, not if it decreases the ease of checking in or adds steps to the existing user flow. 

**6. 11 out of 11 Veterans thought it was easy to find out how to review their other upcoming appointments from the pre-check-in confirmation page.** However, some Veterans didn’t understand that they had other appointments with tasks to complete (based on the design pattern and content) or had no interest in starting another task after their primary task was completed. 

**7. 11 out of 11 Veterans prefer to receive a text message when it’s time to check in to their appointment.** And, 8 out of 11 Veterans would prefer to receive a text message before each of their appointments when they have more than one on the same day.

> "The first one was the initial confirmation and that's all I was expecting to see. And then, looking further down it appears that the VA wants me to take some more actions."

> "Well, do you have to do that? They just want to know the appointment is confirmed. I would probably not check my information."

> "I would be done. I mean I know my information is correct. So, I would be done."

> "Honestly, I wouldn't click the link because of time. If it said, you must confirm the information prior to your appointment. Something more directive."

> "Once it's confirmed, I generally don't do anything with it unless I need to add it to my calendar. If it was worded differently, I might do something. For example, if it said, please review this information, but know that your appointment is confirmed."

**2. 10 out of 10 Veterans thought it was easy or very easy to check in to an appointment.** I.e., the design and content cues from the appointment page to the confirmation page were easily findable and felt very guided. 

<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 4 20 05 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/101129355/90e64546-8d18-468c-afe1-b0e2a71b9c58"><br><br>

> "It's pretty much guided. Simple. Very easy."

> "Very easy. It was clear. It wasn't a lot of steps. It's not a bunch of extra steps."

> "The green arrow [Link - Action component] works for all the cues."

> "I'm not sure how you could make it easier. It's very quick and convenient."

> "I think maybe this process is a step or two longer than what it needs to be… But, the travel part saves you a step. You can do it right then and there. Like, going to that BTSSS part. So, I do like that travel part there."

> "I think about 3 or 4 times, it will be easier. It's way better than the kiosk with no voice output, especially with blind and low-vision Veterans. So, this is way easier."

However, the content in the "What to do next" in the appointment card was confusing to a few Veterans for minor reasons. Therefore, the appointment card could be simplified to avoid being redundant with the appointment information in the appointment list, as well as reduce cognitive load and align better with VA notification design patterns.

> "Well, it's listed twice. Is that just a reminder? I don't think it's needed to repeat the appointment."

> "The click to review your contact information, but I would probably combine those sentences so it's not so confusing. It's a little bit confusing where it has review your contact information and then upcoming appointment."

> "What to do next isn't super clear. I don't think it's too much information, but maybe just a wording issue. But, with screen readers, sometimes the headings are repetitive and I'm getting repetitive information on the next page."

**3. 9 of out 9 Veterans said that nothing was confusing about the organization or prioritization of the check-in confirmation page.** Veterans thought the most important information on the page was that they were checked in successfully, their appointment details, and that their travel reimbursement claim was submitted.

Some Veterans mentioned reviewing the content that directs them back to review their upcoming appointments list, but it was typically mentioned last because, unsurprisingly, it's positioned last on the page.

> "Making sure my travel reimbursement went in. So, that looks like it was successful. And, checking to make sure my appointment is at the right time and with the right doctor."

> "Wow, that's nice. I like that they are processing the reimbursement already. The most important thing is that I'm checked in and that they're working on my reimbursement already. I think that's pretty neat." 

>"Shows my appointment and that I'm checked in and it says we'll send you a text message with the status of your travel claim."

> "It shows me the appointment time and that they're processing the travel reimbursement. And, there's a thing to review upcoming appointments."

**4. Similar to how some Veterans find the check in status on the appointments list page helpful, Veterans expected to find a similar appointment confirmation or “your information is up to date” status for pre-check-in on the appointments list.**

> "Once it's confirmed, it should say it's confirmed because I have no way of knowing if these other ones are confirmed."

> "Absolutely. I would have expected to know if this appointment was confirmed. If I confirmed it 3 or 4 days ago, I would have no other place of knowing if I confirmed it."

> "My only question is, why can I only confirm some appointments and not the other ones?"

> "There's only 1 other appointment that says that I can confirm it and there's several others that I can't confirm. I feel like those haven't been confirmed. To me, the appointment doesn't seem confirmed." 

> "Interesting. None of the other appointments have anything else about confirming. I would put some information there that says confirmed so that they know I'm coming to the appointment."

**5. 9 out of 11 Veterans thought that it was helpful to be able to review all of their upcoming appointments when completing a pre-check-in or check-in task.** However, not if it decreases the ease of checking in or adds steps to the existing user flow. 

<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-27 at 2 01 37 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/101129355/35b4ee20-db80-4c3d-8964-04385c9cb1c1"><br><br>

> "It's nice to have that reminder there, especially if you have three appointments in one day or several appointments in one week. So, it's nice to be reminded of that."

> "I liked everything and that it was on one page. I didn't have to navigate to another page or window."

> "Very helpful because you tend to forget that you have appointments way out."

> "I did appreciate that. Especially because appointments are often changed."

> "I found it very helpful. From my own experience, I went to the doctor last month, and a day or two later, I went on the VA website and I was shocked [in a good way] that all my appointments up to December were there."

**6. 11 out of 11 Veterans thought it was easy to find out how to review their other upcoming appointments from the pre-check-in confirmation page.** 

<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-27 at 2 07 09 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/101129355/b1431d14-02fb-4a2b-829a-f160efed1a87"><br><br>

> "I would close it. I don't see anything to do. I would just wait for the text to confirm an appointment."

> "I would probably close it out. I mean, I might review my upcoming appointments. But, typically with VA, I get 4-5 text messages even after I've confirmed it to remind me and everything. So, it might be easier to confirm these now and not have to confirm it again."

> "I might go back to review upcoming appointments, but it doesn't really seem like it requires me to do anything. The message under review upcoming appointments doesn't seem like I have to do it. It just seems like I either can or can't."

> "If there's absolutely something for me to do, then I would use that arrow button again [Link - Action component]. To me it looks like it's not a requirement."

However, some Veterans didn’t understand that they had other appointments with tasks to complete (based on the design pattern and content) or had no interest in starting another task after their primary task was completed. 

Might complete additional tasks: 

> "Since the Friday appointment is so close, I would probably confirm that one."

> "I've done everything else that I can do for today's appointments. So, I would confirm the rest of the appointments."

> "I might check some of my other appointments to make sure I'm square. I probably wouldn't confirm or I might confirm my appointment on the ninth for ease just to get it done with."

Stick to the primary task: 

> "I don't want to confirm my appointment for Friday just yet; it's still Monday. I have two young kids at home that get into all kinds of trouble and there's no telling what I may be doing by Friday."

> "No, I wouldn't confirm an upcoming appointment because I've been conditioned that VA is going to send me text messages. So, when I'm on the VA web pages, I'm generally just there for more information. If I saw that, I would probably click on it and confirm, but that's not how the VA has conditioned me to respond to confirmation requests."

> "I wouldn't be worried about my upcoming appointments because I have appointments today. It wouldn't be a priority."

And, some Veterans were confused by seeing a different appointment card in the "What to do next" section when returning back to their appointments list after having completed their primary task. 

This could be another indicator of notification fatigue that many VFS teams have heard before, as well as cognitive overload. And, as a possible solution, stick to patterns that we know work well, such as presenting additional tasks within the context of the appointment list and not a separate section.

> "So, it's almost time to check in. Oh, I guess I tried to check in too early. It was confusing."

> "I have other appointments. I guess I don't know why it's focused on the one appointment on the ninth."

> "That's weird. Wasn't it different before on top? I would have thought it just started at upcoming appointments. You didn't want to confirm anything, so I didn't expect to see it at the top."

> "So, is this one a different one? So, have I not yet confirmed this one?"

**7. 11 out of 11 Veterans prefer to receive a text message when it’s time to check in to their appointment.** And, 8 out of 11 Veterans would prefer to receive a text message before each of their appointments when they have more than one on the same day. 

<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-27 at 2 17 03 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/101129355/95c8ecfb-05c5-4dda-abce-7cadb8334475"><br><br>

> "Text message for sure because there's posters hanging up all over the place. How am I going to know which one to go to unless it's right up at the nurses station? And, if I'm up there, why not just say, hey I'm here."

> "I just think that I'm so used to that. A lot of times posters could be often ignored because there's so much jargon when you walk in. There's information signs and posters and directions and it could be easily overlooked. Whereas, most people come in and they're all on their phones. So, I think that's a wonderful idea."  

> "10/10 I would take a text message over a poster. I have been to facilities where they put information on the wall. And, unless you have someone directing you to that wall, then you don't know where to look there. That's a rough way to get checked in to an appointment. Getting a text message is so user friendly. We're so conditioned to review a text message when we receive one. That's clearly the better way to go."

# Additional Insights

Veterans provided additional insights that will help to inform the PCI product and development roadmap:

# Recommendations

## Recommendations for *initial MVP release*

1. Change the pre-check-in text reminder to be simpler, while also inciting action. 
1. In the "What to do next" appointment card that contains the primary task, simplify the content for ease of use, while also differentiating it from the appointment in the upcoming appointments list. 
1. Ensure that Veterans understand if and why some appointments might not be listed in their upcoming appointments list and explain how to review their entire list. E.g., Appointments on VA.gov. 
1. When Veterans return back to their appointment list, avoid showing additional tasks to complete, unless there's an appointment inside the check in window. We want to avoid cognitive overload, while also allowing Veterans that want to complete other tasks to still review those tasks in the appointment list.  
1. Send a check in link text message 45 minutes before each Patient Check In (PCI) eligible appointment.
1. Update content on the identity verification pages to make it clear to Veterans that providing their last name and date of birth is the start of the process.

## Recommendations for *subsequent releases*

1. Add statuses within the upcoming appointments list for whether appointments have completed pre-check-in. I.e., we want Veterans to feel confident that an action took place. 
1. Work on finding a better design pattern and content to communicate to Veterans how many more PCI-related tasks they're able to complete after finishing their primary task.  
1. Begin planning for larger rollout of PCI with the inclusion of beneficiary travel. 
1. Find a better design solution (pairing with the Appointments and A11y specialists) that allows screen readers to better navigate longer lists of upcoming appointments.  
1. Work with the Platform Design System team and A11y specialists to troubleshoot the memorable date component to make it more accessible for screen readers. 
1. A/B testing of different design patterns on the initial appointments list page to ensure the main focus is on the primary PCI-related task. 

## Recommendations for *releases that may require other teams or larger architectural changes*

1. Continue to work towards reflecting all of a Veterans appointments in PCI, similar to Appointments on VA.gov. 
1. Allow Veterans to complete PCI tasks outside, to the degree possible, existing pre-check-in and check-in expiration rules. 
1. Continue to escalate the need for a centralized database of facility floor maps or directions to help Veterans wayfind to the building or clinic.  
1. Look to add features into PCI that are available in VEText appointment reminders and Appointments on VA.gov. For example, add to calendar and cancel appointment. 
1. If a Veteran completes pre-check-in for an upcoming appointment that hasn't been set as confirmed in VistA by VEText, then make sure the status update is sent to VistA so Veterans don't continue to receive appointment confirmation text reminders. Of course, they’ll continue to receive appointment reminders up until the day of their appointment.

## Who we talked to

Our goal was to stress test our prototype with an inclusive set of Veteran populations including those with cognitive disabilities, using screen magnification, using screen readers, etc. 

However, we weren’t able to successfully recruit and observe all underserved Veteran populations, including: 

- Other than honorable discharge
- Immigrant origin
- Expat (living abroad)
- Hispanic, Biracial, Asian and Native
- LGBTQ+<br><br>
