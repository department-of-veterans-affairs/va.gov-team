# Research Plan and Conversation Guide: Check-In (Veteran-Facing) In-person Discovery Research

## Plan
- Researchers will go to the VAs in San Francisco, Seattle, and Durham to observe as many Veterans as possible checking in for their appointments via the kiosk or with a staff member.
  - Martha Wilkes will be observing in Durham.
  - Ming Ligh will be observing in Seattle.
  - Steve and Kimberly McManus will be observing in San Francisco.

## Session setup
For this research, we will be intercepting veterans at VAMC to ask them about their experience while checking in for their appointment(s). We will be asking to observe them as they check in for their appointment(s) either using the kiosk, directly with VA staff, or using “I am here.” Prior to interviewing and observing the veteran, the moderator should be prepared to have the veteran complete a consent form (to be provided).

## Introduction (2 minutes)
Hi, my name is Martha, Steve, Kimberly, or Ming. I am working with the VA to try and improve the check-in experience for veterans like yourself. Do you have a few minutes to talk to me about your experience in checking in for appointments at the VA?  
- Are you here for an appointment? 
  - If yes, ask the type of appointment(s)?
  - If no, ask them the reason for their visit. Probe if they mention pharmacy, opticals, labs, or beneficiary travel. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 15 to 20 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you too long so you are not late for your appointment.
- **We want hear your personal experience and honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or have an experience you liked, we want to know about it. Understanding your story will help us create better check in experience for veterans, like you. We will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Health can be a personal topic.** I understand that there may be aspects about your experience that you do not want to share with us. If you’d rather not answer a question, please just let me know and we can skip it.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the our discussion, please let me know.** This is a voluntary session, and I will not be offended in any way if we need to stop.
- Researchers- **PLEASE NOTE: We cannot record the session.** But can take notes and can take pictures with their consent. Please let the veterans know our notes/pictures will not be shared and will only be used to help jot our memory. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we proceed?

## Background (5 minutes)
To get started, I’d like to get a little background information about you, and your experience with the VA.
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (Moderator can prompt the participant: where they live, branch of military, work or hobbies).
- Do you manage any of your VA health benefits online? 
  - Where do you do that? 
  - What do you do online?
  - When you are managing your benefits online, what device do you typically use? 
- Do you have a mobile phone or tablet? If so, what type and have them show you their phone/tablet, if possible.
- Do you use your phone to manage your health? 
  - (If yes) What apps do you use? 
  - What do you use them for?

## Check-In Experience (15 minutes)
Great, thank you. Now I’d like to ask you a few questions about your experience checking in to your appointment.
- Do you recall how you scheduled the appointment you’re going to today? (Over the phone, online?)
  - If online, which website did you use to schedule? 
  - Is that how you typically schedule appointments? (Note if their behavior has changed due to Covid). 
- Once you scheduled your appointment, what happened?
  - Did you receive any appointment reminders? (Note whether these are VEText, email, or mail reminders.)
- How did you know where to go for your appointment today?  
- When you have an appointment at the VA, what do you typically do to check in for your appointment?
- Has checking in for an appointment changed with COVID-19? How?
- Ask if you can observe them while checking in for their appointment.
- Did they get a reminder about their appointments? 
- Did they have to complete the COVID screener before entering the facility?
- How many in-person appointments has the veteran had since the beginning of the pandemic/COVID-19?

### Things to watch for
- The action the veterans takes, such as:
  - They go to the kiosk
  - They walk up to the welcome desk, staff
  - They used “I am here”
- If they use the kiosk to check in
  - Observe how they check in - SSN + DOB? or VHIC? 
  - Observe if they are prompted to update any information. 
  - Observe what the “home screen” looks like
  - Ask what they like and don’t like about the check-in experience
  - Observe what happens when they have completed check in
    - Are they asked to proceed to their provider office?
    - Are they asked to wait in a centralized area?
  - What other tasks/actions do they do at the kiosk?
  - Any feedback that could make this process better
- If they checked in with directly with a staff 
  - Observe if there is a line and how are they queued?
  - Observe how many staff members are checking veterans in
  - What type of questions do they ask the veterans?
  - After checking in, what do veterans or staff do?

- Did they check-in in their vehicle? If so, what did they do? How did they like it?
- Overall, how did you like your check-in experience today?
  - If the experience was positive, what did they like about it?
  - If the experience was not positive, what can be improved?
- How would you feel if you had the option to check-in using your mobile phone, instead of the kiosk (or front desk, as applicable)? Probe deeper to understand their preference for checking in as needed. 
- If you had a magic wand and you can check in for your appointment any way you would like, what would that experience look like.

## Thank you and closing (2 minutes)
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us and allowing us to learn more about the check-in process today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on improving the check-in experience.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
