### Warm up questions - 3 minutes 

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
> Yes

> Yes.

- What device are you using to join this session today?
> iPhone

### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > The last time I filed it was a new process. They they had us click on a link. I don't recall it was a few months back, but I don't really recall exactly, but I know there was a link instead of turning in the the paper forms. There's a new link that you go to and it opens up a website. And you put the information in like that.
  > If I remember, it was a little frustrating initially, but it went smooth, I believe, if I remember correctly.
  > I don't remember exactly what it was, but I know initially I had some trouble like trying to figure trying to figure everything out with with the site. But I don't know if it was trying to get logged in or creating an account, or what exactly it was, but I remember it was a little frustrating in the beginning.
- But you did manage to get that filed?
  > Yes
- Can you tell me about your experience filing with a paper form?
  > It's a little, I don't know. I feel it's a little tedious. Having to fill out the papers, and then turn them in and wait for the turnaround time to be reimbursed for the appointments and everything. But it's a pretty, I guess you could say it's a fairly simple process just filling out the form, but you just have to remember to to grab the form on your way out from the appointment otherwise you have to wait until your next appointment to get a form.
- How did online compare to using the form?
  > It seemed to be a little bit quicker. I think it's more more convenient, because after after you leave your appointment, you could just click on that link and file your travel claim.

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > It could be like automatic like if if you had an appointment and you checked in and completed your appointment like once your appointment was completed, it it would process automatically.
- Okay. And so would there be anything at all that you'd have to do? Or it would just be completely the background
  > Maybe just checking in for like the the address you checked in from, or something like that.
  > Or if not like, done automatically. The the Va send you like a text message that you just click on and just confirm the appointment details, confirm the address, and then once you click, submit this, or confirm information, then it's automatically processed.

- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)
  > I think they're similar because, you're still being compensated for taking the time to get to one of your appointments that's dealing with what whatever it is that you're receiving a compensation for. So you you're not having to come out of pocket to travel to get that care for something you sustained during military service or whatever. So I think that's where it's similar.
