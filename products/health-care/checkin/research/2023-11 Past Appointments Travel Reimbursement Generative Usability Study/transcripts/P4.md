### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > The last time I filed it was a new process. They they had us click on a link. I don't recall it was a few months back, but I don't really recall exactly, but I know there was a link instead of turning in the the paper forms. There's a new link that you go to and it opens up a website. And you put the information in like that.
  > If I remember, it was a little frustrating initially, but it went smooth, I believe, if I remember correctly.
  > I don't remember exactly what it was, but I know initially I had some trouble like trying to figure trying to figure everything out with with the site. But I don't know if it was trying to get logged in or creating an account, or what exactly it was, but I remember it was a little frustrating in the beginning.
- But you did manage to get that filed?
  > Yes
- Can you tell me about your experience filing with a paper form?
  > It's a little, I don't know. I feel it's a little tedious. Having to fill out the papers, and then turn them in and wait for the turnaround time to be reimbursed for the appointments and everything. But it's a pretty, I guess you could say it's a fairly simple process just filling out the form, but you just have to remember to to grab the form on your way out from the appointment otherwise you have to wait until your next appointment to get a form.
- How did online compare to using the form?
  > It seemed to be a little bit quicker. I think it's more more convenient, because after after you leave your appointment, you could just click on that link and file your travel claim.

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > It could be like automatic like if if you had an appointment and you checked in and completed your appointment like once your appointment was completed, it it would process automatically.
- Okay. And so would there be anything at all that you'd have to do? Or it would just be completely the background
  > Maybe just checking in for like the the address you checked in from, or something like that.
  > Or if not like, done automatically. The the Va send you like a text message that you just click on and just confirm the appointment details, confirm the address, and then once you click, submit this, or confirm information, then it's automatically processed.

- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)
  > I think they're similar because, you're still being compensated for taking the time to get to one of your appointments that's dealing with what whatever it is that you're receiving a compensation for. So you you're not having to come out of pocket to travel to get that care for something you sustained during military service or whatever. So I think that's where it's similar.


### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**

> Reminder and claim. Ok yeah. I mean this is cool, too, because I don't think I've ever gotten a reminder for to to file the travel reimbursement.

- Is there anything confusing about this information?
> No, it's pretty self-explanatory.

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?
  > It's how I would would expect an email from the VA. Yeah, there's there's nothing, really that that stands out or anything.

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.
> Click on sign in to va.gov to start your claim.
> And then I click on one of these to to get logged in.

**Appointment list**

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Was there anything confusing about that process? 
  > I think I used to use DS log on. But when I tried logging in with Ds log on (on va.gov), there was some type of error message popped up. And that part's just a little frustrating. But no, not that. Nothing confusing. I know each one leads to the the same thing.

- Where were you expecting to end up?
  > This right here is fine. Because it's taking you directly into what you're going to. You don't have to try and navigate, to try to get to what it is you're - where you're trying to go. It gives you the link right there to file your travel reimbursement. So that's that's fine.

- Now let’s take a look at what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
  > It gives you notification on how much time you have left to file your claims. Shows your upcoming appointments. Yeah, just looks like a Va page like that. Nothing really stands out.

- Is there anything confusing here?
  > No

- What would you do next?
  > Click on the file for travel reimbursement link.
  
- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
  > That screen minimize, so you could see what's what's behind it.
  
- Would that'd be something you'd do?
  > Yeah, that I was I was trying to when you -

- And if you did select to close it, what would you expect to happen to the information there? 
  > I was still expect that that link for the - It like it, should minimize to like how that blue arrow is next to file for travel, reimbursement. If you click on that, it would open this little screen back up, or if you click it, it will close it back to just the link.
  
- Okay? So you're saying the file for travel reimbursement link would stay there. But the information above it would not.
  > Right.

- And what would you expect to happen if you did not close this?
  > Yeah, what do you mean? It would just be in the way.

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next to file that claim.
  
**Intro page**

> I'm just reading over each one before just reading what it says.
> So here I would then just go ahead and file mileage only, if that's what I was filing.

-Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  > Yeah, I didn't understand the check your eligibility. I didn't understand why that was there, especially if you're sending me a link saying to file your travel claim, that's kind of like contradictve. You're telling me to file a claim, but then it's saying "check to see if you're eligible to file a claim." So that's that's kind of confusing.

- And how clear are the steps for filing a travel reimbursement claim?
  > Pretty clear. You just click on click on the links.

- And how clear are the 2 options for filing a claim?
  > They're clear, pretty clear.

- And can you tell me a little bit more about the numbers to the left of this information, how you perceive that those?
  > Like, basically, it's the steps to get your claim filed.

- Go ahead and continue

**Review page**

- Anything confusing about this page?
  > Nope, nothing confusing.

- Ok, go ahead and continue.

**Success page**

- Talk to me about this page and the information included here.
  > It's pretty common. Just let you know that your claim's been processed and lets you know what's going on next. Yes, it's pretty self-explanatory, nothing tricky or anything like that.

- Tell me about your understanding of what's happened to your claim.
  > That is been submitted to the VA and now that it's just you just a waiting game, just waiting for them to go ahead and process it. So like, basically my part is done now.

- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > I guess this is what I expected to with filing a claim. Like I said, aside from not receiving emails, saying like reminding you, or urging you, to file a claim. But everything else is pretty expected.

- And did you notice this claim mentions 2 appointments?
  > Ya I didn't notice that. But I see it now.
  > I think maybe if they had both the appointments like the times that would be - because, like, I just submitted it and, before you said something, I would think I would have the file a claim for the second appointment.
  > If you read it, this claim includes 2 appointments on. But maybe if you listed the appointment dates and times that that be crystal clear. Then it's like, okay, so these 2 claims have been filed.

- And so why do you think that the second appointment is included here when you've gone through the process of filing just once?
  > Because it was included in the like in the beginning. When you first logged in it said for these 2, it showed both appointment dates and times.

- And would you expect that 2 appointments like that would be included in one process of a claim?
  > I would expect that. Yeah. I guess.

-  And what would you expect to happen next with your claim?
  > It to just be processed and be reimbursed.

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?
  > I guess clicking on the review --  like what kind of questions?

- If you just wanted to know more about the claim now that it was filed.
  > I guess you just click, review your claim.

- Go ahead and and do that.

- So I'm curious. Where did you expect that link to take you? And is that different or the same as where it took you.
  > Definitely not here. But that's that's the thing with like clicking on VA links like they'll take you to a completely different website. But I would think that it would go to like, open up a page that shows something to deal with your claim that you just filed, that it's processing or "received by such and such" or something of that nature. Not having this entire page and try to figure out where to click on next.

- So then, did you notice the review? Your past appointments link?
  > Yes

- Where did you expect that to take you?
 > To the list of your past appointments, but that's what what was kind of confusing, too, because it said, you can check the status of your claim by going to the appointment details page for this appointment, and then it says, review your past appointment. So is it gonna take me to that details appointment details, page, or is it just gonna take me to the list of my past appointments?
> The verbiage above it is just a little confusing. It's it says you can check the status of your claim by going to the appointment details page of your past appointments, but then it says, it just says, review your past appointments. So it should be like, I would think that's gonna take me to my appointments list via the appointments details page.

-  Ok, let's try that.

**Past appointments page**

-  Is this where you expected to go?
  > Yeah. But like I said the verbiage up top says you could review your claim at the appointments details page. But this isn't really the appointment details page. This is what I expected that link to send me to because this says past appointments. There's like no deep (link?)

- Knowing that you're looking for the details page, how would you find that?
  > I don't know. There's there's no like dropdown menu, or maybe maybe you have to click on each one of your appointments I'd assume?

- Okay, do you wanna try that for the second one? Tell me about this page now and what you were expecting.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**

  > This is the page I would expect that that link would have sent sent me to since it said appointment details page. Basically what I what I would expect under the appointment details.

- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  > I have no idea.

- Overall on this page, can you tell me about what is most important for you here?
  > I don't know what you mean by like, what's most important. But I guess that it's got the details of the appointment.

- And did you notice the travel reimbursement section there at the bottom?
 > Oh, yeah, I see that under the details.

- I know we came here to learn more about your status, is this what you expected to find?
  > Yeah, I guess you just gotta jump through a few more hoops to to get to that. But yeah, it's leading you that way. Where I see where now you'd click review your claim.

- Okay. and where would you expect that link to go?
  > Like basically to where it's at in the processing, like it has been received, is in process and posted to your account, or posting soon, or something like that.

- Go ahead and select that link.
  > (laughs) Typical, but definitely not what I expected. Well, it's what I expected, because I'm used to deal with the VA. But it's not what I expect talking to you, saying like, I would expect it to show me a screen that says where my claim is.
  

### Task #2: BTSSS status questions - 10 minutes

- Submitted for Payment
  > They're all pretty self explanatory.
  > I'd expect that my claim has been submitted, and I'm just waiting to be paid.
 
- Payment Canceled
  > For some reason there's an issue, and the reimbursement was canceled.
 
- Denied
  > My claim was denied for some reason.

- Approved for Payment
  > That, after it's been submitted, is now sent and approved status, and it's just way to be processing.

- In Manual Review
  > It didn't go through like the automatic process and that it had to be looked over.

- On Hold
  > It's on hold for some reason. I didn't understand that one. That would make me think like either it could possibly be in manual review. It was incomplete. It has possibly been denied, it's like up in the air.

- Saved
  > I don't understand what that would be.

- Claim Paid
  > Self-explanatory. I've been reimbursed.

- Incomplete
  > Something is missing.

- Fiscal Rescinded
  > No idea

- Claim Submitted
  > I've submitted my claim for processing.

- Which of these terms are most important for you to know during the process?
  > Probably approved for payment.

- Are there any that are not important?
  > I don't know what fiscal rescinded is. That would be the only one. Everything else would be important to to my claim being submitted and me finding out where it is, as far as the status.
  
  > I think On Hold shouldn't be there, or is. It should have a a different term. Something because in manual review could have your claim on hold as well, like just saying, On, Hold, that like leaves you in limbo wondering what's going on.

- Were there any other terms you expected to be here that were not included?
  > Probably claim received cause. It says claim submitted, and then I would think after claims submitted there would be  claim received cause it could have could've got stuck somewhere. I would expect to them to verify "okay, we received your claim." Other than that that's it.
