### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > Yes, so I actually submitted a claim almost 4 weeks ago. I used the BTSSS site and logged in with my DS Login information, the username and password. Once I got into the system, and it, of course, asks you your security questions, they send you a link to put in to verify it. Once I go through the link to verify, it gives me a message that says, "Please wait, we're gathering your information." I recently had to update my banking information on the site. They have a disclaimer to send - I wanna say effective sometime this year - that claims are being sent electronically. I believe they're trying to get away from some paper checks. And if we don't have updated bank information on file, it can delay receiving any type of travel reimbursement.
  
  > So I updated my information. Then I went in to create a claim. The system gives you a chance to see any appointments that you have. For the most part, some of the my apartments do pop up. I don't know if it's something that the clinics have to do on their end to close it out or whatever the case may be. They will pop up, and then I can go in to create a claim that way. If my appointment does not show up automatically, I will have to go in the system and create a claim, so I have to go in and report the, manually put in information for the appointment, put in a clinic name, the address, the date of the claim, I mean the date of the appointment, the time, and an address for that. I put that information in, if I have to manually create the appointment I put it in, then I initiate the "create the claim" portion. Go in, put my starting address, my home address where I left from and which appointment I went to. It's usually [clinic] is where the majority of my appointments are. If I have to go see my PCM for something, that's a different address, and as a matter of fact, I just had an appointment yesterday in [location] that I have to probably go in today and try to create the claim for that as well.
  
  > So put that information in. It would ask me questions: What am I trying to claim? It gives you the options when you toggle through the system of mileage, food, options such as that. So I always claim the mileage portion. And it actually, if it's a one way trip or round trip, I put one round trip, and sometimes the system will act right to where I can get the information in. I will honestly say the last few times, and prior to disappointment when I had to create a claim, the system used Bing maps, and for whatever reason that system is down for Bing maps, so a lot of times I have issues trying to even create, um complete the claim because if Bing's maps is not working, it won't pull up any data. So that's the only downside with using the BTSSS portal is Bing maps has been acting that way for a while. Even when I was doing claims last year as well. It's a hit and miss with trying to get that claim to link with the Bing maps, if you do it electrically. That's been my experience with it.

- Ok, and you said that that has been happening since last year. Does that prevent you, then, from filing your claim?
  > So prior to when the VA came out with now everything has to be done within 30 days, prior to that I would go in and try at least once a week to try to get it to work, and it will always be a hit and miss. But eventually I guess the system decide to communicate with Bing maps and it worked. Now with me it's more concerning because if a claim is not filed within 30 days of the appointment date, it's not gonna be approved for travel reimbursement. So that's the issue I have. I haven't went in today, but I'm going to go in today because I have to and create the other claim from the appointment for Monday or Tuesday. But that's been issue with the previous appointment that I filed.

- And just to make sure I'm understanding, have you had any claims at all that you haven't been able to file because of that? Or have they all eventually worked out so far?
  > Since I've used the system with travel reimbursement, I've claimed 5. I put in for 5 claims for mileage reimbursement. I've only had 2 that were denied.

- Do you create multiple claims for different appointments on the same day? If you ever have 2 appointments during one visit to a facility?
  > I have not had the experience yet. I will have it coming up soon, because I have, uh it won't be until 2024. I have a couple of appointments in February that's gonna end up being like that. So I have not used that option yet where I created multiple claims yet for the same day, however, I have went in and did multiple claims. They were different dates, but I was able to select both and be able to fill the information out. Once I was able to complete one, if bing maps was working, and it pushed that one through for a manual review, then I can go back and and do the other one.

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how youâ€™d want it, what would it be like? 
  > One, if Bing maps is down, if the system was able to use another map system like Google Maps or something else, that will work in case that system is down. Also, I know it gives you the options to upload items if you need to, I guess, like receipts or something like that, but I wish it would give you the option where you can go in and click the option of if you want your travel reimbursement to go via your bank account electronically, or if you'd rather receive a check.


- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)
  > I mean, which way?
  > As far as like with the travel reimbursement claims, in a sense of being able to initiate them through the system, I don't wanna say it's tedious because if the information is in the system, it's easy going, it's good. I think it's to me it's about the same as if I'm doing a claim through the VA with the system, because even with the doing a claim through the VA if the site is down, or there's something glitching, or the system is getting ready for update, it's gonna shut down as well. You can go to try to upload something, or you can go to try to fill out a form, and it was not available right now or they send a message "We're having issues finding the information at this time." So the systems I think they're pretty much the same sometimes when it comes to that, having access to certain information.

### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**

- Anything confusing about the email?
  > No, there was nothing confusing about the email.

- Go ahead and review this page
  > So I'm going over the information, reading the notification that I got. So I see that it has my appointments listed. So I'm going to click on the "sign in to va.gov to start your claim" link. I clicked that link. It gives me different options to sign in the login.gov, id.me, DS login, and myhealthevet. I usually use the ds login.
  

**Appointment list**

> Once I click on that it brings me to the appointments page, and it has different arrows (action links). One of them is start scheduling. There's one that's opened and says File a travel reimbursement claim. It also gives you a bolded disclaimer that says that I have 25 days left to file the claim for these two appointments that I had on the 13th of November at the Cheyenne VA medical center. So, also lists my upcoming appointments that I have as well. I'm going to click on the tab that says file for travel reimbursement.

- Anything confusing about this process so far?
  > No, no confusion so far with this once I log in. Everything is here. Even let me know about the claims, how many days I got left is bold, so I could see it's not blending in with the other information.

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next to file that claim.
  
**Intro page**

- Go ahead and review this page
  > Ok, clicking on the file for travel reimbursement link. Once I open that up, it gives me the page, and once again it gives me a reminder that I have 25 days left to file for appointments on the thirteenth of November, at the Cheyenne VA Medical Center.
  
  > So it gives different options. It gives you where you can check your eligibility. Eligibility to see if you're eligible for healthcare travel reimbursement. It gives you the second option to file your claim. It gives you to wear if you're filing a mileage-only travel claim, or if you're filing a travel claim with receipts. And also it gives you to check the status of your claim, which is the third step.

-Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  > No, nothing I can find that's confusing, because they also give you arrows (additional info dropdown), so you can get more information on the first step when it says, Check your eligibility. It gives you a list to let you know if you're eligible or not, and once again it lets you know in bold. It lets you know that at least one of these must be true. So everything that you need to know in this first step is bolted out so you could see. It's not blending in with the normal text. So nothing confusing on this page.

- And how clear are the steps for filing a travel reimbursement claim?
  > The steps are clear. They are very clear.

- And how clear are the 2 options for filing a claim?
  > So when I look at the 2 options for this one, it gives you information about what is considered a claim only mileage. So it gives you information there. It gives you examples like if you are claiming expenses like lodging, meals, or tolls, unless you know, you can file through the BTSS System, or you can file by mail, email, or fax. And also when it says file with claim with receipts, if you look up at the top it says "if claiming only mileage, you can file online right now. We'll ask you a few questions. You won't need receipts." If anything with that, I would probably try to bold something in there to grab the veteran's attention or the caregiver's attention if they're filing, because it's letting you know that if you're only doing a claim only mileage, then you don't have to worry about receipts, but it gives you option to file a travel claim with receipts.

- What would you want to be bolded? Or what's most important?
  >  If I look at step 2 where it says file your claim, the first part of the paragraph where it says "if your claiming mileage only," I would suggest if it's possible, if they can bold the "if you're claiming only mileage" verbiage right there to prompt the person that's file the claim that, hey all you have to do is click that link right below you.

- Ok, go ahead and continue.

**Travel pages**

> Okay, so I'm gonna file a mileage-only travel claim. I click on the link and it's asking me again, are you claiming only mileage and no other expenses today? And once again it gives you a drop down that says if you have other expenses like receipts, if you need to submit any of that stuff, you can't file a claim right now, but you can file your claim online 24/7 through the BTSSS. My suggestion again is when you click that toggle down button, and unless you know if you are submitting receipts, if there's some way where it can bold the "you can't file a claim right now" portion, just to once again inform the person filing the claim like, okay, I can't do anything right here.

>  So I asked you, are you claiming only mileage and no other responses? I'm going to click Yes.

> I click the Yes tab, and it brings me to the next page where it says, did you travel from your home address? Answer Yes if you travel from the address listed here. And you certify that it's not a post office box. So my address is showing up so you can see if that's the address. If this is my address, I'm going to click Yes.

**Review page**

> Once I click Yes, it gives me the page where it says, review your travel claim. And once again it wants you to confirm the information is correct before you submit your claim and gives you the information. Actually, what are you claiming? Mileage-reimbursement only? Did you travel in your own vehicle, and where you travel from? Whichever the address is you travel from as long as it is not a po box.

> I like how it also has, up in the right hand corner across from claim information, it gives you the option to edit. So if you need to change some information in it, you can do that before you go through with your claim.

> Once you go down the shaded area, Beneficiary travel agreement, it gives you the agreement that you need to read, and then you know that if you are submitting type of false or fictitious information for a claim that you know you can face criminal and civil penalties, and by submitting this claim you agree to the beneficiary travel agreement. And once again, it gives you a button to pull down, and lets you review and certify the statements are true in regards to your claim.

> And once you get done reading over all that goodness, if everything is good to go far as that claim and none of that affects you in any way, you can click that "I confirm that the information is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. I read and I accept the beneficiary travel agreement." It does let you know that this is required. I know, in this portion, right here it has aterisk for strict importance. A suggestion I will make is if they can bold that just once again. So everyone knows okay you cannot go any further unless you click this.

- Anything confusing about this page?
  > No, nothing confused me on this page.

- Ok, go ahead and continue.

**Success page**

- Talk to me about this page and the information included here.
  > Once I submit my claim, I get a green shadow box. This is we're processing your claim. And once again information that I put in there, the 2 appointments that I had on that day. And it lets me know I don't need it to do anything else. It also gives me my claim number for reference, and it gives you the information of what happens next for me to know what I can do, how to review my claim, how to review past appointments. And if I need to set up a direct deposit for travel pay and reimbursement, it lets me know how to do that as well.

- Tell me about your understanding of what's happened to your claim.
  > So my understanding is that my, I get my portion on from my end to where I submit for my mileage, put in the information, my address, the system appointments are pulled up for me, so I was able to, you know, verify the information. Once I got my claim, and it says submitted, I am under impression that it's been sent up to where it can be reviewed, and make sure that the appointment is checked out to be true, that yes, I did actually had the appointment, it wasn't canceled or anything, or I wasn't a no show. And I am just waiting to get that claim approved and wait for the the mileage reimbursement to appear either in my account or to be mailed to me.


- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > In the prototype it's easier and it went quick versus dealing with the system currently. So I like how the process was easy. It's quick. It doesn't have all the other different stages I have to go to to actually log into the system where you have to put in the identification code, then you have to wait for the system to accept it, then the system has to put up all your data. It went straight to work.

- And did you notice this claim mentions 2 appointments?
  > Yes, I do.


- And why do you think the second appointment is included when we went through the filing process just once?
  > I believe because the system recognized that both appointments were at the same medical center and on the same date. So instead of me having to go through, do on a claim, go out, submit it, and then do another claim, the system recognized "Hey you had 2 appointments at that same treatment facility on the same date, paying both of them at the same time.

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?
  > So if I so have any questions in regards to my claim, and if I scroll down and of course it lets you know what's happens next. If you go down, the screen has the need help section as well there, even though it's mentioning things about scheduled appointments or technical issues with a VA appointment or anything like that.  Let's see. That is interesting. Because even when I'm down here reading, it's just everything dealing with an appointment.

- And what would you expect to be there?
  > If you have any questions or concerns in regards to your travel reimbursement claim this is the number you can call, or this is the email contact, or something like that. And the need help section has leap feedback about this application.

- Go ahead and and do that.

- Did you notice the review your claim link in under your claim number?
  > Yes, I do. I just clicked on it. It takes me to a screen that says VA travel reimbursement and on this page it gives you information about flining claims, eligibility for general healthcare, travel reimbursement, what to do before you file first, questions you may have about following your claim, and more information about travel pay reimbursement. So it gives you 5 different links there.
  
- Where did you expect that link to take you? 
  > I was expecting it to take me to my claim so I can look at it and see the status of it to see if it's in manual review. If it's been approved, if it's been denied. That's what I'm expecting to see.

- So then, did you notice the review? Your past appointments link?
  > Yes, I did

**Past appointments page**

- (Moderator prompts participant to select that link)
  > So when I click on the view my past appointments link. It pulls up my past appointments. It shows the 2 appointments that was on the thirteenth. It showed one on the fourteenth as well, with whose? By phone, and then it shows me one that I had on the fifteenth at the same clinic. But it says I have one task to complete.

- And what do you think that that one task to complete is referring to?
  > With the one test to complete? I am not sure I don't know if that's something that will be on my end. Did I need to complete? Or if that's something on a clinic in it need to be complete. I noticed when a few times that I had done my travel claims in the system. It will say a form and check out, so I don't know if there's something in the system from that claim to where they need to go and say yes. This patient or this veteran actually came to the appointment and got seen, and then they closed that form it out. Already. Check that patient out once they lead it.

**Appointment details page with CTA**

- You can go ahead and select that appointment.
  > so I click the appointment where it says, one test to complete a I'm reading information I'm going through to see what it is. Oh, it's once again. It gives. It gives you the information that the file for tribal reimbursement. I have 23 days left to file.  It has a link, says, after visit Summary, where I can go to the after visit summary. it lets me know where and when the appointment was, which was on the fifteenth of November. are who the provider was? The street address of it, and it gives me the option to print.

- What do you think that that one task to complete is refer was referring to?
  >Only thing I can think of is because I have 23 days to file for tribal reimbursement is to file a trial file for tribal reimbursement, because it gives me that link there as an option to click to solve for it.

- Okay, I'll have you go back to the pass appointment list and select the second appointment.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**

  > So I selected my past appointment and saying, Goodness, it gives me the link an option to click on the after visit. Summary and it gives me an option at the bottom, where it says, travel reimbursement. and gives a course to my claim number status in manual review and gives me the option to review my claim.

-So this was one of the appointments that we filed for. How does this compare with what you were expecting to find on this page?
  > It compares to what I expected to see gives you the status of the claim. Of course, the claim number again. And yeah, it it expected. It's what I expected to see when I click on this.

- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  > I believe because it's an appointment for mental health that they did not want to disclose what the appointment was for.


### Task #2: BTSSS status questions - 10 minutes

- Submitted for Payment
  > It's letting me know that I completed my claim. I submitted just to try to get reimbursed for travel
 
- Payment Canceled
  > That's one of those I will need clarification on. I don't know if it's because it's denied. I don't know if 2 or 3 would go hand in hand if it was denied, and then payment canceled, or if they double paid. I don't know about that one.
 
- Denied
  > 

- Approved for Payment
  > Which means, after they did their manual review, everything for that claim was checked out and verified, and they approved for payment to be dispensed.

- In Manual Review
  > 

- On Hold
  > When I see on hold, I think of that maybe that some information is missing for that claim in regards to the appointment, or if the a caregiver or veteran need to update some more information or send in some more documentation on their end, and that claim is just on hold until then.

- Saved
  > You know things happen, systems shut down, or like in my case, I'm still waiting for Bing maps to communicate with the system. So the system automatically saved your process where you're at now, so you don't have to go through and repeat the steps once you log in again.

- Claim Paid
  > Claim paid is just that the claim was approved. They dispense the funds. You received the funds either by check or in your bank account, and it just updated to that that claim was paid.

- Incomplete
  > I don't know if incomplete would go hand in hand with on hold, or if that could be one of the reasons why. Incomplete could be anything, some additional information documentation is missing to verify the appointment, or the appointment was not closed out all the way on a facility end, so right now that or if the claim is missing receipts or information like that, it's considered incomplete before you can submit it.

- Fiscal Rescinded
  > I am not sure what that one will be for Number 10. I don't know if it's because every fiscal year the budget has to be reviewed, or whatever the case may be, and the money's put on hold. I'm not sure what fiscal rescinded it means.

- Claim Submitted
  > You submitted your claim.

- Which of these terms are most important for you to know during the process?
  > I believe all of them to be important. I just don't know about fiscal rescinded, if that's something that needs to be seen because I don't know what it would pertain to, but other than Number 10 I feel like all of them are important to be seen.
