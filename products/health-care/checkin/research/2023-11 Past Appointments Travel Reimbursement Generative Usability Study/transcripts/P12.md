### Warm up questions - 3 minutes 

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
  > Yes

- Have you used the appointments tool on Va. Gov. To schedule and manage your health appointments before?
  > I've used the appointment option to check on times and dates. I've never scheduled one, though normally I'll send the out patient clinic I go to a message if I need to schedule an appointment.
  
- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
  > Yeah, I use text check in now and what they do now is offer me that opportunity after I complete text check in to automatically apply for travel pay. That was on the 29th of November was the last time.

- And is that the only method that you've used so far to to file?
  > No, prior to text check-in and the options to file then, I went to the btsss site. I'm not terribly comfortable with that, because, I mean I managed get through it, but it's not as simple as I would prefer it to be. It was brand new to me to file my own travel request. So sometimes it's been not quite as specific as they wanted, and that could have been why it was declined. I'm not sure. But I would prefer a little more simplicity on that site.

- What device are you using to join this session today?
  > I'm using an iPhone.

- And are you using a screen magnification tool at all today?
  > I have my text pumped up a little bit, that's all.

### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > I've also, I will tell you I've also used the link via MyHealtheVet to get into the travel pay URL, and then I think there was even after the second URL where I sign in, I finally get to the BTSSS site. The last time was, as I said, via text check-in, and that was a breeze. I just clicked on the button that said, 'yeah let's take care of it now,' and I got a response that it was automatically submitted.

   > Prior to that, to me, it's really difficult. I have to wonder when I file on my own, which specific sites should I certainly go to the first time, and I'm not quite sure what that would be. So I tried the myhealthevet site. There's a link there to go to travel pay. I believe from there I sign in via login.gov. and then I think I reached the BTSSS site.
   
   > And then I go - there's another option. I can't remember now, where where do I go? See what it is? It's complicated. Because there's more than one site. I think I go to Va.Gov actually, if I can't figure it out via the myhealthevet site I'll go to va.gov. I'm not sure if there's a travel pay link there. I believe there is, but I'm not sure.
   
   > So what I've done is bookmarked the beneficiary travel URL and and I can go directly to that now, I believe. There's also another one I just remembered. So it is complicated - eAuthorization. I think it's eauth.va.gov. So there's too many. I wanna be able to know what the default site is to go to, touch a couple of buttons, and be done with it. It's complicated for me, so I have to believe it's complicated for other Vets as well. This is not rocket science for me. I've been at this for years online and whatnot, with Macs and Windows, but this particular exercise has me sometimes running in circles. 

- How's your experience been? When you have reached the portal and have used it
  > Well, when I have to input the info on my own, that's another issue, because it has to be very specific, and there are occasions where, for example, my appointment might be at 11 o'clock in the morning and the provider doesn't take me until, let's say, 11:17. Apparently the Beneficiary Travel Office needs to know the exact time it started and the exact time that it ended, my appointment, and I have to be either very careful that I remember, or jot down notes, or take a screenshot or something, or it's not gonna be approved because they will suggest the time doesn't exist, with no explanation. The travel office should know that I made the appointment, certainly. There should be some sort of electronic give and take between the outpatient clinic and the travel pay office that says, yeah, he was sure at this time the appointment was completed. So it is frustrating.
  
  > And the form to fill out. I'd love to have it more simplistic as well. Obviously I know what the outpatient clinic's name is. I know that know the physicians name, you need to input that, and also the time. Sometimes it just doesn't work properly, even if I input that correct information. So I've had several occasions where it's been denied. Other times, they've rearranged the title that I give it because apparently it has to be a specific title as well. For example, if I'm seeing a pediatrist, I'm not sure whether I should put in the outpatient clinic, which is a part of the VA facility. And that can deny me as well.
  
  > And and even if my time on the appointment is off, I'm sure that the Travel Department can either contact them or they they should get it. They should get a notice electronically that my appointment was completed. I would think that they do

- Are the claims that you file usually mileage only claims. Or do you have receipts that you add as well?
  > No, they're always mileage-only. I mean there might come a time where I have to stay overnight, but that hasn't happened. And I've been going to the same clinic for 35 years now. So there's occasions where you do have to stay overnight, whether it be weather, or there's something else the doctor wants to do, or whatever, but just mileage for now.

- And if you ever have 2 appointments at the same facility on the same day, do you create multiple claims for those appointments.
  > Well, I think I've tried, but in retrospect it's probably not the best idea. I mean, I'm only driving down there once, obviously. And I'm only driving back once. But that brings up another question that I can't answer: if I have to do this on my own rather than having it done automatically via text check in, I wouldn't know which appointment to input to the travel pay URL and the form. I'm assuming it would be the first one, but, frankly, it might not be. I don't know.
  
  > Actually, that's gonna happen in January. I've got 2 back-to-back appointments, so we'll see. I think I'll use text check-in in January, and that should take care of it.

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > I've got a number of Va sites bookmarked. Well, obviously, to me, I keep lauding the positives of text check-in, and that would be my first choice. I mean, it's just flawless. I've never had an issue with it. So I use that now, but there might come a time when my phone might not pick up a signal or something, or text check-in isn't available, I should say, so I would want one URL to go to just like every other VA Department in sight, just one URL, and that would be va.gov is what you guys are working on, I guess. Go there and be able to find the link for travel pay reimbursement, and then have it work the same way text check-in works, you know? Simple question, would you like to file for travel reimbursement for your appointment on such and such a day? Click yes. And thank you for your service, you know. That's that's pretty much it. Simplicity. Because there are so many VA sites right now, and I know that you all are compressing them because I know I've noticed a difference over the past few years. Certainly. But there is still a slew of 'em. Messaging is a big help as well, because if I can't find an answer I'll message a certain department. But there's still a lot of sites that I'd prefer to have deleted from my devices that I rarely go to.

 
- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)
  > I'm not sure what you mean. I just, I'm not sure what how to respond to that.

- Anything that comes to mind. As far as how you think of your travel claims in relation to any other claims. And if nothing comes to mind, that's fine, too.
  > Well, I mean, it's obviously a plus. It pays for my gas.
  
  > And something else I could mention about this as well. This might be taken away once again. I had it for a certain number of years, and then I didn't have it for well over a decade, for some reason. I contacted the travel office last October 2022, and they said, "Yeah, you're eligible." And so that's when I started this process again of requesting travel pay.
  
  > The only other benefit I get from the VA is a direct deposit disability check, and that's been flawless since the eighties, I believe. Travel pay online, receiving the travel pay allowance is fantastic. Without it, it's not gonna break the bank on my end, but it's something I feel that is warranted. I'm making the trip down. It's about a hundred mile round trip. Why not go for it? Having said that I can't say anything else else about about it. I can't offer you any more feedback about it, I don't think, aside from the simplicity factor when applying for it. It's a great option to have. I really don't have anything else to say about it.


### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**

- Imagine that you just received this email from Va about filing for travel reimbursement after 2 visits to your VA Medical Center on November thirteenth, 2023. Go ahead and review this email.
  > Well, this looks fairly familiar to me. I believe after I log into the probably the beneficiary travel page this looks fairly familiar. I mean, there's nothing surprising here, I understand at all.

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?
  > Sign in to start your claim. Gosh! You know. That's all well and good, but I sure would prefer getting a text. It doesn't seem to have any perhaps glitches that email might have. I have my cell devices, and I have two of them, I haven't set up for really strict privacy, so I would have to rearrange everything, from location to microphone camera, turn everything off, but I mean, I can go this route. If this is the way you guys are doing it. If you ask me that question about, where would I go from here, I would click on sign into "va.gov to start your claim." But why not just send the email to go directly to the link at va.gov.

- Go ahead and try that

**Appointment list**

(on list)
  > Okay, so I would click on file for travel reimbursement.

(returned to these x/close questions later in the session)
- So the at the top here where it talks about file a travel reimbursement claim. Did you notice the the x or close button?
  > I see that. I'm not sure I saw initially it. Could be a little bigger.

- Well, what would you expect to happen if you selected that?
  > Well, that would cause this particular square on the side, I believe.

- And if you did select that and the square closed, how would you find that information again?
  > I'd probably backtrack. I see a link for schedule and manage health appointments, although that wouldn't-- I'd I'd have to start all over, I guess, to where we were. I can use the back arrow to-- Well, maybe I wouldn't have to log in. This is confusing. I mean I clicked on the back arrow, and I'm not sure if I would have to log in again or not, frankly. So I'm not sure where it would take me.

  
**Intro page**

(did not pause to read through info - immediately selected mileage-only)
  > Mileage-only

**Travel pages**

(went quickly through questions)
  > Only mileage, yes. This looks familiar to me.
  > Yes, home vehicle. Yes, home address.

**Review page**

  > Review, click the box, check the box, and submit the claim. That's pretty easy.

**Success page**

  > So I'm done with that. That's familiar to me.

- Tell me about your understanding of what's happened to your claim.
  > Well, the claim normally is submitted through the facility, and I don't normally check. Occasionally I'll review the claim to make sure everything is fine, but it automatically, for whatever the reason, goes to manual review. I'm not sure why that happens with me. I know, speaking with other veterans, it's just automatically processed. But for me every one of these is manually reviewed. And then, some are denied and some are accepted and it goes to the direct deposit to my bank account. So that's how the process works, I believe, for me, and that normally takes about two weeks or so.

- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > I'm trying to remember. I think all the basic information is the same. The formatting might be a little bit different, but you know, there's there's a link to review the claim, past appointments, how to set up direct deposit, file another claim, that would come in handy occasionally, I suppose. And upcoming appointments, which I normally would not click on because -- well I might. I might do that if I have a number of appointments coming up. Normally, I would go to va.gov, but since it's here, I would probably click on upcoming appointments. This looks pretty much the same as what I am familiar with. I like the background shading for claims submitted. (referring to success alert). The light green. The text is fine. It's easy enough to understand for me. And the phone numbers at the bottom are a good tool to have.

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?
  > Well, down at the bottom, it says "Need help" and there's the number here. So, I know my health facility's phone number, but for this or a technical issue with this tool, I could call the number you have showning here, the 877 area code. If I had a problem with the claim itself -- oh, that's for an appointment. Call the health facility. So that okay, let me see here. You asked specifically about if I had problems filing the claim?

- After you filed the claim, if you were trying to find out more about that claim or the status of the claim.
  > Oh, I just go up top here to where the green shading is, "review your claim." 

- And where would you expect that link to take you?
  > I'm assuming that would take me to the BTSSS site, I think.

- Go ahead and and do that.
  > Okay, sign in and create an account.

- Actually, you can go back. This did take us to the real login for va.gov, but we don't need you to to log in with your actual information.

- How did where that link took you compare to where you were expecting to go?
  > Well, that's what I was expecting, but, again, what I would prefer would be why not take me to -- you could code a login page at the actual travel url rather than going through the login.gov front door, and then I could sign in there. It would just save some time; it's not a big deal, really.

- So if you wanted to check the status of that second appointment that you filed a claim for, how would you do that?
  > The status? Well, I'd probably click on the same link "review your claim." The the green shaded area mentions two appointments, so I'm assuming both appointments would be there.

- And did you see the "review your past appointments" link that's there?
 > Yeah, I see that. You wanna click on it?

-  Ya, let's go to that.
  > Oh! Ok, so both appointments are probably there. 

**Past appointments page**

(moderator prompted to go to past appointments page)
  > There we go. Okay, I understand that. So I would click on a second appointment. And there it is.
  
  > I was just gonna say this would become very familiar quickly. If this were live, you know. I don't see anything here that would cause me any problems. Need help is at the bottom. I normally don't print anything out. I don't have a printer, so I don't go that route, but if I need to save some information I'll take a screenshot. My photos are backed up anyway, so I would always have that, or send myself an email or something. But this this looks simple enough. And getting here was easy.

- And what information on this page is most important to you?
  > Well, I'm not sure. I think when I file claims, when I do it on my own rather than text, the hospital wants to know what the appointment was for I'm looking up at the top here, and this says "type of care not noted." I don't know if that's just because it's not a live page or not, but I think that if it were pediatry it should say pediatry, if it were blood work it should say blood work, that sort of thing, so that's probably is necessary for me to proceed to a--  I don't think it would be approved that way if the specific care wasn't noted on the claim that I would send. And what else is important or most important? Well, that would be important, certainly, what type of care, I think. I don't think they would approve without that.

- What does it seem like? Type of care? Not noted means here.
  > What that means to me is that in the context of travel, of filing a claim, it probably would not be approved. I mean, there has to be something there. The provider's name is there, but I don't believe the Travel Department would just utilize that to either deny or approve any sort of claim. I think they have to know what kind of care you receive. They do now I believe. In fact, I'm sure they do. When I fill out that form out manually now, I have to type in, for example, like pediatry, I have to type in the physician's name, the time, the date. It's complicated for me, at least. I prefer not to do all that. But again, what does it mean? It means that it probably would not be approved.

- And did you notice the travel reimbursement information at the bottom?
  > Ya I see that.
  > I review my claim occasionally. I don't do it as much as I used to, but if I don't hear or see any direct deposit in 10-14 days, I'll go to the site and check on the progress of it. You know what would also be nice about that is if we got status updates. You know, it's so easy to send out a text, and the VA is relying on text for all sorts of stuff now, everything from video chat reminders to checking into a video chat, as well as appointment reminders and checking into those appointments as well. So why not offer a text to review the claim? Take us right to it. Because I have a feeling that if I wasn't already logged in, I'd have to log in again to login.gov. Via text, they'd probably just reply with the status of it, I'm assuming. Or if they didn't, that would be nice, certainly.
  

### Task #2: BTSSS status questions - 10 minutes

_(Did not get to this activity within the session time limit)_


### Post-Task Interview - 1-2 minutes

- Do you have any questions for me or anything else you’d like to share?
  >  No, this has been a process for me that I feel I'm doing something that will benefit other Veterans as well. So I've been enjoying this. I've done this a few times, and you know, when all this is done and you guys are gone-- and I'm not suggesting you leave quickly, simply saying that what you're doing is making everything, a ton of VA urls, obsolete in the process of your rewriting the va.gov site. I must have 15 VA bookmarks and probably 13 of them I don't need anymore. So thank you for what you're doing.
