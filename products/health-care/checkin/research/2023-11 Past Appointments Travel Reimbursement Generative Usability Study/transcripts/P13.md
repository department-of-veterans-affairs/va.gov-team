### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > Okay, I filed a travel claim Wednesday. It was a community care appointment. I went to VA. Gov and typed in the search bar travel and it took me to the btss, I think that's what it's called. I signed in there and then I had to create the appointment because it wasn't in there, and then I had to file the travel part of it.

- How was the process of filing?
  > I've done quite a few of them, so it wasn't super difficult for me. But it could be kind of difficult for an older generation, somebody who's not technically, you know, as advanced as this generation is. So yeah, I mean to create the appointment was probably the most confusing part. So you have to search through all the providers to find the community care provider, and there's a lot of them for [state].

- Why is that?
  > Because you you expect the appointment to already be in there. And then you have to get asked you Who's what facility is this being charged to? And I see [mutliple options], so I didn't know which one to pick. So I just went with the main hospital.

- And have you had any claims at all that haven't gone through when you've filed that way, or have been denied?
  >  Yes.
  > I didn't expect it to get denied. It was another community care one and for some reason they denied it. I never looked into it afterwards, but it should have been paid because it was community care. And the VA sent me to them.

- Do you create multiple claims for different appointments on the same day? If you ever have 2 appointments during one visit to a facility?
  > No, I use the first appointment. I do that a lot because I live an hour and 15 min from the Va. So I'll usually try to stack my appointments in one day.


- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > In the app being able just to hit a button and go straight into BTSSS and not having to re sign in again. That would be wonderful.
  > Okay, again, with the appointments. Community care appointments having them put in, you know, to where you don't have to create the account or create the appointment.

- What are you referring to by re-sign in?
  > When you leave the VA app. It makes you sign in with Id.Me again. So you have to do the step more than one time.

- Anything else that comes to mind?
  > No, I've done it quite a bit. So to me, it's kinda easy. Other than like having to sign in multiple times to get to it. That's the biggest thing.


### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**

- Go ahead and review this email.
  > I like the fact that they have the link in the email. And I'm trying not to click. The only question I would have is, do I click the BTSSS or do I click the va.gov to do the claim?
  
- What would you do if we weren't here?
  > I would go with the BTSSS because to me, you know, to me it would be skipping a step, where, if you sign into va.gov, you have to do id.me to get into there, and then turn around and do id.me to get into the BTSSS.

- Is there anything else confusing about this information?
> No. It's actually pretty straight to the point. There's not but 2 extra words.

- If you were to receive an email like this from Va, is this what you'd expect? Or would it be anything else that you'd expect to find here??
  > Just maybe, you know, the VA seal to make sure to let me know that it's actually from the Va.


- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, I'd like you to go with the sign into va.gov option and show me how you would what you'd do from here.


**Appointment list**

(quickly navigates to appointment list)

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Tell me about this page.
  > I would click file for travel reimbursement. I like the fact that it's got how many days left you can file and the fact that it's showing my future appointments on the same page.

-    Was there anything confusing about that process? 
  > No

- Where were you expecting to end up?
  > I expected to actually be on va.gov and have to go to click to find the BTSSS link and click it, and then id me, and then get this part where I could file for free reimbursement.

- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
  > It would cancel reimbursements.
  

- And if you did select to close it, how would you find that information again? Or get back to that in some way, or would you not be able to? 
  > I would go back to va.gov in the BTSSS and look for the appointment there.
  

- And what would you expect to happen if you did not close this?
  > I would expect it to the next time I signed in and tell me how many days left I had to file a claim.

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next to file that claim.
  > So this is the same page, or almost the same page, as what you would do what I would have done before, if we weren't in this this program right now, but it took away quite a few steps. (va.gov > btsss and sign ins)
  
**Intro page**

- Tell me about this page
  > I like the fact that you can check your eligibility. And then, in fact, you can pick mileage only, or receipts. Because on the the normal one you have to add this stuff to it after you start your claim. So I think this would take a step out. Possibly more than one step out.

- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  > 

- And how clear are the steps for filing a travel reimbursement claim?
  >  I think it's pretty clear, except for at the bottom check the status of your claim. There's nothing to click on there. But the others, it's definitely very straightforward.

- And in that bottom option for something to click on. What would you expect to be there?
  > Just either a list of the claims that you have or a button to go to a list of the claims that you have in.

- And how clear are the 2 options for filing a claim?
  > They're very clear.

- Go ahead and continue

**Review page**

- Anything confusing about this page?
  > Okay. I like the fact they double check that you clicked the right button.
  > And I like the size of the buttons cause we're all getting older and hard to see sometimes.


- Ok, go ahead and continue.

**First travel mileage question**

> Okay. I like the fact. They double check that you clicked the right button. And I like the size of the buttons, because we're all getting older and hard to see sometimes.


**Review page**

- Anything confusing?
  > No, I like it, it's kinda dummied down, I guess - the best way to put it compared to what you look at when you file it now.

> (dropdown agreement) I like that, because in the other page you can't just shrink it down. I read the beneficiary travel agreement every time, just because my eyes do that. So I like the fact that I don't have to read it if I don't want to.

**Success page**

- Talk to me about this page and the information included here.
  > I like the fact that it's, you know, highlighted that it's been submitted, and it tells you how many appointments, on what day, and the claim number. It's all right there, very simple, very easy to read.
  > I like the fact you can go to your upcoming appointments from this page, kind of as another reminder of your appointments cause a lot of times, you know some veterans have so many appointments, and you know they tend to forget one or 2.

- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > I didn't expect to get the the simplified version of the claim and the other links on it. I figured I would have to do another step to go to my appointments.
  > And filing another travel claim, I like having that on that page, too, because sometimes I'll wait and do all my appointments that I had at one time. So instead of having to do all the steps over again, the way you do it now you have to like start a huge thing again. And this is kind of nice where I can just click it, where I'm hoping I can click it, and it goes straight to the the claims.

- Go ahead and try that.

**Past appointments page**

- Where did you expect that to take you?
  > To the sign in area again. I do like this.

- And so how would you go about filing another claim then?
  > I would click on the appointment.

**Details page with CTA**

  > Again, I like this because you it's right here. The filing for travel is, I mean. It also tells you that days left to file.

- And did you notice the on the page before of the appointment that you clicked? Did you notice that red dot?
  > Yes, I was, gonna ask about that and the task to complete.

- What did you think that was referring to?
  > I thought it was filing for reimbursement. Or it could have been because it's a mental health appointment. It could have been, you know, sometimes they send homework with you.

- So this file for travel. Doesn't go anywhere at the moment. Where would you expect this to go though, if you if you selected the link at the top?
  > Back to that easy-to-do travel reimbursement page.

- So now, if you if you were on this page and you wanted to find out more about your status of your claim for the 2 appointments that you just filed for, how would you do that?
  > I would click on the appointment.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**

  > Let's pull it at the bottom, and you can review it. Because now it doesn't have that on the web page.

- Where would you expect the review your claim link to take you?
  > To a page that had all my claim statuses.

- Ok go ahead and select that.
  > Okay, so this I don't like this because you go right back to the beginning, and you have to sign in again. So if I'm already signed in and looking at my appointments, it doesn't make sense for me to have to re sign in again when I click a link that I'm signed into.
  > I would want the link to to go to a list of my claims. 

- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  > That it's like a beginning appointment, so they don't know exactly what kind of care they're going to give out, whether it's, you know, medications or physical therapy. And it's not a follow-up appointment. It's a brand new appointment.
  > Like for a new issue.

- And where does that information come from?
  > I would think it would be the person who you called and made the appointment with, or yeah, I mean, I guess it would come from the person you made the appointment with. The people who answer the phone when you call to make the appointment.


### Task #2: BTSSS status questions - 10 minutes

- Submitted for Payment
  > That means I've filed the claim and it's waiting. Probably it would be like the first couple of days after you've filed the claim.
  > To me it's pretty important cause, if not, randomly like in my savings account, I'll get a travel reimbursement. I'm like, okay, which appointment was that for?
 
- Payment Canceled
  > To me it would be that they decided not to pay it. I would wonder why, you know, I kind of like a why after it.
  > Pretty important.
 
- Denied
  > That would mean they decided not to pay it. Again add the why after it. Even just a brief description of why it was denied.
  > Again, pretty important because I'd want to know if it's not gonna come in. I know some people, you know, depend on that to pay for their next appointment, you know, fuel for their next appointment. So to me, it would be pretty important to know it.

- Approved for Payment
  > Approved for payment means that they've okayed the mileage, and that at some point in time they'll send a check or direct deposit.
  > Again, very important.

- In Manual Review
  > I would have no clue other than my brain automatically goes to somebody pulled the file, and is like actually, manually looking at the report of my mileage. And you know, receipts or what not.
  > Pretty important cause it kinda tells you that it's gonna be a little bit longer before you get paid, or not paid.

- On Hold
  > Kind of to me means the same as in manual review, in the fact that somebody has pulled it and is looking it over for some reason or another, and I would put the "why" at the end of it.
  > Again, pretty important.

- Saved
  > That one means that I didn't have all my receipts and realized it. So I'm gonna go ahead and save it, so I don't have to put all the other information back in when I sign back in.
  > It's important but not drastically important.

- Claim Paid
  > That means they've sent a check or direct deposited the money for the mileage.
  > I guess pretty important, that way I knew the money was, you know. going to be in my count within couple days at least.

- Incomplete
  > Means kind of the same as far as the saved. It's just giving you a little bit more information that okay, you still have stuff to add to this claim. But again, there's the why? Because after it, if I saw that I would want to be able to have highlighted what was missing. So like if I forgot to put my phone number in, or the mileage in, or what not, having that description or the highlighted parts to tell me why it's incomplete.
  > Pretty important that way I knew I, you know, had something else to add to it, and I wasn't sitting there waiting for a claim that is incomplete to go through.

- Fiscal Rescinded
  > No clue. I would Google it. I couldn't take any more steps. I'd have to go look it up.

- Claim Submitted
  > That means I had all my ducks in a row, and I hit the submit button, and it's telling me that I did. I did all the steps I could do.
  > Pretty important because then I can, you know, check it off my list of things to do for the day. I know that it's sent.

- Were there any other terms that you expected to be here that were not included?
  > No
