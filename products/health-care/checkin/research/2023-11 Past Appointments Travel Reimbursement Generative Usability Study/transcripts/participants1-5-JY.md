Notetaking - 11/16/2023 - Observation - Participant 1 

Has filed a travel claim before 
up to the first floor of a VA hospital - one page form - borrow a pen all on paper during the day he has an appoitnment there


Travel Reimbursment prefer the  process to be over my cell phone or computer 

claims travelclaims - disability travel claims - 100% disability 
 

filed a claim for ptsd - took a couple of months 

disability and travel claim are NOT the same, travel you have to wait for your appointment 

Travel Claims Reimbursement Steps Test 

- Claim Paid : means that the va has reviewed paperwork and paid it and I'm sure of it because received it in bank account, - never seen this term before when filing a travel reimbursement
 - In Manual Review : no idea what that means and never seen it before, seems like VA is still evaluating the claim??? 
- Approved for payment : Veteran did the right thing and VA will be sending out my approval in a month or so - would be helpful 
- Submitted for payment: not that important to veteran
- Payment Conceled : something happened and the payment was cancelled, I just wouldn't want to see it
- Denied : painful - if it's denied I'd like to be notified, nothing confusing about it *VERY IMPORTANT*
- Claim submitted : i submitted and someone has checked and seen, important but not that important 
- Saved : whatever work I did has been saved and someone has it
- Fiscal Rescinded : I don't like it, don't understand it, not that important
- Incomplete : important to know, maybe forgot to put the date, incorrect year etc 
- On Hold : not impotant because some of the others are more important, someone is looking into the claim etc 

- denied and payment cancelled are the same interpreation 



Participant 2
- Has own benefits - used to have to go to redacted PII - get something signed and get money for travel - not in the last 2-3 years
- 1) go to location 2) sit in an office 3) whatever appointments had had to get it signed to say they were there 4) hand it to imbursement window 5) get cash -- now it might just go to your service diabled account 

- if you could wave a magic wand and make that travel reimbursmeent process - walk up and scan my service connected id and a check comes in the mail 0 there's a kiosk, would rather just use it to scan and travel - or it just goes into next month's disimbursement check in them mail
 - worst part is having to travel to location - seamless and 
- disability claim - needs to be better - explain the VA math for disability - hire more people - make it easier to understand - 



terms travel reimbursement  test :

-Claim Paid : getting money - never encountered term, not confusing, very important , it's what i'm owed
-In Manual Review : why is it a manual review,what did I miss, what did the VA not understand what did I not get, explain what a manual review, not rrelevant for travel , if it explained what it was about that would be easier, Manual Review is out of the ordinary 
-Approved for Payment : I'm getting paid but when? *very important*
-submitted for payment : did what I was supposed to do, now waiting for VA to respond *important*
-Payment Cancelled : what didn't I do right, why, *very important*
-Denied :  I'm upset, why? - I did what I was supposed, tell me why it was denied *very ipmortant*
-Claim Submitted : guess it's different than submitted for payment? I at submitted something you should have it on your desk 
-Saved : didn't submit it, have to come back to it, not confusing, not super important 
-Fiscal Rescinded : no idea 
-Incomplete : I didn't fill it out right, I want to know have some red fields maybe? important 
-On Hold : same thing did i not submit it, who has it on hold? why is it on hold?: 

big fan of less statuses the better, more choices leads to more confusion 

removed fiscal rescinded, denied/payment cancelled are essentially the same (?)
submitted for payment/approved for payment - kinda the same(?)

don't see in manual review too often 

Participant 3

- Has never filed a travel claim 
- How did you choose your primary care provider at the VA? He was assigned to me, I didn't have a hoice
If you could pick your own doctor what would you look for? Experience - how long they've been practiving 
- Do you see any providers outside of VA? Do you use different criteria? I had cancer - I was told that redacted PII is the best cancer hospital - the problem with the VA is that you can't get an appointmet for 2-3 months, can't wait that long
- Do you go online to get information about healthcare providers? No, not tech-savvy - can barely go on MyChart because o the sign-in uswername and password 

- I don't see why they can't use my SSN and my name to log-in expect to just work 
- it's hard enough paying my bills online, 
- can use fingerprint for my chart - no computer 
- ask daughter for help with things - helps with almost everything - put the app on phone - once I got home and tried to get in there I couldn't,only for mychart can I use my fingerprint, the other one I can't . Not a VA mychart 

- Have you ever scheduled an appointment with VA.gov, or fill a prescription 

round trip it's 20 miles 
I went to the basement - I have a bad memory -

Need FaceID or Fingerprint - password - 

would not go to VSO because don't use app - refill prescription over the phone - 

does not like automated phone app - would use a kiosk 

has not used kiosk at VA facility 


Participant 5

has done manual travel claim before 

not a pleasant experience - stand there and wait 

if you could wave a magic wand and fix it how would you? Do it online at a computer, etc 

disablity vs travel claim -

red/pink colors difficult

travel is just getting a piece of paper they type it in, at first they gave you cash, and then they started giving you check - veterans were depending on that cash to get home, disabled veterans not getting any money - they need the travel pay to get from point a to point b 

filing for disability was way more difficult - they said don't be surprised to be denied -was denied even though he lost his vision 

Claims Status Test Terms

Claim Paid - I got the money! Money was paid out. 
In Manual Review - someone is looking at it with their eyes, not confusing, if I don't get it in 6 workdays i will call again to see what happens 
Approved for Payment - I'm golden 
Submitted for Payment - paperwork has been inputted to get paid. Doesn't bother me not super important 
Payment Cancelled - they didn't accept paperwork - need to find out why - all comes down finding out why 
Denied - not good - has to find out why it was denied
Saved - problems coming down the pike 
On Hold -work is getting done, not confusing,let me know and I'll call them up 
Incomplete - someone didn't do the paeprwork correctly, something is off, staff does it, we don't -- irrelevant questions - thought I'd put down NA 
Fiscal Rescinded - means not getting any money, not confusing - you got it or you don't have it - call them and find out why 
Claim Submitted - paperwork is in, but claim is  not completed yet 

status steps can go down to 3-4 instead of like 10-12 , the WHY is what's important
