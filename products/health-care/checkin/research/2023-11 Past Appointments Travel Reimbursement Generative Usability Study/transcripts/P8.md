### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > So basically, when I actually file in for that, if I have an appointment for the schedule date, that's when I actually fill out the form. And then let's say, if I get a little time earlier than I usually do, I tend to fill it out, and just, you know, to not forget it when I have to leave or so, because I've had that happen to me, but not anymore, because I tend to fill it out prior to going to my appointment and then on my way out I just pressed on and go home, and no worries.
  > I usually do that every time I have an appointment.

- And it sounds like you usually use the paper form?
  > Yes

- Have you ever used the portal online?
  > No, I haven't had luck with that. Ever since that all started I never had luck and log in for some reason. Maybe it was at the beginning, but I haven't looked into it anymore.

- So you've tried it, but it wasn't really working for you?
  > Yeah, a couple of years ago, if I recall.

- If you have 2 appointments on the same day, do you create multiple claims for each appointment?
  > No.
  > Because I would assume that that's all I would be authorized to get paid for, you know. If I have 1 to 3 appointments, and all I get is one way of transportation. Either it's a round trip, or however they calculate it, you know.

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you would want it, what would it be like?
  > Well, like it used to be before. I used to get the money on the spot, and that's it. It used to be like, at the beginning when it all started for me, when I qualified for it, I used to get the money I just submitted the paperwork and wait in the waiting room, and then I'd get my money there. But ever since they instated this having to do with your bank account it whatever time it takes, you know, it shows up on the account. Before it used to be that I used to get the money on hand, and that's it. But they changed that.

- And so when you used to get your money immediately like that was that, did you go up to a person at a counter?
  > Yes

- How would you describe travel claims, your travel reimbursement claims, in relation to any other benefits. You might have like disability claims, for example. 
  > I think it's something fair and something that will help the Veteran to be motivated, and in a way be enthusiastic. Waiting, at least, you know, to get some kind of help for the ways of getting there, you know. Let's say, in my case I have a car, you know, that that's good for the the gas and stuff like that. It makes me, you know, to feel ease at the time that I'm gonna get at least something back in regards to that. No matter how far away the the appointment is, I'll still get something back.


### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**

  > Okay, I'm thinking that this will be the two appointments I have with that set day, the thirteenth and that depending the mode of transportation I had that day I could apply for the transportation reimbursement.

- Is there anything confusing about this information?
  > No. Depending if I was taken by the VA or I was able to go on my own in my own mode of transportation I would be more than likely to know what's going on, and that would be --- If I haven't submitted any paperwork, I would be able to know whether or not I can fill it out or not.

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?
  > I wouldn't be able to say cause because I would not be expecting for this to come up because like I said before, I normally do it before I leave the hospital. So it would be something like once on a blue moon to happen. Because I normally tend to to follow up on that as soon as I get there, or actually before I leave - to put in the paperwork at least, you know. So I wouldn't be looking out for something like this,  unless something out of the ordinary happens.

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.
  > Basically, I'll sign in to the VA.gov to start my claim, and I'll hopefully be filling out the necessary portions of that part I would need to fill up to to fulfill my claim.

**Appointment list**

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Was there anything confusing about that process? 
  > No

- Where were you expecting to end up?
  > At the actual appointment, at least. The most current one. To file according to the date I was assuming that I could fill out for.

- Now let’s take a look at what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
  > Okay, for instance, there's um... saying that there's 25 days to claim 2 appointments. One on the thirteenth and... basically that. That's the only one there because the other ones are pending, so I would be filling out for that one.
  > I would be submitting for travel reimbursement due to the fact that it says there that I had two appointments on the thirteenth. And I would be able to file for that particular day.

- Is this what you were expecting to see?
  > Yeah, that would be the only one, of course, unless it's on a different date.

- Is there anything confusing here?
  > No

- What would you do next?
  > After I fill out, I really don't have the slightest idea what happen when I feel like file online for this because I've done it annually, you know, at at the the VA.
  > When I get to the very end, if I would need to sign for it, I would think I would be signing it with the there's a site, I think, that covers there that I could be able to sign for it and submit it, if I'm not mistaken. I'm just guessing.
  
- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
  > Probably I'll just get that removed by all means, probably.

- And if you did select that, how would you find that information again? 
  > Probably when I go in it will perhaps remind me that it's still pending so many days. Like signing in again.
  
- And what would you expect to happen if you did not close this?
  > I would have to go to the hospital or the clinic for it in order to no lose the reimbursement opportunity.

- Can you tell me a little bit more about what you mean by that?
  > Okay, in order for me to avoid to lose the opportunity to submit the travel paperwork, or apply for the reimbursement for that travel date, I would go as soon as I can before -- now that I know that I only had about 25 days to claim it. I would make all efforts to do so if I didn't have an opportunity to do it online.

- And so I wanna make sure that I'm that I'm understanding correctly. So when you see this here, would your next step be to do something here, or would you go file in a different way?
  > I would still try to do it here. If I have no other ways of going around it, I'll probably end up going personally.

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next to file that claim.

  > So I would file for travel.
  
**Intro page**

  > Okay, by all means, I am eligible because of my compensation status. And if I would need to to claim any mileage in this, I've never done that. I don't know how much would it be per mile that I'll be getting. I never have submitted any receipts.

- And how clear are the 2 options for filing a claim?
  > I would I would assume that the filing mileage only claim would be the distance from my house to the facility. And if I would, let's say, if I would be flying, or something like that, I would be able to claim with any receipts, any travel receipts I might have, any expenses of course, I would be able to put them in there, include them in that filing as well.

- And how clear are the steps for filing a travel reimbursement claim?
  > It looks easy. I've done that while I was in the military. That's what's called per diem and stuff like that. I just take it over to finance, but again, that's the old way of doing it, not anything online, which I would basically, you know, round up all of the things I have on hand if I would need like the tolls I used to get there and so on.

- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  > No

- Go ahead and continue

  > (Selects mileage-only) I'll just put in the one that I would consider, and due to the fact that I'm not traveling on a plane or anything, I would hit that (Yes to mileage-only question)
  > And I would hit that (yes to are you traveling in your own vehicle) as well, which is part of the questionaire on the form that I usually fill out at the hospital.
  > And I would fill out that as well and confirm the address. (yes to contact info)

**Review page**

- Anything confusing about this page?
  > 

- Ok, go ahead and continue.

**Success page**

- Talk to me about this page and the information included here.
  > 

- Tell me about your understanding of what's happened to your claim.
  > 

- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > 

- And did you notice this claim mentions 2 appointments?
  >

- And so why do you think that the second appointment is included here when you've gone through the process of filing just once?
  > 

- And would you expect that 2 appointments like that would be included in one process of a claim?
  >
  
-  And what would you expect to happen next with your claim?
  > 

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?
  > 

- Go ahead and and do that.

- So I'm curious. Where did you expect that link to take you? And is that different or the same as where it took you.
  > 

- So then, did you notice the review? Your past appointments link?
  > 

- Where did you expect that to take you?
 > 

-  Ok, let's try that.

**Past appointments page**

-  Is this where you expected to go?
  >

- Knowing that you're looking for the details page, how would you find that?
  > 

- Okay, do you wanna try that for the second one? Tell me about this page now and what you were expecting.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**


- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  > 

- Overall on this page, can you tell me about what is most important for you here?
  > 

- And did you notice the travel reimbursement section there at the bottom?
 > 

- I know we came here to learn more about your status, is this what you expected to find?
  > 

- Okay. and where would you expect that link to go?
  > 

- Go ahead and select that link.
