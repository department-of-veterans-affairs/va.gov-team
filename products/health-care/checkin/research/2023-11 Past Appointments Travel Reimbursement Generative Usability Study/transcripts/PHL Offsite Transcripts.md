Magic wand for travel reimbursement process.

Do it over my cellphone or my computer. It saves me a couple of steps; I can do it while I’m on the train. I can do it at the VA Hospital library and I can print it for free.

How does the Travel pay claims process compares to filing other types of claims?

 I filled disability for PTSD disability it only took me a couple of months. 
 
Are they similar?

Oh no, you got to wait til you come down for your appointment. It’s a small minor hassle, but its not a big of a deal. The big one was disability.

Do you ever check travel reimbursement status?

“No, the only thing I check is when I get a reimbursement on my bank. Like 6 bucks from where I live. I get a notification from my bank and hey, there it is, I got it.”

“Its nice to know it working and I did the right thing. I don’t see it at all (claim paid status).”

How important is it for you to know In Manual Review?

How important is it for you to know the Approved for Payment status?

“It would be helpful.”

### PHL Offsite Vet 2-Travel Pay

Do you have VA healthcare?

“I actually have my own benefits, I only go to the VA when I need surgeries or something ike that. I don’t use them for regular general doctors.”

Have you ever filed travel pay?

“I used to when I live down in (Redacted PII), I would get things signed and they would give me like $40 bucks for gas.”

Last time you Filed for Travel pay.

Haven’t been to (Redacted PII) in 2 to 3 years.  I got to the Brick (?) Clinic alot.  They maid me come up to (Redacted PII) and I’d have to sit in the office and wait til they call my name and I’d get a piece of paper and whatever appointments I had, Every time I left, I had them sign them sign to say I was there. And at the end of my appointment, I just went down to the disbursement window, and I handed it to them and they’d do the math for (Redacted PII) and back it was like $30 something like that for cash. They paid it with cash. I know since then they changed it , now it just goes into your, I’m service disable as well, I think it just goes now into your service disabled account now. I haven’t done it in a very long time. I don’t have to go up to (Redacted PII) anymore, If I do I just ask for a community care.

Magic wand for travel reimbursement process.

Walk up and scan my service connected ID, they know where I’m at . are you here, yes. Did you go to all your appointments, yes. And I hit close and a check comes in the mail a week later. Like when you go in there’s a kiosk where I check in for my appointment and they ask what are you here for. At the end when I go back to the kiosk when I did all my appointments, I hit end and it goes up to the cloud an it says, We owe (REDACTED PII) $25 dollars and just send them a check. Or if its that quick it just goes into my next month’s disability disbursements.”
How does the Travel pay claims process compares to filing other types of claims?
Its just money. Worst part is having to drive to (Redacted PII) and the parking and the whole nine yards, its not the best area especially if going there late at night. It was seamless, travel claim was always the easiest part, I know if I went up there I’d get cash back and get something to eat. It’s a long way back like 45 to 1 hour and 15
Are they similar?
 No its not (comparable to a disability claim) that where you guys need to hire more people, hire more VSO’s explain the VA math for Disability claims. I don’t understand I was 80% disable and I recently went to 50% , but my disbursements changed and I don’t understand now that I’m 20% more disabled.

Do you ever check travel reimbursement status?

Not really.

Any terms that should not be here?

“I am a fan of the less the better. Having more choice, just leads to more confusion.

If could remove, which ones would you take out?

Fiscal Rescinded; Cancelled or denied could mean the same thing (too similar). These are kind of redundant-submitted for payment approved for payment.

So you don’t travel for care anymore?

No, there are times that I have to travel, But I just tell them I am not driving to (Redacted PII) on A Tuesday with traffic. They just send me to Community care . (so no need to file travel pay).

What do you think of filling travel pay online?

“Its easy. I would like to do it on the Kiosk.


### PHL Offsite Vet 3-Appointments

Do you have VA healthcare?

Yes, I go to the VA Hospital at the time.

Have you ever filed travel pay?

Negative.

How did you choose Primary care Provider at the VA?

I got assigned,  I didn’t have a choice. It’s not like we have this doctor and you can chose one, it was assigned to me.

If you could pick your own are there any qualities that you’d look for in a doctor?

I would guess experience. How long they’ve been practicing, absolutely.

Do you see any providers outside of VA?

Yes.

Do you chose those providers on a different criteria than you would chose a VA provider?

Yes, I had cancer and I was told that Redacted PII best place in Redacted, so I went there for cancer treatment. The problem with the VA is that you can’t get an appointment right away. Its usually 2 to 3 months down the line and that doesn’t work for me. And I have to go to Chemo and all of that and after that, immune therapy which didn’t work and Keytruda actually attacked my lungs, And I had to run to the hospital cause I couldn’t breathe. So I went to the VA hospital, and They admitted me and I was there for 8 days. They treated me very well; I have no complaints while I was there. Only problem is getting there, getting an appointment. I like my primary care he is a great guy and we get along great. Ive seen my primary there, Ive also seen a diabetes doctor and also seen a therapist for my leg, I have nerve damaged. I didn’t get to see a pulmonologist, although they did give me a breathing test, but I wasn’t assigned a pulmonologist.

Do you go online to get information about healthcare providers?

To be honest with you, I don’t, cause I’m not very tech savvy. I can barely go on “My Chart” because of the sign-in, and  the user password and the minute I put in the password, and it says “we don’t recognize this password”, that’s it I quit. I get frustrated and I quit . Why do they need my username and password, why can’t I just use my name and social security number. I expect it  t work and if it doesn’t I quit I don’t have patience for it. Its hard enough paying my bills on line. Unfortunatly, I did not know how to do that, My wife Redacted was the one that was paying the bills. So I didn’t even know how to do that. So when she left, I learned how to pay my bills.

You accessed “My Chart” before?

Yes, I don’t know how this happened but I used my finger to get on “My Chart” (On their mobile phone) Yes, I don’t have a computer, I use my mobile phone and my finger to get on “My chart” but its great. I don’t have to use a user name or password, none of that.

If you needed help with learning how to log on, would you go for help for that?

I would ask my daughter for help, but unfortunately she works and she doesn’t have time. But basically shes the one who helps me with that. I did go to the VA at one time and they but the VA app on my phone, but once I got home and dried to get in their I couldn’t. But, used finger print for “my chart” not that app. (My chart) is not a VA app , it’s a civilian app.

Have you ever scheduled an appointment on VA.gov?

I usually call on the phone to make an appointment and to refill prescriptions.

Did you know that you could get travel compensation from the VA?

No, I didn’t know that.I had no idea, that’s great. Its actually 10 miles from my house, so round trip is 20 miles and I had. I almost got a job at that VA but when I got sick, I didn’t feel good enough to work. They approved me for oxygen, when I got here I had to sit. I have a portable oxygen machine , but its in the truck.

Did your daughter help you make appointments?

No, I do all my appointments on the phone. Its pretty easy and theyre very nice people on the phone. The problem is if I call today (Mid November) I cant get an appointment with my primary till mid January or February and I cant wait long that especially with my condition. As far as the travel pay, I never heard of it?

It sounds like you haven’t seen VA health records at all?

I do have an (VA) app, but I don’t know how to use it. At one time, someone called me and told be next time I come to the VA, come down to the basement and someone will show you how to use the app. And I did do that, but when I got home, I tried to log in, I have a bad memory, and can’t remember anything.

What did they tell you the app would help you with?

With everything with making appointments, checking results of tests. I really didn’t feel like I needed it. Why would I need the app to make VA appointments when I can do it over the phone.

Do you have other benefits through the VA, like disability or pension?

No.

What would make it easier for you (to use the VA app)?

Fingerprint or face recognition.If they could do that that would be fine. I would use it (VA app) more often.

What would you do to get a password?

I tried. It says reset and then they tell you we will email you a code, But I don’t know how to get out of the app and into the email, because once I get the email, I lose the app (on mobile phone). Then I have to start all over again and its frustrating. I wish I could use my finger and get into the app.I ve called for help with other stuff (other apps) and its difficult. They tell me what to do, I try doing it and she says okay take your time, and it doesn’t work. I just don’t have the patience for it.

Veterans service centers can help you, would you go there for help?

No, Like I said I really don’t need the app and when I can call and make appointments.

How about your medical records, has anyone asked you to see your medical records?

My civilian doctor says we can’t see what you get done at the VA, we can’t see your records. I don’t know if the VA would allow a civilian to see my records.

How about your prescriptions?

I do it at the local pharmacy and also at the VA. Most of the time VA will mail it to me. And if not, they’ll send the prescription to CVS. I make the phone call to the doctors, and he’ll send the prescription, or they’ll mail it (prescription) to me. I do everything by phone.

They’re moving everything to the web and the app.

I know, it is getting so difficult, everything is automated like when I call, and sometimes I have to start all over again by going to the main menu.
Have you encounter a kiosk at the VA where you can just walk up and check in for an app.

No, I’ve never seen one at the Redacted VA. I probably would use it. I don’t have a problem doing that. 

Do you have any questions for us?

Yeah, I’m curious about the travel pay thing. How do I get more information.(Moderator went online and discovered Veteran did not qualify for travel pay.)


### PHL Offsite Vet 4-Appointment

Do you have VA healthcare?

Yes.

Have you ever filed travel pay?

No,  I walk to the VA. The VA is 15 minutes walk from my house, so I don’t have a need to use it yet. The bus is also $2.50, so Its not a big deal for me to get there.

How did you choose Primary care Provider at the VA?

Yes, they weren’t that many females available. I called to set up my initial, “hey I’m new in the area” “We only have 1 female primary care in the area, do you want to wait for that?” And I said yes. And then they scheduled me an initial visit, I didn’t have an option (didn’t have an option for choosing the women just here what’s available, they had no choice). 

If you could pick your own are there any qualities that you’d look for in a doctor?

The same criteria but the VA doesn’t have any options. Gender age, availability whether they do telehealth. (Can get telehealth with VA after a bunch of phone calls).

Do you see any providers outside of VA?

Part of my school there’s medical, if you have an issue you can go in.

Do you go on website to look up providers?

I’d like to but I feel I have no options with the VA. So I try to see who ever they can provide me.I would like to research their different specialties.

Have you ever scheduled an appointment of VA,gov or MHV?

I schedule when I go in, they give you a number to call. So I call the hospital and I’m transferred to women’s health and I either need to leave a message and keep calling back. I would like to schedule through the apps, I have both VA apps downloaded to my phone, I usually call. I had an appointment for hearing aids today and I haven’t been able to reschedule it so I had to put aside other things I had to do today to make sure I attend that appointment. I couldn’t reschedule it. I left 2 voicemails and I cant schedule it online, I cant even see my appointment online.I don’t think I have the ability to reschedule online even.

You have the VA app and the Chat app, what have you used those for?

The VA app is helpful for claims , where you’re at in the process, what you qualify for what you have received, I had to contact my provider 1 time via the chat and that was seamless, other than that I’ve saved all the phone numbers I need on my phone so. 

How did you find out about the app?

When I originally signed up for healthcare, I saw it online and figured it would be easy and my friends use it. When I did my initial primary care visit, they said that there was a chat app. I really don’t use it that much.

What do you wish you can do on the app? Is there anything that you are not able to do, but would like to?

I think appointments. Sometime the provide writes down in an “old school book” their schedule. Like todays appointment, I cant see it out in the app. When I call the hospital and try to reschedule it, they say” Hey, we don’t see your appointment, we cant reschedule it, somethings likes that is challenging. Mental Health, the same things happen. So I think visibility of appointment in the app is helpful the ability to schedule or reschedule is helpful. I guess your medical records are not in the app, unless I haven’t go into it that much. Maybe visibly like that like result and tests are helpful.
I’ve used the pharmacy a little bit, its nice it send you a text when you need to refill, yes or no, and I say yes and its done. So that’s seems less so I haven’t needed the pharmacy function in the app. Yeah I think that scheduling (appointments) is the biggest problem.

When you say check your claims, can you tell me what kind of claims?

Yes, disability claims, you can go in and see. And it goes through your claim history and when it was initiated when it was completed, and I’m waiting for the status of my claim and (it doesn’t ? list the disability appointments. I’m sure the VA doesn’t want to be constantly be updating, But I think more clarity on the claim would be helpful. My disability rating status changes my payments , but you still need to see a provider, like you didn’t need to see one before, but now you need to see amental health provider. So now in the few months I have this new appointment. I only found out about the appointment) because I proactively called (Otherwise I wouldn’t have know about it). I would like to see if I need more appointments (as it relates to my claim).

You mentioned you had to provide your medical records, can you talk about that?

Its kind of convoluted, I looked it up a few times, I know it called something like the “blue folder”; there the VA medical history and also my medical history that I uploaded from the Navy. It just seems like they are in a bunch of different places to me (all their medical records are not found in one place). I haven’t formal y seen my medical record online, I don’t need it know, but If I move from Redacted, I hope that all my records transfer. And even when I see student health in my school, that is not merged, which is fine, but I’ve gotten vaccines in the school the VA doesn’t know about. I would like the ability to upload if I got a flu shot or at Walgreen, that would be nice. I can upload for school. I can take a picture of it with my phone and I can upload it to my student health portal.

Notetaker question: Have you ever heard of MyHealthVet on VA.gov?

I have heard of it, but I’ve never used it. Oh interesting, I’ll have to look up on there. (Is not are on how to get on MHV, not aware off appointment features, medical records, and pharmacy features. 

How are you getting insider tips or news about options such My HealtheVet, ect..?

Just my friends from my ship. At my school’s Veterans’ club. Not much through the VA.

Have you ever seen a kiosk at the Vet health center?

No.

What would be the best way to get out that information to you (Info about MHV or other things Vet would be aware of)?

I check my email a lot. (she gets several emails from different VA dept on a regular cadence) and their newsletter. But would like a separate email informing about MHV. Maybe a 1 on 1 when you go to the VA (to inform of new things-she heard about the Chat app from the nurse while taking her blood pressure.) that was helpful and an email follow-up.

You have an appointment today?

Yeah, a telehealth with mental health I get an email like 2 weeks before reminding me that I have an appointment, then I get it a week before. On the day of the appointment, sometimes I don’t get the link until 20 minutes before my appointments, its very stressful and frustrating and my provider didn’t login till 30 minutes after the appointment. Very Frustrating to block off the time and hope that the network is going to work; I’ll get an automated email. Sometimes you have to call to find out (if the telehealth appointment will happen) and sometimes if you call outside the business hours, you have to wait till the next day-a lot of my friends in my age group have talked about this and are worried.
The hearing aid specialist used a paper schedule to put their appointments in and Vet is not aware if the provider is required to put that in an electronic schedule.


### PHL Offsite Vet 5-Travel Pay (Low Vision-Blind)

Have you ever filed travel pay?
I did.

Last time you Filed for Travel pay.

Last time I did it was about 5 years ago. I went to the window filled it out and got a check in the mail. I don’t do it now cause you have to stand their and wait in line. Its not a pleasant experience.

Magic wand for travel reimbursement process.

Have the last person talking to you, do it online and you get a check in the mail.

How does the Travel pay claims process compares to filing other types of claims?

I’ve had disability. Well I had to go in for an interview and did the (disability) claim. Some questions did not make sense to me. 

Are they similar?

Travel you just give a paper and they send you a check. They used to give you cash but now they said it’s a check. Veterans were not very happy cause they were depending on that money to get home. Cause you have a lot of veterans who get aid but no money, so they were depending on that money for train fare home. Filling for disability was the toughest part.
Do you ever check travel reimbursement status?

No, cause the treasury department would send you a check in 6 days, so I never had to check it (status).

Travel Claims Reimbursement Statuses

Anything confusing about (In Manual Review)?
