# Participants 1-5 General Notes

Moderator: Lois Lewis

Notes submitted by: Lois Lewis

- Participant 5 is low-vision.
- No one had submitted claims online - they do it while at the office.
- One participant mentioned using a kiosk to check in - would like to use for travel
reimbursement.
- One participant mentioned using a fingerprint to log in to his "my chart" from another
provider since he has difficulty logging in.
- Maybe we don't need so many statuses?
- Terms were relevantly well understood.
- Every travel interaction was with a human and paper.
- Saved status was misunderstood by one participant.
- I wished we had additional resources to provide after sessions.
