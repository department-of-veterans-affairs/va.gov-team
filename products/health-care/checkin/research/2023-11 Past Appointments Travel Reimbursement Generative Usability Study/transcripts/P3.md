## Transcription 

### Warm-up Questions

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
  > Yes
- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
  > No (was not aware of the possibility). _Note: Moderator decided to continue the session_
- What device are you using to join this session today?
  >Phone, Google Pixel 7
- Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  > It depends - sometimes use screen magnification, sometimes subtitles

### General Questions

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience?
  > Skipped because participant hasn't filed before
- So, knowing that you haven't filed yet. if you were to file, and that process could be. However you wanted it. What would it be like?
  > I would prefer it to be electronic where I could fill in some blanks. Go go to a website or link. Fill in some blanks of the relevant information time, date, appointment type, and then upload maybe a screenshot of the map that I traveled for distance. Because it would most likely be a reimbursement of miles, is that how that works?
- Moderator goes into some background on how filing works.
  > Then an attachment link would be helpful for me to attach receipt and relevant reimbursement paperwork.
- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had?
  > Can you clarify the question?
- Just thinking of. And in this case might have to imagine a little bit since you haven't filed yet. But thinking of travel, reimbursement claims, and then any other types of claims you have, how are those similar or different to you?
  > I guess the travel claim would be more simple because it would just involve mileage and possible parking receipts and lodging and things like that. I could more simply upload that information and answer a few questions, whereas, like a medical claim for the disability would involve more paperwork as far as like filing the claim, uploading relevant medical records. Sometimes it's harder to get those medical records from various providers, you know, if you've gone to multiple clinics. As far as like if they have questions I can fill in the blank and then upload attachments, that would be the the biggest similarity in the claims. It would just be more paperwork, I think, for the actual medical disability claims.
  

## BTSSS Status Questions
- Submitted for Payment
  > Meaning: It means the claims department have all the information they need from me and it's been approved and they've submitted to their billing department for payment.
  
  > Confusing: The only confusing part is, is it me the the veteran submitting it for payment, or is it the VA submitting it for payment. That would be the confusing part, like is. Does that mean it's been approved? Or is it just me initially filing it.
  
  > How important: It would give me confirmation. If it's meant for the veteran, it would give me confirmation that I have completed all the steps that are needed. And then once I push submit that I've submitted to the department to review it for payment. So that's it's a good confirmation, whereas, like, if I am missing the paperwork or or step I would not get the prompt that it was submitted for payment, like it would say, please review, you know, section 2, or please add this attachment. And then, if it's the other way around, if it's for the government to reimburse it would give me a positive confirmation that they've approved it and I could be, you know, waiting for payment. So it just like I said, depends if it's referring to the veterans submitted for payment all their information, or if it means the Government has completed all their steps, and you know so that's why I don't. Without context, it's hard to know.
- Payment Canceled
  > Meaning: That means, for some reason they somewhere the accounting department made a mistake. They had initially approved my payment, but then they realized it was not eligible, and they canceled the payment.
  > Confusing: No just upsetting unless it was a wrong amount. And then, you know, they've updated the amount so it could be that payment canceled, and then they have a new payment in progress.
  > Importance: Well, this would be a red flag, you know. They would prompt the service number or the veteran to do something about it, you know, but maybe make a call check to see why it was cancelled. It would definitely prompt some action, I think.
- Denied
  > Pretty much the same thing. Except now the veteran would be required to investigate, why it was denied, and also prompt for action, you know. Maybe call in, or if there's a chat available to write, say, you know what information is missing. So typically, if I see denied, I would hope there is an explanation and speculation code or blurb saying deny due to missing information or travel is not authorized for this app, you know, just something. The word there alone feels insufficient. Denial code or something. Or more information as to what information needs to be added or resubmitted.
  > Importance: That's pretty important. It might be the most important, because if you're denied, then I think that would prompt the most action. Now you're if you submit for something, and you thought you were eligible, and now you've been denied, and it would prompt you to take action to remedy the situation.
- Approved for Payment
  > It's a very good to know. I mean, it's not the most important. But it's reassuring, you know, like, okay, I did everything right. I'll just wait for the process, you know, when the money comes in and comes in.
  > Confusion: Not at all.
- In Manual Review
  > It means all the information's been received by someone did. The word manual prompts me to think there is a person that is looking at all the data on the paperwork versus an automated review. So someone, a person, is actively looking at it.
  > Confusion: I don't think so. Okay, I haven't seen it very often, though. Manual review right? Like that doesn't. That's not very commonly used, I guess. I think I understood that if they want the veteran to think that someone, a person, is manually reviewing it, then I get, I think they got the point across, and that was the intent.
  > Importance: It's okay. It's not very important, but I at least it's reassuring to know that someone's looking at it. So maybe soon I'll get an answer versus you're in the queue and it there's an unknown wait period.
- On Hold
  > It's a little confusing, because, once you submit something, I assume it's going to be on hold until someone gets to it. But then, when you tell me it's on hold, I wonder, like am I in some queue or am I missing information. Am I just waiting because there's a long line and the person that's staffed is too busy? Or am I missing something and I need to resubmit? Or in queue, you know, or pending review, versus on hold tells me there's something missing or not right about the claim. If that's their intent, then I would hope to see something like On hold, more action needed, or submit additional information, or something like that. Like, Why am I on? Hold cause on, on hold is different than progressing or awaiting review, right?
  > Importance: It's a smaller red flag than the denied. But it's kind of important. If it's on hold, I'm like, well, if I'm proactive. I'd want to investigate. Why is it on hold? Is it? That's the confusing part is, if it's just in the queue. I'm not worried, I'm just waiting because you guys are busy.
- Saved
  > That I've successfully uploaded everything, and it saved to the database waiting review hopefully.
  > Confusion: no
  > Importance: It's just kind of confirmation that what I submitted was saved. So it's just it's kind of a feel good thing. Ok, it's not floating in some cloud and possibly missing with the ones and the zeros that it saved somewhere in the database and could be retrieved. So it's just a nice confirmation.
- Claim Paid
  > That's cool. That means I can check my bank account. It's about as good as the approve for payment. Nothing confusing about it.
  > Importance: If I needed the reimbursement, it would be important for me to check my account, just to to verify. It wouldn't be super important if I wasn't counting on the payment.
- Incomplete
  > that would be great to be included on Number 6 on hold and completed something like that on hold, you know due to incomplete submission or something like that. So it would prompt action. That's pretty important, like I need to go do something about it if I want to get payment.
They're related and could possibly be adjoined in the same field cause that would clarify the on hold.
  > Importance: Very. But they would tell me I need to take action if I wanted to complete my submission.
- Fiscal Rescinded
  > I don't know what that means, as far as reimbursement goes. I don't know that. Does that mean the payments been resend it like, have they retracted their budget? I don't know how that applies to a veteran. This sounds more like a budgetary term within the department for the accounting and budgeting purposes. It's probably better stated with other words, I don't know what that means. Rescinded. Usually me, I think, means like it's cancelled, or it was never valid in the beginning. Fiscal tells me it's a bigger branch than I mean, either it's like something from Congress, maybe. Or the Va. Department's budgets been resecinded. It's a bigger term than one travel department. It sounds like the whole VA department has some budgetary. So maybe like "budgetary constraints does not allow payment at this time. I don't know something more clarifying because those 2 words, I think I feel like the common layman won't know what that means. Those those feel like big words to me.
  > Importance: This one just makes me feel helpless like? I can't do anything about this. Why are you telling me this? You know, it's sort of out of the hands of it. Feels like it's out of the hands of the of the department, and the veteran sounds like there's big, bigger congress budget issues, like, there's some legislation that needs to be passed or something. And there's nothing anyone can do about that until you know the parties agree.
- Claim Submitted
  > A very affirm good affirmation to the veteran that everything I submitted was good to go, and it's moving along. But I just need to wait for the next step.
  > Confusion: Nope. I think that's a pretty standard language. Yeah. Claim submitted.
  > Importance: Medium. It just feels good that to know that I turned in everything I need to. And then, you know, I'll just wait for the next step.
- And then so we've gone through all of those. Were there any other terms that you expected to be here that weren't
  > Maybe received and pending review. Like, maybe, instead of in manual review that tells me someone has it on their desk, and it's pending review.
  

## Task 2: Usability Testing

- Now, imagine you just received this email from VA about filing for travel reimbursement after two visits to your VA Medical Center on November 13th, 2023. Go ahead and review it.
  > Okay, it's a reminder, you can file travel reimbursement. So I'm tempted to click on the sign in the Va. Gov. To start my claim. Is that what you want me to do?
- Is that what you would do next?
  > Yes. if I want to file a claim, that's what I would do. Yes.
- Okay, don't do that quite yet, but that's good to know. Is there anything about any of this information that is confusing?
  > No, it's very clear. If those were my appointments, I like the fact that it's bolded that I have 30 days after the appointment to file, so I would take action immediately. I would click on that "sign in to va.gov" to start my claim. And then I do like the link below where it says "Go to your past appointments" in case this letter does not include any past appointments that I think should be there and could verify. Yeah, I would go straight to the sign into va.gov, and start my claim.
- And how does this compare this, this example email compared to what you'd expect to be in an email like this?
  > I like, how succinct it is. If I was to expect a simple to-the-point email, this is it.
- Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.
  > I would like, I said, take immediate action and sign in. So I'll click on the link. _(On sign in screen)_ So at this point I would log in through id.me, cause that's my favorite way to login, or login.gov would work as well.
  > _(On Appointments page)_ So I've logged in successfully right. Looks like I see my appointments. I can start scheduling, but I don't want to schedule. I want to file my travel reimbursement, which is right there in front of me. I like the pop-up screen that takes over the whole screen unless I exit away, which I won't, and I love the fact that it says I have 25 days left to file. I see I have 3 pending appointments. So this is just a typical appointment screen, which is what I'm familiar with. But I really like the pop up to allow me to to click on, so I would immediately click, cause my purpose was to file the claims. I would immediately click on that link there, "file for travel reimbursement."
- Where were you expecting to end up coming from the email?
  > I was expecting to end up in a file for travel claims screen, but this works as well. I'm ok with this because it's a pop-up but maybe some people might find that a little confusing, because I'm expecting to see a travel claim reimbursement screen like a whole section of its own, whereas this is embedded in the appointments. For me it works either way because I have the option with the exit exit away, but maybe it could have its own screen. But I don't know software-wise. If that's more complicated this works for me.
- Anything confusing on this page?
  > Not really.
  > I mean, the only thing that would be more helpful is maybe if the the title file for travel reimbursement claim is larger than the word Appointments because my eye is drawn to appointments when my purpose was to file for my reimbursement claim.
- And so you mentioned that you would not close that section out. (task card) What would you expect to happen if you did close that?
  > It would go away, and then I would be regretful, because then I would have to be searching for it. I would be upset. Because sometimes I accidentally close things. I don't mean to. So that's why it's not the best, because you might accidentally exit out quickly if the words don't catch your eye faster than the word appointment, because appointments is really big. And December 23 is really big. But the "file your reimbursement claim," which is my primary purpose is medium size. It's not the smallest, but if you want to catch my attention, I would want those to be the big writing. Because that was my sole purpose.
- How would you try and find that information if you did close that?
  > I would probably look in my past appointments and then see if this pop up would show up again in my past appointments as a prompt.
- And would you expect that to be the case?
  > If it was a really smart software that would be fantastic. But I don't know if it's that smart. So maybe that's a suggestion. Link it to the past appointment I expect to file the claim for, and therefore when I go into that pass appointment from November thirteenth, I can file the claimant from there.
- _Moderator note that participant initially said she'd immediately go to "File a travel reimbursement" on the task card. Asks her to go try going through past appointments instead to see how those expectations line up._
  > Sure, if I was too quick-handed and closed it out.
  > So, I see my past appointment. Oh, and I see one task to complete. That's cool. And it has a red dot. I like that.
- What does it seem like the one task to complete is referring to?
  > I need to do something.
  > I would click on the appointment the primary care with Jonathan Schmidt and see what my task is.
  > Or, ideally, I could just click on the task. But like, I don't think I can, I have to click on the appointment. _Clicks on appointment._ "File for travel reimbursement" (referring to CTA at top of detail page). That's very smart. And it has how many days I have left. Yeah, that's really smart. I expect to be able to touch that file for travel reimbursement and take me to where I need to be.
- And is this what you expected to find here?
  > I like it. Do I expect it? Yeah. I mean, in an ideal world it seems very user friendly.
- Go ahead and continue.
  > (on intro page) Ok, check your eligibility, file your claim. I see that I can file a mileage only, or file claim or the receipt. Okay. so that was what we were talking about earlier.
- How clear are the steps for filing?
  > So it's very clear the first one, I won't need receipts, so I, just need to put my mileage, which is perfect. Then the second one expenses total. It's very clear. I know exactly what I need to do and which way to file. _(used screen magnification here without any trouble)_
- Anything confusing on this page?
  > Just the date (prototype date error)
  > _Clicks on eligibility._ Oh, yeah, that's great. I'm eligible. All those appointments I haven't filed, for I have to go back and look at. There's no like minimum mileage here. So yeah I would be eligible. Oh, thank you. So I learned something today. So there it is. You can tell the veteran they can go into the checker eligibility to see if it applies to them. This is this is fantastic. This is very relevant, and you'll know right off the bat if you're eligible or not. I like that.
- Got ahead and continue with what you'd do next.
  > I would file a claim for travel only unless I took tolls. So I would do this the first one. Are you claiming only mileage and no other expense today? And I would click. Yes.
  > (Travel questions) Did you travel in your own vehicle? Yes. I like the big font on the question.
  > If you travel from the home address. I would say, yes. This is nice if you didn't.
- So I noticed you looked into this information. (additional info) Is anything confusing about that?
  > No, just that, you know, depending on what I'm doing that day. I may not be coming from home. I might be coming from my son's school, or I volunteer at the hospitals. I might be coming from the hospital, you know, like I might be coming from another address straight to my appointment versus going from my home. That's all.
- Ok, go ahead and click yes.
  > (Reivew page) Okay, so it it just summarized the information I selected. And then there's a beneficiary travel agreement. There's a penalty. severe criminal and civil penalty. Well, you either did or you didn't. I mean, okay, sure. And then I would click, yes, confirm and then submit claim.
  > Oh, that was really easy. So it looks like they would calculate my home address to my appointment location and just automatically do it. I wouldn't even have to input the mileage. That's really smart. I like that a lot. Yeah, that makes it really simple, because normally I've had to, you know, go to Google, map, calculate always 25 miles times to and then put in 50, but this has smart mileage calulator in it. Nice.
  > And so looking at the rest of this page this claim includes 2 appointments, so it tells me I did both appointments because they were both on the same day. I guess right? And then, if I'm not sure what I filed for, I can click review my claim. So that's kind of nice. What happens next? That's reassuring. Review my pass appointments. Check your status if I had any previous claims. This I would want to check my status on the other claims here. So that's pretty good. Learn how to set up direct deposit. So if I have not set up my direct deposit, this sounds like a great link for me to go ahead and set up or direct deposit there. Oh, another claim! This is all very relevant. This is great. I'm assuming the review. Your past appointments will have my status for the other claims. If I happen to make 'em.
- Yeah, what? Where would you expect that to go?
  > ??? I'm submitted. View your claim? Hmm! It's fine where it's at It's just confusing whether or not I can check my other status based on review your past appointments. And I don't know what this is intending.
  > Like, for example, if I had previously filed for other appointments. you know, like, because it says, check their status on claims. So what if I had multiple claims? Not from this November thirteenth one like, let's say, I had an October first one. And I'm curious about the status. This review your past appointments. I would hope it would give me those statuses if I clicked on it.
- Go ahead and select that.
  > I don't have past appointments in this scenario.
- And if you wanted to check that status that you were mentioning and that Link took you here.  Is that what you expected, or different than what you expected?
  >  I guess this work, you know, like here, I can see I have a November 15 appointment that I still have one task to complete.
- Let's say you're checking the status for that second appointment on November thirteenth. How would you do that then?
  > Since I don't have any other option. I would click on the appointment. I would go like this "In person appointment when...travel reimbursement claim, there it is in manual review. Not very confusing and manual review. So that was quick. Someone already is. I assume someone received it, and they're looking at it. But I know I just submitted it. So I don't know. Unless there's a bunch of people waiting to review these claims I don't think it could be that reviewed that fast unless it's an automated process. In manual review is just confusing. I don't know that it's that important. It just tells me somebody is doing it. But that would be very efficient if someone's looking at it already within the last 5 min. It's confusing, but not that important. I just know it's in review.
- Can you tell me a little bit about this page overall? And then also what information is most important to you here?
  > If I was looking for the travel reimbursement and it's it's on the bottom. I would have to scroll. I would hope that would be up top. But I mean, if I'm just looking at, it's okay I guess on the bottom because not everybody will have a travel reimbursement claim. So it's fine.
  > Go to after visit summary. That's nice. I'm curious what that is. Would that have like the medical notes there.
- What would you expect to be there?
  > My medical notes and follow-up care? Possibly my labs, if relevant.
- So one more question about this page, under "What," what do you think "Type of care not noted" means?
  > Um, either the provider didn't put in that information, or when I made the appointment I was not clear. Because I was expecting it to say maybe chiropractic care, orthopedic, manual manipulation, exam, follow up. That's what I would expect. But when it says type of care not noted, some one left it blank. I don't know who inputs that, like would the service member trigger that answer when they made the appointment, you know? Or would the practice, the provider input that as you know, follow-up care, exam, urgent care, manual manipulation, things like that?
- Okay, that's good to know. So it's not exactly clear where that came from and who entered the information?
  > Right
- I think that's all that we need to go through in the prototype. Do you have any other questions for me or anything else you'd like to go back to and discuss?
  > I'm curious if all the travel reimbursements are embedded within the past appointments, or there is a separate travel reimbursement section that if you go in there it would take you to these to these appointments?
  > If I was filing for the claim, that's where I would go to, I would go to travel reimbursement. I wouldn't go to pass appointments first as my first choice. But since I got the reminder email and the link and the letter, it took me here. But if I was to be proactive and go into the website va.gov, my first place to look would be travel reimbursement from the homepage. And then, because this is already so smart, if I was to select travel reimbursement, I would expect it to take me here, so you don't have to reinvent another process. It would just already be here. But I didn't know if that already exists, or if there's always a link like or this is new, right? This is a brand new process.
- This is something new that we're testing. Yeah. But yes, that's why it's really good to know this and kind of what your your mental model would be when arriving on the website.
  > I like it. The only thing additional would be it should have its own link from the home page because like I said, if I closed out, and I didn't know to look for the task. I don't know, I'm in my late forties and I'm kinda tech savvy, but if you imagine a 60 or 70 year old Veteran, this might be a little bit confusing for them. If they don't know to click on links and stuff. There's there's very few people like that now, but I still know a few people who are not so comfortable. You know, like they might be prompted to go look for travel, reimbursement on the website or file by paperwork, which ideally we should eliminate.
