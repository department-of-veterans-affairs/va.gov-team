### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > 

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > 

- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)

### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**


- Is there anything confusing about this information?
> 

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?
  > 

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.
> 

**Appointment list**

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Was there anything confusing about that process? 
  > 

- Where were you expecting to end up?
  > 

- Now let’s take a look at what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
  > 

- Is there anything confusing here?
  > 

- What would you do next?
  > 
  
- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
  > 
  
- Would that'd be something you'd do?
  > 

- And if you did select to close it, what would you expect to happen to the information there? 
  > 
  

- And what would you expect to happen if you did not close this?
  > 

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next to file that claim.
  
**Intro page**

-Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  > 

- And how clear are the steps for filing a travel reimbursement claim?
  >

  > 

- Tell me about your understanding of what's happened to your claim.
  > 

- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > 

- And did you notice this claim mentions 2 appointments?
  >

- And so why do you think that the second appointment is included here when you've gone through the process of filing just once?
  > 

- And would you expect that 2 appointments like that would be included in one process of a claim?
  >
  
-  And what would you expect to happen next with your claim?
  > 

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?

  > 

- Where did you expect that to take you?
 > 

-  Ok, let's try that.

**Past appointments page**

-  Is this where you expected to go?
  >

- Knowing that you're looking for the details page, how would you find that?
  > 

- Okay, do you wanna try that for the second one? Tell me about this page now and what you were expecting.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**


- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  > 

- Overall on this page, can you tell me about what is most important for you here?
  > 

- And did you notice the travel reimbursement section there at the bottom?
 > 

- I know we came here to learn more about your status, is this what you expected to find?
