### Warm up questions - 3 minutes 

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
  > Yes, several times.

- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
  > Yes, I did through the BTSSS.

- What device are you using to join this session today?
  > Right now it's my gamer laptop.

### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > What it was is... I live in [city], which is a 170 miles one way nearly 400 miles round trip to [facility] where I had to go. So I when I went up there, and everything the lady said "Don't forget to do your travel claim. So this is my first time, so I went up the BTSSS and they already knew that I had a travel from [city]. They already knew that; it was already in it. So selected that and submitted my claim. So doing that was really really easy. The problem is, you know, it's been about 3 months now, maybe 4, and I've heard nothing, seen nothing. I mean, it's like it went into a black hole.

- Have you been able to check on that claim at all?
  > Yes I did and I don't see anything. Like I said it like went into a black hole.
  > That's one reason why I was glad to see this here and participate, because my first experience with it has not been good. I mean it. It seemed like everything was good. But then it just goes some black hole. There's no feedback from the system to me, whether it's been received, or what's happening. It's like nothing.

- Sounds like you'd done that once?
  > Yes, I could have done it for years, because I've been with the VA since 90. Never did it. I just did it now, because those trips get a little expensive.

- And did you have a multiple appointments during this trip, or just one appointment?
  > It was one appointment and what it was was to be able to procure a scooter, which I did. They were really good. The VA, I was totally shocked, within 2 weeks they got me the scooter plus the elevator to go on my truck. I was floored. I didn't expect that. I expected a year or more.

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > Customer feedback, for example, on a lot of different portions of the VA site and throughout the industry, so to say, you submit something and you automatically get some kind of of confirmation through email or text of the action being completed. Like I said, the biggest problem now,  the only way I was looking to see is, maybe if I had a small little deposit in my checking account. You know I haven't seen any of that. So that's the big thing. If I had a magic wand, there needs to be programmed in there some customer service, you know: Confirmation feedback, or like a status, you know, Hey is it still there or did it just magically disappear? That's the big thing I see.

- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)
  > Well, that's a hard question to ask, since they have never done one to completion for me. If it was done to completion, then it would be good, because that would help me be able to have gas and stuff to meet my appointments. On the surface that's awesome thing, but in reality I haven't seen anything to completion yet - just promises. 


### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**

  > Okay, I can see that it already knows that I got appointment and where it's at. Now, here's the thing that have, and this is where it gets confusing sometimes, especially with the VA site. You say "sign in to va.gov to start start your claim," but then you have to hunt and peck and spend a lot of time trying to find the BTSSS. So, since this is for a travel claim, shouldn't the link be straight to the BTSSS

- Is that where you would expect it to go?
  > Well, yeah, because that's the thing I want to get to. Because if you go to va.gov, you go and look on there and nowhere, absolutely nowhere, does it say BTSSS anywhere. What you got to do is you gotta search and search and search until you finally find it.

- Is there anything confusing about this information?
  > No, just that. I mean, I look down at the bottom and it does have a link to the BTSSS, but I would think I would want that up further up in the email so that I could go straight there. Besides that it's good, straightforward. 

- Okay, well, go ahead and select that first link that you said you would want to know where that's going (BTSSS).
  > What the va.gov or the BTSSS?

- Which link would you select in this case?
  > I would select the BTSSS, since that is the actual content of business for this email.

- For today, we'll go with the top one, the sign in to va.gov and see where that goes. Go ahead and click on that.

  > Another alternative is to note that they need to put this on the front page, you know, like they got, they got the claims and all that. If they just would add the link to the BTSSS.
  > I always use Id.Me becuase DS Logon is horrible. Most of the time it doesn't work. Now, the new login.gov I have not tried yet, so I always use Id.me.

**Appointment list**

  > Okay, this is what I expect to see when I do log into the VA. But, now see here. This is good if I click on the VA and it takes me straight to the travel reimbursement like it shows here, that's awesome. That is awesome. (referring to task card) My experience, unless they changed it lately, it didn't do that. You did not see that.

- So you said you were expecting to see this sort of page. But you weren't expecting to see something about travel is that, did I get that right?
  > Well, what it is is I would go up to mine and I would see any claims or appointments or anything, but it didn't have this travel reimbursement information. I would have to hunt BTSSS and login to there to see anything. But if y'all are doing it this way, this is the awesome way to do it.

- Is there anything confusing about the page?
  > No, actually it's pretty awesome because there I wouldn't know my appointments and I would know which ones that I can do a travel voucher with. Because, let me tell you why that's important. Because of I see the VA clinic in [city 1] and then they refer me to [city 2], whenever they they can't handle it or whatever. So [city 1] is basically an 80 mile round trip for me, a lot less mileage. So far I have not seen any of those qualified for travel reimbursement.
  
- What would you do next?
  > 
  
- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
  > 
  
- Would that'd be something you'd do?
  > 

- And if you did select to close it, what would you expect to happen to the information there? 
  > 
  

- And what would you expect to happen if you did not close this?
  > 

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next to file that claim.
  
**Intro page**

- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  > 

- And how clear are the steps for filing a travel reimbursement claim?
  > 

- And how clear are the 2 options for filing a claim?
  > 

- And can you tell me a little bit more about the numbers to the left of this information, how you perceive that those?
  > 

- Go ahead and continue

**Review page**

- Anything confusing about this page?
  > 

- Ok, go ahead and continue.

**Success page**

- Talk to me about this page and the information included here.
  > 

- Tell me about your understanding of what's happened to your claim.
  > 

- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > 

- And did you notice this claim mentions 2 appointments?
  >

- And so why do you think that the second appointment is included here when you've gone through the process of filing just once?
  > 

- And would you expect that 2 appointments like that would be included in one process of a claim?
  >
  
-  And what would you expect to happen next with your claim?
  > 

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?
  > 

- Go ahead and and do that.

- So I'm curious. Where did you expect that link to take you? And is that different or the same as where it took you.
  > 

- So then, did you notice the review? Your past appointments link?
  > 

- Where did you expect that to take you?
 > 

-  Ok, let's try that.

**Past appointments page**

-  Is this where you expected to go?
  >

- Knowing that you're looking for the details page, how would you find that?
  > 

- Okay, do you wanna try that for the second one? Tell me about this page now and what you were expecting.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**


- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  > 

- Overall on this page, can you tell me about what is most important for you here?
  > 

- And did you notice the travel reimbursement section there at the bottom?
  > 

- I know we came here to learn more about your status, is this what you expected to find?
  > 

- Okay. and where would you expect that link to go?
  > 

- Go ahead and select that link.
  >
