## Transcription 

### Warm up questions - 3 minutes 

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
> Yes

- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
> Yes. It was through the BTSSS portal. 

- What device are you using to join this session today?
> Android (Samsung)

### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
> It's easy and not easy. Sometimes the appointments are in there, sometimes you have to put them in. So, it's something I have to go through, finding the appointment, and if it's in there, I'm able to go through and follow the steps and put my address on it, the address of the facility, and then say that I've traveled. 

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
> Would be easier if all the appointments showed up in the system. And, also, there are times when the VA address is missing.

- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)
> No, the other ones are different. The other ones always have the information you need; they're a lot quicker to go through. I sort of put them separately [in my mind].

### Task #2: BTSSS status questions - 10 minutes

- Submitted for Payment
> Feels that I've filled out the correct information, it's submitted, and I have to wait to get it confused. To me, it's not [confusing].
> It's important because I know that everything went through without errros. 
 
- Payment Canceled
> Means that they've cancelled the payment. I've only seen this one a couple of times. And, they do explain why the payment was cancelled. The explanation is usually pretty clear.
 
- Denied
> That it was not approved. I've seen that a few times. Usually what happens is that it lets met know that it's been over the amount of days to have filed the claim. 
> That's kind of important, because usually that happens when the appointment isn't in BTSSS, and when I try to create the appointment, the time has passed. 

- Approved for Payment
> Got approved and I should get a payment for it. This one is pretty clear.
> It is very important.

- In Manual Review
> Means when I enter something manually. So, then it tells me it's in manual review. So, then I have to wait to see if it's going to get approved. To me it's pretty clear [I wouldn't change the name].

- On Hold
> They've looked at it, but it's been stopped for some reason. I would call it something different, something like, "Claim on hold," and provide more information. 

- Saved
> Usually means that all the information I put in has been saved into the system. I usually do them all together. It might just mean everything I put in to the claim itself was saved. Then, I submit it after that. 

- Claim Paid
> Accepted and paid.
> It is important, because I know I'll get paid for it.

- Incomplete
> It means that not everything in the claim.

- Fiscal Rescinded
> Never seen that, so I'm not sure.

- Claim Submitted
> That the claim has gone through for verification. 

- Were there any other terms you expected to be here that were not included?
> None that I can think of right now.

### Task #2 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**

> Wow, okay.

- Is there anything confusing about this information?
> No.

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.
> Well, I would select "Sign in to VA.gov to start your claim" for these appointments.

**Appointment list**

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Was there anything confusing about that process? 
> No.

- Where were you expecting to end up?

- Now let’s take a look at what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
> It looks like it explains the medical procedures better than I've seen. But, I would go ahead and go to "file for travel reimbursement" and it tells you how many days you have left. 

- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
> I would expect for that message to go away.

- And if you did select to dismiss it, how would you find that information again?
> Two ways. I probably try to sign in again and see if it shows up. Or, click into the appointments and see. I would go where it says "Pending (3)" then see what we got pending.

**Intro page**

-Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
> No, it's not confusing. It's pretty straight up. 

- Ok, go ahead and continue.
> I would start with "check your eligibility." But, yes, I am eligible. If I selected that, I believe it would tell me that I'm eligible for it. So, it does explain eligibility a lot better.

**Review page**

- I’ll stop you here for a second. Can you tell me about this page?
> It's easy to understand.

- Ok, go ahead and continue.
> Checked box and selected "Submit claim."

**Success page**

- Talk to me about this page and the information included here.
> They included both appointments on one, which is a good thing. Also, that they gave you a claim number, which is good, to fallback in case something happens. 

**Past appointments page**

- And for the last task, can you walk me through how you would start filing for travel reimbursement for another one of your past appointments?
> Well, I see on the 15th that it says, "1 task to complete." I think it means that something missing or that I did not file a claim for this. 

**Appointment details page w/ action link**

- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
> Everything is clear. Easy to find right at the top where it says, "File a travel reimbursement." 

**Appointment details page that's been filed**

> Everything is easy to understand. I can see the claim number and that it's in manual review.

- What do you think "type of care not noted" means?
> They did not put the procedures or the reason I went to that medical center for. Something like, "procedure not available," [might be better].

### Post-Task Interview - 1-2 minutes

- Do you have any questions for me or anything else you’d like to share?
> This is a lot easier than the way it is right now. For one, when you have different appointments, it pulled them all at the same time, instead of going one by one. Yes, in BTSSS I file a claim for each individual appointment. If they do send something, they explain the reasoning into why. But, I haven't run into any problems doing that.
