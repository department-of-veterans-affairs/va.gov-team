# Past appointments travel reimbursement generative usability study - November 2023


## Background
In June 2022, a review of the VA general health care travel reimbursement program was conducted – focusing on Beneficiary Travel Self-Service System (BTSSS) – which resulted in recommendations on improvements to the Veteran experience. One of those recommendations, amongst improving existing VA products and considering alternative paths to gathering beneficiary travel (BT) information from Veterans, was to integrate travel reimbursement into the patient check-in (PCI) ecosystem.

The travel reimbursement feature within the PCI application was successfully piloted in July 2023 at PCI-enabled clinics at Wilkes-Barre VAMC, Allentown, Sayre and Williamsport, and is currently being rolled out to additional VISNs in a phased release (October 2023).

Expanding on the successful pilot response from Veterans and staff on the mileage-only travel reimbursement check in process, the PCI team is now exploring how the mileage-only userflow can be used to allow Veterans to file for travel reimbursement for past appointments in both a LoROTA environment and a fully authenticated environment. Basing the design and userflow off of previous research findings around travel reimbursement and the unified check-in experience, we will test this past appointment experience via Appointments on va.gov (i.e., solving for complexity first, meaning that Appointments on va.gov has more options for Veterans compared to PCI). 

## Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans on the proposed past appointments mileage-only travel reimbursement userflow and design and, specifically, about ease of use and how well it meets expectations. 
We also hope to learn more about Veterans’ mental models around the meaning and importance of different claim statuses used in BTSSS, to inform which statuses should be incorporated in the mileage only userflow on va.gov and which statuses the BTSSS team should consider adjusting.
Research Questions

### Primary questions:
1. From a full auth experience (on MyVA) via an email for filing a travel claim for a specific appointment, how easy or difficult is it for Veterans to navigate to file a travel reimbursement claim?
2. How helpful are task cards (that are located above the Appointment list for upcoming appointments) in helping Veterans locate the travel reimbursement task they are expecting to file?
3. How easy or difficult is it to understand the time left to file for a travel reimbursement claim for an appointment? 
4. How easy or difficult is it to understand the submitted claim status, time left to file (and associated next steps) for a travel reimbursement claim (whether filed or not) on the **confirmation pages**?
5. How easy or difficult is it to understand the status, time left to file (and associated next steps) of a travel reimbursement claim (whether filed or not) on the **details pages**?
6. Do Veterans understand the dot indicator on the appointment list indicates tasks to complete on the details page? 
7. Do Veterans understand that they can only file one travel claim for multiple appointments happening on the same day at the same facility, but that each of those travel claim statuses could update simultaneously? 
8. What would Veterans change or add, if anything, to improve filing a travel reimbursement claim for a past appointment? E.g., edit the address, upload receipts, etc.

### Secondary questions (already partially addressed in earlier research):
1. What do Veterans expect to happen if their home address is incorrect when they are filing a mileage-only claim?
2. Confirming previous research: Do Veterans find it helpful to review their appointment list before arriving at the travel reimbursement qualifying questions? (E.g., for the email scenario only.) 
3. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand they can return to their past appointments list after filing their travel claim to file another travel claim for a different appointment?

### Hypothesis

### Primary questions:
1. From a full auth experience via an email notification, how easy or difficult is it for Veterans to navigate to the travel reimbursement screens?
  - LIKELY TRUE - Veterans will think it’s very easy to navigate through the userflow from the email.
2. How helpful are task cards in helping Veterans locate the travel reimbursement task they are expecting to file?
  - MAYBE TRUE - Veterans will notice the task card but may have questions around which appointment the card is referring to.
3. How easy or difficult is it to understand the time left to file for a travel reimbursement claim for an appointment?
  - LIKELY TRUE
4. How easy or difficult is it to understand the status (and associated next steps) of a travel reimbursement claim (whether filed or not) on the **confirmation pages**?
  - LIKELY TRUE - Veterans will easily understand the travel reimburesment claims.
5. How easy or difficult is it to understand the status (and associated next steps) of a travel reimbursement claim (whether filed or not) on the **details pages**?
  - LIKELY TRUE - Veterans will understand that they have either successfully submitted their claim, or that their claim has failed to submit.
6. Do Veterans understand the dot indicator status on the appointment list indicates tasks to complete on the details page?
  - LIKELY TRUE - Veterans will understand they have a task to complete due to the content accompanying the dot indicator.
7. Do Veterans understand that only one travel claim can be filed at a time for multiple appointments in one day at the same facility, but that multiple statuses could update simultaneously? 
  - LIKELY FALSE - Veterans will not realize that they can only file one claim at a time due to multiple CTAs being present.
8. What would Veterans change or add, if anything, to improve filing a travel reimbursement claim for a past appointment? E.g., edit the address, upload receipts, etc.
  - MAYBE TRUE - Veterans will have suggestions for improvements, such as editing their address or uploading receipts for other types of claims. 

### Secondary questions (already partially addressed in earlier research):
1. What do Veterans expect to happen if their home address is not correct when they are filing a mileage-only claim?
  - LIKELY TRUE - Veterans will expect to be able to update their address (if they are traveling from their home address but it is listed incorrectly)
2. Do Veterans find it helpful to review their appointment list before arriving at the travel reimbursement questions? (depending on point of entry) 
  - LIKELY TRUE - Based on unified check-in generative research results, Veterans will overall find the appointment list helpful for quickly reviewing their appointments, and will appreciate being able to learn which appointments they can file travel reimbursement for.
3. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand they can return to their appointment list after filing their travel claim to file another travel claim for an appointment within the last 30 days?
  - MAYBE TRUE - Based on unified check-in generative research results, Veterans will be able to find how to navigate back to the appointment list, but might not notice they can do so without prompting.

## Methodology
This research will be conducted as a remote, moderated study and will combine presenting Veterans with a list of travel reimbursement claim status terms with a usability test. For the status questions, we will use present the terms via slide deck and, for usability testing, we will have the participant use an accessible CodePen prototype built for mobile devices. 

When reviewing travel reimbursement terms, participants will be asked about their interpretation of each term's meaning and how important they consider this status during the travel reimbursement process. Participants will then complete specific tasks within the CodePen prototype and will be asked follow-up questions to gain understanding of expectations and satisfaction.

Participants will try out a prototype presenting the “Email user flow (successful submission).”
