## Key Findings (Part 1): Veterans’ experience filing for travel

### Filing methods
- 7 participants last filed using BTSSS (1 participant for the first time)
- 1 participant last filed with eCheck-in (but has filed with BTSSS in the past)
- 1 participant last filed with the paper form (and has always filed with the paper form)
- 1 participant had not filed before but is eligible 



### Pain Points
The pain points mentioned centered around the BTSSS portal, though participants mentioned that, if these challenges did not occur, the process usually went smoothly. 

#### Finding BTSSS or signing in
- 6 participants mentioned challenges with finding the BTSSS portal or signing in

> "If you go to va.gov, you go and look on there and nowhere, absolutely nowhere, does it say BTSSS anywhere. What you gotta do is you gotta search and search and search until you finally find it." - P9

#### Appointments not appearing or difficulty entering appointment information
- 5 participants mentioned challenges with inputting appointment information or not finding appointments in the system, particularly community care appointments 
- 1 of these participants thought not having their appointment in the system meant they could not file a claim (and that it wasn’t possible to add it manually)

> "Sometimes it doesn't work properly, even if I input that correct information. So I've had several occasions where it's been denied. Other times, they've rearranged the title that I give it because apparently it has to be a specific title as well." - P12

#### Lack of claim status feedback/information after filing
- 3 participants mentioned having a difficult time finding out about their claim status after filing or not knowing why something was denied or not paid in full

> "So I selected that and submitted my claim. So doing that was really really easy. The problem is, you know, it's been about 3 months now, maybe 4, and I've heard nothing, seen nothing. I mean, it's like it went into a black hole." - P9

#### Difficulty filing or re-filing within the 30-day window
- 1 participant mentioned the 30-day window being problematic because there isn't time to re file a claim or is only alerted to the deadline when it has already passed

> "Usually what happens is that it lets me know that it's been over the amount of days to have filed the claim. That's kind of important, because usually that happens when the appointment isn't in BTSSS, and when I try to create the appointment, the time has passed." - P2

#### Bing maps not working
- 1 participant has struggled with Bing maps not connecting when trying to file her claims

> "So that's the only downside with using the BTSSS portal is Bing maps has been acting that way for a while.It's a hit and miss with trying to get that claim to link with the Bing maps, if you do it electrically." - P11



### Magic Wand Scenarios

For their ideal travel reimbursement claim scenario, participants had a range of responses:

#### BTSSS portal updates or changes
- 4 participants mentioned updates or changes to the BTSSS portal, such as appointments and information all showing up in the system

#### Previous Travel Reimbursement methods
- 2 participants mentioned preferring previous processes such as filing with the kiosks or in-person with a paper form at the counter
Common feedback (brief background on kiosks leaving)

> "As far as I'm concerned. I don't know why they they changed that because, you know, it was right in the office when you did it. And then when I went home, I didn't have to scroll around on the computer or anything. I thought that was very efficient. And I never had any problems with that." - P18

#### Need for confirmation feedback via email or text
- 1 participant focused the need for confirmation feedback via email or text

> "You submit something and you automatically get some kind of of confirmation through email or text of the action being completed." - P9

#### A more automated process
- 2 participants mentioned more automated processes involving text in which they could confirm their details, submit, and receive a text or email confirmation
- 1 of these 2 participants described their positive experience with eCheck-in and their desire to use that process everywhere for travel.

> "Maybe just checking in for the address you checked in from, or something like that. Or if not like, done automatically, the VA could send you a text message that you just click on and just confirm the appointment details, confirm the address, and then once you click submit this or confirm information, then it's automatically processed." - P4

> "I keep lauding the positives of text check-in, and that would be my first choice. I mean, it's just flawless. I've never had an issue with it." - P12

### Filing a claim for multiple appointments on the same day 
In addition to noting this within the prototype, we started asking Veterans if they’d ever filed multiple claims for two or more appointments on the same day at the same facility. 

Overall, Veterans seem to understand that they could not file this way, or that they would only be reimbursed for one appointment if they did try and file for both.

### Travel reimbursement claims vs. other VA claims
To learn more around Veterans’ mental model of the claims ecosystem and how travel fits into it, we asked Veterans "How do you think of your travel claims in relation to your other claims?"
- 7/8 participants were confused by the question, though we iterated on the wording during the study
- Even with iterations and in-session explanations, we were only able to get one response that addressed the question and, therefore, stopped asking this question after the 8th participant 

Based on the answers we did get, we can reasonably assume that, in the context of a cohesive claims ecosystem, Veterans either do not think of their travel claims in relation to their other VA claims or do not have an established mental model for how they think about their travel claims in relation to their other VA claims.

-----

## Key Findings (Part 2): Understanding of Claim Statuses

We presented participants with 11 claim status terms Veterans could feasibly encounter while filing, asking how they interpreted each status and which were most or least important to know during the process of filing or reviewing their claim. 

### Key Takeaways
- 8 / 10 participants completed the claim status exercise
- All 8 participants found Fiscal Rescinded confusing

- At least 3 participants thought terms should have more context or description - specifically for “Payment Canceled” “On Hold” and “In Manual Review” and “Incomplete”

- Participants thought some of the terms had the same meaning or could be combined with others, such as “Claim submitted and submitted for payment”
- 1 participant thought “Claim Received” was important to add to the statuses

## Key findings (Part 3): Usability testing - Enabling Veterans to file BT claims from Appointments

### Summary
Participants were asked to imagine they’d just received an email reminder to file for travel reimbursement and show us how they’d file their claim. Overall, participants easily navigated to and completed each section of the travel reimbursement, mileage-only claim user flow. Most challenges appeared after filing when participants attempted to learn more about the claim status or to file another claim.

1. Starting the claim - Receiving an email to start a task on VA.gov was a familiar pattern for Veterans. 8/10 participants easily navigated from the email to the start of the travel reimbursement flow on VA.gov. 2/10 participants said they’d select the link to the BTSSS portal rather than Appointments on VA.gov.

2. Filing the claim - The simplified, mileage-only process – also used in eCheck-in – proved easy for participants to complete. Regardless of which path Veterans chose (i.e., navigating from the task card or the past appointments page), 10/10 participants completed the steps to file their claim.

3. Learning more about the claim status or filing another claim - Most challenges appeared after filing, e.g., when participants were asked how to learn more about their claim status or to return to the past appointment list to file another claim. Veterans understood the path, once prompted, but did not generally choose to return to the past appointments list or an appointment detail page on their own and felt the experience lacked a direct link to check the status of their claim.

### Starting the claim 
Most participants easily navigated to the appointment list from the travel reimbursement email reminder.

#### Email & sign in
<img width="435" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 3 29 12 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/79372956/14911814-c170-4dfe-9a8d-69f168b4ac16">

- Participants found the information in the email easy to understand and said it was aligned with what they'd expect from an email from VA, although 1 participant mentioned they expected the email to take them directly to BTSSS, and 1 other participant said they’d prefer a text instead of an email

> "Reminder and claim. Ok yeah. I mean this is cool, too, because I don't think I've ever gotten a reminder to file the travel reimbursement." - P4

>  "Since this is for a travel claim, shouldn't the link be straight to the BTSSS?" - P9

- 7/10 participants selected the “sign in to VA.gov to start your claim” link, while 2 participants said they would go directly to the link leading to the BTSSS portal.
  - And, 1 participant selected the “past appointments link” because they wanted to review their appointments first.

> "It's really great. It has a link to start the claim so I don't have to scroll through anything. I would click that link to start the claim.” - P1

- Participants went through a mock sign in, but spoke aloud about some of their frustrations around the actual VA.gov sign in process

### Filing the claim
Participants easily understood how to file their mileage-only travel reimbursement claim after arriving on the appointment list from the reminder email. 

#### Appointment list
<img width="385" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 3 34 57 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/79372956/34699fd0-f3dc-4de4-bc5f-b71b6f575d26">

- A few participants expected to arrive elsewhere (e.g., a specific claim, such as on the appointment detail page or to VA.gov to find the BTSSS portal entry, but noted they liked this option better.
> "This is good if I click on the VA and it takes me straight to the travel reimbursement like it shows here, that's awesome. [Normally] I would have to hunt for BTSSS and log in to there to see anything. But if y'all are doing it this way, this is the awesome way to do it." - P9

- All Veterans noticed the task card, number of days left to file, and action link

- 8/9 participants who arrived on the appointment list chose to start their claim by selecting the “file for travel reimbursement” link in the task card.
  - 1 participant noticed the action link, but decided to file by navigating to their past appointments.

- Participants did not want the option to close the task card if it meant the information would go away.
  - 1 participant thought closing the card would cancel their reimbursement opportunity.

> “It would go away, and I would be regretful, because I would have to be searching for it. It's not the best, because you might accidentally exit out quickly if the words don't catch your eye” - P3

#### Intro page
- Participants said they found the intro page clear and understood the claim options and steps to file, though we observed a few points of confusion: 1 participant was thrown off by the process list structure, and 1 participant understood the page to mean they had already finished filing.

- We heard diverse feedback around the reimbursement eligibility information: 2 participants called out the instructions on how to check their eligibility as positive, while 2 other participants assumed VA had already confirmed their eligibility.

> "This is fantastic. This is very relevant, and you'll know right off the bat if you're eligible or not. I like that." - P3

> "Whenever I get this, it already has determined whether I'm eligible or not." - P9

- 2 participants mentioned they expected to find a link for checking the status of a claim in step 3

- All participants found and selected the link to “File a mileage-only travel claim”

#### Mileage-only travel questions
- We did not observe any difficulties with the mileage-only travel questions. Participants navigated through them quickly and understood the questions. A screen magnification user noted, “I like the big font on the questions.” (P3) while another mentioned wanting "you can't file a claim right now" in the additional info component dropdown to be bold so it was easier to notice
  
- 1 participant who uses eCheck-in to file travel noted that they were familiar with this process

#### Review page
- All participants found the review page easy to understand, quickly reviewed, and submitted their claim

> "Review, click the box, check the box, and submit the claim. That's pretty easy." - P12

- 2 participants called out both the “Edit” link and the collapsed BT agreement as helpful

> Review page edit button: "So if you need to change some information in it, you can do that before you go through with your claim." - P11

> Review page additional info component: "I read the beneficiary travel agreement every time, just because my eyes do that. So I like the fact that I don't have to read it if I don't want to." - P13

#### Success page
- Immediately after filing, it was easy for participants to understand what happened to their claim. Participants reported the success page was clear and had positive reactions to reviewing the success alert, the inclusion of the claim number, and the option to file another claim. 

- 4 participants mentioned expecting to receive an email or text immediately after filing

> "The only way I can know is to go look at my checking account." "If there was a way where once it's paid, there could be a text or an email just sent to your account." - P18

### Learning more or filing another claim

Most challenges arose when participants tried to learn more about a claim status or file another claim.

#### Success page 
- Although participants noticed the “2 appointments” in the success alert, some did not notice it until prompted, and not all participants were clear on the reasoning for “2 appointments” appearing

- All participants who selected the “review your claim” link expected to be taken directly to their claim or claims, whether in BTSSS or an appointment detail on VA.gov, rather than the unauthenticated travel reimbursement page on VA.gov. We also heard frustration around the need to “sign in again” at this step.

> "Is it information that's related? Yes. But that's not what I want to see. I'm wanting to look at the claim that I just submitted." -P9

- Participants found the content related to the “Review your past appointments” link confusing

> “Because it said “you can check the status of your claim by going to the appointment details page for this appointment,’ and then it says, ‘review your past appointment.’”  “I would think that's gonna take me to my appointments list via the appointments details page." - P4

- Participants had trouble learning more about their claim status and expected to find resources for travel pay in the “Need help” section on the page. 4 participants said they’d check “Need help”  first and were surprised not to find the information there.

> "If you have any questions or concerns in regards to your travel reimbursement claim this is the number you can call, or this is the email contact, or something like that." - P11

#### Past appointments
- Participants had to be prompted by the moderator to navigate to the past appointments page to learn about their claim status, but once there, understood how to find and review them

> "This would become very familiar quickly." "This looks simple enough. And getting here was easy." - P12

- Participants generally noticed the dot indicator, though some only mentioned it after they were asked about it. Not all participants understood its meaning and gave a range of interpretations. Only after visiting the appointment detail page, participants understood that it was referring to being able to file a travel reimbursement claim.

> "Would probably have to file it or add more information," - P1
> "It would probably be a message of some kind" - P8
> "Do I need to complete it? Or is that something on the clinic that needs to be completed?" - P11
> "I think it means that something missing or that I did not file a claim for this." - P2
> "You might want to explain what that means a little bit, like the voucher needs to be submitted." - P18
> "Since this is a travel reimbursement, it tells me that this is a travel reimbursement." - P9

#### Details page (w/ travel status)
- 6/8 participants who viewed the appointment detail page easily found the travel reimbursement section and claim status. However, it wasn’t clear how noticeable this section was for 2 participants, who took longer to find it.

> "If I was looking for the travel reimbursement and it's on the bottom. I would have to scroll. I would hope that would be up top. But I mean, if I'm just looking at, it's okay I guess on the bottom because not everybody will have a travel reimbursement claim." - P3

- Echoing previous feedback about the “review your claim” link on the success page, participants expected this link to lead somewhere with more direct information about their claim or claims, rather than the unauthenticated travel reimbursement information page on VA.gov.

> "a page that had all my claims" to "go back and look and see what you put in," or "a screen that says where my claim is"

- Participants interpreted “type of care not noted” in a variety of ways and overall were not sure about its meaning or who input the information (e.g., Veteran or staff). 1 participant mentioned they didn’t think their claim would be approved if the type of care wasn’t provided.

> "I don't think [travel reimbursement] would be approved that way if the specific care wasn't noted on the claim that I would send." - P12

## Recommendations

### Part 1: Veterans’ experience filing for travel

- **Make it easier for Veterans to find the BTSSS entry portal on VA.gov.** 

- **Integrate notifications (text and email) into BTSSS** to let Veterans know when a claim has been filed, an action is required, and when the status of a claim has been updated. 

- **Lessen the burden for Veterans of having to enter appointment information** for community care claims.  

- **Investigate easier sign in methods for BTSSS**, while also considering how an authenticated user from VA.gov could avoid signing in again when entering the travel pay entry portal. 

- **Identify a solution to allow Veterans to fix or refile a claim** once they’ve received notification that their claim has been denied and it’s past the 30-day filing window.

- **Consider investigating a more reliable map service to replace Bing Maps**. E.g., Mapbox, Google Maps, etc. 

- _**Investigate opportunities for a more automated, “touchless” experience for Veterans to file a claim after an appointment.** For example, Vista Scheduling Enhancements for Clinical Staff (VSE-CS) using BTSSS API, which could automatically submit claims at the completion of a care encounter, i.e., if mileage-only claim criteria was met._  

- Continue research to understand where Veterans would navigate on VA.gov after filing a claim, as a means to **better understand the mental model between BT claims and other VA claims**.

### Part 2: Understanding of claim statuses

- **Utilize more plain language alternatives for claim statuses**, especially “Fiscal Rescinded.”

- **Consider creating descriptions to provide meaning to existing claim statuses**, especially for “Payment Canceled,” “On Hold,” “In Manual Review,” “Incomplete,” and “Denied.” For example, include information that explain what’s happening during this step, why it might be in this status, and what’s expected next. 

- **Consider using fewer claim statuses, e.g., ones that are most important to Veterans**, or better differentiate between similar statues. For example, help Veterans better understand which statuses are more staff-facing or remove them altogether. 

- **When applicable, include the reason a claim was denied in the BTSSS portal**, instead of the Veteran waiting for a letter with the explanation. 

### Part 3: Enabling Veterans to file BT claims from Appointments

#### Email reminder

- **Confirm correct email notification template is being utilized with/from VA Notify**. E.g., 1 Veteran mentioned that it would feel more authentic with the VA seal. 

- **Consider how to further clarify that this potentially new BT filing process (for mileage-only claims) occurs on VA.gov**, versus BTSSS, so Veterans feel confident in their selection of filing options. 

- **Consider adding a text notification** for Veterans that prefer text over email communication.

#### Appointment list page

- **Remove option to dismiss the task card** because Veterans had varying opinions on its function but did not want to lose the information. 

- **Consider including “past appointment” in the task card’s content to help create a mental model that BT claims are associated with past appointments**, even though the task card for filing BT appears on the upcoming appointments list page. (I.e., as a way to create a mental model that important actions for Veterans appear in a centralized location.)

#### Form introduction page

- **Continue to move towards (i.e., the VTP and BTSSS offices) creating a BT eligibility check system** that would remove the need for Veterans to check their own eligibility.
  
- **Move the travel reimbursement eligibility information below the “If you're eligible…” information** to address Veteran confusion.
  
- **Consider better highlighting (e.g., bolding) “if you’re claiming only mileage” so Veterans can quickly scan the page and understand that it’s the option for filing without receipts**, knowing that it makes up ~75% of all claims across VA sites.
  
- **Evaluate the benefit of adding a link to the past appointments page to check a claim status in step 3 of the process list**, knowing that a disadvantage would be that Veterans would need to manually find the appointments from their list for the associated claim. (E.g., it could be more than 1 appointment.)
  
- **Consider adding another step to the process list with information on how to set up a direct deposit before filing your first claim.** (https://www.va.gov/resources/how-to-set-up-direct-deposit-for-va-travel-pay-reimbursement/)

#### Mileage-only claim eligibility questions 

- **Share feedback with VA design community that some Veterans prefer task-based questions in the large h1 heading style**, i.e., because it’s easier to see (for sighted users). (https://design.va.gov/patterns/help-users-to/complete-a-sub-task) 

- **Consider how we might bring more attention to important information that’s in the additional information components**, such as bolding specific content in the expanded view or moving the information to the body of the page.

#### Form review page

- **Work towards including the estimated reimbursement amount** (if or once its added into the BTSSS API return response), which Veterans expected to review, since it appears in BTSSS.  

- In future research, **evaluate if Veterans’ understanding of the “Edit” link in the form review page is in line with its actual function**.

#### Form success page

- **Consider simplifying (i.e., reducing the amount of information on) the page and avoiding repeating links**, which only serve to potentially confuse Veterans.
  
- **Follow VA content style guidelines for links more closely for the “Review your claim” link to better communicate the link destination for Veterans**. And, change the link destination to, ideally, deep link to the claim in BTSSS or directly to the BTSSS entry portal.

- **Discuss the possibility of not having to sign in again on AccessVA** when entering BTSSS from an authenticated session on VA.gov.  

- **Add information on how to get help with travel reimbursement** in the “Need help” or the “What else can I do?” section.

- **Send a notification (text or email) after a claim is filed** to keep Veterans up to date on their claim status. 

- **In the success alert, consider providing more appointment information instead of “This claim includes 2 appointments on {Date} at {FacilityName}.”** 

- Also mentioned on the appointment list page, **consider including the use of “past” for links associated with filing a BT claim to strengthen the mental model with Veterans that BT claims are associated with past appointments**.

#### Past appointments list page

- Further evaluate effectiveness of the dot indicator pattern, and whether it can be modified to include context about the action that needs to be completed. In addition, explore a task card component that supports a group of tasks to complete, which is something the Check In Team is beginning to explore for the VA design community.

#### Past appointments detail page

- If possible, move travel reimbursement information to the top of the page until it has reached its end of cycle. E.g., paid, denied, etc. And once it does, then move it to the bottom of the page since it will cease to provide new information to Veterans. 

- Pass along findings that “type of care noted” for the Type of Care field was not understood by Veterans to the CAIA Team. Recommend being more direct, such as “Not available” or “Not provided,” and clarify the source of this information (e.g., provider or patient). Or, have a neutral value when the source of the information is unknown. For example, “VA appointment.”

- Also mentioned on the success page, follow VA content style guidelines for links more closely for the “Review your claim” link to better communicate the link destination for Veterans. And, change the link destination to, ideally, deep link to the claim in BTSSS or directly to the BTSSS entry portal.

-----

## Conclusions
### Increasing ways to file BT claims further benefits Veterans
Most, if not all, Veterans we spoke to usually file for mileage-only reimbursements, which accounts for ~75% of claims filed across all VA sites. Therefore, adding the ability to file a claim on Appointments on VA.gov, a heavily trafficked VA Health App, has the potential to increase awareness and offer Veterans an easy, and quick, method for filing a claim. In addition, by including a path for Veterans to file a claim with receipts (through BTSSS) in the Appointments experience, Veterans will have a more holistic view of how to file any type of BT claim, which will help strengthen their understanding of the program and its benefits. 

### Veterans want better feedback from VA/BTSSS when changes to their claim status occurs 
Regardless of how Veterans file a claim, they were collectively clear that they expect notifications (text and email) when they file a claim, when an action is required, and when the status of a claim has been updated. 

### Veterans want the BTSSS portal to better meet their expectations
Most Veterans mentioned having a difficult time understanding different claim statuses meanings, locating and signing in to BTSSS from VA.gov, and finding their appointment in the portal (i.e., for community care appointments). Therefore, with some adjustments to the BTSSS portal to address these concerns, better 
trust can be built between Veterans, VA, and the the tools they use to access their benefits.
