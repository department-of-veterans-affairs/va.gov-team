# BTSSS Statuses Exercise 

## Key takeaways: 
(Note: these are currently pulled from memory / top takeaways posts - need confirmation once all participant answers are recorded here)

- 8 / 10 participants completed the claim status exercise
- All 8 participants found Fiscal Rescinded confusing
- At least 3 participants thought terms should have more context or description - specifically for “Payment Canceled” “On Hold” “In Manual Review” “Incomplete” and "Denied"
- Participants thought some of the terms had the same meaning or could be combined with others, such as “Claim submitted and submitted for payment”
- 1 participant thought “Claim Received” was important to add to the statuses

## Terms tested

### Submitted for Payment
- P1: My claim was approved. Claim approved [would be better]. It's important because I want to know if there was a problem, like if it was pending, denied, etc. If it was approved, then I don't have to chase anyone down.
- P2: Feels that I've filled out the correct information, it's submitted, and I have to wait to get it confused. To me, it's not [confusing]. It's important because I know that everything went through without errors.
  - Meaning: It means the claims department have all the information they need from me and it's been approved and they've submitted to their billing department for payment.
  - Confusing: The only confusing part is, is it me the the veteran submitting it for payment, or is it the VA submitting it for payment. That would be the confusing part, like is. Does that mean it's been approved? Or is it just me initially filing it.
  - How important: It would give me confirmation. If it's meant for the veteran, it would give me confirmation that I have completed all the steps that are needed. And then once I push submit that I've submitted to the department to review it for payment. So that's it's a good confirmation, whereas, like, if I am missing the paperwork or or step I would not get the prompt that it was submitted for payment, like it would say, please review, you know, section 2, or please add this attachment. And then, if it's the other way around, if it's for the government to reimburse it would give me a positive confirmation that they've approved it and I could be, you know, waiting for payment. So it just like I said, depends if it's referring to the veterans submitted for payment all their information, or if it means the Government has completed all their steps, and you know so that's why I don't. Without context, it's hard to know.
- P4: Pretty self explanatory, submitted for payment. I'd expect that my claim has been submitted, and I'm just waiting to be paid. 
- P8: The first one would be meaning that it was submitted for payment.
- P11: It's letting me know that I completed my claim. I submitted just to try to get reimbursed for travel
- P13: That means I've filed the claim and it's waiting. Probably it would be like the first couple of days after you've filed the claim. To me it's pretty important cause, if not, randomly like in my savings account, I'll get a travel reimbursement. I'm like, okay, which appointment was that for?
- P18: Submitted for payment means it was approved but it's waiting for payment.

### Payment Canceled
- P1: I haven't encountered it. But, guessing it's been denied after an error. Probably saying, "Denied" or "Pending."
- P2: Means that they've canceled the payment. I've only seen this one a couple of times. And, they do explain why the payment was canceled. The explanation is usually pretty clear.
- P3: Meaning: That means, for some reason they somewhere the accounting department made a mistake. They had initially approved my payment, but then they realized it was not eligible, and they canceled the payment. Confusing: No just upsetting unless it was a wrong amount. And then, you know, they've updated the amount so it could be that payment canceled, and then they have a new payment in progress. Importance: Well, this would be a red flag, you know. They would prompt the service number or the veteran to do something about it, you know, but maybe make a call check to see why it was cancelled. It would definitely prompt some action, I think.
- P4: For some reason there's an issue, and the reimbursement was canceled. 
- P8: Second one was payment would have been canceled.
- P11: That's one of those I will need clarification on. I don't know if it's because it's denied. I don't know if 2 or 3 would go hand in hand if it was denied, and then payment canceled, or if they double paid. I don't know about that one.
- P13: To me it would be that they decided not to pay it. I would wonder why, you know, I kind of like a why after it. Pretty important.
- P18: I would guess payment canceled for some reason they found a reason not to pay you, you know, when it came time for the payment.

### Denied
- P1: I'm not getting payment. There's something missing or I don't qualify for reimbursement. This one is very important.
- P2: That it was not approved. I've seen that a few times. Usually what happens is that it lets me know that it's been over the amount of days to have filed the claim. That's kind of important, because usually that happens when the appointment isn't in BTSSS, and when I try to create the appointment, the time has passed.
- P3: Pretty much the same thing. Except now the veteran would be required to investigate, why it was denied, and also prompt for action, you know. Maybe call in, or if there's a chat available to write, say, you know what information is missing. So typically, if I see denied, I would hope there is an explanation and speculation code or blurb saying deny due to missing information or travel is not authorized for this app, you know, just something. The word there alone feels insufficient. Denial code or something. Or more information as to what information needs to be added or resubmitted. Importance: That's pretty important. It might be the most important, because if you're denied, then I think that would prompt the most action. Now you're if you submit for something, and you thought you were eligible, and now you've been denied, and it would prompt you to take action to remedy the situation.
- P4: My claim was denied for some reason.
- P8: The third one would be denied, for whatever reason I wasn't -- probably meaning that I had submitted some kind of a claim and that was denied because like I've had before, because apparently there's some information, like a wrong date. Perhaps a wrong date, or something like that I've had before.
- P13: That would mean they decided not to pay it. Again add the why after it. Even just a brief description of why it was denied. Again, pretty important because I'd want to know if it's not gonna come in. I know some people, you know, depend on that to pay for their next appointment, you know, fuel for their next appointment. So to me, it would be pretty important to know it.
- P18: For whatever reason they denied it. Whoever approves it denied it.

### Approved for Payment
- P1: The claim was approved. Nothing confusing. Very important.
- P2: Got approved and I should get a payment for it. This one is pretty clear. It is very important.
- P3: It's a very good to know. I mean, it's not the most important. But it's reassuring, you know, like, okay, I did everything right. I'll just wait for the process, you know, when the money comes in and comes in. Confusion: Not at all.
- P4: That, after it's been submitted, it’s now sent and it's just way to be processing.
- P8: Which would be that it's approved for.
- P11: Which means, after they did their manual review, everything for that claim was checked out and verified, and they approved for payment to be dispensed.
- P13: Approved for payment means that they've okayed the mileage, and that at some point in time they'll send a check or direct deposit. Again, very important.
- P18: It got approved. No problem. So you'd be expecting a payment.

### In Manual Review
- P1: That I have successfully submitted my claim. Nothing confusing. Does manual review mean that the computer or someone is going to review my information? Somewhere in the middle. I don't know.
- P2: Means when I enter something manually. So, then it tells me it's in manual review. So, then I have to wait to see if it's going to get approved. To me it's pretty clear [I wouldn't change the name].
- P3: It means all the information's been received by someone did. The word manual prompts me to think there is a person that is looking at all the data on the paperwork versus an automated review. So someone, a person, is actively looking at it. Confusion: I don't think so. Okay, I haven't seen it very often, though. Manual review right? Like that doesn't. That's not very commonly used, I guess. I think I understood that if they want the veteran to think that someone, a person, is manually reviewing it, then I get, I think they got the point across, and that was the intent. Importance: It's okay. It's not very important, but I at least it's reassuring to know that someone's looking at it. So maybe soon I'll get an answer versus you're in the queue and it there's an unknown wait period.
- P4: It didn't go through like the automatic process. That it had to be looked over.
- P8: In a manual review would be that someone would be checking it out.
- P13: I would have no clue other than my brain automatically goes to somebody pulled the file, and is like actually, manually looking at the report of my mileage. And you know, receipts or what not. Pretty important cause it kinda tells you that it's gonna be a little bit longer before you get paid, or not paid.
- P18: And manual review means it's just in probably one of the layers that it has to go through before it gets approved.

### On Hold
- P1: I have no clue. What's the difference between waiting for manual review and on hold? Have they gotten to it or not?
- P2: They've looked at it, but it's been stopped for some reason. I would call it something different, something like, "Claim on hold," and provide more information.
- P3: It's a little confusing, because, once you submit something, I assume it's going to be on hold until someone gets to it. But then, when you tell me it's on hold, I wonder, like am I in some queue or am I missing information. Am I just waiting because there's a long line and the person that's staffed is too busy? Or am I missing something and I need to resubmit? Or in queue, you know, or pending review, versus on hold tells me there's something missing or not right about the claim. If that's their intent, then I would hope to see something like On hold, more action needed, or submit additional information, or something like that. Like, Why am I on? Hold cause on, on hold is different than progressing or awaiting review, right? Importance: It's a smaller red flag than the denied. But it's kind of important. If it's on hold, I'm like, well, if I'm proactive. I'd want to investigate. Why is it on hold? Is it? That's the confusing part is, if it's just in the queue. I'm not worried, I'm just waiting because you guys are busy.
- P4: It's on hold for some reason. I didn't understand that one. That would make me think like something, either it could possibly be in manual review. It was incomplete. It has possibly been denied, it is like up in the air. I think on hold either shouldn't be there, or it should have a different term. Something because in manual review could have your claim on hold as well, like just saying. On hold, that leaves you in limbo wondering what's going on.
- P8: On hold would be like pending for somebody to look at it or pending for future reference on whatever that would be.
- P11: When I see on hold, I think of that maybe that some information is missing for that claim in regards to the appointment, or if the a caregiver or veteran need to update some more information or send in some more documentation on their end, and that claim is just on hold until then.
- P13: Kind of to me means the same as in manual review, in the fact that somebody has pulled it and is looking it over for some reason or another, and I would put the "why" at the end of it. Again, pretty important.
- P18: There must be a reason it's gonna be on hold. You gotta probably look into that.

### Saved
- P1: It's saved, but I haven't submitted it yet. It's pretty clear. Sometimes I think I have submitted it, but I haven't. So, it's very important to know if it's been submitted. Because I don't have pictures of the community care forms needed for evidence, I'll often have to go back and upload to my computer, and then go back to my claim.
- P2: Usually means that all the information I put in has been saved into the system. I usually do them all together. It might just mean everything I put in to the claim itself was saved. Then, I submit it after that.
- P3: That I've successfully uploaded everything, and it saved to the database waiting review hopefully. Confusion: no Importance: It's just kind of confirmation that what I submitted was saved. So it's just it's kind of a feel good thing. Ok, it's not floating in some cloud and possibly missing with the ones and the zeros that it saved somewhere in the database and could be retrieved. So it's just a nice confirmation.
- P4: I don't understand what that would be.
- P8: Saved would be having to do that the information was taken care of and stored in whatever way. Saved would be like, it's saved and it was processed. It's kept in the system, I would assume.
- P11: You know things happen, systems shut down, or like in my case, I'm still waiting for Bing maps to communicate with the system. So the system automatically saved your process where you're at now, so you don't have to go through and repeat the steps once you log in again.
- P13: That one means that I didn't have all my receipts and realized it. So I'm gonna go ahead and save it, so I don't have to put all the other information back in when I sign back in. It's important but not drastically important.
- P18: It's saved. I don't know why that would be here, I mean, save just means they're not doing anything with it. They just saved it. 
  - I don't know exactly what saved would be. Just that's not telling you much information, so let's see... incomplete and manual.

### Claim Paid
- P1: That I should probably check my bank account to confirm. Pretty clear. Yes, [very important].
- P2: Accepted and paid. It is important, because I know I'll get paid for it.
- P3: That's cool. That means I can check my bank account. It's about as good as the approve for payment. Nothing confusing about it. Importance: If I needed the reimbursement, it would be important for me to check my account, just to to verify. It wouldn't be super important if I wasn't counting on the payment.
- P4: Self-explanatory. I've been been reimbursed.
- P8: Claim paid would be something that's been already paid for.
- P11: Claim paid is just that the claim was approved. They dispense the funds. You received the funds either by check or in your bank account, and it just updated to that that claim was paid.
- P13: That means they've sent a check or direct deposited the money for the mileage. I guess pretty important, that way I knew the money was, you know. going to be in my count within couple days at least.
- P18: I would think that would be the same as approved for payment, although it's already been paid. After that so approve for payment is approved but I haven't been paid, and then claim paid means it has been paid.

### Incomplete
- P1: There's information missing. It's pretty clear. Very important.
- P2: It means that not everything is in the claim.
- P3: that would be great to be included on Number 6 on hold and completed something like that on hold, you know due to incomplete submission or something like that. So it would prompt action. That's pretty important, like I need to go do something about it if I want to get payment. They're related and could possibly be adjoined in the same field cause that would clarify the on hold. Importance: Very. But they would tell me I need to take action if I wanted to complete my submission.
- P4: Something is missing.
- P8: Incomplete would be pending information that I probably didn't submit.
- P11: I don't know if incomplete would go hand in hand with on hold, or if that could be one of the reasons why. Incomplete could be anything, some additional information documentation is missing to verify the appointment, or the appointment was not closed out all the way on a facility end, so right now that or if the claim is missing receipts or information like that, it's considered incomplete before you can submit it.
- P13: Means kind of the same as far as the saved. It's just giving you a little bit more information that okay, you still have stuff to add to this claim. But again, there's the why? Because after it, if I saw that I would want to be able to have highlighted what was missing. So like if I forgot to put my phone number in, or the mileage in, or what not, having that description or the highlighted parts to tell me why it's incomplete. Pretty important that way I knew I, you know, had something else to add to it, and I wasn't sitting there waiting for a claim that is incomplete to go through.
- P18: Incomplete means they need more information.

### Fiscal Rescinded
- P1: I have no clue. Probably appealed something and they made the final decision. I guess it [seems important], but sort of confusing.
- P2: Never seen that, so I'm not sure.
- P3: I don't know what that means, as far as reimbursement goes. I don't know that. Does that mean the payments been resend it like, have they retracted their budget? I don't know how that applies to a veteran. This sounds more like a budgetary term within the department for the accounting and budgeting purposes. It's probably better stated with other words, I don't know what that means. Rescinded. Usually me, I think, means like it's cancelled, or it was never valid in the beginning. Fiscal tells me it's a bigger branch than I mean, either it's like something from Congress, maybe. Or the Va. Department's budgets been resecinded. It's a bigger term than one travel department. It sounds like the whole VA department has some budgetary. So maybe like "budgetary constraints does not allow payment at this time. I don't know something more clarifying because those 2 words, I think I feel like the common layman won't know what that means. Those those feel like big words to me. Importance: This one just makes me feel helpless like? I can't do anything about this. Why are you telling me this? You know, it's sort of out of the hands of it. Feels like it's out of the hands of the of the department, and the veteran sounds like there's big, bigger congress budget issues, like, there's some legislation that needs to be passed or something. And there's nothing anyone can do about that until you know the parties agree.
- P4: No idea.
- P8: I don't know how to say that word. Okay, that's the first time I've ever seen that. It could be pertaining for whatever date funds would be available for that, perhaps.
- P11: I am not sure what that one will be for Number 10. I don't know if it's because every fiscal year the budget has to be reviewed, or whatever the case may be, and the money's put on hold. I'm not sure what fiscal rescinded it means.
- P13: No clue. I would Google it. I couldn't take any more steps. I'd have to go look it up.
- P18: Yeah, I don't know what the hell that is, for some reason they they don't wanna pay you, whether you make too much money, or we're ineligible or what, I would guess. That's kind of a tough one. 
  - And like, I say, the tenth one is kind of a crazy one. I don't understand exactly what that would mean.

### Claim Submitted
- P1: I've successfully submitted my claim. Important.
- P2: That the claim has gone through for verification.
- P3: A very affirm good affirmation to the veteran that everything I submitted was good to go, and it's moving along. But I just need to wait for the next step. Confusion: Nope. I think that's a pretty standard language. Yeah. Claim submitted. Importance: Medium. It just feels good that to know that I turned in everything I need to. And then, you know, I'll just wait for the next step.
- P4: I’ve submitted my claim for processing.
- P8: Claim submitted would be the actual claim that was submitted at the time.
- P11: You submitted your claim.
- P13: That means I had all my ducks in a row, and I hit the submit button, and it's telling me that I did. I did all the steps I could do. Pretty important because then I can, you know, check it off my list of things to do for the day. I know that it's sent.
- P18: It's been submitted but hasn't been paid. Some of them are kind of similar to each other though, I think. Submitted for payment and claim submitted, I would say one and 11 are similar to each other.

### Were there any other terms you expected to be here that were not included?
- P1: I don't think so.
- P2: None that I can think of right now.
- P3: Maybe received and pending review. Like, maybe, instead of in manual review that tells me someone has it on their desk, and it's pending review.
- P18: (Reason denied) That would probably be a good thing to put in there. You wouldn't know. You'd have to go back and look and see where where would do it. But if it's gave you a reason there, maybe that would help you.

### Encountered any of these while filing?
- P8: The only one having to do with the denied - that I put in the wrong date. And I received a letter in the mail saying it was denied for so and so reason. Other than that, no.
- P18: The only thing that's happened is they've paid me just for I thought not as much as they paid me before, so I really didn't know why. But there was no way really to find that out. I was telling you about paying you one way or whatever, but so they would pay you, and it seemed partial to me, but then there was no way to really figure it out. So it wasn't that big of a deal, but it'd be too hard to go figure out.

### Most important
- P4: I don’t know what fiscal rescinded is. Everything else would be important to my my claim being submitted and me finding out where it is, as far as the status.
- P8: The approved payment, submitted for payment, claim paid, and claim submitted. Those will be the most concern right there, which would be assuring that something positive went on behalf of my claim. Something negative would be payment canceled, denied, in manual review. Just in case there's something that perhaps was not well informed at the time. On hold would be pending for many things. Save - same for the purpose that it was submitted and the claim paid that it was paid for. Incomplete would be missing information.
- P11: I believe all of them to be important. I just don't know about fiscal rescinded, if that's something that needs to be seen because I don't know what it would pertain to, but other than Number 10 I feel like all of them are important to be seen.
