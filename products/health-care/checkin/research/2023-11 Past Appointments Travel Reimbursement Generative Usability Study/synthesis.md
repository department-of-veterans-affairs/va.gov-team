## Key Findings: Veterans’ experience filing for travel

### Filing methods
- 7 participants last filed using BTSSS (1 participant for the first time)
- 1 participant last filed with eCheck-in (but has filed with BTSSS in the past)
- 1 participant last filed with the paper form (and has always filed with the paper form)
- 1 participant had not filed before but is eligible 



### Pain Points
The pain points mentioned centered around the BTSSS portal, though participants mentioned that, if these challenges did not occur, the process usually went smoothly. 

#### Finding BTSSS or signing in
- 6 participants mentioned challenges with finding the BTSSS portal or signing in

> "If you go to va.gov, you go and look on there and nowhere, absolutely nowhere, does it say BTSSS anywhere. What you gotta do is you gotta search and search and search until you finally find it." - P9

#### Appointments not appearing or difficulty entering appointment information
- 5 participants mentioned challenges with inputting appointment information or not finding appointments in the system, particularly community care appointments 
- 1 of these participants thought not having their appointment in the system meant they could not file a claim (and that it wasn’t possible to add it manually)

> "Sometimes it doesn't work properly, even if I input that correct information. So I've had several occasions where it's been denied. Other times, they've rearranged the title that I give it because apparently it has to be a specific title as well." - P12

#### Lack of claim status feedback/information after filing
- 3 participants mentioned having a difficult time finding out about their claim status after filing or not knowing why something was denied or not paid in full

> "So I selected that and submitted my claim. So doing that was really really easy. The problem is, you know, it's been about 3 months now, maybe 4, and I've heard nothing, seen nothing. I mean, it's like it went into a black hole." - P9

#### Difficulty filing or re-filing within the 30-day window
- 1 participant mentioned the 30-day window being problematic because there isn't time to re file a claim or is only alerted to the deadline when it has already passed

> "Usually what happens is that it lets me know that it's been over the amount of days to have filed the claim. That's kind of important, because usually that happens when the appointment isn't in BTSSS, and when I try to create the appointment, the time has passed." - P2

#### Bing maps not working
- 1 participant has struggled with Bing maps not connecting when trying to file her claims

> "So that's the only downside with using the BTSSS portal is Bing maps has been acting that way for a while.It's a hit and miss with trying to get that claim to link with the Bing maps, if you do it electrically." - P11



### Magic Wand Scenarios

For their ideal travel reimbursement claim scenario, participants had a range of responses:

#### BTSSS portal updates or changes
- 4 participants mentioned updates or changes to the BTSSS portal, such as appointments and information all showing up in the system

#### Previous Travel Reimbursement methods
- 2 participants mentioned preferring previous processes such as filing with the kiosks or in-person with a paper form at the counter
Common feedback (brief background on kiosks leaving)

> "As far as I'm concerned. I don't know why they they changed that because, you know, it was right in the office when you did it. And then when I went home, I didn't have to scroll around on the computer or anything. I thought that was very efficient. And I never had any problems with that." - P18

#### Need for confirmation feedback via email or text
- 1 participant focused the need for confirmation feedback via email or text

> "You submit something and you automatically get some kind of of confirmation through email or text of the action being completed." - P9

#### A more automated process
- 2 participants mentioned more automated processes involving text in which they could confirm their details, submit, and receive a text or email confirmation
- 1 of these 2 participants described their positive experience with eCheck-in and their desire to use that process everywhere for travel.

> "Maybe just checking in for the address you checked in from, or something like that. Or if not like, done automatically, the VA could send you a text message that you just click on and just confirm the appointment details, confirm the address, and then once you click submit this or confirm information, then it's automatically processed." - P4

> "I keep lauding the positives of text check-in, and that would be my first choice. I mean, it's just flawless. I've never had an issue with it." - P12

### Filing a claim for multiple appointments on the same day 
In addition to noting this within the prototype, we started asking Veterans if they’d ever filed multiple claims for two or more appointments on the same day at the same facility. 

Overall, Veterans seem to understand that they could not file this way, or that they would only be reimbursed for one appointment if they did try and file for both.

### Travel reimbursement claims vs. other VA claims
To learn more around Veterans’ mental model of the claims ecosystem and how travel fits into it, we asked Veterans "How do you think of your travel claims in relation to your other claims?"
- 7/8 participants were confused by the question, though we iterated on the wording during the study
- Even with iterations and in-session explanations, we were only able to get one response that addressed the question and, therefore, stopped asking this question after the 8th participant 

Based on the answers we did get, we can reasonably assume that, in the context of a cohesive claims ecosystem, Veterans either do not think of their travel claims in relation to their other VA claims or do not have an established mental model for how they think about their travel claims in relation to their other VA claims.

## Key Findings: Understanding of Claim Statuses

We presented participants with 11 claim status terms Veterans could feasibly encounter while filing, asking how they interpreted each status and which were most or least important to know during the process of filing or reviewing their claim. 

### Key Takeaways
- 8 / 10 participants completed the claim status exercise
- All 8 participants found Fiscal Rescinded confusing
> Quote
- At least 3 participants thought terms should have more context or description - specifically for “Payment Canceled” “On Hold” and “In Manual Review” and “Incomplete”
> Quote
- Participants thought some of the terms had the same meaning or could be combined with others, such as “Claim submitted and submitted for payment”
- 1 participant thought “Claim Received” was important to add to the statuses
