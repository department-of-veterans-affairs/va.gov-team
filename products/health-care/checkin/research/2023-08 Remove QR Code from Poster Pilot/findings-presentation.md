## Goals

Asheville and Richmond* participated in the pilot**, which tested a new version of the check-in poster that removed the QR code option. We expected a very small increase in check-in utilization and a decrease in complaints from Veterans to staff about issues with the QR code/poster.

**1) Was there a noticeable increase in Veterans using the new check-in poster from staff observations? And, what were those encounters like for Veterans?**

**2) Was there a realized increase in Veterans using the new check-in poster (i.e., through the Patient Check-in Dashboard)?**

**3) Was there an increase in complaints from Veterans to staff, specifically, about the new check-in poster?**  

**Piloting the new poster at Asheville and Richmond was a way to capture feedback from a smaller group before rolling out nationally. The PCI team created the new poster based of feedback from the field that reported a small amount of Veterans having issues using the QR code. For example, scanning it would result in taking Veterans to an unknown web page. ([New poster release plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/release-plan/detailed-release-notes/remove-poster-qr-code.md).)*

 ***This report includes data from all stations at Asheville and Richmond. However, at the time this report was created, we’re unsure how many stations and clinics actually used the new poster.*

## Conclusions and Next Steps

Overall, the new poster pilot was successful because: (1) there were no concerning Veteran interactions with the new poster reported from staff, and (2) while there was a negligible decrease in eCheck-in utilization, we can’t declare that the new poster was solely responsible since it was a minor change that likely went unnoticed to Veterans, and (3) there were no complaints reported about issues with the QR code/poster from Asheville or Richmond, VSignals or OIT ServiceNow (SNOW) tickets.

**IVC/OCTO Product Owners**

- Decide on date to announce new poster version is available to all VISNs and what date to have them available in clinics. ([Posters are currently available for download](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/design/visual-collateral#latest-release-pdf).) 

**IVC/VISN 6 Team**

- Determine how to proceed with the [Patient Check-in Poster Pilot spreadsheet](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/lori_pusey_va_gov/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5d062c85-a394-4f27-84f8-00b166fb8e57%7D&action=edit). E.g., is it still useful for tracking new poster feedback or other reporting needs?  
- Consider addressing feedback reported from facilities. E.g., increase Veteran and staff understanding of how eCheck-in works, how to update a Veteran’s smartphone number in VistA, and having providers avoid starting appointment encounters without a check in status, etc.
