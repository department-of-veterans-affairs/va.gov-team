## How to Collect and Process Feedback

1. Submit a data collection request ticket to the Contact Center (see [How to Submit a Request Ticket](#how-to-submit-a-request-ticket)).
2. The Contact Center will email the Veteran feedback to the address you provided in the request ticket.
3. Once you get the email, download the feedback spreadsheet to your machine on the VA network. 
4. Rename the spreadsheet in the following format (this lets us sort all the feedback files by date):
   `CIE Medallia [YYYY] Q[#] Sprint[##]` 
   For example: CIE Medallia 2024 Q1 Sprint 5
5. Scrub the feedback of PII/PHI. Read through every user comment and replace personal information with asterisks or number symbols. Replace data with codes as follows
   - Email addresses - PII_EMAIL
   - Names - PII_NAME
   - Social security numbers - PII_SSN
   - Phone numbers - PII_PHONE
   - Other identifying info - PII_OTHER
7. Move the scrubbed file to this [folder](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/benjamin_brasso_va_gov/Documents/Weekly%20Reports/Medallia%20Non-PHI%20Files?csf=1&web=1&e=wdghmh)
8. Analyze the data (see [How to Analyze the Data](#how-to-analyze-the-data))
9. Share the analysis, including your notes of any potential issues that raise concern with:
   - Kay Lawyer, Kristen McConnell, Stephen Barrs via VA email
   - Kay Lawyer, Kristen McConnell, Stephen Barrs and the CIE team via a thread in the [check-in-experience Slack channel](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C022AC2STBM).


## How to Submit a Request Ticket

Using the template below, submit a ticket in GitHub to the Contact Center to collect the Medallia feedback. The feedback should be emailed to a VA.gov email address since it may contain PHI/PII information. All feedback request tickets should be attached to the [CIE Analytics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/42190) Epic.

## How to Analyze the Data

- Copy all of the data cells (not including the header cell) from the spreadsheet that you scrubbed free of PHI to the [CIE Medallia Analysis Spreadsheet](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/benjamin_brasso_va_gov/Documents/Weekly%20Reports/CIE%20Medallia%20Analysis.xlsx?d=w9cce7abb8adb4f3fb4e7839e0ce487b0&csf=1&web=1&e=s42PgP)
   - Make sure you copy to the Data tab
   - Make sure you insert the data at the end of the existing data
   - Make note of the row numbers for the data you just added
- Review each feedback comment (in the 'What task were you trying to do today?' column)
   - You may want to hide all columns between the feedback comment column and the feedback category column (i.e. hide between K and BD)
   - If the feedback comment matches one of the feedback categories, put a one for that row in the feedback category column
- Go to the Analysis-PCI tab
   - Copy the last row to the next free row
   - Change the sprint to the one for which you are adding data
   - Change the start and end dates to coincide with the sprint for which you are adding data
   - Change the row range for each cell in your new row to match the row range for the data you added
      - Example - if you added data to rows 53 through 101, you would change the AU row range to 53 and 101 and the I row range to 53 and 101

- Go to the Analysis-CI tab
   - Repeat the process in this tab as you did for the Analysis-PCI tab
- Go to the Analysis-T tab (once we release travel)
   - Repeat the process in this tab as you did for the Analysis-PCI tab
- Go to the Graphs tab
   - For each graph, extend the row range for the datasource to end with the last row of the newly-added data
      - Note that some datasources are split and you will need to change each row ending range
         - Example of not split: 'Analysis-PCI'!$C$3:$E$5
         - Example of split: 'Analysis-PCI'!$C$3:$C$5,'Analysis-PCI'!$L$3:$O$5
