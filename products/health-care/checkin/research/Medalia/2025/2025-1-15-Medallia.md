## Notable Comments



**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> Didn't check me in. Good thing I checked in at counter

> Electronic check-in with PCM team at VA Ann Arbor.  I was able to complete it online but the VA doesn’t accept that as a checkin and still requires you to checkin again at the desk.    If I didn’t go up to the desk myself I would have been flagged as missing my appointment.  No notes on the website or link stating I needed to checkin at the desk after successfully checking in electronically.





**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

> I was told that my appointment was canceled.









**Trouble updating contact info**

> You asked me if my physical address was correct and I said no.  You gave me no way to correct it.

> Not allowed to update to next of kin. Still trying to submit this check-in process.

> Check in, could not correct contact information! Please add the ability to correct information online.

> Trying to update my next of kin address and all staff members gave me the deer in the headlight look. I was sent to two different offices and no one knew what to to do or wanted to do. SHAMEFUL!

> This website is inadequate. The  contact block is incorrect but the option to provide the proper data is not available.







**Too many notifications**

> I get frustrated with how many times that you gotta tell me I have an appointment on a certain date. I’ve already answered that maybe 20 times. Thanks, Joe.

> Why do I get so many confirmation request for the same appointment?  This one makes #5 for the same one.

> The system has us waiting us to checkin when we are always an hour away yet.!!!! To any of the appointments.

> Why have I received  this 3 times in the past week? I also get have you arrived notices a half hour before each appointment  while I'm driving to the appointment. This is very annoying and dangerous for me to Reed these messages loan enough answer them. Colorado just passed a new law starting 1/1/25 if a police officer sees someone using their phone they can be ticketed.
