## Notable Comments

**Like PCI**

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> Appointment was canceled but I was not notified until check in<br>

> I was scheduled for an appointment weeks ago and received information over a week ago the my 11:00 appointment was canceled for physical therapy on 17 September 2024. 5 minutes before 11:00 today the 17 September 2024 I received information that I was rescheduled for an appointment today at 11:00 at physical therapy on Travis AFB. Why am I being notified 5 minutes before an appointment that was previously canceled and then all of a son, I am now late for an appointment that was cancelled. There is no way your notification system or personal working the appointment system can be that messed up.<br>


**Trouble updating contact info**


> Could not update emergency contact!<br>


> Shouldn’t need to do pre-checkin days before appointment. Should be able to correct information during the pre-Checkin process.<br>


> My contact information is incorrect . I checked no but was not given option to correct.<br>


> Update Emergency Contact info during Check In process.  Your app presents a screen that asked if the information is correct and I responded 'no'.  Rather than taking me to a screen to put in current and correct information, it just proceeds to the next question… How blatantly stupid to bypass the opportunity to correct that information on the spot. Sorry to your programmers, but as a programmer myself, why wouldn't you take the opportunity to allow for on the spot corrections?  That's ludicrous, especially since I've already been validated into the system, so don't go throwing "security concerns" as a reason. I'm already authenticated at this point in the process.<br>


> Change my spouse information. I cannot do it on line and the staff said they cannot change that information.<br>


> How come I can’t use this app to review and update my contact information? When I filled out my contact information, this app automatic responded “sorry, we cannot update your information at this time because the link has expired. Close “  What’s the thinking and reasoning behind this prohibition? Please respond to PII_NAME PII_EMAIL<br>


> I was trying to update my personal information on this form, which would be so easy. But I am always told to have it updated at the appointment. At the appointment I am told to update it online. Can’t win.<br>
