> Checking in on device very easy and helpful.<br>


> Easy to use system<br>

> Check in for appointment and submit travel pay. When the program works it's great otherwise it is an extreme hassle to maneuver through.<br>


> If this is truly an alternative to the access.va.gov website.  Itâ€™s a wonderful thing.  Thanks!<br>




**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**


> CHECK IN FOR THE SECOND TIME! NO DOUBT, I WILL HAVE TO CHECK IN AGAIN ON LINE  AND THEN AGAIN WHEN I ARRIVE.  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!<br>


> On line travel claim submission is great, but why does this have me checking online but then I still have to wait in line and check in with receptionist?<br>




**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> I arrived in a manual wheelchair and had difficulty getting to the correct department. I called them, someone came to get me. The doctor was amazing, great attitudes by all staff. My best experience ever!<br>


> EKGâ€¦.i checked in as requested by text but tech should be provided with sign on office to knock to inform additionally not all individuals receive text so signage should be established to inform clients<br>



**Trouble updating contact info**


> Update spouse name.  First wife died Feb 2020 and I have changed spouse name in VA system, but it is still showing my first wife in this application.<br>


> Made this choice because although the question were important and easy to respond howecer, it would be nice to allow corrections and changes to be made right on the spot rather than waiting<br>


> I should be able to complete minor edits in this process. Relationship for Emergency Contact  Work Phone I should be able to remove. I retired many years ago.<br>


> Can't figure out how edit info.<br>


> Edit & make corrections.  Even though it asks if this is correct or not I was unable to make changes<br>




**Issues verifying identity**


> When I went to check in it asked for my last name and social security number I did that and it told me the social and birthdate didnâ€™t match<br>
