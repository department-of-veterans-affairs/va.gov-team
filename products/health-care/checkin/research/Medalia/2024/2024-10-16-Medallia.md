> Check in & bonus was able to do travel!

> This app is very convenient! Thank you for making things as easy as possible!

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> CT scan 2nd floor Radiology. There was no one at the desk upon arrival. Several fruit flies were in the waiting area. I scanned a check-in QR code that showed I was checked in. A tech arrived and verified that I was not checked in. Afterwards I completed my appointment.

> Check In… However, some bureaucratic Mensa Candidate dreamt up the idea for VA Patients to “check in” electronically…however, the patient rep at the waiting area for imaging has NO CLUE when a patient does so; thus, patients end up NOT being checked in unless they approach the waiting area window…WHOSE “HAIR-BRAINED IDEA” was this?

> Check-in. However I am not sure how well it works. I checked at the desk and the clerk had not notified the nurse. So time was wasted.

> Check in and submit travel.  Travel wouldn’t work without an alternative means or suggestion/ directions to submit.  Also checking in using the app I have learned does not check you in to your actual appointment. You still have to go to the front desk to check in. What’s the purpose of this app to check you in if it doesn’t actually check you in.? Also, I have learned that the staff is, not happy with the app because many veterans bypass the check-in desk sit down and wait and the staff is not aware that they’re sitting down. This situation with the app needs to be addressed to correct this problem.


**Trouble updating contact info**

> I was just doing check-in for my appointment. I think you should be able to update. Information on emergency contact and next of kin when doing this. It’s too hard to find a staff member that can do it unless I go to the main hospital and have to fill out a form.

> Why can't I just edit and update my contact information without jumping through all this mess, and be done with it!

**Issues verifying identity**

> Fill out my check-inn for my appointment.  The application eill not accept my surname.  When trying to go back to re enter my last name as on my ID card, the system refused to give me access.


**Too many notifications**

> Multiple texts that I confirm yes to appt, then send another saying don't come more than 15 mins early, then allows me to check in, then 45 minutes prior to appt it asks if I have arrived at the VA?  After it told me to not come more than 15 mins early.  I say yes and it says it is time to check in for my appt and goes over previous check in info already given day before.  Confusing overload and gets me thinking the system isn't registering the Info?  So do I come early or not as it says it was 5ime to check in for appt, but I wasn't to the 15 minutes prior threshold yet 🤔

> I love this tech, except that I'm asked to confirm my information with every single reminder. That's excessive. Please adjust.
