## Notable Comments

**Like PCI**

> Completing online check in for my appointment was easy to accomplish.


**Concerns with check in at kiosks**

> Why have kiosk  when there is a check-in on phone and the link expired? Keep the kiosk for check-in.

**Trouble updating contact info**

> No matter how many times I ensure my information is correct, somehow it gets messed up. My profile has the correct information, but this shows a different mailing address. It is a PO Box, not a residential address. The information above says I have to make thus known at the time of my appointment. Figured as much.

> This appointment check-in feature could be improved.  Some of my personal contact info (spouse, next of kin) was missing and I could not provide this info using the app.

> My emergency contact is incorrect and no staff can update for me. Why ask me if it’s correct or not and then send me to a staff if they can’t update it. Site is counter intuitive. This is my third attempt with this update and no success with staff and sure.

> There should be an “edit” option for updating personal information for check in.  Example: the work number is incorrect- but no way to change it until I show up for my appointment

> Why not allow the veteran to ypdate their own information??? Unnecessary waist of time to make them ask the front desk who don’t care that your their to begin with and only want to rush you through as quick as they can

> Check in.  Although I’ve UPDATED my emergency contact information many times, it is still incorrect and therefore my answer “no” to that question prevents further online check in.  Which never seems to work anyway 🤷‍♂️

> I would like to make any changes on this form.  It would save me a phone call to the Business Office or a visit. I have a new email address and the relationship with my next of kin. Thank you! Have a great day. 😊

> you gave WRONG contact relative and I responed NO but you gave no space to correct it with relative more applicable. Bothers me that you still show a NON-APPLICABLE person. PLEEEZE CORRECT - LETTING ME KNOW IT IS CORRECTED.

> Fix my own emergency contact information right here instead of having to go find someone to do it for me.


**Too many notifications**

> A plethora of governmental texts, emails and mail is all a waste of time and money. Use 1 method of contact and stop re-inventing the wheel and micro tasking. What’s wrong with you people? How many times do you need to notify me? Stop it!

> Confirming my appointment. Which I already confirmed. There is no need to send me a text every single day asking me to confirm my appointment. Once is enough.

> I’m getting multiple reminders for appointments sometimes the next day, sometimes the same day.  I would prefer not having to do the pre check in repeatedly and would just like to get the text reminders.
