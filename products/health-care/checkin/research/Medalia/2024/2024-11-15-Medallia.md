**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> Why do we even have this check in system? It doesnâ€™t check your in for your appointment at all. No matter what appointment you have you still have to go to counter and check in. Another broken system.













**Trouble updating contact info**

> Correct e-mail address. If you are asking us to check our contact information, then there should be a way to do it without having to go to a different page or wait until an in-person visit.  This is especially true when you ask if the information is correct; there is a no button to choose; and when clicked it just takes you to the next page.
