# Research Plan for Check-in, Unmoderated Appointment Information Prioritization (Check-in), September 2022

## Background
The Modernized Check-In Team is reimaging the experience between a Veteran scheduling a medical appointment and having their appointment. In particular, the Modernized Check-In Team has created the portion of the ecosystem that enables Veterans to utilize their smartphone to “check in” to their appointments through VA.gov, which lets the VA know the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 

  - Confirming their appointment
  - Reviewing their contact information 
  - Reviewing their emergency contact information
  - Reviewing their next of kin information 

- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment

Within [another study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/travel-reimbursement-mvp-remote-test), we are actively exploring adding travel reimbursement within check-in product.


### OCTO Objectives 

This research plan supports the following OCTO objectives: 

- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Increase completion rate of online transactions
- Increase usage of digital self-service tools
- Decrease time to successfully complete and submit online transactions 

### Veteran Journey
 This research plan maps to the following moment within the Veteran journey:

## Research Goals	
Check-in has expanded our access to more appointment data, which we can display to Veterans within the check-in experiences. The list of all appointment data that we can display includes:
- Recently added
  - provider's name 
  - type of care 
  - location (floor and room numbers)
  - modality (in-person, telephone, etc)
- Added awhile ago
  - clinic name
  - facility name
  - date
  - time (timezone - recently added) 
  - clinic phone number
  - facility phone number and TTY
- Could add
  - weekday
  - address
  - instructions on how to attend video or telephone appointments
  - reason for visit
  - facility directions (map link)
  - cancel status
  - patient name

The goal for this study is to identify what appointment data is most important within certain portions of the day of check-in experience. 

The mobile app and VAOS teams have looked into similar topics. Once our check-in appointment information survey is complete, we will compare all of the studies to determine where we can align with the other products and where we need to differ due to unique check-in needs. 

### Outcome
Ultimately, we would like to determine what appointment data is important to Veterans and how they rank its important relative to each data point within day of check-in. Then, we can plan further work to iterate on the current experiences.

### Research questions
- What appointment information is important to review when letting VA know you have arrived for your appointment? 

### Hypothesis
1. Veterans and caregivers will generally agree on which data is most important when letting VA know you have arrived for your appointment.

## Method	
We will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will receive a link to an online survey that contains 2 scenarios in which the participant will prioritize appointment data. The online survey will be built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions.

We would like to get complete survey responses from at least 30 Veterans and others (ideally 40-50), in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA).

### Location
Remote unmoderated via Optimal Workshop

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We would like Perigean to recruit 63 people using the cohorts below in order to get at least 35 completes. This study will be broken up into 7 mini studies, segmented by the 7 cohorts below.


### Recruitment criteria

|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans | Family Member| Caregivers | Service Members|
