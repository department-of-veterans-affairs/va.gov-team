# Pre-Check-In Research Plan for Telephone Appointments  

## Background and Goals 

### Background 

To help streamline the day of check-in experience, the Healthcare Experience Team released the first iteration of pre-check-in in January 2022. 

Pre-check-in allows Veterans with in-person appointments to complete the following: 

- Confirm their appointment
- Review their contact information
- Review emergency contact information 
- Review their next of kin 

In the future, pre-check-in for in-person appointments will include features that enable Veterans to: 
 
- Answer health questionnaires 
- Edit and update their contact, emergency, and next of kin information 

Most often, Veterans can complete  pre-check-in at least 7 days prior to their scheduled appointment. However, the timing can vary depending on each facility’s set-up. 

However, the pre-check-in product isn’t currently available to Veterans with telehealth appointments. Specifically, the scope of this research will focus on the telephone appointments modality of the various telehealth options, which was a decision made from conversations between VVC stakeholders and the Healthcare Experience Team. 

Currently, we know the following about telephone appointments from previous research that includes [conversations with VVC stakeholders](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/discovery/telephone-appointments) and an [interview with a PCP provider](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/discovery/telephone-appointments/staff-interviews/stakeholder-findings.md): 

- Telephone appointments are typically scheduled as a follow up appointment 
- The provider calls the Veteran at the scheduled appointment time. Sometimes a nurse may call beforehand to confirm the Veteran is available and to answer health questions. 
- If a nurse is not able to call a Veteran beforehand to conduct the health questionnaire, time spent with the patient during their appointment to conduct this takes time away from the patient with the provider 
- It would be beneficial to the provider to know that the Veteran is ready to start their scheduled telephone appointment  
- It could be beneficial to the Veteran to know if the provider is running late 
- There is value in having the Veteran confirm their telephone number prior to their scheduled appointment 
- Some patients need to be reminded that their appointment is a telephone appointment and to not show up for an in-person visit 
- Appointment reminders are often sent out to Veterans via VeText. However, it’s dependent on the facility and the frequency of reminders varies by facility. The default reminders are scheduled for 7, 2 and 1 days prior to the appointment. 

This research will build off of the [health questionnaire discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/discovery/user-research/research-findings.md), which offers the following findings: 

- Filling out forms is not a pain point if Veterans believe the information will benefit the care they receive
- Veterans believe that filling out digital forms before their appointment would decrease wait times and optimize time with care providers
- A [prioritization study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/research/veteran-prioritization/research-findings.md) was also completed and Veterans did specify that they would like to complete the above items prior to their appointment.

The [Pre-Check-In product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/product/product-brief.md) has complete details about the pre-check-in product.

### Goals

The goal of this research is to identify an optimal experience for Veterans with telephone appointments to complete pre-check-in that leads to the following outcomes: 

Veteran-facing

- Increase the number of Veterans with telephone appointments completing pre-check-in, which includes confirming their appointment, contact information, emergency contact information and next of kin 
- Reduce Veteran confusion about whether an appointment is to be completed over the phone or in-person.
- Increase in accuracy and/or quantity of pre-check-in information 

Staff-facing 

- Provide a streamlined way for staff to collect pre-check-in information for telephone appointments
- Allow staff to focus on other critical tasks 

## OCTO Objectives 

- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
- Measures to increase:
    - Usage of digital, self-service tools
    - Completion rate of online transactions
- Measures to decrease:
    - Time to successfully complete and submit online transactions

## Veteran Journey 

The pre-check-in experience is an important part of moments that matter at different stages in a Veteran’s life:  

- Managing primary care and chronic health issues during their “Living Civilian Life” stage
- Taking care of my health during their “Retiring” stage
- Managing my declining health during their “Aging” stage

## Research Plan 

### Research Goals	

- Understand current experience that Veterans have with telephone appointments
- Understand expectations of pre-check-in for Veterans with telephone appointments
- Identify the optimal way for Veterans with telephone appointments to experience pre-check-in 
- How to denote that the appointment will take place on the telephone
- How to set expectations with a Veteran that a provider may not join the appointment exactly at the stated appointment time

### Research Outcomes 

We will apply findings and insights from this research to identify the optimal way for Veterans with telephone appointments to access and complete the pre-check-in experience in a seamless way that’s deemed valuable to Veterans. 

Recommendations and improvements will be included in subsequent releases of the pre-check-in experience to support telephone appointments. 

### Research Questions 

- Understand current experience that Veterans have with telephone appointments
  - What pain points exist, if any? 
- Understand expectations of pre-check-in for Veterans with telephone appointments
  - What type of tasks would these patients expect to complete (if any) prior to their appointments? 
- Identify the optimal way for Veterans with telephone appointments to experience pre-check-in 
  - Do Veterans have a preference (if any) on when and how to fill out pre-check-in questions prior to their telephone appointment? 
  - Does the Veteran understand the appointment will take place over the phone and not in-person?
  - What expectations does a Veteran have about  when a provider will join a telephone appointment?

Conversation guide (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/telephone/conversation-guide.md)

### Hypothesis

- Hypothesis 1. Veterans will find it valuable to confirm their phone number before their appointment in the pre-check-in experience. 
- Hypothesis 2: Veterans will find it easy to have the pre-check-in experience integrated into the existing appointment notifications process. 
- Hypothesis 3: Veterans will understand their appointment is supposed to take place over the telephone and not in-person.
- Hypothesis 4. Veterans will find the day of check-in easier for telephone appointments with a pre-check-in experience that educates them on what to expect on the day of their appointment (e.g. their provider will call, and the Veteran may need to wait after the scheduled time). 

### Method	

We will be conducting remote, moderated user testing sessions over Zoom with the following methods: 

Contextual inquiry / Semi-structured interviews: This will help us explore open-ended concepts like pre-check-in and current experience of telephone appointments, so we’ll have the context we need to address our research questions 1 and 2. 

Usability testing of a prototype: Observing Veterans reaction to a proposed  solution with follow-up questions will help to answer our research questions 3. 


### Location
Research sessions will be conducted in 1 hour sessions over Zoom using a UXPin prototype.
