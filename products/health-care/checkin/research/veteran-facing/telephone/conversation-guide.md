## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to talk about all the questions you are asked and information you review before a VA medical appointment where you speak to the physician over the telephone. We’ll also discuss actions you can take prior to an appointment, such as canceling and rescheduling. We are exploring the possibility of enabling you to review and update this information as well as cancel/reschedule online in your own time from the comfort of your own home.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take no longer than an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes
Now, I’m going to ask you to think about your last VA medical appointment where you spoke to the physician over the phone.
- What was the type of appointment, such as primary care, cardiology, dermatology, etc.?
- How did you schedule this appointment? 
  - Was it a follow-up from an earlier appointment?

    - If it was on your mobile phone, do you recall if it was a general phone number or a private number?
  - What types of questions do the medical professionals (such as a doctor) ask at the start of your telephone appointments? For instance, do they review your list of medications?

## First Task: Happy path for pre-check-in for a telephone appointment - 30 minutes

Alright, I want you to pretend that you have an upcoming appointment with your VA primary care provider via the phone and you receive the following text a few days beforehand. You also recently moved, so you need to update your home address. 

### SMS and first pass through the first pre-check-in workflow
At this point, I would like you to share your screen, so we can see the text too. Try to complete the task that the SMS is asking you about. I will just observe you as you try to complete it. I'll ask you questions later. Talk-aloud as you complete the task. Share your thoughts.

- Were the next steps after completing pre-check-in understandable?
– Did they try to select any of the accordions on the confirmation page?
