# Research Goals
The pre-check-in experience is an important part of moments that matter at different stages in a Veteran’s life:
Managing primary care and chronic health issues during their “Living Civilian Life” stage
Taking care of my health during their “Retiring” stage
Managing my declining health during their “Aging” stage


The goal is to understand how the pre-check-in experience can lead to the following outcomes:
- Veteran-facing / Caregiver-facing
- Increase usage of mobile check-in on day of appointment
- Ensuring day of check-in is seamless
- Increase in accuracy and/or quantity of pre check-in data, specifically pre registration information

Staff facing
- Administrative and clinical staff are more prepared for appointments
- Minimize the number of no shows, or confusion on the day of the appointment
- MSAs can spend more time on other critical tasks
- Increased accuracy in veteran profile information

Research Goals
- Identify the type of information and how to deliver that information in the pre-check-in user flow to better meet Veterans and Caregivers expectations
- Identify how to improve the content and user flow to make it easier for Veterans and Caregivers to complete pre-check-in

# Research Questions

Identify the type of pre-check-in information and how to deliver that information in the user flow to better meet Veteran and Caregiver expectations
- When and how does pre-check-in start?
- Does an SMS message align with how Veterans expect pre-check-in to be initiated? If not, what other touchpoints are preferred?
- How many days prior to the day of appointment should pre-check-in be initiated?
- What are Veterans expectations on the frequency of receiving reminders? E.g. 2 weeks, 1 week, 3 days
- Should pre-check-in be contingent on a Veteran confirming their appointment?
- Do Veterans have a preferred device (mobile or desktop) to complete these pre-check-in tasks?
- How do Veterans respond to the need to complete a health questionnaire during pre-check-in?
- Does the need to authenticate in the middle of the pre check-in user flow interfere with a Veteran’s ability to complete the task?
- What are Veterans expectations on when and how to cancel an appointment?
- How do the needs of the Caregiver overlap or diverge from that of a Veteran completing pre check-in?
- Identify how to improve the content and interaction experience to make it easier for Veterans and Caregivers to complete pre-check-in
- How do Veterans distinguish between the following terms: Mailing Address, Home Address, Permanent Address, Temporary Address, Next of Kin, and Emergency Contact
- Are Veterans expecting to be able to update their next of kin information or prefer emergency contact information instead?
- Do Veterans understand that updating their contact and next of kin information here will update it across VA?
- Are Veterans able to utilize the modal to update their address information?
- Does providing a read only version of the contact information page meet Veterans expectations?
- Do Veterans have a preference (if at all) for a form list or task list of the pre-check-in activities?
- What do Veterans expect to see on the confirmation page?
- Do Veterans know what to do after completing pre-check-in?
- Does a Caregiver have unique needs that are not being met by the content and design?


# Methodology 

- Observational and task-based usability studies using prototypes in UXPin. 
- Conducted in 1 hour sessions over Zoom

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

Veterans will continue to find value in completing pre-check-in tasks based upon previous research.
 - “Likely True” IF  they will not like to complete for every appointment, ensure information is updated across VA, and the staff/providers will refer to this information

Veterans prefer to receive pre-check-in tasks via SMS texts.
- “Likely True”, as some Veterans expressed desire for email notification in addition to SMS; physical cards are also preferred by a minority 

Veterans will have a slight preference to complete these tasks on a desktop according to past research.
- “Likely True”, completing pre checkin seemed to be the preference for those Veterans who may have a disability or prefer larger screens

Completing all pre-appointment tasks together, including health questionnaires, will be preferred by Veterans.
- “Likely True”, if veterans feel confident that the staff and providers will use the information on the day of appointment

Veterans will understand the difference between the address types.
- “Likely True,” Home address was preferred over Permanent address; Varied responses on the definition of temporary address, some speculated to be valuable to snowbirds or those in precarious living situations

Veterans will verbalize their preference or concerns regarding updating next of kin and emergency contacts within this workflow.
- “Likely True,” veterans expressed that a lot of it was “as expected” due to previous experience at the VA; a couple experienced negative reaction to reviewing Next of Kin

Veterans will notice the informational banner at the top of the contact and next of kin pages, so they will understand changes made here will update their information across VA.
- “Likey True,” While all understood that meant to update across VA, many expressed mistrust as to whether that will actually happen, due to previous poor experience

The edit modal will impose no problems on the Veteran's ability to update their information; therefore, this pattern can be submitted to the design system for consideration.
- “Definitely True”, as validated with task based observation, all Veterans selected Edit and was able to return to the previous page

The need to authenticate in order to edit will introduce some friction, but not enough to deter Veterans from completing the task.
- “Likely True”, all Veterans were surprised to see the authentication prompt after selected edit; few speculated this would be a blocker to complete the task; others speculated it wouldn’t be a blocker

The confirmation page provides enough information that the Veteran knows what to do after completing pre-check-in.
- “Likely True”, many Veterans seemed to find the confirmation page generally clear, with desire to be able to add the appointment to their digital calendars

# Key Findings

1. Majority of Veterans seem to value the ability to complete pre-checkin, if they don’t have to complete it for every appointment

2. Majority of Veterans linked the value of completing pre-checkin questions with the staff and providers ability to use the information

3. All Veterans were able to complete the tasks without experiencing usability issues; however some were unclear on what exactly they were being asked to complete. 

4. Majority of Veterans didn’t mind reviewing Next of Kin and expected to review Emergency Contact; few Veterans were negatively triggered by being asked to review Next of Kin

5. Some Veterans value completing pre- checkin tasks on desktops, particularly for those who who prefer larger screens. 

6. Majority of Veterans seem to mistrust whether information gets updated across VA. 

7. The need to fully authenticate was either a blocker or a motivator to completing pre check-in


# Details of Findings 


_To add images: ![text](link - add image to github folder and link here with .png)_


**Finding 1**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-check-in

Quotes

> “This looks great – if it can make my visit easier or more simple then I like it.”


> “If you have a lot of appointments this could get annoying.”


**Finding 2**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-check-in

Quotes

> “I’d be upset if I got to the appointment and would have to do this all again.”

> “Anything to streamline the veteran experience....make it easier for the veteran the better.”


**Finding 3**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-check-in, DSP Form Templates

There weren’t any major usability issues that interfered with the Veteran’s ability to complete the task. Specifically, we tested two different design layouts: task and form. Neither presented any friction. 

Quotes

> “I’m pleased...it’s easy to understand.” 


> “I would not expect an entire thing to fill out after a confirmation of an appointment I would have been done and moved on.”

**Finding 4**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-check-in

Other parts of the flow seemed to be familiar for Veterans because it is consistent with previous experience with the VA. For example, after viewing the NOK or contact info page, one veteran said“ This is pretty standard”. Another veteran reviewed the SSN log in page and said “That’s normally what you do when you check-in”. 
Quotes

> “Are they expecting me to die during this [appointment]?” 


> “Next of kin?  Why not emergency contact?”

**Finding 5**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-check-in, HWD: Desktop


Quotes

>“I’d prefer to do it on an iPad or on a desktop. It would work on my phone, too – but it is a little more difficult with my disability.”


>“I prefer a desktop because of the size and I am a keyboarder. I am decent at texting but I prefer the keyboard because I grew up on typewriters.”

**Finding 6**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-check-in

Many veterans valued the statement “ your information will update across VA” that appeared on the contact info page. Some mentioned that this would be great if it really was a “one stop shop” to update all info. But there was an undertone of mistrust. We heard a lot about Veterans referencing poor past experience.  For example, one veteran described his medications being delivered to the wrong address.


Quotes

>“...If it isn’t [updated across VA] then you won’t get people to trust this...It is challenging to go in and not have the doctor prepared.”


>“ We just bought a house and moved... I updated  [my info] but my mail is still going somewhere else…”

**Finding 7**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-check-in, PRDT: login

The response to fully log in was polarizing among veterans. Some mentioned they thought they were already logged in because they signed in using their SSN at the beginning of the flow.  

Quotes

>“I would hope that I could not even see that info unless I was logged in. I would want to know why I have to log in to edit if entering last name and last 4 allowed me to view. You should have to log in from the start.”


>“I see this as double assurance.”

# Additional Insights

- Notification method depends on veteran device and usage habits (for instance, SMS and email were preferred by veterans)

- Preference for design patterns used in the industry ( for example, the ability to indicate the home and mailing address are identical)

- Home address is clearer than permanent address; More label testing with target user groups will be helpful


# Recommendations

* Recommendation 1
    * Clarify content to better set up expectations related to next of kin, authentication, and that they are completing ‘pre checkin’.  
* Recommendation 2
    * Add emergency contact (review and eventually edit) into the pre-checkin experience
* Recommendation 3
    * Develop guidelines for how often we would like veterans to complete pre-checkin updates
* Recommendation 4
    * Evaluate staff-facing pre-checkin workflow, which may affect pre-checkin engagement in the long term
* Recommendation 5
    * Clearly explain where information gets updated across VA to better set up expectations for veteran, which may also help build trust
* Recommendation 6
    * Re-evaluate pre checkin being dependent upon confirmation and where it fits within the holistic appointment flow
* Recommendation 7
    * Better understand the authenticated experience and use cases to identify how best to set up expectations to fully authenticate when editing info. 


# Next Steps

Evaluate recommendations for long term (or post MVP) release with product teams. 


# Further research needed

Findings may not include the perspectives of the following underserved Veteran groups
Don’t have a degree 
Identify as Latinx, Biracial, Asian, +  Native
Use of assistive technology (AT)
We recommend studies with these underserved groups in the future.
