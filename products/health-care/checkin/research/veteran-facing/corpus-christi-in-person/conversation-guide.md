# Check-In Conversation Guide for In-Person Veteran Interviews at Corpus Christi

July 6, 2022


## Clinic Arrival Logistics

Upon arrival at the clinic, speak with staff on how to intercept Veterans. Specifically, seek responses to the following: 

Does the staff want to do the initial intercept? Or can we? 
Are there certain Veterans to intercept or avoid? E.g., patient flags. 

In addition, talk to staff about hanging up the most recent version of posters, if not already in place. 

## Intro - 1 minute 

Are you checking in for an appointment?

Would you like to check-in using your smartphone today? 

Great. My name is [Kristen or Nira] and I’m a researcher for the VA. I’m here to help get you checked in and gather feedback on the check-in process. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions while helping you through check-in? It will help us continue to improve the check-in process for Veterans like yourself. This is completely voluntary. 

If no, point them to the check-in poster.

If yes: Thank you. If you’d like to stop at any time, just let me know and we will.
