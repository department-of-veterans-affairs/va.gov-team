# Research Plan and Conversation Guide for Check-in MVP UAT
August 2021

## Goals
### What product & team are you doing this research for?
VSA Healthcare Experience: Check-in

### Background:
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. The healthcare experience team in particular will be creating the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via VA.gov. With this round of research, we are looking to get feedback the initial, limited release of our MVP with real users checking in.

### Research questions:
- After a Veteran utilizes the new mobile check-in solution, are they called back for their appointment without having to talk to a clerk/Medical Support Assistant (MSA)?
- What is the impact to the staff workflow when Veterans check in on their mobile phones?
- How do Veterans and staff feel about the mobile check-in solution?
- Where within the facility should Veterans utilize VA.gov to check in for their appointment?

### Hypotheses:
- The Veterans will successfully check in via their mobile phone, because the clerk and clincial staff will know the Veteran is in the waiting room without needing to speak directly to them. As a result, a nurse or other clinical staff will call the Veteran back for their appointment without first talking to an MSA/clerk.
- Clerks/MSAs should have shorter lines of Veterans waiting to check in, since Veterans will utilize this solution. They shouldn't need to speak directly to the Veterans who check in via their mobile phones, in order for the clinical staff to know the Veteran has arrived for their appointment. The impact to their in-person Veteran check in (Veteran's who choose not to utilize the mobile check-in solution) workflow may vary depending upon their current workflows.
- There should be minimal to no impact to clinical staff's workflow on how they know a Veteran has arrived for their appointment. 
- Veteran and staff responses will indicate that the mobile phone check-in solution is useful and does not negatively impact experience or clinical workflow.

## Method 1: Go to MVP site 
### Methodology and recruitment
- 1-2 team members travel to the MVP site(s). First site expected to be Martinsburg VAMC.
- Conduct intercept interviews with Veterans before their appointment.
  - Identify best place in the facility to conduct intercepts.
  - Work with clinic staff to determine best approach to intercept Veterans.
  - Aim to intercept at least 10-15 Veterans as they enter the clinic, before they check in for their appointment.
- Watch the Veteran complete check-in on their mobile phone.
- Ask follow-up questions.
- Utilize [Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) (NPS) in conjuntion with qualitative questions to evaluate Veteran and staff experiences. NPS can be used over time to see fluctuations in the experience, but will not be the only user experience metric evaluated. 

### When? What dates do you plan to do research?
- To be determined. Coordination with the MVP location(s) needed. Research should begin concurrently with the launch of the MVP.
  - Find out from MVP site what the busiest day(s) and time(s) are and try to complete this research during that time.

### Conversation Guide
- Prior to interacting with Veterans, take notes about the setup of the clinic.
  - What type of care is provided?
  - What does the area look like?
  - How many MSAs/clerks are available in the clinic? 
  - What is the staff check-in process like?
  - How is cellular service?
- When intercepting a Veteran...Hi! My name is [Name] and I'm a researcher with the VA. We created a new way to check-in using your mobile phone. 
- Would you like to check-in via your mobile phone?
  - If no:
    - Thank you. Have a nice day.
  - If yes:
    - Do you mind if I observe you completing check-in and ask 2 follow-up questions about the experience? It will help us to continue to improve the check-in experience for Veterans like yourself. 
      - If no:
        - That is ok. Point them to the poster, so they can complete mobile check-in by themselves.
      - If yes:
        - First, I need to ask you a question to see if you are eligible to check in with your mobile phone. Do you have more than one VA appointment today that you have not already completed (e.g., pre-appointment labs)?
        - If yes: 
          - Thank you for offering to try out the check-in on your mobile phone, but this mobile phone pilot only works for Veterans with one appointment today. We hope to expand to include multiple appointments in one day soon.
        - If no:
          - Thank you. Direct them to the poster, and watch them complete check-in.
            - Things to watch for:
              - Did they successfully complete check-in?
              - If not, what happened? Where did they get stuck?
              - Did the Veteran talk to the MSA/clerk for any reason?
                - Why?
          - On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process to another Veteran?
            - Why? What are your impressions of the experience?
- Thank you for helping us continue to improve the check-in experience.

## Method 2: MVP Site Staff Help Us Gather Feedback from Veterans
### Methodology
- Staff at the MVP site(s) will ask Veterans a series of questions ideally towards the end of their appointment (maybe at checkout), so the Veteran can provide feedback on their mobile check-in experience. However, it is up to the MVP site to determine when in their workflow these questions can fit. if this needs to occur prior to an appointment or at some other point that is absolutely fine. _The site should just let the check-in team know what was decided._

### Recruitment
- Staff should try to get feedback from:  
  - 6 Veterans who completed check-in on their mobile phone
  - 3 Veterans who did not check-in on their mobile phone
- _Staff should not worry about getting feedback from every patient during this evaluation._

### When? What dates do you plan to do research?
- To be determined between MVP site and check-in team. Ideally less than two weeks after launch.

### How staff should document feedback
- Feedback should be anonymous. Do not collect names or other identifiable information.
- The staff can utilize this [interactive PDF](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/6850668/MVP.PilotEvaluation-Feedback.pdf) to capture the feedback from the patient. Staff fills out the documentation.
- Corey Parker will periodically message the MVP site to gather the feedback documents.
- If staff would prefer another document type or process to gather feedback, message Kristen.Mcconnell@va.gov with details.

### Conversation Guide (Questions to ask Veterans)
- Did you check-in for your appointment on your mobile phone today?
  - If the Veteran answer "no" or "I don't remember," ask the following questions:
    - Did you see a poster [name the location of the poster at MVP site letting you know that you could use your mobile phone to check-in?
      - If yes, was there a reason that you did not check-in on your mobile phone?
    - Thank you very much for your feedback.  
  - If the Veteran answers "yes," ask the following questions:
    - On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process to another Veteran?
      - Why? What are your impressions of the experience?
      - What did you like and dislike about the experience?
      - Do you have any other feedback on checking in via your mobile phone?


## Method 3: MVP Site Feedback from Staff
### Methodology and Recruitment
- The check-in team reaches out to the MVP site(s) after the check-in experience within 10 days from launch of MVP. 
  - Feedback can be soliticited via email or remote meeting. If a site visit is able to be scheduled, then we can ask these questions during the site visit as well.
  - Try to invite as many staff and roles as possible at the MVP site to give feedback.

### When? What dates do you plan to do research?
- To be determined between MVP site and check-in team.

### Conversation Guide
- How has mobile check-in impacted your work?
  - What do you like about it? 
  - What do you dislike about it?
  - What would you change about the new mobile check-in?
- How has mobile check-in impacted the Veteran experience?
- On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process be utilized at another VA clinic?
- If a site visit is able to be scheduled, observe the staff member's check-in process.
