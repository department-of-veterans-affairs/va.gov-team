Conversation guide for Spanish Check-in & Toggle Design
I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
PART 1: Spanish content
Warm-up questions (5 to 10 minutes)
I'd like to start now with learning a little more about your background.
Do you and [your family/the Veteran] primarily speak Spanish, English, or another language at home?
“Spanish.”
Can you tell me about your and [your family members'/the Veteran's] level of comfort with English vs. Spanish?
“I’m fluent in English and Spanish. My mom lives with me, and she doesn’t speak English.”
“My Spanish is Cuban.”
In general, when you each need information, do you prefer to read it in English or Spanish?
Why or why not?
“I prefer English. I feel more comfortable with English and comprehending it. I’ve learned more in English than Spanish.”
Are there specific kinds of information or topics that you specifically prefer in Spanish? Can you tell me more about this?
“No.”
Can you tell me about any VA benefits or services that you, or your family members, use or have used in the past?
Do you help your family manage any of their benefits or services or vice versa? Tell me more.
“Yes. I take care all of my mother’s.”
Now, I’m going to ask you to think about the tasks you do prior to a VA medical appointment, such as checking in.
Do you recall which type of tasks you were asked to complete (if any)?
“Not for an appt.”
As a bilingual Veteran, were there any tasks you think was missing or could have been helpful for Spanish-speaking Veterans?
“I don’t think there is much. The VA that I go to, I don’t see anything that is geared towards Spanish speakers.”
“It would be nice to have the option for both.”
Curious if you have interacted or know other Veterans or caregivers with low English proficiency? (if yes), are you familiar with what their check in experience is like at the VA?
“I don’t know any.”
Testing of Spanish content (20 minutes)
I want you to pretend that you have an upcoming appointment with your VA primary care provider via the phone and you receive the following text a few days beforehand. At this point, I’m going to share my screen. I will walk you through each screen and ask you a few questions as we go. Please remember, there are no right or wrong answers. I appreciate your honest feedback.
For each Spanish-translated screen for pre-check-in and check-in, ask:
