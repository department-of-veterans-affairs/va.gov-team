# Research Goals
The check-in team is creating portions of the ecosystem that enable a Veteran to use their mobile device to pre-check in and check in for a medical appointment via VA.gov. Based on the previous research with veterans and staff members, we heard that this may decrease the long waiting time for some busy clinics if it functions adequately.

With this round of research, we are looking to gather feedback on the pilot release of Spanish content and the language toggle from Veterans through remote usability testing.

To date, there are only a few studies that look into Veterans and their family members who speak Spanish as their primary language. Within this study, we want to understand Spanish-speaking Veterans:

- perceive pre-check-in and check-in experience
- validate if the translated Spanish content meets plain language standards
- review the current toggle design pattern and test the new toggle design

In this research study, we also want to:

- Ensure the translated experience meets plain language standards for Spanish-speaking Veterans
- Understand the current check-in experience of Spanish–English bilingual veterans and their family members
- Identify suitable toggle design for partially translated content (not site-wide)
- Gather user feedback about simplified header and footer

# Research Questions

- What are the needs and pain points of bilingual Veterans and their caregivers?
	- What is their demographic information? (age, familiarity with technology, language proficiency, etc.)
- Are there any family members who also use Check-in/Pre-Check-in? (for example, assisting the patient or the family member who is also a VA patient?) If yes, what are their needs?
- What is users' language preference when using Check-in/Pre-Check-in?
- Is there additional  content that’s preferred? 
- How easy-to-understand is the Spanish translation for bilingual  Veterans and caregivers?
- How well does the proposed toggle design meet Veteran expectations? 
- How clear is the Spanish pre-check-in and check-in experience for bilingual  Veterans and their families with LEP?

# Methodology 

Remote, moderated sessions over zoom with bilingual Spanish-English Veterans and/or caregivers. 
The study includes two parts. 

**Part 1 - Understand  pain points and assess Spanish translated content**
- - Semi-structured interviews
- User feedback translated Spanish content
- Screenshots of Spanish translated content will be shown to during feedback

**Part 2 - Understand toggle design expectations**
- Impression testing of the two different toggle designs  in the pre-check-in user flow and the check-in user flow
- Usability testing of toggle designs using sketch prototypes on the Veteran’s mobile device.
Sketch will be used

To manage the length of each session, participants will be divided into two of the above parts. 


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

- Veterans and family members with low English proficiency (LEP) may have specific content needs that may be missing in the current experience
“Likely True”, as some Veterans mentioned the need of having benefits information and medical terms in Spanish.

- The Spanish content may be accurate,  but may not meet plain language standards of Veterans.
“Likely True”, as some Veterans found some content was confusing and use difficault words.

- Veterans find the original toggle design discoverable but confusing.
"Likely False", as Veterans said it is simple and just hoped it   be bigger 

- Veterans don't need to frequently switch their language using the toggle.
Not enough information: Not enough information captured.

- Veterans may prefer to have the toggle at the bottom as long as we provide clear hints about where to find it.
"Likely False", as Veterans said they hoped the toggle just be on the top so that they can notice it easily

- Only first-time users need to see a notification indicating there is now a language toggle
Not enough information: Not enough information captured.

> “Now, English. Since there are different dialects of Spanish, it’s difficult to understand.”


**2. There are even differences between the cultures and languages in the Spanish regions.**

VA Need to be careful when translating for Veterans from different Spanish regions. 

Quotes

> “It gets tricky because words don’t translate to the other. So the dialects can be offensive if you are not careful.”

> “The fact that most misunderstand the fact that the Latin America is put into one pot. Someone raised in different parts it is so huge, its two different cultures and languages.”


**3. The needs for Spanish content/service are not met.**

Veterans need Spanish content, especially medical terms, benefit information.
Some locations have a heavy Hispanic population, but there aren’t many Spanish resources.
Quotes

> “My brother in law [is a Vet and LEP] has issues on what is available to him for benefits, there are a lot of options but the options are not clear enough.”


**5. The possible background of LEP Veterans. (second hand story)**

Spanish-speaking Veterans may have good English ability when they are in the service, but they may forget English after going back to Spanish-speaking regions. Some LEP Veterans serve in locations, such as south America and Puerto Rico with more Spanish speakers


Quotes

**7. Tech using habits of bilingual Veterans.**

Veterans mainly use Google Translate.
Some Spanish-speaking vets don't set their browser to Spanish.
People tend to find a language switch at the top or the bottom of the website. 
Quotes

- It is harder for elder Spanish-speaking Veterans to access Spanish content because they don't use smartphone.
- A visually impaired Veteran mentioned that the kiosk doesn't work for visually impaired Veterans.

## Pre-check-in and check-in interaction findings

**1. High satisfaction rating on check-in / pre-check-in experience. However, some interaction issues were found.**

On a scale from 1 (very unclear) to 10 (very clear): average rating is 8.6
This rating is about the check-in and pre-check-in flow. We will discuss the rating of the content in the next section.
> “If there is any problem, it is not because of the form but the culture and the language”


**2. Interaction Design issues that could also happen for general users**
- 3 out of 6 Veterans expected the form is editable if they click on “No” when asked if their information is up to date. The content seems to be editable but it didn't seem to have clarity issues.
- 3 out of 5 Veterans did  not understand the refresh button on the appointment page.
> “Will it take me to edit?”

> “What do you  mean by actualizacion?”

**3. Bilingual Veterans have concerns about the consistency of Spanish and English when navigating the website.**
- Though there was an notification on the top of page saying that some content was in English, 4 out of 6 Veterans seemed surprised that some content was in English.
- A Veteran has concerns the links on the confirmation page are in English.
- A Veteran thought that the footer should also be translated if he chose Spanish.


Quotes
> “It's mixed up...It may confuse Veterans."
> “It says contact your provider but will be contacted in English?  It doesn’t align with what they are trying to do.”

**Secondary Findings**

- A Veteran considered the accordions in the footer as a part of the "Need help" section.
- A Veteran viewed the ‘Learning assistance’ accordion in the footer as a language switch, expecting it would show language options after clicking the plus icon.
- A Veteran mentioned that the footer is overwhelming and some links (such as the policies) are not helpful.
- A Veteran seemed to misunderstand pre-check-in as check-in. 
- A Veteran mentioned not knowing enough information about the appointment before checking in, such as location and providerㄡㄡ
- 2 Veterans mentioned the concerns about how this product will help elderly Veterans who may not be tech savvy.



## Pre-check-in and check-in content findings

**1. High rating on overall clarity, but translation issues identified.**
- On a scale from 1 (very unclear) to 10 (very clear): average rating is 8.4
- It’s important to address the translation issues as they may impede task completion (details are outlined in the subsequent findings).  

Quotes
> [On why he gave the clarity rating a 6] "It takes forever to fill out the forms, so I have to read it a few times to understand what they are asking for" - Veteran who speaks spanish from Ecuador

> "It's fairly clear [apart from a few issues]" - Veteran who speaks spanish from Cuba


**2. The translation of check-in and pre-check-in seems to be confusing.**
- Check-in was translated as Register.
- Pre-check-in was translated as Pre-registration. 2 out of 6 Veterans said it was registration. 

Quotes
> " There should be a better word for register. I know register in English but registro is like filling out something to apply for something. It’s not checking in, I am registering for something. "

> “Begin your registration before arrival.”
> “You have completed your registration. Bring your cards of insurance to the appointment.”



**3. There are some possible translation issues to look into because of Spanish difference.**
1. Time label on the pre-check-in intro page
“‘Horario means ‘timeline or schedule’...it would be more accurate for ‘horario’ to be ‘hora’, which means time.” - A veteran who says he also works as a translator. However, the other veteran said 'Horario' means hour.

2. H1 on the pre-check-in confirmation page
out of 6 Veterans interpreted the H1 as a question, confused that it was written as a statement. 1 Veterans interprets H1 as a statement, and thinks it is clear, doesn't express any confusion.

3. The refresh function on check-in Appointment details page
3 out of 5 Veterans were confused by the expiration date wording.
“This translates to " The last time it was actualized…I don't understand what 'actualized' means". - Veteran who speaks Spanish from Cuba.
The label may have a verb tense issue, as this Veteran says it translates to "updating". He asks "What am I updating?" - Veteran who speaks Spanish from Ecuador

4. The translation of Next of Kin (pariente)
3 out of 6 Veterans were confused about the wording in the H1 Next of Kin page 
The word “pariente” may not translate well to all types of Spanish. Some Veterans believe this could mean “parent”. Suggest using a more universally accurate word like “family relative”, which would translate to “familiar”.
"In many Latin American cultures you would use “familiar” meaning a family member. Like someone that is a parent or family member. There could be confusion there. This is a cultural difference you will run into." - Veteran who speaks Spanish from Columbia"

**Secondary Findings**
- The insurance card information on the check-in confirmation page.
- 3 out of 6 suggest ‘insurance cards’ should be more specific.


## Toggle design and language function findings

**1. For those who need the language switch, they prefer to have it on top because it's is easier to notice.**
- 3 out of 5 Veterans hope that a  language switch is on the top of the page. 
- 2 out of 5 Veterans think that a language switch should be available both on the top and bottom of the page.

Quotes
> “If it's not on the top, then someone may miss it when using their mobile phone.“
> “Begin your registration before arrival.”
> “You have completed your registration. Bring your cards of insurance to the appointment.”


**2. If a new language function is available on the VA website, Veterans want to have additional marketing methods, such as emails or texts.**
- 2 Veterans suggested targeted Spanish speaking households with Spanish mailers. 1 Veteran mentioned getting an SMS is good.

Quotes

**3. Current version - a toggle above H1: clear and takes less clicking.**
- 5 out of 5 Veterans thought it worked as expected.
- The Spanish option is available Spanish.
- A Veteran said it can be larger.
- 2 out of 5 Veterans suggested that we add the Tagalog here.

Quotes

"


**4. The design with a notification on the top and a language switch at the bottom least preferred because it is confusing.**
2 Veterans thought it worked as expected. 3 Veterans were surprised.

About the notification:
plain language and call to action is good.
It's more noticeable because it is bigger and colorful.
 2 out of 5 Veterans thought it would take them to another page or open a drop-down list after clicking on “Switch languages”.

About the scrolling effect:
3 Veterans thought it  is confusing because it  adding another step to the Veteran to switch the language.

**5. The language switch as the subheader: noticeable, big, and takes less clicks.**
- 5 out of 5 Veterans thought it worked as expected.
- Veterans usually compared this design with the current toggle and though this version was better because of the visual cues and that one more language available. 


Quotes
> "That would be best...it gives me my options right there, I don't have to scroll to the bottom"
> "It's nice and bold right at the top"


**Secondary Findings**

- A Veterans mentioned that "sign in" on the header leads to confusion.
- A Veterans mentioned that all content, including the footer should be translated. (The current toggle)
- Have the language switch as the subheader got the highest rating. The current language switch is good, but it can be improved.



# Recommendations

**Spanish-speaking group findings**
- Different VA facilities should have different Spanish prioritization based on the demographic.
- Provide more Spanish content and services in the future and keep improving the Spanish experience.


**Pre-check-in and check-in interaction findings**
- Enable Veterans to edit their information when doing mobile check-in or pre-check-in.

**Pre-check-in and check-in content findings**
- Document user feedback and review them with a translator.
- Share with the Sitewide Content team what roles are interested in translation and multilingual Veterans.

**Toggle design and language function findings**
- Improve the hierarchy and visual of the current language switch design to make it noticeable.
- Explore where to place the language switch (on the top, or both on the top and at the bottom of the page) with the user groups that are not representative in this study, such as monolingual Veterans.
- Explore a further simplified header to reduce Veterans leaving workflows like check-in.
Reimagine the "Need help" portion and the footer to provide essential information for Veterans.
- Provide marketing materials about the language switch.
