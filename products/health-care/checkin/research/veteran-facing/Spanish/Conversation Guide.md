## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to talk about how VA can meet the needs of Spanish-speaking Veterans when preparing and checking in for their VA medical appointment. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
This entire session should take no longer than 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

*Start recording.*

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

# PART 1: Spanish content 

## Warm-up questions  (5 to 10 minutes)

I'd like to start now with learning a little more about your background.
- Do you and [your family/the Veteran] primarily speak Spanish, English, or another language at home? 
     - Can you tell me about your and [your family members'/the Veteran's] level of comfort with English vs. Spanish?
     - Which spanish-speaking region  is your Spanish from? 
- In general, when you each need information, do you prefer to read it in English or Spanish?
     - Why or why not? 
- Do you help your family manage any of their benefits or services or vice versa? Tell me more.

Now, I’m going to ask you to think about the tasks you do prior to a VA medical appointment, such as checking in.
- Do you recall which type of tasks you were asked to complete (if any)? 
- As a bilingual Veteran, were there any tasks you think was missing or could have been helpful for Spanish-speaking Veterans?
- Curious if you have interacted or know other Veterans or caregivers with low English proficiency? (if yes), are you familiar with what their check in experience is like at the VA?


## Testing of spanish content (20 minutes)

I want you to pretend that you have an upcoming appointment with your VA primary care provider via the phone and you receive the following text a few days beforehand. At this point, I’m going to share my screen.  I will walk you through each screen and ask you a few questions as we go. Please remember, there are no right or wrong answers. I appreciate your honest feedback. 


**For each Spanish-translated screen for  pre-check-in and check-in, ask:**

- Can you tell me what this page is asking you to do? 
- What, if anything, do you find confusing? Why or why not?
- Is any information missing? 

**Follow-up questions** 
- Overall, what information, if anything, is missing for non-English speakers or veterans with low English proficiency?
- Overall, what, if anything, would you improve? 
- On a scale from 1 (very unclear) to 10 (very clear), how would you rate the clarity of the Spanish content? Please explain.
- On a scale from 1 to 10 (where 1 is very unsatisfied, and 10 is very satisfied), how would you rate the overall  Spanish language experience of pre-check-in and check-in? Please explain.

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it serves the needs of all Veterans and their family members and caregivers. Thanks! If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the email blurb that you’ll receive from our team.


# PART 2: Language Toggle Design

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

I'd like to start now with learning a little more about your background.
- Do you and [your family/the Veteran] primarily speak Spanish, English, or another language at home? 
     - Can you tell me about your and [your family members'/the Veteran's] level of comfort with English vs. Spanish?
     - Which spanish-speaking region  is your Spanish from? 
- In general, when you each need information, do you prefer to read it in English or Spanish?
     - Why or why not? 
- Do you help your family manage any of their benefits or services or vice versa? Tell me more.
- Do you set your browser to Spanish or use Google translate? Why or why not? 
- Where do you expect to find a language toggle or switch if translated content is provided on a website?

Now, I’m going to ask you to think about the tasks you do prior to a VA medical appointment, such as checking in.
- Do you recall which type of tasks you were asked to complete (if any)? 
- As a bilingual Veteran, were there any tasks you think was missing or could have been helpful for Spanish-speaking Veterans?
- Are there specific kinds of information or topics that you specifically prefer in Spanish? Can you tell me more about this?
- Curious if you have interacted or know other Veterans or caregivers with low English proficiency? (if yes), are you familiar with what their check in experience is like at the VA?

## First Task: Toggle 5-second test (10 minutes)
Now I'm going to ask you to think about the last time you checked in for an in-person medical appointment.  I’ll  be showing you 3 designs in total. I’ll share each design briefly. I’ll then ask you some questions. I’m sharing the screen now. 
Note: the order of the designs shows will vary between all partipants

[Show first toggle design for 5 seconds and show a blank slide]
- Follow-up questions after showing each toggle design: 
- What grabbed your attention, if anything? 
- What functions does it provide?
- What words or sentences can you recall, if anything?

[Show the slide of the second toggle design for 5 seconds]
- Follow-up questions after showing each toggle design: 
- What grabbed your attention, if anything?
- What functions does it provide?
- What words or sentences can you recall, if anything?

[Show the slide of the third toggle design for 5 seconds]
- Follow-up questions after showing each toggle design: 
- What grabbed your attention, if anything?
- What functions does it provide?
- What words or sentences can you recall, if anything?

[Show both designs]

I'd like to bring your attention to the header (the area at the top)  and footer (the area at the bottom):
- What do you notice about these two areas?
- Can you tell me more about how the header and footer impact your experience?

I’d like to talk about the language switch on the top section of the page.
- What do you notice about the language switch?
- If you click on the continue button, do you think it will show an English page or a Spanish page? 
- How do you expect it to work?
     - If talking about Design B, also ask: how do you expect the notification to behave? 
     - If you close the notification, what do you expect to see if you navigate to the next page? 



[Follow-up questions]
- Which language switch, do you think, is most helpful?
- Where do you expect to find a toggle on VA website if translated content is provided?
- How do you expect to be notified about the new language function?

For Design B, also ask:
- What did you expect about the notification? Do you expect to still see or not to see the notification on the second page/the Spanish page? 


## Second Task: Toggle usability testing (15 minutes)
Note: the order of the designs shows will vary between all participants

[Participants viewing the toggle design in pre-check-in flow]
I want you to pretend that you have an upcoming appointment with your VA primary care provider via the phone and you receive the following text a few days beforehand. At this point, I would like you to share your screen, so we can see the text too. I've sent you a link in the chat to prototype. Please cut and paste this link into your browser. Thank you.

Before you start,  a few things I want to mention:
This prototype is just for user testing.  There is some content not yet translated into Spanish. We’d like you to mainly focus on the language switch function rather than other functions of the flow. 

Please take a moment to interact with  this prototype. Please talk-aloud as you complete the task. And there are no right or wrong answers, I appreciate your honest feedback. 


[Participants viewing the toggle design in check-in flow]
I want you to pretend that you have an upcoming appointment with your VA primary care provider via the phone. You see a poster at the clinic, text to the number on the poster and receive a link. At this point, I would like you to share your screen, so we can see the text too. I've sent you a link in the chat to prototype. Please cut and paste this link into your browser. Thank you.


[Link in the chat:  link to a prototype combination, which includes Current toggle, Toggle Design #1, amd Toggle Design #2]

**Things to observe**
Does the participant understand how the toggles work without direction?
Does the participant understand the English content? If not, how do they seek help?

**Questions to ask after a participant try out each toggle design:**
- Does the language toggle switch work as you expected? Why or why not? 
- What makes the language switch helpful?
- What makes the language switch not helpful? What would you change about the design, if anything?



## Post-Toggle Testing Questions 
Please stop sharing your screen, and I’ll share my screen instead.
(Show the slide showing 3 designs: the current toggle, and the 2 toggle designs)
Demonstrate each design and ask the following questions:
     - On a scale from 1 to 10 (where 1 is very unsatisfied, and 10 is very satisfied), how would you rate your experience with these 3 designs?



## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it serves the needs of all Veterans and their family members and caregivers.
Thanks!
