# Research Goals

The check-in product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The check-in experience team, in particular, has created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check-in” through VA.gov (e.g., letting the VA know that the patient has arrived for their appointment). 

With this round of research, we are looking to gather feedback on the pilot release from Veterans across the St. Louis area. To date, we haven’t spoken with any Veterans who completed the live pre-check-in experience. Within this study, we want to understand how the pre-check-in experience was perceived by Veterans, especially when combined with check-in. It is difficult to recruit Veterans who have completed pre-check-in remotely utilizing our Perigean pool of participants, since we are at such a limited number of clinics. This is why we are interested in going on site to intercept Veterans, who are more likely to have completed pre-check-in.

The purpose of this research was to: 

- Evaluate effectiveness of check-in and pre-check-in experiences with Veterans and staff at St. Louis pilot clinics.
- Identify strengths, pain points and opportunities to inform product team and roadmap (as VISN rollouts begin). 
- Evaluate effectiveness of new poster that addresses low-vision concerns. 
- Gain insights and opinions on product naming.  
- Gain insights from VA staff on opportunities to integrate telephone appointments with pre-check-in and displaying patient record flags in VSE-CS. 

# Research Questions

- Are Veterans able to complete pre-check-in successfully from home? Do they understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in? 
- What friction points arise for Veterans during check-in? How easy or difficult is check-in to complete on VA.gov? 
- What is the impact on the new poster addressing low vision concerns? 
- How do Veterans refer to the check-in process? 
- How do MSAs interact with Veterans during the check-in process? What impact does pre-check-in and check-in have on MSAs workflow? 
- What are the overall impressions of check-in among Veterans and staff? 
- How are patient record flags currently used by staff? 
- How would adding telephone appointments to the pre-check-in experience impact staff workflow?  

# Methodology 

From April 27-29, 2022, we visited St. Louis VAMC, North County CBOC and Olive Street VA Clinic to conduct intercept interviews with Veterans when they arrived for their appointment. We observed Veterans interact with the updated poster, complete check-in on their mobile device and asked follow-up questions using our [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/StLouis-pilot-feedback/conversation-guide.md).

We also observed and interviewed a variety of VA staff who have a role in the check-in process, including MSAs and clinicians. We used a [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/pilot-feedback/conversation-guide.md) to steer those conversations. 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans should be able to successfully complete pre-check-in from the comfort of their homes. Veterans will correctly assume that they still need to complete mobile check-in even if they completed pre-check-in. The pre-check-in experience improves the staff experience, since they need to review contact, next of kin and emergency contact information with fewer Veterans.<br>
    1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: Most Veterans we spoke with did not complete pre-check-in. Therefore, there wasn't enough information to determine ease of use or perceptions about how it's related to check-in. However, staff said that when Veterans complete pre-check-in, it creates a more seamless check-in experience on the day of the appointment. 
1. Veterans will be able to successfully check-in via their mobile device, verify their identity and confirm their demographic information without any friction. In the ideal scenario, Veterans will be able to complete check-in with little to no intervention from MSAs. Therefore, MSAs should have shorter lines of Veterans waiting to check in, since Veterans will be utilizing the new check-in solution in the waiting area. 
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Some Veterans were able to complete check-in on their own, while others needed assistance from MSAs. In addition, in some clinics, MSAs engaged Veterans to help with the check-in process. Of course, there were Veterans that did not want to use the mobile check-in process, therefore requiring MSAs to assist them with check-in through VSE-GUI. 
1. The updated poster enables low-vision Veterans to easily read check-in instructions. 
    1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: Based on the nature of the research, we were not able to capture demograhpic information from Veterans. Many Veterans at the eye clinic were not thrilled with checking in on their mobile device, but it's unclear if the poster was problematic for them. 
1. MSAs will still check-in Veterans who prefer in-person over mobile. 
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Some clinics checked Veterans in through VSE-GUI that didn't want to use their phone, while other clinics were much more insistent on Veterans using thier phones.  
1. Veteran responses will indicate that the pre-check-in and mobile phone check-in solutions are useful and do not negatively impact their care experience.
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Responses were mixed. Some Veterans simply do not want to use their phone to check in, and of course, some cannot due to various reasons. However, other Veterans had no difficulty with the new process. 
1. Staff responses will indicate that the mobile check-in solution is useful and does not negatively impact experience or clinical workflow.
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Staff see the potential, but are hesitant until technical and lag issues are resolved. 
1. Properly displaying patient record flags is very important to staff.
    1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: There were mixed opinions on where patient record flags should reside. Some feel that flags could be added to VSE-CS, while others are content with CPRS. 
1. Gathering necessary pre-registration and other information prior to a telephone appointment can be difficult. Adding telephone appointments to pre-check-in would solve the staff pain point of reviewing pre-registration during appointments.
    1. LIKELY TRUE: Clinics and providers seem to be inconsistent in how pre-registration is completed for telephone appointments. Therefore, utilizing the new check-in process would create consistencies. 

# Key Findings

1. There's a large cohort of Veterans that feel they shouldn't have to use their phone to check in at the VA. However, younger Veterans and returning patients have adopted the changes in a more streamlined manner.  
1. Pre-check-in was not widely used by Veterans because it's overlooked and conflated with the initial appointment confirmation message.
1. Veterans were frustrated that they had to wait to check in when arriving early for appointments. 
1. The new poster addressing low vision concerns was initially successful, but requires additional testing with low-vision participants.  
1. If posters weren’t in line of sight of Veterans between entering the clinic and walking up to the MSA counter, then Veterans often missed them altogether. 
1. Network and cell signal strength are variable between clinics: 3-15 seconds to receive second text message from VeText, 5-15 seconds for VA.gov to load. 
1. Veterans appreciate the help from MSAs when checking in. However, it’s increased the workload of many MSAs.

# Details of Findings 

Labels: AUD: Veterans, HDW: Smartphone, PRDT: health-care-check-in, RESRCH: User Acceptance Testing, RESRCH: Interviews, VETSJNY: Taking care of themselves

**There's a large cohort of Veterans that feel they shouldn't have to use their phone to check in at the VA. However, younger Veterans and returning patients have adopted the changes in a more streamlined manner.**

Of the 59 Veterans we spoke with, 17 (or 29%) either did not have a mobile device with a data plan or were unable or willing to use the mobile check-in process. 

And, of the 42 (or 71%) that did use the check-in process, a mixed sentiment was returned for the overall perception of check-in. Returning patients were the most confident using check-in. For example, Veterans returning for a routine visit to their primary care physician. And based on our observations, younger Veterans tended to have an easier time adjusting to the new process. 

*Positive*

> _It [mobile check in] was better than the kiosk._

> _It was super easy to get checked in._ 

> _Love how it works. It works really well._

> _I like not having to wait in a long line._

> _It was hard at first, but it’s been good now._

*Somewhat negative*

> _Don’t use a cell phone. Never do._

> _It would have been easier if I had just spoken to them [MSA]._

> _It was pretty difficult._

> _What are they going to have us do next?_

> _If the government wants them to check-in with their phone, then the government should provide a phone._

> _Veterans feel like they're being hacked and tracked._

**Pre-check-in was not widely used by Veterans because it's overlooked and conflated with the initial appointment confirmation message.**

When asked if Veterans remember completing pre-check-in, almost all either thought, a) they completed it by confirming their appointment through text message, or b) they weren't aware it existed. 

One Veteran mentioned that they receive too many text messages from the VA to easily spot the pre-check-in message. They suggested that they may be more inclined to see the text message if it wasn't an immediate response tied to the appointment confirmation. 

Most Veterans were unaware of pre-check-in's value to them. 

> _It looks like all the other messages."_

> _Veterans don't read the entire pre-check-in message, and therefore don't know what pre-check-in even is. The message needs to be a lot shorter._

**Veterans were frustrated that they had to wait to check in when arriving early for appointments.**

We observed many Veterans arriving 1 hour early (i.e., 30 minutes prior to check-in availability) for their scheduled medical appointments as a result of a number of reasons: 

- Travel arrangements
- Provider/staff recommendation
- Typically requires caregiver assistance

We learned that it can be frustrating for Veterans, especially those that require caregiver assistance, to wait to check in to only learn that they have to stand back up and see the MSA to confirm their information. 

We also heard from clinicians that they like to know if their patients are there early because there's a chance they can be seen earlier (especially for morning appointments). 

**The new poster addressing low vision concerns was initially successful, but requires additional testing with low-vision participants.  **

No Veterans we spoke with had difficulties being able to read the new poster. 

However, it's worth noting that overall sentiment on check-in was much lower at the eye clinic. I.e., potentially it's challenging for that Veteran population to use their phone and/or use the poster. 

**If posters weren’t in line of sight of Veterans between entering the clinic and walking up to the MSA counter, then Veterans often missed them altogether.**

This in turn created a small waiting line at some clinics for staff to provide help. 

In addition, check-in posters were often competing with other posters for real estate. E.g., posters on safety, COVID-19, visitors, etc. 

**Network and cell signal strength are variable between clinics: 3-15 seconds to receive second text message from VeText, 5-15 seconds for VA.gov to load.**

Initial response from VeText following “check in” text was immediate. The second message from VeText took 3-15 seconds on average to arrive. Although not a lengthy time, it had the potential to create a line at the MSA counter. 

Depending on the strength of cell service for the Veteran’s mobile device, it took anywhere from 5-15 seconds on average to load VA.gov. 

And, at times, we observed that the Contact Information page was slow to load. There were a few scenarios where the bottom of the page loaded first, requiring the Veteran to scroll up to view the question.  

**Veterans appreciate the help from MSAs when checking in. However, it’s increased the workload of many MSAs.**

Most MSAs still interacted with Veterans because of their proximity to the clinic entrance. Other reasons included: 

- Veterans may not have seen the check-in posters; 
- MSAs offered to assist them through the check-in process, e.g., to get them comfortable;
- Some Veterans needed assistance using their mobile device 

> _It was much easier since you helped me._ 

At times, there was a pattern for MSAs to walk Veterans down the “happy path” of confirming all of their information (in order to create a frictionless experience for the Veteran).  

There were moments that MSAs reached “hard stops” with Veterans either as a text or on VA.gov. In a few of those scenarios, MSAs didn’t know how to correct the issue and instructed the Veteran to try again, which led to a repeat failure (and frustrating experience for both). 

Although MSAs ensured all Veterans were checked in to VSE-GUI, many still messaged providers in Teams to let them know their patients had arrived (likely due to technical issues the clinic has previously experienced with check-in). 

# Recommendations

* **Pre-check-in**
    * Explore opportunities to increase utilization of pre-check-in with Veterans (and ensure it doesn’t “get lost”). 
        * Communicate the value to Veterans (in marketing communications, text message, etc.) 
        * Test new text messages (e.g., test moving the pre-check-in link into initial confirmation text message) 
        * Send text message at a different time or day after confirming their appointment
        * Send pre-check-in message multiple times, if not completed
        * Introduce email for pre-check-in 
    * Consider implementing editing of demographic information in pre-check-in.  

* **Check-in**
    * Consider implementing a push text message on day of appointment, e.g., pushing the check-in link out to Veterans (knowing that Veterans are arriving earlier than 30 minutes). And, consider increasing the check-in window beyond 30 minutes. 
    * Look for opportunities (via an audit) to provide more context in error messages on VA.gov pages to expedite check-in process for Veterans and staff.
    * Explore opportunities to improve the CHIP text response when 0 appointments are found. E.g., avoid Veteran confusion if/when directed to va.gov/find-locations.   
    * Work with engineers to replicate (and correct, if possible) the scenario where users are starting lower on the page after identity verification.  

* **Check-in poster**
    * Consider finding a way to include the “30 minute window” message into the poster to increase Veteran satisfaction. In addition, consider adding a VA logo to the poster to add credibility and authenticity.  
    * Consider testing a poster option where text option is primary and QR code is secondary (knowing that it’s troublesome for some Veterans and devices). 
    * Look into creating recommendations and guidelines for poster placement in clinics. Or, look for opportunities for Human Centered Designers to offer assistance at clinics when setting up posters. 

* **Back of the house**
    * Continue to look for opportunities to improve lag time between VSE-GUI and VSE-CS. 
    * Share knowledge with stakeholders and training team about the impact that training has on MSA’s workload and usage of VSE-GUI and VSE-CS. I.e., with a goal to create better consistencies on how staff use these systems, how they work with Veterans to get checked in and how to mitigate when Veterans reach hard stops. 
    * Talk to more MSAs to understand why they’re using VSE-CS. 
    * Share knowledge with stakeholders and training team on successes of a dedicated staff member helping Veterans with check-in. As a result, recommend testing at high-volume clinics. 
    * Work with VSE-CS team to understand and prioritize suggested improvements to VSE-CS. E.g., more visual alerts for status changes, open text box option for Workflow status, adding last 4 digits of SSN to patient name, filtering options in Workflow, etc. 

* **Feature enhancements**
    * Talk with additional staff to understand if patient record flags are desirable in VSE-CS.
    * Cross-reference telephone appointment findings with usability testing findings to determine if additional gaps exist prior to piloting. 
    * Prioritize feature enhancements with product owners, including:  
        * Integration of travel reimbursement into check-in 
        * Ability for caregivers to check in for Veterans 
        * Expansion into walk-in appointments

## Who we talked to

59 Veterans were observed during check-in

- 17 (or 29%) of the 59 Veterans either did not have a mobile device with a data plan or were unable or willing to use the mobile check-in process

Due to the intercept method used for this research, we were unable to collect demographic information that supports the VA's inclusive research guidelines. 

We spoke with Veterans from a number of clinics, including:

- North County CBOC, St. Louis (Primary care, wellness, nutrition, etc.) 
- GI Lab, Eye Clinic, OT/PT, Speciality Care Clinic (at St. Louis VAMC) 
- Olive Street VA Clinic (Women's Health and Dermatology Clinic)
