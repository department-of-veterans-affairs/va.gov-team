# St. Louis Pilot Research Executive Team Findings Debrief 
Presented: April 29, 2022

The following high-level observations and findings were reported to the St. Louis VAMC Executive Team on April 29, 2022. As session notes are aggregated, some findings may change. In addition, a full research report inclsuive of all findings will be created. 

## Day 1 CBOC North County 

- There were a couple (returning) patients who were quite fond of the check-in process. Loved it, super easy to use and confident in it.
- A couple patients were unable to check in because they were too early for their appointment window.
- Poster placement can be a major factor for effectiveness. If it's not in the Veterans way when entering the office, they likely won't see it. Improving awareness of check-in could help too. E.g., educational posters outside the office, other channel messaging, etc.
- Concern from staff around time it takes for check-in information to show up in VSE and/or status changes in VSE CS from VSE. 
- Of course, we noticed that many Veterans don't have cell phones and don't want to use them. (But, that's expected.)
- Also saw that many Veterans need help using check in for various reasons; mostly surrounding lack of phone expertise. E.g., hard to see, hard to use their phone, don't use phone that much, etc. And, of course, scanning and using QR codes can be finicky. E.g., getting the link to show, tapping the link, etc. (Our team as well as MSAs were there to help Veterans learn the process, as needed.)

## Day 2 John Cochran, Optometry, GI Lab, PT and Specialty Clinic 

- Check in process was challenging for many Veterans visiting the optometry clinic. E.g., difficulty seeing and using their phone.
- We've heard and discussed this before, but to reiterate again, we heard many Veterans arrive early for appointments, even before the 30 minute window. In some clinics, clinicians can see the patients early and feel it would be great to get them checked in earlier, if possible. 
- One of St. Louis VAMC team members has been helping the Specialty clinic everyday to ensure Veterans are able to check in. Veterans love working together with him and feel empowered about the check in process once he spends time with them explaining how it works. Interestingly, he's been showing Veterans how to save "VA Check In" as a contact in their phone. These Veterans are now "experts" in how to check in for their appointments.  
- Feedback from staff and clinicians on delays of information coming into VSE GUI. Although, times were very good today when we were observing.
- Veterans often skip pre check in because there's a perception that they're already checked in via the "Yes" response.
- MSAs would like to understand the "why's" and "how to fix" for numerous error messages. E.g., how to identify when the mobile number isn't correct and what to tell the Veteran to fix in the future. 

## Day 3 Olive Street VA Clinic (Dermatology and Women's Health) 

- MSAs were very helpful working with Veterans to learn the new check in process. Once someone was able to walk them through it, they were much more comfortable with the process. Of course, this takes time away from the other work that MSAs are responsible for. 
- One Veteran gave some suggestions on how to improve the use of pre-check-in. E.g., they receive so many text messages already that look exactly the same. They recommended to try to send a message out another time vs. along with the “you’re confirmed” response. In addition, make the message stand out more from the other messages. 
- Check in status from patients was quick into VSE. 
- Of course, some Veterans either didn’t use a mobile phone or have data turned on. We also saw a few patients that were using a different mobile number, and therefore, couldn’t check in with their current phone (until their number is updated). 
- Many patients were early to their appointments. E.g., an hour early. It can be frustrating to wait and go through the check in process to find out that they have to stand back up and see the MSA.
