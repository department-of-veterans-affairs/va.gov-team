# Conversation Guide: St. Louis Visit to Gather Feedback on Pilot from Veterans

## Upon arrival to the clinic, speak with staff on how they would like us to intercept Veterans
- Does the staff want to do the initial intercept? Can we?
- Should we not intercept certain Veterans?
- Talk to staff about hanging up the low vision poster(s) for our study (if not already in place).

## Initial Veteran Intercept and Screening Questions
- Hi! My name is [Name] and I'm a researcher for the VA. We are here today to gather feedback on a new pre-check-in and check-in experience using your mobile phone. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions and possibly observe you completing check-in? It will help us continue to improve the pre-check-in and check-in experience for Veterans like yourself. This is completely voluntary.
  - If no: That is ok. Point them to the updated poster, so they can complete mobile check-in by themselves. **[End session.]**
  - If yes: Thank you. I just want to let you know that if you want to stop my questions or observations at any point just let me know and we will. Would you like to check-in via your mobile phone?
    - If no: Did you start (but not complete) or successfully complete pre-check-in prior to your appointment today? You might have received a text message with a link to review your address, phone, next of kin, etc. That is pre-check-in.
      - If no: Understanding why Veterans aren't using the experience is also valuable to us, was there a particular reason that you didn't complete pre-check-in?
        - Thank you for helping us continue to improve the pre-check-in experiences. Direct Veteran to MSA to check in. **[End session.]**
      - If yes: **[Ask questions from "Pre-check-in Questions" section only.]**
    - If yes: Great. Before you check-in, did you start (but not complete) or successfully complete pre-check-in prior to your appointment today? You might have received a text message with a link to review your address, phone, next of kin, etc. That is pre-check-in.
      - If no: Understanding why Veterans aren't using the experience is also valuable to us, was there a particular reason that you didn't complete pre-check-in?
        - **[Ask questions from "Observing Veteran" section only]**
      - If yes: **[Ask questions from "Pre-check-in Questions" and "Observing Veteran" sections]**
  
## Pre-check-in Questions
- Were you able to successfully complete pre-check-in?
  - If no, why? What screen were you on when you stopped filling out pre-check-in?
- How many days ago did you [start OR complete] pre-check-in?
  - Did you [start OR complete] pre-check-in immediately when you received the SMS or did you come back later to complete it? 
- Where were you when you [started OR completed] pre-check-in?
- On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this pre-check-in process to another Veteran?
  - What did you like and dislike about the pre-check-in experience?
- _Only ask Veterans who successfully completed pre-check-in._ Do you think it will change anything about checking into your appointment today?
  - If so, how?

## Observing Veteran
- Direct them to the poster, and watch them complete check-in.
  - Things to watch for:
    - Did they seem to understand the low vision poster or have any questions?
    - Did they attempt to scan the QR code? 
      - If so, did they have trouble?
    - How long did they wait to receive the check in link via text message?
    - Did they need to make any changes to their contact information? If so, observe that process.
    - Did they successfully complete check-in?
      - If not, what happened? Where did they get stuck?
    - Did the Veteran talk to the MSA/clerk for any reason?
      - Why?
- Stop the Veteran on the appointment list page, if they have multiple appointments listed.
	- What are your impressions of this page?
- Follow up questions (once check-in is complete)
  - Was this your first time checking in with this mobile experience?
  - How would you describe the security of this check-in process?
  - If the veteran didn't use a QR code, when was the last time (if at all) you've used a QR code?
  - _Only for Veterans who completed pre-check-in, but had to review demographics again on the day of._ What are your thoughts on reviewing your address, next of kin, and emergency contact today, since you also reviewed them a few days ago?
  - On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process to another Veteran?
    - Why? What are your impressions of the experience?

Thank you for helping us continue to improve the pre-check-in and check-in experience.
