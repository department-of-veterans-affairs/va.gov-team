# Conversation guide for Healthcare Experience Team, Check-in Phase 2 Usability

## Moderator logistics

Use [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.

Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).

In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute

In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked

Check your \[screensharing setup\]

When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about checking in for medical appointment at the VA.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take no longer than an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We want to hear your thoughts on a possible new way to let your doctor know that you have arrived for your appointment. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* During this session, we'll be doing two things:
  * First, I'll start by asking you a few questions about your past experiences.
  * For the second half of the session, I'll send you a link to a prototype that one of our teams created to explain a new way to let your doctor know that you have arrived. 
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Now, I’m going to ask you to think about your very last medical appointment that you actually went to the VA facility for.

* What type of mobile phone do you have (iPhone or Android)?
* Can you describe checking in for that medical appointment?
  * Overall, how would you describe that experience? Was it a good or bad experience? Easy or hard?
    * What did you like about it?
    * What did you not like about it?
* You checked in via [the method they mentioned in the previous question], what method do you use most often?
  * _Clarify options available only if necessary._ This could be using the kiosk, talking directly with VA staff, using text messaging , or how your access virtual appointments.

## Usability - 30 minutes

Alright, I want you to pretend that you have multiple VA medical appointments today. You have just arrived at the location of your cardiology appointment and you see the following sign hanging on the wall. 

* [Screenshare poster](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/mvp-usability/check-in-collateral-usabilityTest.pdf)
* [For reference: UX Pin prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/6917d1a8683f4d51ece3826388e618dac3eb875d#/pages/140839196?mode=cvhidm)

**Poster**
  * Can you explain to me what we're looking at here?
  * What are your thoughts about what the poster is asking you to do?
  * Is there anything missing?

Seeing this poster, what would you do next? 

At this point, I would like you to share your screen, so we can watch you complete the task mentioned on the poster. [Only prompt them if need be in order to complete check-in.]

Things to watch for:

* Were they able to successfully complete the task?
* Were there any points of confusion?
* Were there any comments about security or data points asked for identity verification?
* Were there any comments about the "your appointment" page with their iterinary, particularly the statuses displayed?

Now, I'm going to have you go back through check-in again. This time I'll ask you some questions at each point in the process.

**Text Message**
* What changes would you make to this text messaging portion of check-in?

**Check in at VA**
* Can you explain to me what we're looking at?
* What are your thoughts about what this page is asking you?
* Would you prefer to enter in the last 4 digits of your SSN or your date of birth here?
* Is there anything missing?

**Contact/insurance**
* Can you explain to me what we're looking at?
* What are your thoughts about what this page is asking you?
* Is there anything missing?

**Your appointments**
* Can you explain to me what we're looking at?
* What are your thoughts about what this page is showing you?
  * What are your thoughts about seeing all of your appointments for the day on one screen?
  * What do you think you have to do to check-in for another appointment (after you already checked in for one)? 
    * What are your thoughts about that?
    * What do you think about the possibility that there are multiple appointments eligible for check-in right now, but only being able to select one to complete check-in.
  * What are your thoughts about seeing these other types of appointments on this page?
    * an appointment you already checked in for.
    * an appointment that is past the time where you are able to check-in for from your phone.
    * an appointment that you are too early to check-in for from your phone.
    * an appointment that isn't eligible for online check-in.
* Is there anything you would like to be able to do or see on this page that currently isn't available?
  * Why?
* Have you ever had a virtual (video or phone) appointment?
  * Would you expect or not expect virtual appointments to be a part of this check-in experience?
* Is there anything on this page that isn't useful to you? You would be ok if it was removed.
  * Why?
* Have you ever scheduled an appointment on VA.gov?
  * If so, what you do think about this appointment list versus your experience with VA online scheduling?

**Confirmation page**
* What are your thoughts about this page?
* Is there anything missing?
* What would you do next?
  * If you don't know where to go, then what would you prefer to do next call or talk to a staff member?
    * What if the phone number was for the main VA call center? 
* [Make sure they close their prototype before asking this question] You have now checked in for one appointment. Pretend your next appointment isn't for another few hours. Describe to me how you would check-in for your next appointment.
  * _Observe if they want to click the link again, if they text "check in" again, or if they try to bring up the confirmation page._

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
* Now that you've seen the whole experience, what are your impressions of the experience?
* If you could change one thing about the experience, what would it be? 
* Do you have any other thoughts on what we talked about today?
* Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on check-in and make sure it really works for Veterans, so thank you for your time.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
