When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about checking in for medical appointment at the VA.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take no longer than an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We want to hear your thoughts on a possible new way to let your doctor know that you have arrived for your appointment. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* During this session, we'll be doing two things:
  * First, I'll start by asking you a few questions about your past experiences.
  * For the second half of the session, I'll send you a link to a prototype that one of our teams created to explain a new way to let your doctor know that you have arrived. 
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Now, Iâ€™m going to ask you to think about your very last medical appointment that you actually went to the VA facility for.

* Can you describe checking in for that medical appointment?
  * Overall, how would you describe that experience? Was it a good or bad experience? Easy or hard?
    * What did you like about it?
    * What did you not like about it?
* You checked in via [the method they mentioned in the previous question], but is that the method that you use most often?
  * _Clarify options available only if necessary._ This could be using the kiosk, talking directly with VA staff, using text messaging , or how your access virtual appointments.
* Have you ever had a check-in experience go wrong at the VA?
  * If so, can you share what happened?

## Usability - 30 minutes

Alright, I want you to pretend that you have a VA medical appointment today. You have just arrived at the location of your appointment and you see the following sign hanging on the wall. 

[Screenshare poster](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/mvp-usability/check-in-collateral-usabilityTest.pdf)

**Poster**
  * Can you explain to me what we're looking at here?
  * What are your thoughts about what the poster is asking you to do?
  * Is there anything missing?

Seeing this poster, what would you do next? 

At this point, I would like you to share your screen, so we can watch you complete the task mentioned on the poster. [Only prompt them if need be in order to complete check-in.]

Things to watch for:

* Were they able to successfully complete the task?
* Were there any points of confusion?
* Were there any comments about jumping from a text message to a website?
* Did they expect to see any additional information on their contact info/insurance, appointment, or confirmation pages?

Now, I'm going to have you go back through check-in again. This time I'll ask you some questions at each point in the process.

**Text Message**
* Would you make any changes to this text messaging portion of check-in?
* What do you think about starting in a text message, then finishing check-in on va.gov?

**Contact/insurance**
* Is this what you were expecting?
* Can you explain to me what we're looking at?
* Is there anything missing?

**Your appointment**
* Is this what you were expecting?
* Can you explain to me what we're looking at?
* Is there anything missing?

**Confirmation page**
* Is this what you were expecting?
* Is there anything missing?
* What would you do next?


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
* Now that you've seen the whole experience, what are your impressions of the experience?
* What wording would you want the initial poster and webpages to use?
  * let us know you're here
  * check-in
  * something else
  * I don't have a preference
* If you could change one thing about the experience, what would it be? 
* Do you have any other thoughts on what we talked about today?
* Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on check-in and make sure it really works for Veterans, so thank you for your time.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
