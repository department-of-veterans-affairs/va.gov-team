# Patient Check In Conversation Guide for Travel Reimbursement MVP Remote Usability Test - Prototype-Tasks for B & C, Starting with Prototype B

Last modified: August 4, 2022

## Moderator Logistics 

### 2-3 Days Before the Session 

- Review VA Platform’s [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions). 
- Perigean will send you the login instructions for using Zoom accounts for user research. The first time you use their account you will need to coordinate with Perigean on 2FA. 

### Day of the Session 

- After logging in, you will be logged in as a presenter. Be sure to enter your name. 
- Mute your Slack notifications. 
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/observer-guidelines) to your observers. (Slackbot will do this for you if you type “observer instructions” into #feedback-backchannel.)  

### Starting the Session 

- In the Participant “More” menu, make sure “Play Join and Leave Sound” is unchecked.
- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except for the participant is on mute.  
- Keep observers in the waiting room to ask the participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell the observers to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to the participant when they are admitted to the session.
 
## Intro - 5 Minutes 

Hello and thank you for joining today. My name is Ben. How are you doing today? 

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes. 

Today I'm going to ask you to do some specific tasks using a website, which is actually a prototype, that I will share with you in a few moments. 

Before we start, I want to go over a few things: 

- **First, I have some other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I wanted to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with letting them in for this session? 
     - *If “no,” ask the observers to leave the Zoom via Slack.*
     - *If “yes,” let other observers into the room.* 
          - And, here are some other members from our team. My team members, please say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth and mute your audio, that would be great. 
- **So, this session should take about an hour, probably a little less.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task. 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers. We are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We’re testing a website to learn how we can make it easier to use for Veterans. I welcome any and all of your feedback and I won’t be offended by opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason, and at any time, you want to stop this session, please let me know.**
- **Lastly, are you comfortable if I record this session today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, but the recordings are deleted after we complete the analysis. Also, none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. So, is it okay to record? 

Great. Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Okay, I’m going to start recording now.   

*Start recording. Select “record to cloud” so that the recordings are saved to Perigean’s account.* 

I have started recording. Once again, are you comfortable if I record this session today? 

## Warm-Up Questions - 1 Minute

So, before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions. 

- What kind of device are you using for this session today? E.g., smartphone, desktop computer, etc. 
- And, what brand or operating system is it?  
- Have you been to a VA health care facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 12 months? 
- Have you ever used your mobile device to check in for a medical appointment? 
- Have you ever filed or received payment for a travel reimbursement claim for a VA medical appointment?  

Great. Thank you. 

## Prototype-Tasks for B & C, Starting with Prototype B - 30 Minutes 

### Screen Sharing Instructions 

*Paste [Prototype B link](https://www.sketch.com/s/e79a827e-42cf-4a82-b554-874c75b5c70e/prototype/a/E032CDED-B46C-437E-8592-D47A595CB4DD) in the Zoom chat.*

*Use this [guide](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-screen-recording-set-up) if you encounter problems with participants not being able to record their screen.*

Now, I’d like to be able to see your screen. Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me? 

Great. If there’s any apps or notifications on your device that you’d like to turn off or close, I’ll give you a moment to do that now. 

So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.  

Please tap the screen anywhere. And, as you tap the screen you will see a menu appear at the bottom of the screen. In that menu, tap "Share Content." Then, tap "Screen." Then, tap "Start Broadcast." Now, tap anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen, which starts with "Everything on your screen." Perfect. 

Now, I have sent you a message in the Zoom chat that contains a link to the first prototype that I'd like for you to review. Let's go ahead and find that link. So, please tap anywhere on the white part of the screen. And, as you tap the screen you will see the menu appear again at the bottom of the screen. In that menu, tap "More," which is furthest on the right. Once you've tapped "More," you should see a list of options. Please tap the first option, which is "Chat." Please tap on the link to open it. Perfect. 

Now, you should see my video in a window that’s overtop of your screen. If you could, please swipe that window towards the right of your screen so it is hidden out of view. That’s perfect. 

Finally, in the upper right corner of the page, please tap the three dots. And from that list, please tap "Full Screen." Perfect. We're all set.

### Exit Strategy

Well, I am so sorry, but it seems like we are having trouble with the screen sharing today. I apologize for the inconvenience, but unfortunately it’s needed for our session. 

So, I want to thank you for your time today, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a great rest of your day.  

### Prototype-Tasks

So, this is a “somewhat-interactive” prototype that you’ll be reviewing today. You’ll be able to tap the buttons, such as Continue, Yes or No, Back to Last Screen and read through the information on the screen. However, you won’t be able to use your keyboard to type in your information, for example. And, some of the information, such as your mailing address or contact information will not be correct. But, this prototype should give you an overall idea of how the check in process works for a medical appointment. 

So, today I’m going to be asking you to do some specific tasks using this prototype. However, I’m going to be starting and stopping you to provide specific instructions and ask you questions along the way. Does that sound okay?  

Great. Now, this is the first page of the check in experience, which requires Veterans to authenticate with their last name and date of birth. Please tap the “continue” button to advance. 

Great. Now, for the next three pages, read through the information and tap “yes” to advance once you’ve reviewed. And, as you’re reviewing these next three pages, please talk aloud so that you share what you’re thinking and what, if anything, you’re unsure about before advancing to the next page.  

*The participant should be on the page “Are all of the following true?” page.*

Now, on this page, as you’re reviewing, I would like you to talk aloud as much as possible so that you share what you’re thinking and what, if anything, you’re unsure about before advancing to the next page. Please start reviewing, but remember, don’t advance to the next page.   

How would you rate the difficulty of understanding the question you’re being asked on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is easy and 5 is difficult?  

Why did you choose this rating? 

In a real life situation, how much time do you think you would need to be able to answer this question on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is longer and 5 is quicker. 

Why did you choose this rating? 

Now, please tap “yes” to advance. 

On this page, read through the information and tap “check in now” for either appointment to advance once you’ve reviewed. 

*The participant should be on the confirmation page.*   

Again, on this page, as you’re reviewing, I would like you to talk aloud as much as possible so that you share what you’re thinking and what, if anything, you’re unsure about before. Please start reviewing. 

This is the last page of the check in experience. Could you tell me if this is what you expected to see? 

Is there anything unclear to you? 

What would you like to change or add? 

How would you rate how well this page met your expectations based on how you responded to the questions on the previous pages on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is does not meet your expectations and 5 is does meet your expectation? 

Why did you choose this rating? 

And, how would you rate the difficulty of understanding the information on this page on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is easy and 5 is difficult?  

Why did you choose this rating? 

### Post-Task Questions

- Now, in thinking about all the pages you reviewed for checking in to an appointment, could you tell me if this is what you expected to see? 
- Was there anything unclear to you? 
- What would you like to change or add? 

### Tasks for Alternative Path 

Now, I’d like you to scroll to the top of the page and tap on the red banner.

This has taken us back to the beginning. 

Now, what I’d like for you to do is tap “Continue” on this authentication page and answer “yes” to the next three questions, which will place you on the page asking the question, “Are all of the following true?” Please go there now. 

*The participant should be on the “Are all of the following true?” page.*

Now, instead of tapping “yes” to this question, please tap “no.”  

Please go ahead and tap “check in now” for either appointment to advance to the next page.  

*The participant should be on the confirmation page.*

Now, again, on this page, as you’re reviewing, I would like you to talk aloud as much as possible so that you share what you’re thinking and what, if anything, you’re unsure about before. Please start reviewing.

So, again, this is the last page of the check in experience. Could you tell me if this is what you expected to see as a result of changing your answer to "no" to filing a travel reimbursement claim? 

Is there anything unclear to you? 

What would you like to change or add? 

How would you rate how well this page met your expectations based on how you responded to the questions on the previous pages on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is does not meet your expectations and 5 is does meet your expectation? 

Why did you choose this rating? 

And, how would you rate the difficulty of understanding the information on the page on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is easy and 5 is difficult?

### Switch to Prototype C 

*Paste [Prototype C link](https://www.sketch.com/s/e79a827e-42cf-4a82-b554-874c75b5c70e/prototype/a/E3C109B2-DA3E-46CD-8A98-52C09ADD1944) in the Zoom chat.*

Now, I have another prototype for you to review that has some slight differences. Could you find the chat in Zoom and click on the link that I sent to you? 

Great, now let's place it in full screen. If you look in the upper right corner of the page, please tap the three dots. And from that list, please tap "Full Screen." Perfect. We're all set.

Great. Now, one more time, let’s tap “Continue” on this authentication page and answer “yes” to the next three questions, which will place you on the page leading with the question, “Is this statement true for you?” Please go there now. 

*The participant should be on the “Is this statement true for you?” page.*

Now, we’ve made some changes here compared to the first prototype. So, as you’re reviewing, I would like you to talk aloud as much as possible so that you share what you’re thinking and what, if anything, you’re unsure about before advancing to the next page. Please start reviewing, but remember, don’t advance to the next page yet.        

How would you rate the difficulty of understanding the question you’re being asked on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is easy and 5 is difficult?  

Why did you choose this rating? 

In a real life situation, how much time do you think you would need to be able to answer this question on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is longer and 5 is quicker. 

Why did you choose this rating? 

Now, please tap “yes” to advance. 

Same thing here, please start reviewing, but remember, don’t advance to the next page yet.

Great. You’ve reached the last page again.  

### Post-Task Questions

- Did you think this prototype was any easier or more difficult to complete compared to the first prototype? Why or why not? 
- Do you prefer one prototype over the other? Why or why not? 
- What differences, if any, did you notice in this prototype compared to the first one?  

## Closing - 2 Minutes

Great. Well, that is all the questions I have for you today. Is there anything else that we haven’t talked about that you’d like to share with me?  

Great. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work in the patient check in experience and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Before we end this session, I have three additional questions for you about the set up of this session. I’ll ask the observers to leave the session at this time. 

*Allow observers to leave.*

- Would you say that you were mostly nervous or mostly comfortable with having observers in this session? 
- Sometimes we have the additional observers already in the session when you join, instead of how we did it today. When I asked you for consent before the observers joined this session, did you appreciate that or did you feel that was mostly unnecessary? 
- Thinking about the brief introductions with the observers, did that make you feel at ease with them listening in or did it feel more awkward? 

Great. Well, thank you for your feedback and thank you again so much for joining us today. 

Have a great rest of your day.
