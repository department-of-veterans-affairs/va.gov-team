# Patient Check In Research Plan for Travel Reimbursement MVP Remote Usability Test

Last modified: August 4, 2022

## Background 

The Patient Check In (PCI) product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The Modernized Check-In Experience Team created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check in” through VA.gov. I.e., letting clinic staff know that the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 
     - Confirming their appointment
     - Reviewing their contact information 
     - Reviewing their emergency contact information
     - Reviewing their next of kin information 
     
- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment

### Travel Reimbursement 

In June 2022, the Beneficiary Travel Reimbursement Path Analysis Team completed an analysis of the travel reimbursement program, which included recommendations on improvements to the travel reimbursement experience for Veterans. One of those recommendations was to integrate travel reimbursement into the patient check in ecosystem. The following prototypes were created to communicate that workflow:

As a result of that work, the Modernized Check-In Experience Team [met with a total of 6 travel assistants and supervisors from travel offices located at VA Bay Pines Healthcare System and VA Texas Valley Health Care to gain further insights](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/discovery/travel-reimbursement) into the travel reimbursement process.

## Research Goals 

Our goals for this research are to gather feedback from Veterans in the following areas to inform the travel reimbursement MVP user experience:  

1. Determine if Veterans prefer to be asked if they’re interested (i.e., yes or no) in filing for travel reimbursement as a precursor to reviewing and confirming their eligibility and how that impacts overall app ease of use 
1. Measure the cognitive load when Veterans review and confirm their travel reimbursement eligibility within two prototypes  
1. Determine how easy it is to understand what to do next on the confirmation page in relation to travel reimbursement 

### Research Questions

1. Determine if Veterans prefer to be asked if they’re interested (i.e., yes or no) in filing for travel reimbursement as a precursor to reviewing and confirming their eligibility and how that impacts overall app ease of use 
     1. Do Veterans feel more grounded (and better prepared) when asked if they’re interested in filing for travel reimbursement as a precursor to reviewing and confirming their eligibility?  
     1. Do Veterans prefer being asked if they’re interested in filing as a precursor even if it increases the number of pages in the experience? 
     1. How well or not so well do each of the two prototypes seem to fit within the existing PCI userflow for the happy path? 
     1. How well or not so well do each of the two prototypes fit within the existing PCI userflow for the alternative paths (e.g., answering “no” to travel questions)? 
     1. Is it confusing to check in for an appointment and submit for travel pay at the same time?   
     1. Would knowing that VA checks your travel reimbursement eligibility after your claim is submitted deter you from still filing a claim within PCI?  

1. Measure the cognitive load when Veterans review and confirm their travel reimbursement eligibility within two prototypes    
     1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how much strain do Veterans experience (e.g., the time it takes to stop and figure out how to respond) when reviewing and confirming their travel reimbursement eligibility for each of the two prototypes?  
     1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how easy to use are each of the two prototypes for reviewing and confirming travel reimbursement eligibility?   

1. Determine how easy it is to understand what to do next on the confirmation page in relation to travel reimbursement 
     1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how easy is it to understand what to do next on the confirmation page for travel reimbursement for the happy path? 
     1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how easy is it to understand what to do next on the confirmation page for travel reimbursement for the alternate paths (e.g., answering “no” to travel questions)?  

### Hypothesis 

1. Determine if Veterans prefer to be asked if they’re interested (i.e., yes or no) in filing for travel reimbursement as a precursor to reviewing and confirming their eligibility and how that impacts overall app ease of use 
     1. Most Veterans prefer to see the eligibility information when being asked if they’d like to file for travel reimbursement, therefore prefer Prototype B over Prototype A.
     1. Most Veterans prefer engaging with fewer web pages, therefore prefer Prototype B over Prototype A. 
     1. Most Veterans will agree that travel pay is appropriately positioned within the PCI workflow. 
     1. Most Veterans will agree that including travel pay in PCI is logical. 
     1. Most Veterans will agree that including travel pay in PCI is valuable. 
     1. Most Veterans will not be deterred from filing a travel pay claim knowing that VA checks their eligibility after a claim is submitted.  
1. Measure the cognitive load when Veterans review and confirm their travel reimbursement eligibility within two prototypes    
     1. Most Veterans will think there is more mental strain when reviewing and confirming eligibility criteria on a single page, therefore prefer Prototype C over Prototype B. 
     1. Most Veterans will think it’s easier to review and confirm one eligibility criteria per page, therefore prefer Prototype C over Prototype B.  
1. Determine how easy it is to understand what to do next on the confirmation page in relation to travel reimbursement 
     1. Most Veterans will think the confirmation page for the happy path does a good job communicating that they’re checked in for their appointment and their travel pay claim was submitted successfully. 
     1. Most Veterans will not be surprised that their travel pay claim was not submitted for the alternative path, but agree that the confirmation page does a good job communicating that they’re checked in for their appointment and their travel pay claim was not submitted. 

## Method

This research will be conducted as a moderated usability study that utilizes non code-based prototypes fit for mobile devices. This method allows us to gather feedback at an early stage of development, while gathering it within an environment (i.e., mobile devices) that’s closest to how the product will be used. 

To avoid cognitive overload, half of the participants will engage in activities related to research goals #1 and #3, while the other half will engage in activities related to research goals #2 and #3:  

- Participant Group 1 - Goals #1 and #3
- Participant Group 2 - Goals #2 and #3

To ensure enough data is collected from both groups, we will alternate the group between each scheduled participant session. 

There will be a total of three prototypes created for the purposes of this research: 

- [Prototype A](https://www.sketch.com/s/e79a827e-42cf-4a82-b554-874c75b5c70e/prototype/a/19E0B04F-D95E-4CC1-B15A-543FF487AA3E) (“interested question”) pertains to research goals #1 and #3 
- [Prototype B](https://www.sketch.com/s/e79a827e-42cf-4a82-b554-874c75b5c70e/prototype/a/E032CDED-B46C-437E-8592-D47A595CB4DD) (“no interested question”) pertains to research goal #1, #2 and #3
- [Prototype C](https://www.sketch.com/s/e79a827e-42cf-4a82-b554-874c75b5c70e/prototype/a/E3C109B2-DA3E-46CD-8A98-52C09ADD1944) (“single-question flow”) pertains to research goals #2 and #3

The moderated usability studies will utilize the following high-level conversation guide: 

- Participant Group 1 
     - Introduction 
     - Provide Prototype A to participant (to avoid bias, rotate starting with Prototype A and B between each participant)
     - Ask follow up questions 
     - Provide Prototype B to participant 
     - Ask follow up questions 
     - Closing 

- Participant Group 2
     - Introduction 
     - Provide Prototype B to participant (to avoid bias, rotate starting with Prototype B and C between each participant)
     - Ask follow up questions 
     - Provide Prototype C to participant 
     - Ask follow up questions 
     - Closing
