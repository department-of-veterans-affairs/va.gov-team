# Research Goals

The patient check-in (PCI) product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The Modernized Check-In Experience Team created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check-in” through VA.gov. I.e., letting clinic staff know that the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

In June 2022, the Beneficiary Travel Reimbursement Path Analysis Team completed a review of the VA general health care travel reimbursement program, which included recommendations on improvements the Veteran experience. One of those recommendations was to integrate travel reimbursement into the patient check-in ecosystem. 

As a result of their work, the Modernized Check-In Experience Team began developing user flows and wireframes to visualize the integration and gather feedback from Veterans.

Our questions we're hoping to answer for this research are: 

1. Do Veterans prefer to be asked if they’re interested in filing for travel reimbursement as a precursor to reviewing and confirming their eligibility within PCI? 
1. Is it confusing to check in for an appointment and submit a travel reimbursement claim at the same time?
1. Does knowing that VA checks travel reimbursement and claim eligibility after a claim has been submitted deter Veterans from filing a travel reimbursement claim? 
1. What is the cognitive load required for Veterans when they review and confirm their travel reimbursement claim eligibility? 
1. How well or not so well do Veterans understand the status of their submitted claim or how to file a claim later on the PCI application’s confirmation page? 

# Methodology 

We conducted remote, moderated research sessions with 20 Veterans, which were split into two groups: 

**Group 1**

- Focused on answering the following questions: 

     - Do Veterans prefer to be asked if they’re interested in filing for travel reimbursement as a precursor to reviewing and confirming their eligibility within PCI? 
     - Is it confusing to check in for an appointment and submit a travel reimbursement claim at the same time?
     - Does knowing that VA checks travel reimbursement and claim eligibility after a claim has been submitted deter Veterans from filing a travel reimbursement claim? 

- Asked to complete tasks and provide feedback on the following prototypes: 

     - [Prototype A](https://www.sketch.com/s/38819fc4-18ef-4958-a330-a699785301d6/prototype/a/3A3BBB6C-17C3-44B9-87A0-7C6B35EED3A1)
     - [Prototype B](https://www.sketch.com/s/38819fc4-18ef-4958-a330-a699785301d6/prototype/a/79088E97-24E3-4453-99A2-2A982BA0D3FD) 

**Group 2**

- Focused on answering the following questions: 

     - What is the cognitive load required for Veterans when they review and confirm their travel reimbursement claim eligibility? 
     - How well or not so well do Veterans understand the status of their submitted claim or how to file a claim later on the PCI application’s confirmation page? 

- Asked to complete tasks and provide feedback on the following prototypes: 

     - [Prototype B](https://www.sketch.com/s/38819fc4-18ef-4958-a330-a699785301d6/prototype/a/79088E97-24E3-4453-99A2-2A982BA0D3FD) 
     - [Prototype C](https://www.sketch.com/s/38819fc4-18ef-4958-a330-a699785301d6/prototype/a/E31FD129-23BD-4CF3-AE44-8B1D88533FC6)

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Most Veterans prefer to be asked if they’re interested in filing for travel reimbursement as a precursor to reviewing and confirming their eligibility within PCI.
     1. DEFINITELY TRUE: Veterans preferred being asked first if they want to file a travel reimbursement claim before being presented with questions to review and confirm eligibility of a claim within the PCI application.      
1. It is not confusing to check in for an appointment and submit a travel reimbursement claim at the same time. 
     1. DEFINITELY TRUE: Veterans thought having the option to file a travel reimbursement claim while checking in for their appointment was easy and convenient.  
1. Knowing that VA checks travel reimbursement and claim eligibility after a claim has been submitted does not deter Veterans from filing a travel reimbursement claim.
     1. DEFINITELY TRUE: No, knowing that VA checks travel reimbursement and claim eligibility after a claim has been submitted does not stop Veterans from filing a claim. But Veterans felt that VA should already know if they’re eligible before allowing them to submit a claim or, at minimum, provide information on how to find out if they’re eligible. 
1. The cognitive load required for Veterans when they review and confirm their travel reimbursement claim eligibility is very low.
     1. DEFINITELY TRUE: Veterans required a very low cognitive load to answer questions related to reviewing and confirming their travel reimbursement claim eligibility. Additionally, Veterans preferred being asked one eligibility question per page.  
1. Veterans easily understand the status of their submitted claim or how to file a claim later on the PCI application’s confirmation page. 
     1. LIKELY TRUE: Veterans thought the information about the status of their submitted claim or how to file a claim later was easy to understand, but expected more information about when and where to check the status of their claim, who to contact if they have questions and why their travel reimbursement claim couldn’t be submitted. 

# Key Findings

### 1. Veterans preferred being asked first if they want to file a travel reimbursement claim before being presented with questions to review and confirm eligibility of a claim within the PCI application.  

- Of 9 Veterans, 6 thought Prototype A was easier to complete, 1 thought Prototype B was easier to complete and 2 had no preference.
- Of 9 Veterans, 6 preferred Prototype A, 2 preferred Prototype B and 1 had no preference. 

### 2. Veterans thought having the option to file a travel reimbursement claim while checking in for their appointment was easy and convenient. 

- Of 9 Veterans, 6 had a positive sentiment, 2 had a neutral or mixed sentiment and 1 had a somewhat negative sentiment for checking in to an appointment and filing a travel reimbursement claim together.  

### 3. No, knowing that VA checks travel reimbursement and claim eligibility after a claim has been submitted does not stop Veterans from filing a claim. But Veterans felt that VA should already know if they’re eligible before allowing them to submit a claim or, at minimum, provide information on how to find out if they’re eligible. 

- Of 9 Veterans, 7 responded no, 1 responded yes and 1 responded with no response that knowing VA checks travel reimbursement and claim eligibility after a claim is submitted would not deter them from filing a travel reimbursement claim.

- 30 of 32 responses from 8 Veterans answered “5 - shorter amount of time” (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is a longer amount of time and 5 is a shorter amount of time) when asked how much time they would need to answer a question related to reviewing and confirming their travel reimbursement claim eligibility. 
- Of 7 Veterans, 2 thought Prototype C was easier to complete, 1 thought Prototype B was easier to complete and 4 had no preference. 
- Of 8 Veterans, 4 preferred Prototype C, 2 preferred Prototype B and 2 had no preference.

### 5. Veterans thought the information about the status of their submitted claim or how to file a claim later was easy to understand, but expected more information about when and where to check the status of their claim, who to contact if they have questions and why their travel reimbursement claim couldn’t be submitted. 

- 27 of 33 responses from 9 Veterans answered “1 - easy” (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is easy and 5 is difficult) when asked to rate the difficulty of understanding the information on the PCI application’s confirmation pages.

### 2. Veterans thought having the option to file a travel reimbursement claim while checking in for their appointment was easy and convenient. 

Of 9 Veterans, 6 had a positive sentiment, 2 had a neutral or mixed sentiment and 1 had a somewhat negative sentiment for checking in to an appointment and filing a travel reimbursement claim together.  

> “I like the idea a lot. When I leave the office after my check up, I like that idea of getting it all done right then and there.”

> “I really like the simplicity of the process with this. It's a one and done. I can do it while I'm checking in and I won't forget about it. For example, I still have claims from two weeks ago that I still have to put into the application [BTSSS]. But, I really need at least a good 20 minutes solid.”

> “Amazing. Nothing comes close to it currently.”

> “Very convenient and saves a lot of time. It's fantastic.”

> “It's an excellent concept because right now we can't do it. It's very simple and that's good. It's simpler than the kiosk system now.”

> “If I were at a medical center trying to do this, it would probably be a bit daunting when I can just go to the desk and check in. If it were a bit fewer steps and more clearly communicated on what's happening in this process, then it would probably be a bit better and it would be great.”

### 3. No, knowing that VA checks travel reimbursement and claim eligibility after a claim has been submitted does not stop Veterans from filing a claim. But Veterans felt that VA should already know if they’re eligible before allowing them to submit a claim or, at minimum, provide information on how to find out if they’re eligible. 

Of 9 Veterans, 7 responded no, 1 responded yes and 1 responded with no response that knowing VA checks travel reimbursement and claim eligibility after a claim is submitted would not deter them from filing a travel reimbursement claim.   

> “It wouldn't stop me, but I expect the VA to review my claim right now.”

> “No, because I know I've been authorized for it.”

> “I'm not quite sure what the actual requirements are for travel reimbursement. So, do you have to live outside a 30 mile radius of your attending VA or community care provider? So, maybe there could be some information about whether you qualify for reimbursement. Because if you go through all of this and don't qualify, then you go back to not having an answer as to why I don't get travel reimbursement.”

> “I don't know if I qualify for travel [reimbursement] or not. And, we have a lot of Veterans out there that are qualified, but they don't know they are. If I'm qualified for travel, the app should tell me I'm qualified for it and to file for it. If I'm not qualified for travel, will it still come up or is it set up to know if a Veteran is authorized for travel or not?”

> “If you're unsure if you're authorized for travel reimbursement, there should be something that says, “Click here.” Then, explain who is authorized to receive travel reimbursement.”

### 4. Veterans required a very low cognitive load to answer questions related to reviewing and confirming their travel reimbursement claim eligibility. Additionally, Veterans preferred being asked one eligibility question per page.  

30 of 32 responses from 8 Veterans answered “5 - shorter amount of time” (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is a longer amount of time and 5 is a shorter amount of time) when asked how much time they would need to answer a question related to reviewing and confirming their travel reimbursement claim eligibility.

*Note: One Veteran responded “1 - longer amount of time” to this question, but answered “5 - shorter amount of time” to the remaining questions in Prototype C.*

Of 7 Veterans, 2 thought Prototype C was easier to complete, 1 thought Prototype B was easier to complete and 4 had no preference. 

Of 8 Veterans, 4 preferred Prototype C, 2 preferred Prototype B and 2 had no preference.

### 5. Veterans thought the information about the status of their submitted claim or how to file a claim later was easy to understand, but expected more information about when and where to check the status of their claim, who to contact if they have questions and why their travel reimbursement claim couldn’t be submitted. 

27 of 33 responses from 9 Veterans answered “1 - easy” (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is easy and 5 is difficult) when asked to rate the difficulty of understanding the information on the PCI application’s confirmation pages. 

> “Since I asked them to do [a] travel [reimbursement claim], I would just have the question on how I would be updated. I guess by email.”

> “Who will send an update to me about my travel reimbursement [claim]? I know it's different people at the VA.”

> “How are you going to send me an update about my travel reimbursement? Is it by phone, email, text? When can I expect to hear back? Again, I still don't know if you are or if you aren't reviewing. What's the next step after that? Where are you sending me an update to? How will I know if it's submitted? What happens after the review process? It's not giving me any real information.”

> “Where are they sending the update about my travel reimbursement? Is it to my email? Or will they send me a text message? Other then that, it's very clear, but I just don't know where it's going. So here, it'd be nice to know where they are sending an update.” 

> “Usually at the VA if you can't file [on the kiosk], you go to the travel representative and fill out a form and give it to them. If the kiosk doesn't work, that's what I do. I might say, “Please see a travel representative for follow up.””

> “I guess it seems clear, but it doesn’t tell you why the benefit [claim] didn’t go through and I imagine when it says, “Ask the staff member,” they won't tell you why, but instead give you the [paper] form. I might be confused as to why it didn’t go through.”

# Additional Insights

### Veterans have experienced frustrations with VA general health care travel reimbursement

> “Currently, I have not been able to submit a travel claim online on my end. There’s some sort of glitch.”

> “I get kicked off. I’ll do some work to submit a travel reimbursement online, but it doesn’t save properly. There are too many errors within it. Sometimes I’ll click the button to submit and it doesn’t do anything at all. I’ll do that a couple times, cancel out, go back in and enter most of the information to only find out the next day that the claim was filed five times. And, I never have appointments in my travel app. I always have to screenshot the confirmation page from My HealtheVet that I attended the appointment.”  

> “I’ve sort of always felt it to be a headache to stop at the travel window on my way out considering I’m only 16 miles from the facility.” 

> “So, I have to fill out the paper because there’s some sort of glitch with submitting a claim online. So, I have absolutely no idea on if or when it was approved. I just have to guess.” 

> “We file travel reimbursement through a paper, but never receive any feedback on whether it's received or denied. I've sent in multiple travel reimbursements, but I've never received any travel reimbursement.”

### Veterans often wanted more information to be able to better answer questions, and more decisiveness

> “There are a lot of tolls in my area. That’s why it’s difficult [to answer].” 

> “Here in New York, some people have to take the toll road. How would we submit the receipts for our tolls since we have to pull the bill down, which probably wouldn’t be until the next month or so? I know that would be a question that would come about.” 

> “Some of my fellow Veterans might not understanding this [statement] because maybe their daughter brought them or friend of the family. So, maybe they can misconstrued this.” 

> “Will you have a question after if you selected, “No?” For example, did you take public transportation or private apps? I’ve seen a lot of people take Uber, Lift, taxi. It depends on their frailty and disability.” 

> “Maybe should put, “meals.” I know people that travel from Philadelphia to New York City for their appointments. And, I believe they [VA] cover their meals.” 

> “Saying, “We may be able to submit your claim for review today,” is confusing.” 

> “How do I know if you will or won’t? What am I doing this for if you, “may be able to file my claim today?” What’s the criteria for you to not be able to do it?” 

> “Well, it says, “We may be able to.” I don’t like to hear a doubt like that. That makes me think it might work or it might not work.” 

### Overall, Veterans thought the PCI application was streamlined and easy to use 

> “I think it’s better to see it in your own hands compared to relying on someone behind the scenes. [I.e., MSAs.] This makes it really clear what appointment you’re coming in for. I like seeing all of your appointments. Like, checking in at the [clinic] desk, you may not know you had all those appointments.” 

> “It streamlines everything.” 

> “I’m surprised at how streamlined it looks with the VA website and My HealtheVet. It actually reminded me a lot of My HealtheVet, which is easy to understand.” 

> “Overall, it’s very similar to the kiosks.” 

### Veterans asked about additional functionality 

<img width="1379" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-10 at 11 46 55 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101129355/194905602-4694d2ea-21eb-4961-affc-5c581a027366.png">
<img width="1379" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-10 at 11 47 03 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101129355/194905614-7c5e550a-250a-44d2-8446-9704e83c39d5.png">

# Recommendations

- Utilize a user flow that includes asking Veterans if they want to file a travel reimbursement claim before being presented with questions to review and confirm eligibility of a claim, and present them as one question per page.

<img width="1725" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-05 at 5 19 14 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101129355/194165879-adabc937-0770-4863-b0be-990467bc68e3.png">

- Include clear paths to information (or where to find relevant information) for Veterans to understand travel reimbursement and claim eligibility, without affecting the Veteran’s ability to easily complete checking in to their appointment. 

- Include clearer information on the application’s confirmation pages for Veterans to understand where to check the status of their claim (e.g., link to the AccessVA travel claim portal), who to contact if they have questions about their claim and why their travel reimbursement claim couldn’t be submitted. 

- Talk to the Travel Reimbursement Business and BTSSS API partners about finding a way to check a Veteran’s travel reimbursement eligibility prior to them submitting a claim and making that function available within the online travel reimbursement ecosystem. 

- Talk to the BTSSS API partners about expanding the API to support accepting more types of travel reimbursement claims beyond only mileage without other expenses. E.g., traveled from an address other than their home, tolls, meals, public transportation, etc.  

- Knowing that Veterans thought that having the option to file a travel reimbursement claim while checking in for their appointment was easy and convenient, talk to staff-facing application partners about adding travel reimbursement into VistA Scheduling Enhancements (VSE). 

- Include more information into travel reimbursement claim eligibility questions about common Veteran travel arrangements and trip types (e.g., tolls, meals, Uber, etc.) for Veterans to better understand the questions and feel more confident in their responses.

- Avoid using “we may be able to” phrasing in favor of more precise information. 

**For later down the road…**

- Include support for Veterans to file a travel reimbursement claim after their appointment through something like a post-visit SMS message for those opted in to receive messages from VEText. 

- Send Veterans a confirmation of their submitted claim through SMS that includes their claim number and where to check the status of their claim (e.g., AccessVA travel claim portal). 

- Review additional functionality that Veterans asked about with PCI product owners. E.g., estimated claim reimbursement dollar amount, health insurance confirmation, editing demographics, etc.
