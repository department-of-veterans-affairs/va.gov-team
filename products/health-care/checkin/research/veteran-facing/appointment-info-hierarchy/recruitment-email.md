# Outreach emails for Recruitment for Check-inâ€™s Unmoderated Appointment Information Survey

Subject: Participate in research with VA

Hello,

The VA.gov team at the Department of Veterans Affairs is conducting research to learn what appointment information, such as provider name or clinic address, is most important to you when checking in for a medical appointment or completing pre-check-in prior to your appointment.

We are looking for Veterans and caregivers who have been to a VA health care facility for a medical appointment for yourself or a Veteran that you care for in the last 12 months. You must also be interested in participating in an online survey to help us understand your preferences.

**What will I be doing in this survey?**

You will be sent a link to an online survey in which you'll see a list of appointment information, and you'll rank how important each is to you. You'll also be asked a few more short questions.

**How long is the survey?**

The survey should take you **about 10 minutes** to complete on your computer, tablet, or smartphone. You can do it whenever it's convenient for you.

**Interested in participating?** 

Please reply to this email to receive the survey link and a participation code. After completing the survey, we'll send you instructions on how to use your participant code to access your thank you gift card.
