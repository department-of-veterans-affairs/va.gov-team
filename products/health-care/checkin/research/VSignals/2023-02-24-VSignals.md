## Noteworthy Comments

**Waiting in line**

> Also why get rid of the kiosks? Now we're back to lines waiting for check-in while people socialize. 

**Travel reimbursement** 

> I have been unable to submit travel for two years! Around $2,000 owed. I've spent a couple hours every couple months to try to submit travel reqs. Enter all info, click submit, computer blinks, I'm back at My HealtheVet sign in!

>Having to go through your mileage claim online is very difficult. Can't it be done at the appointment check in? I have not bothered to claim mileage for over a year. 

> Make [travel] reimbursement an automatic action when we attend appointment. 

**Difficulty with QR codes**

> Not everyone has a [QR] code reader on their phone. 

> The QR code at the entrance for virtual checkin didn't work properly. It sent me to the wrong part of the VA website that was irrelevant to checkin. 

**Connection between PCI app and staff** 

> I did not like having to check in on my phone. The receptionist is just sitting there. Can't she check me in? Also, some of my info was incorrect and I had to have her fix it anyway. 

> Why is the new check in system not used? I checked into the VA using the online check in, went to my appointment. Never was called, spoke to receptionist, only to find out that no one uses that system. So why have it? 

> The staff at Goose Creek are outstanding. Helpful. There is a new check in procedure, and they showed us how to use it. 

**Knowing where to go (although, this is likely a kiosk comment**

> When I tried to check in, I answered all the questions only to be told I was at the wrong place, but there were no instructions as to what to do next. It seems that the system could be programmed to alert the patient they were wrong. 

**Increase PCI adoption to other clinic types**

> It would be good to check in on a cell phone when we arrive.
