## Noteworthy Comments

### Check-in specific: 
>
> I was able to check in via text and take care of my mileage request. This was very convenient and saved me a lot of time.
>
> I was able to check in online and go directly to the waiting area. I was in and out in about ten minutes which is record breaking time if you ask me.
>
> Check-in was simple (used the QR code) and making my follow up appointment was easy.
>
> The check-in process has significantly improved since last year. It was very easy. Thank you!
>
> I'm glad you got rid of the check-in machine at the door. It's so much nicer dealing with a friendly staff member for your appointment.
> 
> Appointment reminder postcard said I could check in with my phone. I did so and waited in the waiting room as instructed. Lucky for me, a nurse came by and asked who I was there for. I told her and she said the phone check-in does not work and she didn't understand why the card said it does. 
>
> It is preferred that we check in for our appointment with our phone. Which is great and would be easy if we had wifi in the building. I have to scan the qr code and walk outside or to the door to be able to check in.
>
> I am extremely grateful for the quality of healthcare I receive at this facility. My only suggestion is for the check-in process where you need to scan a code or text - there is no cell reception within the facility which makes this impossible, so you need to step up to one of the reception desks anyway.
>
> Check in has changed locations 4 different places this year getting hard to find!
>
> The check in process at the VA is constantly changing; take a number, use the kiosk, etc. Just decide on one and go with it. 
 
### Concerns we're already addressing:
>
> The travel reimbursement process at the VA is broken. The current web based or hard copy reimbursement request does not work. I have lost count of how many travel reimbursement requests I have submitted without action; around 10 at this point.
> 
> Put those iPads back in the lobby so we can check in and out and submit the travel pay.

### Possible future enhancements
>
> Reminder text did not provide room number. 
> 
> When checking in it would be nice to know if things are on time or running late.
>
> Service was great, but it would be better if instructions were provided to instruct people where exactly to go for their appointment, such as where the check-in desk is for certain specialty groups.
>
> Changes in VA medical accessibility (closing a facility, changing a phone number, or changing check in procedure) without informing staff or clients is harmful and possibly lethal. 
>
> Check in was more personable.
