# September 19, 2023 VSignals Summary

Created: September 19, 2023

This is an analysis of Veteran feedback from **August 7, 2023 - August 31, 2023**.

Feedback from Veterans is captured in VSignals. This report queries VSignals for comments that mention "check in" and "travel reimbursement." In this date range, there were a total of **688** comments. 

Beginning with the last few iterations, we've been very intentional about how we scored the feedback. For example, when reading "The lady at the check-in counter was great!" we didn't score that as positive feedback as it was more feedback on the employee than the actual process. When reading "Check-in was really efficient and quick" we did score that as positive feedback as it was describing the process. This intentionality caused a sharp decline in both good and bad total comments, as you'll see in the graphs below. However, it helps highlight the times when the feedback only focuses on the process itself rather than on an employee.

## Noteworthy Comments

- Check-in specific: 
> I really like the check in with my phone it makes things easier and quicker in my opinion.
> 
> I learned how to check in with my cell phone using the camera, the receptionist provided me help!
> 
> I have been receiving care at the [] facility 15 years plus. I have seen a significant change for the better in the check-in/check out process.
> 
> After check in electronically I'm not sure where to go... Electronically submitting travel claim is very good though.
> 
> Stop the requirement for digital/cellphone check in. 1. It didn't work for me. 2. It does not fit with the VA's policy of face to face concern for a veterans needs and health care. 3. Some poeple do not use or know how to use computer/robot technology.
> 
> I'd like to see the check in procedure go faster. If I tell you all my contact information is still the same please do not continue to ask me about it. New check in is frustrating.
 
- Concerns we're already addressing:
> When I was verifying my appointment I viewed my emergency contact and Nok info. Both need updated. One site stated personnel at clinic would help me update it. However, everyone I asked (appointment check in) told me they don't have access to that info to update it.
> 
> The new check in procedure does not allow me to apply for travel.
> 
> Notifications, both in text and sometimes in written notice, do not clearly identify what and where the appointments are of what they are for.
> 
> The check in phone system no longer worked on my phone. It did work previously on other appointments.

- Possible future enhancements
> An update if provider is running on time at check in.
> 
> My concern is checking in on the phone. The process was easy, but everything was not explained. If you want people to check in by phone, why not put everything on the phone.
> 
> Appointment reminders and the check-in process is inconsistent across VA appointments. For in-person check-ups, I receive a text and usually a phone call; however, for Mental Health appointments I receive a phone call to schedule it 6 months out then no further instructions on how to attend it.
