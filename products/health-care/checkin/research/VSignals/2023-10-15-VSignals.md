## Noteworthy Comments

### Check-in specific: 
> 
> Pre-check-in isn't working. Still have to re-check-in and answer the same questions.
> 
> The QR code check in system needs to work with every clinic instead of having to check in with some clinics and not with others so staff at some clinics do not have to stop working to check in patients. 
>
> I for one am glad the kiosks, and telephonic entrance and other check-in devices are gone. I am totally computer and cell phone literate, but I am cheap and use a very cheap Tracfone with limited minutes to waste.
>
> I was struggling pretty hard at the new kiosk check in. I couldn't really figure out how to text a number. It was so much simpler before." 
 
### Concerns we're already addressing:
>
> I travel 66 miles roundtrip each time I visit the VA. I have no idea how to request travel reimbursement since the VA quit utilizing the kiosks. I have asked several people at the VA in Cape Coral. Nobody knows the answer. Bring back the kiosks!
> 
> Add travel reimbursement forms.
>
> I recommend clerks ask patients if they want to file a travel voucher as they check out each time (quick 5 second review lets the administrative member know if this applies). I went three years without applying for that benefit, because nobody ever mentioned it when checking in/out until a couple months ago when one individual asked me and explained the benefit. Please help you Vets with this.

### Possible future enhancements
>
> The constant verification of my home address, etc. is very annoying. It seems to get asked every time one checks in both through the text link when confirming an appointment and then again when you physically show up and check in. Seems stupid and I will stop completing the verification online when I have a physical appointment. 
> 
> When checking in it would be nice to know if things are on time or running late.
>
> Have staff inform a patient waiting past their appointment time why and perhaps how long the wait will be. 
>
> I did not know where to go after I checked in. The check in just leaves you hanging without additional instructions. I did ask the man at the desk, however and he looked it up.
>
> Since we are already checking in through texting and smartphones, why not have an inside-the-medical-facility (or even from the parking lot) type of GPS that would guide you to the proper waiting area and to your appointments from one place to another, including the floor the appointment is on?
