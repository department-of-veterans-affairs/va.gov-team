## Noteworthy Comments

### Check-in specific: 
>
> The feature where you complete the check-in to the clinic and submit a travel claim all at the same time is exceptionally customer-friendly. Keep up the great work VA. 
>
> I'm extremely pleased with the new online check-in process. It's a great idea and it was seamless, efficient, and effective. I'm especially pleased and glad that the travel reimbursement claim process was effectively part of the check-in process.
>
> I checked in early and barely sat down when they called me back for my blood work. It's usually 10 or 15 minutes which is still faster than any civilian doctor.
>
> I used the text check-in when I arrived but it was unclear to me if I also needed to physically check in with the receptionist. It would be helpful for the text check-in notification to specify if further check-in with the receptionist is required.
>
> I checked in twice on my phone as instructed. I arrived at the clinic 1/2 hour early; at 15 minutes past my appt time, I went to the desk to see what was the delay. I was told you have to check in at the desk for an x-ray. The previous week I did not have to check in for a CAT scan, which what I was told is different. Why is this not noted on the text message?
>
> The amount of pre-check-in contacts is confusing. I did the pre-check-in on the 2nd ask to do so. On another day, a text msg arrived. I took it to mean to pre-check in again and dismissed it. I arrived at 12:25 for my 13:00 appt and the front desk person asked if I checked in online. I said I did the pre-check-in a couple of days earlier. As a result, my team did not know I arrived for the appointment. 
 
### Concerns we're already addressing:
>
> I was not asked if I was eligible for travel pay for my hearing test. Good thing I know how to apply for it on the website, but it concerns me for the older Veterans.
> 
> Checked in at desk, walked over to where my dr office is, and checked in at that window and was told I was late and a no-show. My appt was at 8:30. I checked in at 8:30. Go to the window where no one was. When I saw a lady there at 8:37 she told me I was a no-show to my scheduled appt. After driving 45 min this is really bad service.
>
> My appointment was canceled without informing me. I was not able to reschedule my appointment for at least 5 weeks.

### Possible future enhancements
>
> Signs, signs, SIGNS everywhere! 
> 
> Stop sending the message to the patient's phone to check in when you arrive. When I check in ahead of time from the parking lot, they call me at the check-in inside the building. The last time I checked in by phone the working staff was upset at me and told me not to check in by phone anymore.
