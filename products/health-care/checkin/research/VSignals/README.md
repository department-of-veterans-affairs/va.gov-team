# Biweekly Process for Analyzing VSignals Feedback

1. Ben Brasso will e-mail the VSignals team (Mahdi Blaine at mahdi.blaine@va.gov) on the Monday before a sprint ends to get two weeks worth of VSignals reports.
2. Before the new sprint starts, Ben Brasso will copy two weeks of comments into our aggregated spreadsheet, which is available on OneDrive.
    1. The VSignals reports that we receive are a query from all VSignals feedback containing the words check-in and/or travel pay.
    2. If you need access to the OneDrive document and do not have it, message Ben.
    3. Once the comments are copied, Ben will message the check-in team member completing this week’s analysis.
3. The check-in team member completing the analysis will open the Excel spreadsheet and review each comment.
    1.  The comment categories and general guidelines for determining if a comments applies are as follows:
        1. Mobile CI - Good and Mobile CI - Bad
        2. General Check-in - Good and General Check-in - Bad
            1. General check-in feedback includes any comments where the methods used to check-in can’t be determined or any comment generally referring to the “new” check-in process. With the “new” comments, it can’t be determined if they are referring to just the removal of the kiosk, checking in with staff, or using mobile check-in. This section also gathers any feedback about the overall process, such as “Check-in was great.”
        3. Kiosk - Good and Kiosk - Bad
            1. Comments about wanting the kiosk back for check-in and/or travel pay were counted in the "Kiosk Good" comment total. Most bad comments were about the kiosks being broken.
        4. Staff Attitude - Good and Staff Attitude - Bad
        5. Travel Pay - Good and Travel Pay - Bad
        6. General Appointment Feedback
        7. Wait Times - Good and Wait Times - Bad
    2. If a comment applies to a category, then mark a 1 across from the comment in the corresponding category column. Leave the column blank if the comment doesn't apply.
        2. If a new category is needed, it can be added as a new column.
5. Next, calculate the percentage of comments for each category out of the total comments within the 2 week reporting period. (Sample formulas can be viewed in Row 2978.)
    1. After completing the calculations, copy the last mm-dd-yyyyTrends tab. Name the new tab with the new date, then copy the percentage calculations into the table at the top of this new trends tab.
    2. You can now create a series of 2D line with markers graphs that show the percentage across the different reporting periods.
    3. Export the graphs, so they are ready to add to your final report.
6. Calculate the number of comments within each category for each day of the 2 week reporting period. (Sample formulas can be viewed in Rows 2979 - 2994.)
    1. You can now created a series of 2D line with markers graphs that show the total comments for each day in the reporting period.
    2. Export the graphs, so they are ready to add to your final report.
7. Create a summary report on GitHub
    1. Look to [this previous summary as a guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/VSignals/2022-12-23-VSignals.md).
    2. Make sure to include a summary of the General Appointment Feedback comments as that category isn't part of the graphs created.
    3. Also, create a list of 2 - 3 Key Insights from this analysis. For instance, have any numbers changed greatly from the last reports? 
6. Post the summary on GitHub within this folder.
    1. File format: yyyy-mm-dd-VSignals.md
7. Post a link to the GitHub summary on the #check-in-experience channel. Tag Shawn Adams in the post.

## Process followed prior to Dec. 2022

1. Ben Brasso will e-mail the VSignals team (Mahdi Blaine at mahdi.blaine@va.gov) on the Monday before a sprint ends to get two weeks worth of VSignals reports.
2. Before the new sprint starts, Ben Brasso will copy two weeks of comments into our aggregated spreadsheet, which is available on OneDrive.
    1. The VSignals reports that we receive are a query from all VSignals feedback containing the word check-in.
    2. If you need access to the OneDrive document and do not have it, message Ben.
    3. Once the comments are copied, Ben will message the check-in team member completing this week’s analysis.
3. The check-in team member completing analysis will open the Excel spreadsheet in the desktop app.
    1. Opening the spreadsheet in the desktop app will enable the multi-select dropdown tagging capability. The web app does not have this capability.
4. The check-in team member completing analysis will review each comment.
    1.  First, they will categorize each comment using the dropdown.
        1. **At least one category from the green list of tags must be selected for each comment.** Yellow tags are secondary options. View the "Tags" sheet to see which tags are green and yellow.
        2. If a new category is needed, it can be added to the “Tags” sheet. Once added, it will automatically populate in the synthesis sheet. Be sure to decide if the new category is meets the criteria for a green (primary category, where at least one must be selected) or yellow (secondary optional category) tag.
    2. If a summary or note is needed about a particular comment, then it can be added to the “Notes” column.
5. Create a quick summary report
    1. Look to [this previous summary as a guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/VSignals/2022-09-VSignals.md).
6. Post the summary on GitHub within this folder.
    1. File format: yyyy-mm-dd-VSignals.md
7. Post a link to the GitHub summary on the #check-in-experience channel. Tag Shawn Adams in the post.

*We need to still talk to Research Ops about adding these summaries to the research repo and the process that will involve. They want us to help create a taxonomy for the tags associated with VSignals summaries.*
