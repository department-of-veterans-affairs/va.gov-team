# August 21, 2023 VSignals Summary

Created: August 21, 2023

This is an analysis of Veteran feedback from **July 16, 2023 - August 6, 2023**.

Feedback from Veterans is captured in VSignals. This report queries VSignals for comments that mention "check in" and "travel reimbursement." In this date range, there were a total of **545** comments. 

Beginning in the previous iteration, we've been very intentional about how we scored the feedback. For example, when reading "The lady at the check-in counter was great!" we didn't score that as positive feedback as it was more feedback on the employee than the actual process. When reading "Check-in was really efficient and quick" we did score that as positive feedback as it was describing the process. This intentionality caused a sharp decline in both good and bad total comments, as you'll see in the graphs below. However, it helps highlight the times when the feedback only focuses on the process itself rather than on an employee.

## Noteworthy Comments

> "I checked into my appointment using the app as recommended. I sat until about 10 minutes before my scheduled appointment and decided to check in at the receptionist to be sure they knew I was there. It turns out, according to the receptionist that just using the app was not sufficient. I needed to check in with receptionist. The app needs work."

> I have problems with the automated check in process, after I scan the QR code, I'm supposed to receive a link, I receive something but whatever comes, it does not open, I do it a couple of times, nothing, I just got to my appropriate appointment. I know it's not supposed to work like that.

> Upon arrival, was asked if I had checked in online. The VA has contacted me daily with a remember of my appointment, but no mention of checking in online. The receptionist then made it a point to point out the QR code on the poster right in front of her window, and repeat 3 more times that I can check in online. She realized that I didn't have a cell phone, and grudgingingly checked me in.

> I really liked the check in procedure using my cell phone.
