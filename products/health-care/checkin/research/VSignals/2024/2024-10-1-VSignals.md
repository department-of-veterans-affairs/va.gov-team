## Noteworthy Comments

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> I received a computer generated checkin message which i completed and said check in was complete but offered no instructions about where to go.I finally walked down to the regular checkin desk and was told the computer checkin was useless and she checked me in and told me to go back too where I had been waiting. MAKE YOUR COMPUTER CHECKIN FOR THE MOBILE CLINIC REFLECT REAL LIFE.<br>

> I used Text system to check in for my appointment. After waiting for approximately thirty minutes I checked with the desk clerk and I was informed they didn't use the system. It's time to Get on board or notify veterans automated can not be used!!<br>
*- Durham VA Medical Center, NC (558)*

> I was at my appointment twenty minutes prior and as I got to the door I received a text to check in ! So I completed it and it said I was checked in ! I sat there for almost an hour so I go up to the desk and the man gets short with me ! Pissed me off.Ten minutes later he sid hey twice and ask me my name and then tells me I am not checked in ! and I told him what I had done with the text check in<br>
*- Sacramento VA Medical Center, CA (612A4)*

> The IT department needs to fix the automated check in at the Clinic 1 &2 .
I CHECKED IN FOR MY 9:20 Am Appointment at 8:30 AM, I SAT WAITING FOR MY NAME TO BE CALLED UNTIL 10:30AM. GUESS WHAT? THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM DOES NOT TALK TO THE CLINIC. AS A RESULT I AM SITTING WAITING . IF I HADN,T CHECKED TO SEE WHY I HAD NOT BEEN CALLED. I WOULD STILL BE SITTING THERE WAITING.<br>

**Trouble navigating larger facilities**

> My appointment with Urology clinic did not include any specific location. Urology has two locations on different floors. I followed directions obtained by Ambassador and went to the wrong floor for my type visit. I checked in via Kiosk clueless about the mixup. 20 minutes past my appointment time, I inquired at the desk and they quickly sent me to the correct floor and the person there called my PA to alert them that I was there and what happened. An hour later, I was seen but only after I again had to make my presence known. VERY POOR PROCESS.<br>
*- Tucson VA Medical Center, AZ (678)*

> Upon arriving to front of bldg 4A, the front door was locked.  There are no signs posted to provide clear instructions on how to enter the bldg.  Once checked in by kiosk, I took a seat.  There were no further instructions from the two ladies seated at the front desk.  I eventually after 5 minutes passed my appointment time, asked a different lady at the front desk to please verify if I am located at the correct place.<br>
*- Central Alabama VA Medical Center-Montgomery, AL (619)*

> Please add Rheumatology signs in the facility. The staff provided directions upon entry, but having signs would help. The only Rheumatology mention is on a printed paper by the dermatology check-in counter. It should be mentioned this was my first visit.<br>
*- Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VA Medical Center, GA (508)*

> The only thing I could see/suggest is the question of where to check in... two floors, both 'identical' in appearance, both check in desks look the same....( no Floor number near the check in folks.... ) But they direct me to the proper floor check in... But then, when you come back out..... there is no Floor level evident, good thing there are 'stairs'... going up or down.. that helps one know..<br>
*- Roseburg VA Medical Center, OR (653)*

> I suggest emphasizing there are 2 different building locations/addresses as I arrived, waited 10 mins to check in just to find out I was at the wrong place and the other buidling was a few miles away which made me 20 mins late to appt, they almost had to reschedule me. I realize we are given an address, however months later most just enter "Loveland VA" into GPS, not realizing theres 2 locations.<br>
*- Cheyenne VA Medical Center, WY (442)*

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

> I am recently retired from the Marine Corps and relatively new to the VA Health Care System. My appointment on Sep 26 was a sleep medicine appointment, referred by my PCM at the Rock Hill Clinic.  We drove ~1.5 hrs for the appointment and upon check-in, I was told that the provider was not in that day.  The nurse who saw me was from pulmonology.  Although she was very nice, it appeared the only thing she did was download data from my CPAP machine and put in an order for replacement supplies.  When I informed her that I am not sleeping well, she seemed surprised and was unable to address my concerns.  In total, I spent about 10 mins in the appointment for a 3 hour round-trip.<br>

**Concerns with check in at kiosks**

> Please put the electronic kiosks for check-in and travel reimbursement back.  It is an aggravation to have to manually fill out the travel recommendation form for every visit when all of the information is already in the computer.  It is much easier and faster to complete the form electronically using the kiosks that used to be all over the hospital.  The kiosks also provided faster reimbursement for Veterans and causes more of an administrative burden to VAMC staff having to manually process every hand-written form.<br>
