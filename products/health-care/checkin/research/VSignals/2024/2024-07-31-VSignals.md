*- Carl Vinson Veterans' Administration Medical Center, GA (557)*

Thank you so much.<br>
*- Nashville VA Medical Center, TN (626)*

> I was in and out in no time. The new way using my phone to check-in was fast and easy I like it.  The nurse that took my blood was very good, I did not feel the needle go into my arm.<br>
*- Lebanon VA Medical Center, PA (595)*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> I arrived early for my 0800 appt. Lobby area was open, no one was at the counter (no issue).
I saw the self check-in sign and attempted to check in. QR code is a great idea! 
However, it didn't actually check me in, even after answering ALOT of questions.
The only way I saw the Dr. was because he came looking for me after seeing that I had attempted to check in but it was not complete.
Fix this!<br>
*- Omaha VA Medical Center, NE (636)*


> After all the text messages to check in on line,,and I did,,I walked up to the reception and check in with the staff and they said the online check in didn’t register me in so there is a glitch with it and wanted to pass that on to you…<br>
*- C.W. Bill Young Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (516)*


> The digital check in does not always do what it is designed for. You still have to check in at the counter every time. I stopped doing the electronic check in because it was not worthwhile!<br>
*- Fort Harrison VA Medical Center, MT (436)*


> Despite successfully checking in online, I waited nearly an hour passed my appointment time before being called. When I checked with the front desk, she told me that it been happening frequently lately.<br>
*- C.W. Bill Young Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (516)*


> I checked in online so when I arrived I sat in the lobby of Foxtrot. After some time I approached the window to verify that I was checked in. I was told that you have to approach the window in order to check in at Foxtrot. As a recommendation I think that patients should be aware of this condition. Also there are 2 check in windows, but when you reach Foxtrot it only looks like one. A bit confusin<br>
*- Biloxi VA Medical Center, MS (520)*


> I checked in for my appointment using the new online service. I even went up to the desk to make sure I was checked in. Was told I was and was directed to the waiting area to be called into the back. An hour goes by and they ask when my appointment was for. I replied an hour ago, but have been waiting patiently. Just to be told I was marked as a no show. Now I have to wait till DECEMBER!<br>
*- W.G. (Bill) Hefner Salisbury Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, NC (659)*


> After checking in at ~1240 for my 1245 appointment, I wasted an additional ~30 minutes waiting because i thought i was checked in, but apparently that procedure was incomplete due to no fault of my own.   My Dr was available the whole time.  That is the First time that's happened to me at VA.<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*


> I checked in online five minutes early, waited 20 minutes then left. I figure they overlooked the appointment. I WAS ONLINE AND I DID WAIT 20 MINUTES.<br>
*- Biloxi VA Medical Center, MS (520)*


> I checked-in online through an email I received. I was told by the person at the check-in desk that checking-in online doesn't work, i have to do it in person.  Why provide the option to check-in online if it doesn't work?<br>
*- Biloxi VA Medical Center, MS (520)*


**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> My appointment 7/29/24 @ 08:30 was cancelled due to pcp illness.  I was not notified until checking in at the clinic.  That meant I drove an hour roundtrip in morning rush hour traffic.  While rescheduling was fortunately easy it meant changing my plans for another day.<br>
*- West Palm Beach VA Medical Center, FL (548)*


> I have had 2 appointments Cancelled by Behavioral Health. No notice of either one Ahead of time. Showed up Both times. Checked in and was told they were cancelled.<br>
*- Harlingen VA Clinic, TX (740)*


> Set up appointment for blood draw get email text and mail notifications of appointment time and date but when check in time they have no appointment and need to set up appointment why is that and how does their system not have my appointment in it ?<br>
*- Richard L. Roudebush Veterans' Administration Medical Center, IN (583)*


> My original appointment was on the 19 of July. When I arrived to check in I was told the appointment had been canceled. I was never informed of the cancellation. And drove 70 mi + round trip wasting a morning.  Having problems finding the travel form to claim mileage ??<br>
*- San Francisco VA Medical Center, CA (662)*


> Had a appointment that got cancel within 15 minutes of my check in time. Had to reschedule because no other doctors were available to take me in. Turned out if I had kept that appointment I would not have had to wait 2 weeks to have my surgery.<br>
*- Robert J. Dole Department of Veterans Affairs Medical and Regional Office Center, KS (589A7)*


> I appreciate the care I’ve received at the Huntsville VA, but it has become my experience that my appointment is usually cancelled one or more times when I have an appointment to see Dr PII-NAME. Admittedly it is just for a general health check in, but when that happens I also have to reschedule the associated lab work.<br>
*- Birmingham VA Medical Center, AL (521)*


> My original eye exam was on 7/10, but was cancelled with the VA claiming they could not contact me. I was not contacted.  Then I received notice that it was changed to 7/11 without checking if that was okay with me. Then the VA called on 7/9 notifying me the Dr would not be in on the 11th and it was rescheduled for 7/30. Please contact me for the continuation as there is more and 400 characters is<br>
*- Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, OH (541)*


> The appointment that was made for my wellness check was made a year ago. It was cancelled 3 weeks before the appointment by voice mail. When I called to find out why it was cancelled, I was told "something came up". It seemed that the person did not want to help reschedule the appointment. She finally agreed and found one in August of 2024 that would work with my schedule.<br>
*- Tucson VA Medical Center, AZ (678)*


> I didn't know my appointment was cancelled until I received this survey.  I waited to get something in the mail, but never did.  I checked through myHealtheVet and saw that the appt was cancelled, but not rescheduled.<br>
*- Richard L. Roudebush Veterans' Administration Medical Center, IN (583)*


> this was a tele video visit, i didnt cancel, my provider failed to get on line, after 45 min. of waiting my wife called, receptionist very nice, checked into the situation, said provided had someone else in office, no other reason was given and a new appt was made .  we will see what happens july 11th. hope this explains i didnt cancel.<br>
*- Olin E. Teague Veterans' Center, TX (674)*


> Called to schedule an appointment.
Appointment confirmed via telephone.
Drove 30 miles to my appointment from my home.
Checked in and was told my provider was not here today.
Offered to receive a phone call from the provider in return for the frustration.<br>
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*


> My appointment were canceled because the Doctor called out. And know one called me to let me know.  I was there early waiting for my check in time. I didn't find out until I checked in.. Then the Lady at the window, ask did anyone called me... I had to reschedule...<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*


> In all the years I've been with the VA I have NOT canceled a scheduled healthcare appointment. The Doctor or the VA  has been the one to cancel all those appointments. It makes me mad. In Jan. I was in for a health concern, a rash. I had a appointment in April for a full check-up, VA canceled that.  July 3, I had a appointment, for health concerns the Doctor canceled that appointment.<br>
*- George E. Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, UT (660)*


**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> In the past...travel pay was done in an easy manner.....input into the kiosk...now we went backwards and must submit paperwork...please update your technology.<br>
*- Hampton VA Medical Center, VA (590)*


> Get a Travel Pay Kiosk that actually works.<br>
*- Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VA Medical Center, GA (508)*


> During my visit I noticed that a lot of the elderly patients had a hard time using the kiosk to sign in. They didn’t understand where to go and what they needed to do to get service. I saw at least three elderly patients getting really agitated while trying to get help.<br>
*- Kansas City VA Medical Center, MO (589)*


> The check-in kiosks frequently don't work.<br>
*- Wm. Jennings Bryan Dorn Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, SC (544)*


> Everything was very comfortable and efficient. I just prefer checking in at a kiosk.<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*


> The sign says to sign in at the kiosk...I had difficulty knowing where the kiosk was.  Recommend a sign that points out sign up kiosk.<br>
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*


> please put back the machines to check yourself in and
get travel pay it a long way to walk to get travel pay when you 
are old<br>
*- John J. Cochran Veterans Hospital, MO (657)*


> With the new kiosk system, there were a lot of disgruntled older Vets that were vocally unhappy with the change. I think its fine, but apparently there might have been an issue with the system spitting out correct numbers which caused the ruckus?<br>
*- Harlingen VA Clinic, TX (740)*


> New kiosk was very repetitive and no instructions good.<br>
*- Ralph H. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, SC (534)*


> You should not make the Kiosk the primary way to check in. Kiosk are not reliable, it time consuming and they often break down. Veteran waste time trying to use the Kiosk.<br>
*- Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, CA (664)*


> First visit, instructions not clear on check in machine.Lady at front desk (dark hair) had no identification and was very impatient with us, rolled her eyes at us as we were trying to figure out how to do things. Unfortunately she same person that drew my blood. She put the rubber band on extremely tight.Tightest I have ever had it done, it was very painful left bruising on my arm.<br>
*- Oklahoma City VA Medical Center, OK (635)*


> Bring back the travel kiosk.<br>
*- Biloxi VA Medical Center, MS (520)*


> Your travel pay kiosk was out of paper in the printer.  Therefore, I could not do my travel claim onsite.<br>
*- Carl Vinson Veterans' Administration Medical Center, GA (557)*


> I would recommend better labeling of the check-in kiosks as the first place to stop before getting in line for a window. One was kind of hidden behind a banner, and the screens weren't on or had timed out, so I didn't even notice them at first. Perhaps a stop sign poster or "stop here first" poster should be attached to the top of each.<br>
*- Nashville VA Medical Center, TN (626)*


**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**


> When I arrived for my 0730 appointment, no one was at the window for me to check-in.  All the signs said, lab patients had to check-in.  Recommend that someone be at the window for check-in or add signs that say "if check-in window is empty, lab patients can go directly to the lab".<br>
*- Oklahoma City VA Medical Center, OK (635)*


> RECEPTION BE ON TIME & READY TO GO & SERVE VETERANS;
NOT ARRIVING ON SET TIME; FIRST THEY NOTICED THAT THEY FIRST TURN ON THIER COMPUTORS; WAIST TIME CHECKING THIER E-MAILS; WHEN VETERANS WAITED 30 MINS. PRYER THIER APPOINTMENTS & WAITED ANOTHER 15 TO 20 MIN. TO CHECK-IN.<br>
*- Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, GA (509)*


> Check in is slow and filling out travel claims is ancient.  Kiodjs were expedient and much more efficient.  This visit was better than my previous, .s<br>
*- John J. Pershing Veterans' Administration Medical Center, MO (657A4)*


> I stood in line a long time to check in. I called to schedule a follow-up appointment because I got tired of waiting at the counter. The first time I called I was transferred and the called dropped after ringing 26 times. When I called again the tech made the appointment but refused to listen to my complaint. The service techs are often rude in person and on the phone and they do not return calls.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*


> When I found the liver clinic, I stood at the checkin counter for almost 10 minutes while the three women behind the counter were on thier cell phones. When one finally acknowledged me, she asked me to wait a minute while she finished what she was doing on her phone. Then gave me attitude like she was doing me a favor.<br>
*- Bruce W. Carter Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (546)*


> It took WAY to long to check in. I had two front desk ladies look at me as if I wasn't standing there. They can be very rude at times here in the Ventura office. I feel very disrespected as a veteran sometimes<br>
*- West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, CA (691)*


> Two of us had to wait at least five minutes to check in because there was no person at the window to assist us. We both felt this was odd and when the employee did show up, they looked frustrated.<br>
*- Robert J. Dole Department of Veterans Affairs Medical and Regional Office Center, KS (589A7)*
