## Noteworthy Comments

**Like PCI**

> It was a very good experience, it’s really nice to check in electronically and just have a seat in the waiting room.<br>
*- Baltimore VA Medical Center, MD (512)*

> When I arrived I checked in on my phone. Within minutes I was called back to see my provider.. Provider checked my eyes and I was finished within minutes. All my questions were answered.<br>
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> when i arrived for my appointment, i checked in online. i've been checking in online since va started the new check-in system a couple of years ago. apparently the front desk wasn't aware of my presence, and told me to check in at the desk. long story short, we should have to do one or the other...check in online or check in at the desk. frankly, i like checking in online.<br>
*- John J. Cochran Veterans Hospital, MO (657)*

> I checked in online and thought that was all I needed. I sat in waiting room for 20 minutes before I was asked if I needed to check in. Turns out I had to check in there. They saw me sitting there for 20 minutes and not a word was said to me. Could have asked me why I was there. I know I am not the brightest but......<br>
*- San Francisco VA Medical Center, CA (662)*

**Trouble navigating larger facilities**

> Had no clue where to check in. Went to dental clinic to check in and the lady walked me to the audiologist. There was a sign near the audiologist office that said to check in at room so l-and-so, well that door was closed and it was locked. The audiologist was great and I think she does a wonderful job.<br>
*- Louis A. Johnson Veterans' Administration Medical Center, WV (540)*

> I was not familiar with the VA and employees were taking me to wrong location within the building. The check-in desk, employees not helpful nor friendly.<br>
*- Lt. Col. Luke Weathers, Jr. VA Medical Center, TN (614)*

> Signage would be good to direct new persons coming in what to do next. Add signage that says check into at the kiosk first with a walk through of how that works. 
Labeling doors and waiting areas would also be good. Pointing and saying "over there" is not good direction. Both Perry Hill and Chantilly in Montgomery AL are confusing for a first timer. No signage, no arrows, just kind of wander abit.<br>
*- Central Alabama VA Medical Center-Montgomery, AL (619)*

> The text notification for this appt states to go to 2nd floor. At second floor check in I was told to go back to 1st floor to check in. 1st floor check in desk said not to go to 2nd floor for checking.
It's confusing. Apparently there are different types of therapies but appointment cards and text instruct to report to 2nd floor<br>
*- Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans' Hospital, TX (671)*

> The main VA building is huge.  If you go late in the day, you need to have a very good idea of where you are going.  Check in desks are closed and you end up looking in offices to find someone that can help.  I feel like I just stumbled on the MRI office.  Once I was there, they were very nice and professional.  Then going back to X-ray, it was the same way.  I suggest a kiosk to check-in.<br>
*- George E. Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, UT (660)*

> Where to go for the appointment wasn’t clear.  Across from the emergency room didn’t help.  The staff in the emergency room was very helpful.  
Staffing was very limited to one lady at the front checkout desk. 
No one at the check in desk.  I finally went over to the checkout lady to check in!
The staff executing the procedure was excellent and informative.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*

**Concerns with check in at kiosks**

> The veteran kiosk that helped veterans find their Appointment in the area they had to go to in the hospital has been removed. This was a great tool and made it very difficult for me to find a person to login the system to help me find my Appointment location recommend the veteran kiosk return back on.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*

> Previously it was possible to go to a Kiosk and check in.  Now at Bldg 5 you have to go to reception and wait in a long line to check in.  I saw about texting to a number and use "Check-in"  I am not good with cell phones so I am going to get someone to show me how to do that.  Then I will see if the check-in process via text is easy to use.<br>
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*

> When I arrive I check in with the front desk most of the time. If the provider sees me coming in from the window, they may come and let me in without checking in. So the appointment was met and had, but the check-in part was missed. There should be kiosks to scan our ID to let them know we have arrived. They were out during COVID, so why take them away? It was working perfectly.<br>
*- John D. Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, MI (553)*

> Doing travel on the internet is confusing and annoying. I have no idea why you got rid of the kiosks. Doing them by paper is better. Doing them on the computer/smartphone is confusing. We should not have to struggle to get what is owed us<br>
*- Hershel "Woody" Williams VA Medical Center, WV (581)*

> return the mileage kiosk to the waiting room<br>
*- Ioannis A. Lougaris Veterans' Administration Medical Center, NV (654)*

**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**

> Having to stand in line to check in. For those of us to have a hard time walking and standing. Sometimes the line is long and very hard for me to stand, waiting to check in.<br>
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*

> Long line waiting to check in.<br>
*- San Francisco VA Medical Center, CA (662)*

> the problem is with checking in at the desk. there make you wake to long .there do not look up to see if you are they to check in there are even talking to each other on the phone all at the same time or looking like there are on the comp.<br>
*- Michael E. DeBakey Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, TX (580)*

> Previously it was possible to go to a Kiosk and check in.  Now at Bldg 5 you have to go to reception and wait in a long line to check in.

*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*

> Upon entering the waiting and check-in area, I did not find anyone to check in with. There was a poster on the wall to use my phone to scan a QR. I did not know how to do that. Fortunately (as the clocked ticked towards my appointment time) there was a kind young woman who noticed that I was unsure of what to do. She graciously assisted me after she herself had to do the same checkin process.<br>
*- Portland VA Medical Center, OR (648)*
