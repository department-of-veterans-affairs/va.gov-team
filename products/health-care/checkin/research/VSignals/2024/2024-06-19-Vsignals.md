**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**


> I used online check-in but wait more than 20 mins; afterwards I moved to service desk and before asking I was called. Tech told me that check-in process not always work as intended because in my check-in was there but not the info of the Doc. I wait in X-Ray room while Tech was trying to unsuccessfully contact the Doc. Well, Tech made the procedure with same info I explained to Doc.<br>
*- Eurípides Rubio Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic*


> Electronic check-in needs to be shared or communicated with clerk at specified station. I have checked in electronically and would not have been attended to if I did not check-in physically after 30 minutes of waiting. Clerk mentioned they do not see nor are aware of patients who checked-in electronically based on the text patient received from the VA.<br>
*- Pensacola VA Clinic*


> If you checkin online, tue Cookeville facility still requites you to checkin in person.  That is beyond belief.<br>
*- Cookeville VA Clinic*


> I had a Radiology appointment and did the check in with the text message that I was sent. About 15 minutes after the appointment time I went up to the receptionist and told her that I had did the online check in and she informed me that radiology did not use the system. I was surprised since the week before I had used the system  to check in to Physical Therapy.<br>
*- Greenville VA Clinic*




**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> There should be explicit instructions, prominently displayed instructing vets to go to the kiosk in order to get there prescriptions. And the kiosk should be working, which it was not when I tried to get my prescription.<br>
*- Pensacola VA Clinic*


> Might not hurt to have a sign at the entrance reminding the veterans and/or caregivers to check in at front desk. The only reason I'm mentioning this is we were there for a blood draw and there was 4 of us and 3 of the people just sat down to wait for their name to be called. We were they only ones to check in. The volunteer that was there was great got people's names. Always feel well cared for.<br>
*- Golden VA Clinic*


> The sign for take a number was not pointing in the right direction. I could not find the numbers because I was looking for the paper ones. The kiosks were behind people and not visible and no sign stating where they were. It was all very confusing.<br>
*- Durham VA Medical Center*


> Left very frustrated, no signs/instructions on which window to check in & which window to pickup prescriptions. Several lines formed but none of us knew which window to use so it made a lot of people lose their place in line when we figured it out. We are all military & can follow directions well, but you have to post the directions for us to follow. RX fill was fast but overall bad experience.<br>
*- Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VA Medical Center*


> Should put sign for pharmacy check in on wall next to the waiting line<br>
*- Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*




**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> Regarding this June 5, 2024 appointment(s)... I had two scheduled appointments. One at 11:30 AM and another at 1:00 PM. My 11:30 AM Podiatry appointment is always "great.". But, when I returned to the front check-in/out desk area, I was advised that my 1:00 PM appointment was canceled. This was an inconvenience as I had scheduled a 2:30 PM pick-up from my ground transportation provider.<br>
*- Henrico County VA Clinic*


> I was a little overwhelmed with # of appt reminders, then had my appt cancelled 2 hours prior (virtual appt) due to Provider illness. I thought that I had done something wrong trying to check in for my appt.  I am not sure what to suggest, but it seemed that I got texts, emails & then a mailed reminder.<br>
*- Portsmouth VA Clinic*




**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> Bring back the â€œ Patient Check-In Kiosk â€ smooth check in  process.<br>
*- Hammond VA Clinic*


> The keyosk where you check in to the pharmacy is not like the others you check in at. It's black and hard to see if your standing next to it. Would you please make it like all the other  scan stations. Please mark it so it can be seen by the sight impaired. Thank you<br>
*- North Charleston VA Clinic*


> Although it took me around 6 years to navigate the VA system, I believe I now have world class medical care. I wish the VA would bring back the kiosk machines though to submit travel I fo. I have not submitted travel for two years now because I canâ€™t figure out how to.<br>
*- Washington VA Medical Center*


> Fix all the check in machines.<br>
*- Huntsville VA Clinic*


> Bring back the kiosks to check in.<br>
*- The Villages VA Clinic*




**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**


> For Monday mornings, should have more then one person doing check in, had a line going to the entrance and wait time almost 20 minutes.<br>
*- Cookeville VA Clinic*


> Wait time to check in was too long - 30 minutes.<br>
*- Cookeville VA Clinic*


> The morning was chaotic. Check-in stand was not operable leaving me guessing where I stood in the queue. After a few minutes of waiting I addresses my concerns with the tech who helped me but that pulled me back.<br>
*- West Los Angeles VA Medical Center*


> Entrance becomes congested with having to check in to see if there is an appointment, and delays getting to desired destination<br>
*- Clement J. Zablocki Veterans' Administration Medical Center*


> Wish they add a electronic check in station/ computer to speed up check in. People were lined up waiting to check in at the different stations.<br>
*- Leo C. Chase Jr. VA Clinic*


> I was told to be 15 minutes early for my appointment and I was number one in line to check in and had to wait 10 minutes to be served  And there were 3 people at the windows to serve us and nobody being served.<br>
*- Conroe VA Clinic*


> The line to the check-in window was long, but moved reasonably smoothly. The workers were friendly, business like, and thorough in their service.<br>
*- Cookeville VA Clinic*


> No one at check in window. Had to wait over 15 minutes!<br>
*- The Villages VA Clinic*
