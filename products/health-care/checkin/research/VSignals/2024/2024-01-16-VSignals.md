## Noteworthy Comments

**Positive feedback about online check in and travel reimbursement** 

> Also, I love the ability of check in and filing my travel voucher on my phone right after check in. 

> I used the online checkin prior to entering. It worked. Great new feature. 

> Also, for the first time ever at a VA appointment I could check in virtually and was immediately asked about my claim for travel. Bravo VIP clinic, but why isn't the rest of the VA hospital doing this? 

> I noticed that on this appointment, I was able to check in on my phone. I appreciate the ease of that instead of waiting on being called up because they always take so long. It would be nice to be able to claim my Travel Expense like the way it is available when I go to the VA Hospital for my appointments. [BT might have been turned off during this time period in eCheck-in.]

> The check in process combined with the travel reimbursement was very smooth and easy. 

> It was a great improvement being able to check in for my appointment on my phone instead of having to wait in line at the window like past experience. 

**Potential incorrect PCI clinic configuration**

> Please get the radiology department added to the mobile check in system. I was almost late b/c I checked in online using the link that was sent to me by the VA and my data didn't go on the reception staff. 

**Clinics not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> I checked in on my phone and still had to check in with the receptionist. 

> Do not prompt Veterans to check in electronically. I did so upon receiving the prompt on my phone and thought I was checked in, but was told by the nurse I could only check in at the desk. So what is the point of the electronic check in? It's confusing and an annoyance since it must be duplicated at the clinic check in desk. 

> Check in line is very long, also I did the digital check in from QR and VA rep stated I still had to wait in the line. That seems pretty redundant. 

> I got a notification to check in on my phone so I did. The phone notification said 15 min if not called within 15 minutes to report to front desk. I waited for 15 minutes and then went to the front desk. The person at the desk said you should have checked in to them. This contradicted with the phone process. 

> I used the new iPhone-based Check-in. After waiting a while, I noticed things were not going smoothly, so I did the in-person check-in only to find out I have to do the in-person check-in or the system doesn't work. 

**Trouble navigating facilities, specifically where to check in, which is where clinic information in VistA, if accurate, would be helpful to Veterans in appointment reminders and in PCI**

> Make it easier to find the areas of service. Finding the sleep study office was very difficult. When I first checked in, I was sent to another area to check in, only to be directed back to the original area of check in. I was then given very vague directions. Fortunately, after aimlessly wondering around, someone took the time to walk me to the area of service. 

> 30 minutes early to my scheduled appoint. No person manning the special care desk. [Went to] front desk check in and told to sit and wait. 15 min past my appointment I went to window to find out I was on the wrong floor. Went where I was told, was directed to 2nd floor and quickly found out I needed to be on the 4th floor. Was 25 min late for my appointment but am happy to hear that the specialist would still see me. 

> Enter building and check in on first floor. I was directed to check in again on the second floor for acupuncture, then check in again @ the acupuncture clinic on the first floor. I had no idea where the acupuncture clinic was located. 

> Better signs to let new Veterans know where to check in. 

> I appreciate the letters that state information on my appointment as to where and who my appointment is with. My issue is that when I forget my letter at home and I don't know who I'm supposed to see that day when I get there. I just know I'm supposed to be at the VA. I would like to see more information with the VA check in app or the appointment website. 

> Signs in the elevators are confusing as to which floor orthopedics is located. Says 4th floor where I checked in. No one told me I needed to be on the 3rd floor until I went back to the check in desk about 30 minutes later. 

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled by staff**

> I had an appointment on 3, Jan 2024 at 0930. When I check in for my appointment, I was informed the appointment was canceled that morning by the clinic. Should have received a call/text or something informing me so I didn't drive to the clinic. 

> I had an appointment set 3-4 months ago and I arrived 30 minutes prior to my scheduled time only to be told while trying to check in that my appointment was canceled. I wasn't made aware of until I wasted my time going to this [facility]. I was lied to by one of the secretaries that my number did not work. I had the secretary call me in my presence, only for my phone to work. 

**Lack of check in posters, posters with QR codes, or lack of awareness of online check in by Veteran or clinic** 

> The appointment check-in area needs an overhaul. If more than a few folks are waiting to check in, it's a bit of chaos, especially if the MSA's are on the phone helping others. 

> When I first arrived at the QR automated phone check in, it did not work for me and another patient and the gentleman behind the counter just ignored us then a medic came out and helped us both because the [redacted] behind the counter couldn't be bothered.
