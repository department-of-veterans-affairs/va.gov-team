## Noteworthy Comments

_E.g., not inclusive of all comments._

**Positive feedback about online check in, travel reimbursement and 45MR** 

> I also like being able to check-in for my appointment with my smart phone. 
*- Muncie VA Clinic*

>I am always impressed by the efficiency and professionalism in this facility. On-line check-in is a really good idea and seems to work very well!
*- David F. Winder VAMC*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> I like the new way of checking your appointment, on your smart phone when you arrive at the clinic. Only one concern, the clerks need to check their computer that you have already check in on your smart phone and you are there. 
*- El Paso VA Clinic*

> Electronic check in doesn't work at this location from VA.gov. Staff is oblivious that it exists or how to use it. Staff said I wasn't checked in, treated as a missed appointment and was made to wait hours. 
*- Birmingham VAMC*

> I checked in via text verified it with the check in person at 12:30 at appointment at 1 pm. 2:30 I checked with the office why I wasn't called in yet because I have another appointment at 3:30pm back home and was just told we don't know what happened had to reschedule. Wasted day traveling back and forth. 
*- John D. Dingell VAMC*

> The check in system is becoming very inefficient. I wait anywhere from 10-25 minutes past my appointment time every time I see the chiropractor. On this last visit, someone who check in after me was seen before me because the chiropractor had no idea I was there. 
*- Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow VA Clinic*

> My appointment was at 8 and I wasn't seen until 10:30. I used the internet check in system and no one there had access to it. So I checked-in in person 40 minutes late. 
*- Michael E. DeBakey VAMC*

> I like the check in by cell phone but one of the clinics did not register it. So I was late to my second appointment. 
*- William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans' Hospital*

> The VA online check-in service doesn't alert the physician/doctor that you have arrived and are checked in at the clinic. While it's a neat service, it has limitations to notify the clinic staff that you have arrived as noted in the system once check in. 
*- Seattle VAMC*

**Trouble navigating facilities, specifically where to check in and/or see their provider**

_End-to-end Veteran journey, e.g., feedback not isolated to PCI_

> Texts before appt were incorrect or incomplete. There was no sign for my clinic in the facility. Check-in was closed at my appt time. MyHealthevet has no better info. This is the same experience virtually every time I go. You need to tell patients PRECISELY where to go. 
*- Seattle VAMC*

> When I checked in at the kiosk... .I distinctly remember it saying PACT 4...but when I got upstairs everything was Pod A, B... I wasn't sure where my clinic was. Whatever language/code is used in the clinic should be on the screen. 
*- Kearny Mesa VA Clinic* 

> Very difficult to navigate where your appointment is. Appointment in one building but check in was in another. 
*- Carl Vinson VAMC*

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

> I called audiology the morning of my appt and was that my appt was canceled. This also occurred a few months ago when I had an appt with the Vet Service Officer, only I didn't find out until I got to Bldg 1 to check in, and then I was told it was canceled. The VA needs to be more proactive about letting patients know as soon as they know there's a problem !!
*- Coatesville VAMC*

> Had appt scheduled for 1400 on 3/22. When I arrived to check in I was informed the Dr. was out sick. Said they were unable to contact me. I had no messages or missed calls. 
*-William C. Tallent VAMC*

**Concerns with check in at kiosks**

> I checked in at the kiosk fifteen minutes prior to appointment time. An hour goes by, I finally went to the front desk to inquire. There was an issue with the check in system. Yet, no one bothered to come to the waiting area to call out if I was in attendance. At that point, most medical staff are at lunch. Little over two hours I'm being seen. 
*- Huntsville VA Clinic*

> I checked in at the kiosk, and got an indication that I was choked in for the appropriate appointment. After waiting 30 minutes, I checked at the desk and was told that I was NOT checked in. This wasted the doctor's time and mine. 
*- Wm. Jennings Bryan Dorn VAMC*

> Checkin kiosk malfunctioned was not checked in. 
*- Tucson VAMC*

> One issue I observed is the difficulty trying to use the kiosk machines. The majority of the people I witnessed using the kiosk had difficulty figuring out how to place their ID card. Also, two members were handicapped and could not bend down to insert their card. 
*- Goose Creek VA Clinic* 

> The check in kiosk in the physical therapy space does not always check patients in although the screen gives a confirmation. It may need to be serviced or updated. 
*- Kansas City VAMC*

**Facilities still using QR Codes, which shouldn't be used**

> The self check in with QRC code does not work at all!
*- Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans' Hospital*

**Conflicting instructions to Veterans in appointment reminders**

> I would like for the VA to get the check-in time messages together. One says be there 30 minutes early and the other one says 15 minutes early. 
*- Conroe VA Clinic*
