**Positive feedback about online check in, travel reimbursement and 45MR** 

> I like text check in and filing travel claim at the same time.  It is about time it wS easy to get the claim.<br>
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center*

> I arrived about 20-25 minutes before my scheduled appointment. I was able to check in online as soon as I arrived, and, as a result, the technician came out to take me to my procedure before actual scheduled time. In fact, I was finished with my scan before the actual scheduled time. I think this kind of efficiency that can be provided by the online check-in process may help some with the workflow<br>
*- Chattanooga VA Clinic*

> I was able to check in online before I arrived at the facility therefore enabling me to be seen early. Security guard friendly but made sure I was the named person on ID!<br>
*- Cambridge VA Clinic*

> I was able to check in electronically and saw the tech about 10 minutes after my appointment time. <br>
*- McAllen VA Clinic*

> I am happy with my experiences at VA San Jose Clinic. Everyone is helpful and it is easy to check in by phone.<br>
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center*

> New function to check in and apply for travel pay over smartphone is AWESOME. Folks working there were very professional and courteous.<br>
*- Kalispell VA Clinic*

> Online check-in was much appreciated and helped expedite the appointment. <br>
*- Palm Bay VA Clinic

> I like the way I can check in online., and always get seen quickly. Everyone is professional and friendly.<br>
*- Lee County VA Clinic*

> Being able to check in with my cell phone was new for me and I found it very convenient. Good move. And doing Travel Pay on the cell phone was very easy.  Another improvement in the way things can be handled.
*- Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Kettles VA Medical Center*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> Need to fix the text system that requests you check in online. After checking in online the text indicated I would receive a call when they were ready. After 15 mins of waiting, the clerk at the window told me the text system does not work and that I had not been checked in. Provider and her Nurse were great!<br>
*- New Braunfels VA Clinic*

> When I arrived at the complex, the VA. App sent me a text asking if I wanted to check in. One I was in the waiting area for my CT scan, I checked in via that link. After about 25 minutes of waiting, I went to the reception window. The male was rude, talked over me and told me that although I used the app to check in, they donâ€™t get that information and it wasnâ€™t his problem.<br>
*- Boise VA Medical Center*

> The online check in works most of the time but there have been instances where I checked in on my phone but the receptionist had no record of my checking in. As a result, my appointment was skipped and I ended up being a walk-in, having to wait an extra hour to be seen.  Additionally, this last time, April 25, I could not file for my travel.  It was the first time it would not accept it.<br>
*- Olin E. Teague Veterans' Center*

> I checked in online, but when I arrived to the clinic, I had to check in again at the desk. I waited at least 15 minutes to get checked in and the nurse brought me back to my appointment. It wasnâ€™t clearly laid out if I had to check in at the desk after checking in online<br>
*- Viera VA Clinic*

> 40 minutes prior to my appointment, I checked into the eye clinic using the text that was sent to my phone.  It reflected that I was checked into the clinic.  My appointment time arrived and I had not been seen.  I then ask the lady at the desk what the problem was. She informed me that the on line check in does not work in the eye clinic!  I then waited another 20 minutes to be seen for my appt.<br>
*- Durham VA Medical Center*

> Lab apt. was at 1400. I arrived by 1340 and received text as I got out of my vehicle asking if I wanted to check in. I followed the link in the text and checked in. ... So I got up to the lab and sat down waiting for a Lab Technician to call me forward. None ever did. I eventually hit the "Blood Draw" button and got a number. Then I was called forward. .. Why did I bother checking in?<br>
*- Omaha VA Medical Center*

> Twice now I have waited over 30 minutes past my appointment after using auto check in. I was told not to use auto check in when I have a nurse appointment. There is no indication of this issue when checking in.<br>
*- Lee County VA Clinic*

**Trouble navigating larger facilities, specifically, where to check in and find their provider (e.g., when the check-in station is not close to the clinic) or after completing eCheck-in, there’s limited information on how to find the clinic**

> Get proper rook identification, I had an appointment at room 250, and it was on the 3rd floor. Extremely confusing and frustrating going up and down halls and elevators to locate where I check in at.<br>
*- South Oklahoma City VA Clinic*

> Whenever I have to see the audio. and check in the kiosk always says wrong area. It has been doing this for months. It needs to be looked into<br>
*- Lance Corporal Dana Cornell Darnell VA Clinic*

> "When the appointment was first scheduled I was given directions to where in the building to go. When I arrived and tried to check in there I was directed to a different location. I'm a bit confused with follow on tests. I've been scheduled for a follow-up to a test that I haven't been scheduled for, let alone attended."<br>
*-Ioannis A. Lougaris Veterans' Administration Medical Center

> Navigating the hallways looking for a clinic with no signs for the department I was heading to (neurology in this case) made it harder than it needed to be to find the place to check in.<br>
*- Doris Miller Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center

> I remember when I first walked in not being sure which desk was the main check-in desk (if one of them actually is the main one). It could be a little more clear whether one counter is the main check-in desk or if you can check in/out at any counter.<br>
*- Massaponax VA Clinic

> Arived at the VA 10 minutes early. Everything that was on paper about  where to go and and what team he was assigned to had all changed. Trailers were locked, no clue where to go. Found a worker who took us from one check in desk to another until Dad's name came up, in new offices in the Spine center.  By then it was almost 2 pm so his appointment had to be rescheduled. Takes an hour to get there<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital*

> "I arrived at blood draw in the basement.When I got to the person to draw she told me that I was in the wrong place and that I needed to go to bldg 79.  I got up to leave, she told me to sit down and drew me, bitching the whole time that it was my fault. If the old check in sudses still in place none of this would have happened!  The new and improved replacements do not work and are not in place."<br>
*- Minneapolis VA Medical Center*

> So here I am again bringing up a complaint, had GI consult this morning 8am arrived 745am, after having gone to GI surgery department and redirected (no problem), green desk check in, redirected to Orange path, GI-Diabetes-Dermatology departments, first patient there, double checked in, waited 5-10 minutes, got weighed and blood pressure, waited thirty minutes watching other patients come and go<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center*

> After you check in there is no information about where to go in the building. I checked in, in the parking lot and had to figure it how to get to the clinic on my own. It was on the second floor but I was not told that it given a suite number.<br>
*- Henrico County VA Clinic*

> No signs for the Same Day Clinic at the Palo Alto clinic in Bldg 5. Had to ask for directions and check-in was at a different location. Very confusing. Once I got in treatment was fine.<br>
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center*

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

> "THis is the 2nd time the dental clinic canceled an appointment without letting me know and rebooking it without speaking to me first to see if the date and time was ok with ME THE PATIENT! Checking in is never easy at the dental clinic.  They want you to check in at audio and two days in a row nobody was there."<br>
*- Walzem VA Clinic*

**Concerns with check-in kiosks**
> I found the check-in kiosk easy and efficient to use! I don't like having to use my phone for everything so the kiosk was appreciated.<br>
*- Seattle VA Medical Center*

> Veterans travel payâ€¦.get kiosks back
*- Brockton VA Medical Center*

> Strongly recommend that the travel pay KIOSK SYSTEM be retained and be allowed to work in concert the online portal.<br>
*- Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans' Hospital*

> please bring back the self service kiosk. or turn on the self check-in before 8 am<br>
*- Springfield VA Clinic*

> Ring back kiosk to claim travel reimbursement.<br>
*- Viera VA Clinic*

> bring back the self kiosk many of senior do not have the ring phone then we have to walk all around the hospital to get paperwork for travel<br>
*- John J. Cochran Veterans Hospital*

> I feel the VA system needs to bring the kiosk back for check in, puttting in travel pay and check outs to avoid the veteran having to go to the travel section to turn in the forms for travel pay.  Another option would be to have the attending clinic assist/accept the travel pay forms for/from the veterans. forms<br>
*- Durham VA Medical Center

> Hello as an older veteran must of us do not have computer at home. I like to know why the kiosk card reader are taken out at the Colmery-O'Neil Veterans' Administration Medical Center. The Kansas City hospital still have theirs it makes so much easier to check-in and also claim travel pay. Can anyone help out with this situation. Why are we making it harder for Veterans claim there travel .<br>
*- Colmery-O'Neil Veterans' Administration Medical Center*

> Check in for the PT and OT departments might be better served with a kiosk check in like they do for the pharmacy.  The setup is rather awkward both the glass enclosed check in spot in the lobby, and the hazard taped off check out desk in the back.  Not sure why the printer is oddly located making the checking in and out staff get up and walk to a far location to retrieve scheduling paperwork .<br>
*- Vancouver VA Medical Center*

> Why was the kiosk check-in machine removed? I think it is much better using the machine than waiting in line for the next check-in representative.<br>
*- Seattle VA Medical Center*

> The KIOSK on 2nd Floor near gym was not working<br>
*- Augusta VA Medical Center-Uptown*

> The new kiosk check in is confusing. To get a ticket and wait for a window is not we are use to. I would like to personally check in at the kiosk and wait to be called as the old way. I had a bad experience with my provider so I got the change to transfer to a new one at my recent 4/29/2024 visitation. I still continue to go to this VA location because Dr. Chipchura is the best!<br>
*- Southwest Las Vegas VA Clinic*

> "The Kiosks needs signs above them stating the purpose of those kiosks. I had to ask clerks where to go. Which kiosks were the pharmacy kiosks. (I knocked on the door to the pharmacy, they told me i had to use the kiosks for pickup) Should say (Pharmacy Pick-up) above the two kiosks."<br>
*- Kearny Mesa VA Clinic*

> "Ticketing system is just a bakery tag.  What happened to the sign in kiosk and the board that showed what room to go to.  The clerk had to come get us from the waiting room.  Seems like this is going back in time 10 years. Phlebotomist was wonderful."<br>
*- Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans' Hospital*

> The kiosk machines do not always function properly, and because of that I was skipped and had to wait to be scene when having to go to lab for a blood draw last Monday.<br>
*- Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*

> When I arrived for my appointment I checked in on one of the kiosks and waited to be called. After waiting for over 30 min., I went to the window only to find out that the kiosk did not check me in. I then waited another 30 min. and then asked one of the lab techs how much longer it was going to be. When I finally called, I was told that the wait was due to being late.<br>
*- Huntsville VA Clinic*

> Put the check-in kiosk back in place so we can put our mileage in instead of having to use the BTSSS system which is overly complicated, or put it into the system that when a veteran checks into there appointment that is eligible for travel pay, that the system automatically puts the travel request in for the veteran.<br>
*- W.G. (Bill) Hefner Salisbury Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*

> Would really like the self check in kiosk to come back so convenient and no waiting.<br>
*- Twin Ports VA Clinic*

> Recently I applied for reimbursement. It was a problematic and ineffective process. I didnâ€™t receive anything from travel. Following up is even problematic. Bring back the kiosk. Itâ€™s simple, immediate and effective. Thank you.<br>
*- Hidden River VA Clinic*
