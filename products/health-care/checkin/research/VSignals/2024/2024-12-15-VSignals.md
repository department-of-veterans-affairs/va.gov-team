> I received text and updates on my appointment and completed the early check in on line and that made my visit extremely easy and fast. I was taken on my appointment time and was treated with courtesy and a warm welcome. The lab technician was very friendly and professional. I was extremely pleased with my visit. Thank you all.<br>

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**


> I checked in 2 minutes late, was told to go to waiting room which is normal. After waiting 45 minutes without being called I went to desk, the optician said "I called that name a million times." The person at the desk said "he checked in 5 minutes late."
I recommend 3 things: 1. The patient not be called until after they check in - otherwise what is the purpose of checking in.; 2. The patient's name be called for more than 2 minutes, or 5 minutes (not to quibble,) after appointment time.; 3. No banter between staff justifying why patient was left uncalled. The optician was apologetic, and did a very good job of serving me, no complaint other than the check in and follow up process.<br>
*- Clement J. Zablocki Veterans' Administration Medical Center, WI (695)*


> I checked in at the required time, for what ever reason I was not checked in. After people were seen before me that had later appointments I went to the front desk and asked if I was checked in was told that I was not checked, After I was checked in and seen was told that it was the systems fault, what ticked me off no one said they were sorry.<br>
*- Richard L. Roudebush Veterans' Administration Medical Center, IN (583)*


> When I went in for my labs, I saw a sign that said if you have a smart phone you can scan a barcode and sign yourself in. It didn't mention that my lab order would not be sent to labs, so I was waiting for about 30 minutes before I decided to double-check to see if I was checked in. That's when I was informed that I needed to come up to the window so that the clerk could send my order to lab.<br>
*- Overton Brooks Veterans' Administration Medical Center, LA (667)*


> This is the third time after checking in that my provider wasn't notified correctly that I was present and they came looking for me in the lobby because I never miss an appointment with them. Something with checking in isn't always working correctly<br>
*- Iowa City VA Medical Center, IA (636A8)*


> The e-check in system has tendency to not work, many times I've checked in electronically and still had to check in at the desk after I was told electronically I was checked in. It never get logged electronically. 
VA employees say it rarely works, fixing or ditch it.<br>
*- Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans' Hospital, TX (671)*


> I checked in 15 minutes before my appointment, but after waiting an hour and 15 minutes, I was told there was a glitch and was never checked in.  There shouldn’t be any glitches- I was either checked in at the front desk or I wasn’t and only found out by asking for an update an hour and 15 minutes later.<br>
*- Michael E. DeBakey Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, TX (580)*


> I checked in with my phone I waited for 25 minutes while others went back and had their blood drawn.  Finally a woman came out and asked me what I was waiting for and told me the phone app doesn't work to go to the window and check in.<br>
*- Hershel "Woody" Williams VA Medical Center, WV (581)*


> Text inquiring if we have arrived for our appt vs checking in at the counter.  I've inquired about having to check in at the counter and checking in via text.  Can't seem to get an answer as to why the systems are not talking to each other. Was told one section sees only certain information.  If it is not compatible, do not send Text out.<br>
*- Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans' Hospital, TX (671)*


> The mobile phone check in is iffy at best, most of the time it seems not to get to the check in personal and you have to personally check in to be sure you are in fact checked in, this could be a real time saving tool if it works, sometimes you get a confirmation,  sometimes you don't.<br>
*- West Palm Beach VA Medical Center, FL (548)*


> I received and completed an online check-in message. When I waited in the lobby, I found I had to check in again.<br>
*- Washington VA Medical Center, DC (688)*


> I checked in 10 minutes prior to appt. I wasn't called for the until 50 minutes. For some reason my name wasn't showing that I checked in. Had to check with receptionist twice.<br>
*- James H. Quillen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, TN (621)*


> After I checked in, it turned out that I wasn't checked in for my appointment after I was told that I was.<br>
*- C.W. Bill Young Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (516)*


> The check in process, apparently, did not work properly and my team claimed they didn’t know I was there.<br>
*- Richmond VA Medical Center, VA (652)*


> Check in person did not forward my arrival to hearing office<br>
*- James E. Van Zandt Veterans' Administration Medical Center, PA (503)*




**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> With all of the construction going on in the building, have a check in kiosk so we can verify where to go to our appointment.  I went from the basement to the 4th floor before I found out where my appointment was going to be. I have bad legs and was not sure if I was going to make it.  Front desk volunteers are nice, however they were of no help where to direct me to go.<br>
*- George E. Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, UT (660)*


> Trying to navigate through the VA website is a nightmare; the difficulty of even trying to get travel reimbursement is horrible compared to the ease that the in-house kiosk provided, you just made things worse and more complicated not better.<br>
*- Carl T. Hayden Veterans' Administration Medical Center, AZ (644)*


> The 5th floor signage could be clearer. I got to the 5th floor for my neurology appointment but couldn’t find a sign for neurology. I only saw two check-in areas on opposite sides of the floor. I went to one check-in area, and was standing in line when I asked a woman behind me if the check in line I was in was for neurology. She said it was for pulmonology, so I left and went to the other check in line.    The receptionist at that line told me that I had been in the correct line in the first place. That pulmonology and neurology shared a check in as well as other specialties. So I had to go back where I was and go to the end of the line. Some signage would be helpful. I’m not the only person that was confused.<br>
*- Carl T. Hayden Veterans' Administration Medical Center, AZ (644)*


> Please add signage to assist patients on where to check in. Presently, a 1st time visitor is only wondering and wandering.<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital, FL (673)*


> I wasn't sure where to go to check in. There should be a sign showing where one needs to go in order to check in.<br>
*- W.G. (Bill) Hefner Salisbury Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, NC (659)*




**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> Appointment cancelled which I did not learn until I was checking in.  Dr. Called in sick.<br>
*- Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans' Hospital, CA (605)*


> When our MEDICAL PROVIDER (Doctor) has a change in their schedule ( we the patient) SHOULD BE CONTACTED to RESCHEDULE!
I arrived and was told my “Doctor was attending a TRAINING CLASS) the check in person was a bit confused as to why I was Not Contacted?? I am THE PRIMARY care provider for my Handicapped daughter and I need to make arrangements for her to be cared for in advance!!  I take my health seriously and try to make ALL of my
VA appointments!!! PLEASE NOTE 
the young lady at check in was so nice
and got me a rescheduled date..<br>
*- Wilmington VA Medical Center, DE (460)*


> I had a scheduled appointment and was on time on my appointment and had checked in and was told that my appointment has been canceled.
I was not contacted ahead of time about the canceled appointment, if they did, a message was left on my answering machine at home but did not get a chance to get the message after the fact.<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*




**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> Automate Check-Ins and make Travel Pay easier to claim. The access website hasn't worked correctly in years, thus no travel pay for years other than *one time* I received a text asking me to check in and claim travel. Should put the Check-in/Check-out Computer Terminals back in, add Check-In/Check-out and Travel Claim as part of the app, and/or make sure the Check-In Texts actually work.. Better yet, do all 3.<br>
*- Jesse Brown Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, IL (537)*


> Wish they would bring back the kiosk for travel pay…we fill out the forms but don’t get reimbursed the last three trips we’ve made!<br>
*- Fargo VA Medical Center, ND (437)*




**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**


> Checking in for an appointment at that location is difficult as many times no one is around to check in with.<br>
*- Portland VA Medical Center, OR (648)*


> Previously, when I would arrive at the Ventura Clinic, there had been a long line of Veterans waiting to check in.  During my last two visits, the clerks are doing much better to get everyone checked in, the line is extremely much shorter, or no line at all! MUCH improvement!!<br>
*- West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, CA (691)*


> No one was at the desk when I came for my appointment. I called the numbers listed on the front to see if no one was present, but none (5 different numbers) answered. I called the operator, who did a page, and no one still came to the front to check me in. I waited 40 minutes. By this time another person came for his appointment, he called the number and someone finally answered; however, it was an additional 15 minutes before they came. Whoever was upfront left their purse on the back deck, so I knew someone had to be around. Whoever the woman was, she never appeared, and her purse was still on the back desk. The two gentlemen that waited on me were great and very kind.<br>
*- Washington VA Medical Center, DC (688)*


> Every time I checked into building 5 (I think) for chiropractic & physical therapy, I have to wait for a while & have long line during morning and afternoon time due to lack of representatives that work there<br>
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*


> Why tell patients to arrive 15 minutes early (I.e. 8am appointment) if NO ONE is at their desks to check you in until 8am sharp?
Employees are back behind the counter area before then, have one employee come out at 0745 to check people in for the 8am appointments.<br>
*- Marion VA Medical Center, IL (657A5)*


> Checking in at this clinic is still a concern. I have to pace back and forth in front of the long check in counter in hopes that someone looks up from their computer. I feel really bad for the older veterans with walkers and such having to go back and forth at the counter when they can barely walk! The signage that points to the other end of the desk is basically useless when NO ONE EVER LOOKS UP FROM THEIR COMPUTER. As to my actual appointment, Dawn is an absolute gem…never let her go!<br>
*- Tomah VA Medical Center, WI (676)*


> I was not able to check in the the lab on line and there wasn't anyone at the lab desk to check in. I had to ask one of the lab techs where to check in.<br>
*- Danville VA Medical Center, IL (550)*




**Too many notifications**


> So many text and calls reminding me about my appointment.  The worse one was worse one was the one 38 minutes prior to my appointment, while I am driving in was the text asking if I had checked in yet.  You are suppose to check in 15 minutes prior to appointment.  So why the distraction while driving 23 minutes before the check in time?<br>
*- Omaha VA Medical Center, NE (636)*
