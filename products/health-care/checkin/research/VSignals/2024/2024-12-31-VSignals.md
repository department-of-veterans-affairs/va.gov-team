## Noteworthy Comments
**Like PCI**


> A nice feature with some visits is the text to check in and being able to file for travel pay rather than filing out paperwork and mailing it in.<br>
*- Marion VA Medical Center, IN (610)*


> <br>


**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> It would be helpful if there were a sign telling the patient where to check in for an eye appointment.  It’s not obvious.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*


> It would be nice if we were given a location when we check in online.  Attach it to out appointment information so that we know where in the building to go.  1st floor 2nd floor west end or east end etc.<br>
*- Omaha VA Medical Center, NE (636)*


> During construction it was confusing to find where I was going to get there. I had to ask a staff to get where I needed to be.you need better signage for Vets to understand. During my last appt with audio hearing the check in office did not know what was happening back at the waiting area. Did not know we sat in the waiting area for 45 mins. He had a patient with him. But no explanation while sitting there.<br>
*- Bob Stump Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, AZ (649)*


> Be sure to put a sign out if you need to check in at another area.<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital, FL (673)*




**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> I arrived at my appointment on time. ( driving and parking, 40 minutes).  When I checked in, I was told my provider called in sick.  The clerk said she call and left a message.  I showed her the message.  All it said was”have a  nice day”<br>
*- Jack C. Montgomery Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, OK (623)*




**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> Please put the kiosk back, they have been gone since covid. They are much more convenient and faster.<br>
*- Lt. Col. Luke Weathers, Jr. VA Medical Center, TN (614)*


> Put the kiosk back in the facility.  It makes it easier for check in/out and travel too!  Thanks<br>
*- Durham VA Medical Center, NC (558)*




**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**

> The check in process needs to be improved. There is no type of queue or way to line up.  It is possibly the worst check in system I have ever experienced. It really make me wonder about the medical care sometimes if they cant even do this well.<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*


> I stood in line waiting for a little over 15 minutes with 6 other people. Waiting to check-in or check-out, while talking on the phone. There were also two more people who were in the back office looking in every few minutes.  We are always put on hold , so at least acknowledge the line. Or even apologize for the delay after.<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital, FL (673)*


> I would think all the check-in/check-out windows would be occupied. There was a que of people to check in but only one person at a window.  Three were standing behind the one sitting working talking to one another.<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital, FL (673)*


> Staff shortage and checking in was somewhat difficult<br>
*- Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center, PA (693)*
