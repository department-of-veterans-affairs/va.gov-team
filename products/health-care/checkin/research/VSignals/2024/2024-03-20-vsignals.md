## Noteworthy Comments

**Positive feedback about online check in, travel reimbursement and 45MR** 

> I'm glad we can finally apply for mileage reimbursement at time of check-in for an appointment. This is so great and saves a lot of time with paperwork and computer time. Great idea. 

> I like the texts received allowing me to check in via phone, and also to enter my travel reimbursement request. I hope it is expanded and used throughout the care system. 

> I liked receiving a link to virtually check in and that same link made it quick and simple to complete and submit a travel voucher. 

> The check in with phone is awesome!

> The text VA clinic checkin as soon as I arrive in the parking lot is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! As soon as I walked into the lobby, the nurse called my name... nothing was required... PERFECT. 

> I appreciate the text notification and the hyperlink to check-in attached. Most convenient. 

> I found the new check-in and travel claim process incredibly easy and hassle free. I received a text 30 minutes prior to my appointment and simply clicked on the link in the message when I entered the building, confirmed by information and just like that my check-in and travel claim were done!

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> When arriving for lab work we are asked to check in by text. We sit in the waiting area for a lengthy time only to find out that we need to check in in person. No one bothers to explain that. 

> I was called a day before my appointment to confirm, the person said I was checked in. When I arrived, I didn't check in, as I was told I was checked in. After a 10 minute wait everyone in the waiting area was seen, I then used the QR code on the wall to check in, when that didn't work, I spoke with the unpleasant {} at the desk. 

> I received a text to check in to my appointment. After following the instructions, there was a confirmation message that I was checked in and to wait until called, & if not called 15 minutes after my check in time to go let staff know. I waited until the 15 minutes elapsed from my appointment time. I notified staff, & they did not have me checked in. The text check in needs to be improved.

> Before I had even parked, my phone had a message that I was there and checked in. Once I got in the building the phone again prompted me to check in, so I did. I was informed I was checked in and so I sat and waited. 20 minutes after my appointment time, I still had not been called so I checked with the desk and was told I wasn't checked in because there is a problem with the phone check-in.

> I received a text message to link me to an electronic check-in. I used the electronic check-in and did not check in with the person at the desk. It appeared no one was watching the electronic check-in. I was not acknowledged until I contacted someone behind the glass.   

**Trouble navigating facilities, specifically where to check in, which is where clinic information in VistA, if accurate, would be helpful to Veterans in appointment reminders and in PCI**

> Show the direction how to get to the doctor.

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

> I was supposed to have an appointment on March 1, 2024, but when we arrived we were told there was no appointment for me on the schedule. The check-in clerk tried hard to get me an appointment and was able to schedule an appointment for me on March 14, 2024. I appreciate his efforts to reschedule me. 

> I scheduled an appointment with my healthcare facility and was told to check in at {} before 1 PM. I arrived there before 12 noon and was told the Dr was at lunch and wouldn't be back until 1 PM. I was also told that there was no appointment for me in the system. I told them that someone had dropped the ball on my appointment. 

> When I visited VA in West Palm Beach and waiting to check in the {} told me that they had canceled my appointments I drove 45 minutes to get there

**Concerns at Kiosk facilities**

> Kiosks seem to always have problems when checking in. Frustrating. 
*- North Charleston VA Clinic* 

> Kiosk for checking in not always working and for travel expense been down for a while. Need to fill form to do so otherwise okay. 
*- Brooklyn VA Medical Center*

**Clinics still using QR Codes**

> Please include the check-in QR code on the ground floor, or in the elevator, for your appointment. 
*- St. George VA Clinic*

**Interest in expansion of filing for travel via text**

> I could not check in via text so checked in via staff. But then could not put a travel claim in electronically and travel desk person had stepped away. Maybe have QR codes so Vet can scan to get link for the day.
