## Noteworthy Comments

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> I come in showing my appointment on my phone but still have to check in by the entrance even though I checked in on my phone.  Someone comes in with there letter and they go in. Why send me check in on my phone if I still need to check in<br>
*- Clement J. Zablocki Veterans' Administration Medical Center, WI (695)*

> I received a text to check in online. This check in asked for information, address, phone number, spouse information...cant remember if it asked for social. When I arrived I was told that the text check in does not send info to the clinic, and "no one knows where the info goes or who created and is responsible for the text". This is a massive concern if no one knows where this data is going.<br>
*- Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, GA (509)*

> I arrived a total of 15 minutes early to my appointment, upon walking in no one (out of the three employees that were seated) greeted me and I proceeded to use my cellphone to check in to my appointment due to the fact that the Kiosk, which was right in front of the television was inoperable (broke); I signed in successfully and patiently waited. I was never seen for my apt and told to reschedule.<br>
*- Tibor Rubin VA Medical Center, CA (600)*

**Trouble navigating larger facilities**

> I checked in the new part of the hotpital on ground floor.... was told to go upstairs and check in there ( By the elevators ) for my 2:45 PM appointment with urology. was then told to sit down and I would be called. Waited, Waited.  finally they called my name. The nurse said they thought that I was not there....found out that I was to had went down to the END OF THE HALL TO CHECK IN..!!!<br>
*- Omaha VA Medical Center, NE (636)*

> after arriving at the facility it was very difficult to find the correct place to check in. I used the kiosk to check  in and it told me I was in the wrong place when in fact it was the right place<br>
*- Ralph H. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, SC (534)*

> Direction to check in window not clearly marked.<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*

> I made the appt. in person at the General Surgery clinic; never told that I needed to report to the 9th floor for the appointment. Text message, email, and phone call all indicated it would be on the 2nd floor. I checked in at the kiosk because the 2nd-floor receptionists lack hospitality.  I waited 40 minutes because nothing said I was in the wrong spot & very late for the rest of my day.<br>
*- Kansas City VA Medical Center, MO (589)*

> After checking in at the first floor desk, it would be helpful if there were signs on the second floor showing which side  of the expansive floor that my provider would be on.<br>
*- Biloxi VA Medical Center, MS (520)*

> The experience could be more conducive to welcoming if there were a central location to check in and out at.  No one seemed to know where I was to go.  I went from person to person trying to find where my doctor was located, and finally found someone who worked in her office and took me to where I was supposed to check in.  I was 15 minutes late just trying to find out where I should go.<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*

> I got a bit of a run-around when I checked in. I checked in at Bldg 19 and was told to go across the street to Bldg 20.  When I got to Bldg 20, I was told I needed to be back in Bldg 19.  Back at Bldg 19, I was told I really needed to be back in Bldg 20. They gave me more detailed instructions and I found my appointment site.
No big thing.  I need the exercise anyway.<br>
*- Sacramento VA Medical Center, CA (612A4)*

> I was directed to the wrong location 2 times. First by the info person at the front door and then when I was allowed to check in on the wrong side. The person who called me kept calling me by the wrong first name and mocked me for correcting her. She disrespected me the whole time I was in her office telling me I was constantly wrong according to her statistic.<br>
*- Carl T. Hayden Veterans' Administration Medical Center, AZ (644)*

**Concerns with check in at kiosks**

> the kiosks that we could get information and appointments have been removed. they were very easy to use and are missed.<br>
*- W.G. (Bill) Hefner Salisbury Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, NC (659)*

> I think the former Kiosk system was a better way to check in for appointments<br>
*- Omaha VA Medical Center, NE (636)*

> Bring back the VA card check in machines.  Waited from 0755 to 0808 at the window of the dental clinic, due to another vet making a number of future appointments. With the card check in, the dental team would have know that I arrived on time for 0800 appointment.<br>
*- Seattle VA Medical Center, WA (663)*

> Please reinstate the check in machines travel pay machines<br>
*- Hampton VA Medical Center, VA (590)*

> Even though I checked in at the kiosk, the staff did not receive the message<br>
*- Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, CA (664)*

> Please restore kiosk for travel reimbursement.<br>
*- Jamaica Plain VA Medical Center, MA (523)*
