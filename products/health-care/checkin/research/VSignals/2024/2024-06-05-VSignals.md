## Noteworthy Comments

_E.g., not inclusive of all comments._

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**


> Delete the message in the appointment text that says you can check in via text or email. I talked to the receptionist about this. She said this method would not be seen unless she logged in. It’s best to either check in with her or the kiosk<br>
*- Samuel S. Stratton Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*


> Why get a text 45 minutes prior to appointment, if when you get to the Prime 6 window the clerk states the text is wrong our policy is you can only check in 30 minutes prior!<br>
*- Hampton VA Medical Center*


> When I arrived I checked in with my phone. I then waited 45 min for my appointment time, then another 15 min and I went up to the counter. They said they don't get notice if you check in on the phone, they thought I was a no show. I took another 30 min to see the doctor. (she is GREAT!!) Thanks<br>
*- Sacramento VA Medical Center*




**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> There are a *lot* of signs by the check-in ticket machine, and it's easy to overlook potentially critical information. My only feedback is a recommendation to streamline the signage to the most important, communally relevant, and necessary information.<br>
*- Austin VA Clinic*


> Better signs for where the PTSD check-in is. From the main elevator it's not clear the first time.<br>
*- Cincinnati VA Medical Center-Fort Thomas*


> Receptionist checking me in at Radiology make a rude comment behind my back after I got checked in. During check-in, I apologized for being a few minutes late as I was lost in building trying to find appointment location and she did not respond back but instead murmured to her co-worker, "It said RAD in front of appointment" as she slide the glass door closed while I was walking to waiting area.<br>
*- Ralph H. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*


> I was unaware of where to go. I went to the office area according to map, but kiosk said I was in wrong area and not where to go. I had to wait 8 min tohave a person tell me I needed to go to Mod 6. Why wasn't that in the mailer sent to me, or the email, or in the app? At least state what room appointments are.<br>
*- Ralph H. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*


> Post better signage saying where modules are and such in building. There were a couple of is circling looking for module 6. Then when signed in at kiosk we were in wrong waiting area and had to be ‘found’ for our appointment.<br>

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> I was sent a text and confirmed my appointment. I got a text saying my appointment was confirmed.  I drove an hour and 1/2 to my appointment even though it was storming outside.  I got to me appointment early. I went to check in at Cardio office and I was informed that my appointment had been cancelled. I was never told. The worker had less than zero concern, just told me to make another appt.<br>
*- Dallas VA Medical Center*


> Yes i have a concern. I was scheduled for a Dr. appt on May 3 at 2 pm supposedly to see Dr. PII_NAME  at the Panama City Bch VÁ Clinic I made arrangements to get there but when I arrived to check in they say my appt. Was cancelled. I asked why didn’t anyone try and contact me.The clerk didn’t have an answer why.I’m concerned because I need to physically see aDr every 6 mo. For certain medications<br>
*- Panama City Beach VA Clinic*


> I had an appointment scheduled for 5-6-2024 for a dermatology visit.  When I arrived to check in, I was informed that my appointment was cancelled.  Needless to say, I was angry and question what caused this.  I was told by an employee that the supervisor (Vaneice McClinton) was the culprit.  I got no explanation why I was cancelled, but they did some reshuffling got me in.  No more spaces remain.<br>
*- Tibor Rubin VA Medical Center*




**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> Please bring back the ability to submit a beneficiary travel claim on the check in kiosks. This will be a great help and make it so much faster and easier than using the website. Thank you.<br>
*- Tucson VA Medical Center*


> Replace inoperative kiosks with newer user friendly tools….<br>
*- Huntsville VA Clinic*


> It's hard to get your travel pay. I haven't doing  it seen you all took the kiosks out.<br>
*- Hershel "Woody" Williams VA Medical Center*


> Put VFW on the KIOSK<br>
*- Kansas City VA Medical Center*


> Since they took away travel reimbursement from the kiosk, I haven't been able to be compensated for my travel. I tried from inside the VA Martinez by completing the forms, that didn't work. I was told that we can complete from the myhealthvet website, but I didn't see where that can be completed. I also don't like the ideal that you only have 30 days to complete form.<br>
*- Martinez VA Medical Center*




**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**


> I was escorted to the pharmacy by a medic. The pharmacy kiosk was off due to the holiday. The window shades were down. I did not know if the pharmacy was open. However, I saw an individual through the blinds. I was about to go back to the medic when I heard my name being called. I was told the kiosk was off during after-hours and holidays.<br>
*- Fayetteville VA Medical Center*


> I drove 45 minutes one way from my house to the clinic in Conroe. I arrived 30 minutes before my appointment and it took over 10 minutes to checkin only to find out the Dr was not there. So another 10 minutes to reschedule.<br>
*- Conroe VA Clinic*


> Appointments can't be made in person and it took me 100 calls to make one.i have only been going here for 6months.but last two months is long waits to check in staff cuts leaves everybody scrambling and staff is not happy.its seems nobody likes to work there attitude of people has changed.<br>
*- Northport VA Medical Center*


> the services were great and the staff wonderful except for the staff that check in and check out. have to stand in line for excessive amount of time waiting for someone to do their job. always on the phone not helping in person patients<br>
*- Conroe VA Clinic*
