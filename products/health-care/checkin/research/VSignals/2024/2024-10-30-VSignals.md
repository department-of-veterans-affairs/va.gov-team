## Noteworthy Comments

**Like PCI**


> Had a great visit.  I checked in with my phone. Had my appointment and I was good to go. Thank you for good  visit and treatment.<br>
*- Robley Rex Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, KY (603)*


> When I arrived and checked in for my appointment, I was texted a travel link to confirm my arrival and desire to file a travel voucher. That a very convenient benefit to veterans and I so appreciated it. I strongly recommend that you make that available when veterans travel to the Veterans Hospital for treatment and or appointments in Washington DC. Because most of the time we have problems logging into the site to initiate a travel claim.<br>
*- Washington VA Medical Center, DC (688)*


> It was nice to check in and complete the travel claim.  Thank you<br>
*- Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans' Hospital, CA (605)*


> For the first time ever while checking in, I was prompted to request my travel reimbursement. It went incredibly smooth, an incredible easy, and great teacher to have.<br>
*- San Francisco VA Medical Center, CA (662)*


> It was easier to check in online versus the current process of taking a ticket, getting called to a window, then sitting.  It would be better to use the check in people for calk centers.<br>
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*


> Great service with additional text check in<br>
*- Jesse Brown Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, IL (537)*


> I arrived early, checked in online as well as confirming at the desk.  The doctor actually saw me before my scheduled appointment time.  Very happy.<br>
*- Tibor Rubin VA Medical Center, CA (600)*


> I like the way travel is being handled. I hear that it is going to be done by kiosk again.Either one works better than previous<br>
*- Fayetteville VA Medical Center, NC (565)*


> The check in option via cell phone is the best thing ever. You answer simple questions and then the dialogue tells you that you are checked in and will be seen soon. Much better than standing in line. I also like the day before reminders via text.
  For the first time in my 66 year history I was seen and out of my appointment BEFORE it was the actual appointment time.<br>
*- Michael E. DeBakey Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, TX (580)*


> I use the text ap to checkin.  It makes it easy and quick.<br>
*- Danville VA Medical Center, IL (550)*




**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**


> Make sure the check in portal actually checks in patient<br>
*- John J. Cochran Veterans Hospital, MO (657)*




**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> When scheduling my appointment, I was instructed to report to the clinic in the basement; however, when I arrived to my appointment, I saw a sign that told me to go to another building. I had to ask the welcome desk for instructions to the new location. Then, when I arrived at the new location, I checked in and learned that I was still not in the correct spot for my appointment. I was instructed to go to yet another location that I was unable to identify. As a result, the receptionist had to walk me to a different building to make sure I arrived at the correct location. After it was all said and done, I was 20 minutes LATE to my appointment even though I arrived to the VA 15 minutes early. 
The confusion was for the rehab clinic. It is imperative that this be corrected for patients to ensure we arrive on time and are not “backing up” other appointments.<br>
*- Wm. Jennings Bryan Dorn Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, SC (544)*


> There needs to be better signs for the surgical checkin. I wander around because the letter told me to check in at ASU not surgical checkin.<br>
*- Pittsburgh VA Medical Center-University Drive, PA (646)*


> The signage for trying to navigate through the facility leaves much to be desired. In the speciality clinics the should be signage near the elevator areas so that you know which direction to go. Also while traversing the wings thete is no signs to tell which clinic you are in untill your are there and can see it behind the check in people.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*




**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> Had original appointment in September 2024 canceled with no explanation and was sent a card in the mail stating that the VA tried to contact me, but could not reach me.  I checked both my home and cell phones for a message and discovered no message and no phone call received at all.  I don’t appreciate saying the VA tried to contact me, but no phone call was received.<br>
*- George E. Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, UT (660)*


> If the Doctor says he wants me back in 4 weeks, and when you go to check out, the clerk tells you that the earliest is 8 WEEKS, And, you take the 8 weeks, then are called for the VA to say your appointment in CANCELED!!!  HOW IS THAT GOOD FOR MY HEALTHCARE????  The VA is the worst!!!!  This happens every singe time!!!!!!!!<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*




**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> It sure would be nice if we could use the kiosk to do our mileage. Because I've had to go up there for mileage and I'm not sure that I got paid my mileage I can't check it so you know it'd be a lot easier to sit there and say okay I've checked in and I'm here and I can do my mileage and I'm I don't have comfortable knowing that my mileage will be paid. That's the only problem I have with Lima<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*


> Will like for you guys to put back the Kiosks for checking in and out   Because it was easier to get the travel reimbursement on time and straight to the bank with no problems!!!<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*


> Whoever decided that the present check-in system with the vet card is out the door is a king sized putz. If it ain't broke don't try to fix it.<br>
*- Oklahoma City VA Medical Center, OK (635)*


> I miss the kiosks on site. I feel that they made it easier to check in and submit travel claims/ pike fees for reimbursement.<br>
*- Jack C. Montgomery Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, OK (623)*


> I would like to see a return of the kiosk where you used to scan your card and checked in and were told which waiting room to head for.<br>
*- Abie Abraham VA Clinic, PA (529)*


> Excellent service from all the staff, doctors and volunteer's at the front desk.  Please put the machines back at the front desk area to check in and check your schedules. I talked to others Veterans and it appears that management just took it on their own to remove them and not ask us, the customers, which VA is suppose to service<br>
*- Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center, CO (554)*




**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**


> I was not able to check in with my phone keep coming up with an error and there was no one at the window either<br>
*- Togus VA Medical Center, ME (402)*


> Regarding the appointment time for the 0730 Nurse visit, I arrived 10 minutes prior.  As has been typical for the past few years, the attendant at the check in desk arrived after 0730.  I then waited another 10-15 minutes to see the nurse.  If we are requested to be there for a 0730 appointment, I expect your team would be ready at that time too, to actually see patients.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*


> Only one tech on duty. No one was there to check patients in or to screen for the tech. Thought this strange as usually you are greeted and the are several techs in the immunology clinic.<br>
*- Dallas VA Medical Center, TX (549)*


> Line and wait time for check in and out excessive, I do not see this anywhere else in the VA.<br>
*- Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center, PA (693)*


> There was no one at my clinic to check me in. I had to another clinic to check in however the person at that clinic was very rude and disrespectful. Not just to me but all others who needed help checking in to their appointments. Please make sure that there is someone there to assist with the early morning check ins.<br>
*- Carl T. Hayden Veterans' Administration Medical Center, AZ (644)*


> Need more help with check ins.lines were long.<br>
*- Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center, PA (693)*


> The check in - check out counter on the third floor (cardio) allows a long line to form. There can be 5 people behind the desk deep into their computer ignoring the line. One time a supervisor noticed this and directed the workers to drop what they were doing and take care of the customers. The line quickly went away. There was no lesson learned as on subsequent visits the workers were back into their computers and the line formed. I learned in business , that the customer comes first.<br>
*- Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center, PA (693)*


> There was no one in reception to check me in at 7:00am, my appointment time. Fortunately my provider came in looking for me. If you're going to make appointments at 7:00 someone aught to be there to start the process.<br>
*- Tibor Rubin VA Medical Center, CA (600)*




**Too many notifications**


> Please stop the excessive notifications of upcoming appointments and have you arrived notifications. They are received multiple times a day and for multiple days prior to the appointment. Even when appointment is confirmed the first time, the notifications continue until you arrive for the appointment and check in.<br>
*- James E. Van Zandt Veterans' Administration Medical Center, PA (503)*


> I receive text messages asking me if I am at the clinic and ready for my appointment almost 1 hour before my appointment.  It throws me off guard because I already know I need to be at the clinic 15 minutes before my appointment and checked in.  When I receive a text message so early (usually while I am driving to my appointment) it makes me think I am late, or going to miss it.<br>
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*
