> The new facility at Myrtle Beach is a big improvement. The new check in system is great.<br>
*- Myrtle Beach VA Clinic*


> The first pleasant experience was the new check-in process on my cell phone. It was very expedient. While all others were waiting in line to check in, I was beckoned for my appointment more than 10 minutes before my appointment time. The young lady technician was courteous, very businesslike, and went about her duties in a professional manner. My visit was methodical and satisfying.<br>
*- Downtown West VA Clinic*


> The lab has always been efficient & friendly.<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital*


> I was able to check in on line and get in and out very quickly.<br>
*- Bradenton VA Clinic*



**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> I used the text to check in and after 20 minutes past my appointment time I went to the desk and was informed that I was not checked in.<br>
*- Fayetteville VA Medical Center*

> I used online check-in but wait more than 20 mins; afterwards I moved to service desk and before asking I was called. Tech told me that check-in process not always work as intended because in my check-in was there but not the info of the Doc. I wait in X-Ray room while Tech was trying to unsuccessfully contact the Doc. Well, Tech made the procedure with same info I explained to Doc.<br>
*- Eurípides Rubio Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic*

> i checked in by phone and the lab personnel cannot see that a person is waiting when they check in this way i waited 45 minutes due to this oversight.<br>
*- Muskegon VA Clinic*


> I used the text to check in and after 20 minutes past my appointment time I went to the desk and was informed that I was not checked in.<br>

**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> It was very difficult finding where to go to check in. All the signs directed me to the 'Main Entrance' and when I got there there was absolutely no one around and no signage for help. I was about to give up and leave when a nurse, on her way out for lunch, showed me where to go - on the completely opposite side of the hospital from the Main Entrance!!<br>
*- Garland VA Medical Center*




**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> I showed up for what I thought was my appointment which had been prearranged with  Dr. PII-NAME on a Video Visit earlier in the month.  When I came on the  28th to check in for my appointment I was told that I didn't have any  appointment.  And another appointment was made for  7/3/24. I have to  catch 2 busses and a train and  walk about  1 mile.  So needless to say it's  an effort for me to get there<br>
*- Seattle VA Medical Center*


> The doctor canceled late the day before. The person who canceled said they would call to reschedule the next morning. They didn't. The next morning I received a text I needed to check in. I called scheduling and stated my appointment was canceled. They said I was a no show. I hurried and in waited 45 minutes only to find out no doctor.  The staff didnâ€™t know he was out.<br>
*- Golden VA Clinic*


> Yes I went to check in and was told that my appointment was cancel. They said they sent message  that it was cancel , I don't remember getting it.  I ask if there were someone else that could do the Therapy , they told me that they were on vac.or sent to another department,  that no one could help. To me that's unacceptable there should be someone to be able to fill in.<br>
*- James H. Quillen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*


> Twice my appointments have been cancelled and rescheduled 1-2 months out from the scheduled date by the VA. The last time I received a call on the way to my appointment. I no longer have faith that I will be able to check in to the VA due to them constantly rescheduling my appointments.<br>
*- Newnan VA Clinic*


> My appointment for root canal cancelled due to health care workers retirement.  Waited four months to be cancelled. Was directed to come in for pain management during walk in hours. Waited 1.5 hours with no communication  or acknowledgement after check in.<br>
*- Doris Miller Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*




**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> Not giving us access to the kiosks that made it easier to claim travel pay which was one of the best features that the VA had. With the new system it is confusing and people tend to shy away from that, please bring back the kiosks because it is cheating a lot of Vets everyone is not tech savy.<br>
*- Jesse Brown Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*


> kiosk need more attention some work some dont.I would like to see a contact for patient advocacy on the my healthy vet site. thankyou<br>
*- Jamaica Plain VA Medical Center*


> Since the VA has eliminated the kiosks, I have to fill out paperwork for my travel pay. What used to take less than a minute to do now takes from five to ten minutes. Must be a better way than the current system.<br>
*- Baton Rouge South VA Clinic*


> Every time I go to the VA Iâ€™m treated well just wish had kiosks like before hate going on line for travel pay I know one in travel office but sometimes person is out and have no access<br>
*- Brockton VA Medical Center*


> Open a windows specifically for check in and one for check out instead of waiting for a number to be called just to check in , or bring back the check in kiosks.<br>
*- Southwest Las Vegas VA Clinic*


> Bring Back the Kiosks, I don't like this cell phone type checkin, so am back to standing in line to check in.<br>
*- Outpatient Bay Pines*


> The VA needs more providers and fix the kiosks machines. Why would u waste the money on them to start with.<br>
*- G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*


> Fix the travel site. Took me 10 attempts to complete. Put kiosks back in the clinic. Starting to feel like you make travel difficult to discourage seniors from completing the tasks. Should be automated to occur when your appointment has completed<br>
*- Waynesville VA Clinic*




**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**


> I was in a long line to check in and was told to check in at another window along with 2 other vets. After 50 minutes wait i asked the tech why my name had not been called and he said i had not been reported as haning checkef in. Same for the other vets. I checked in again and was prompltly served. We were sent to the Dental window but told the lady there we were there for bloodwork.<br>
*- Conroe VA Clinic*


> Check in was delayed due to a private conversation.  Check in is not and has not been the best experience both on this visit and others.<br>
*- Downtown West VA Clinic*
