## Noteworthy Comments

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> I was not checked in properly so I waited almost 1 hr before finding out that I was listed as a no show because of the improper check in. My provider was very apologetic and told me that I was not the first veteran that it has happened to. Please don’t go back to the ways of the old VA!<br>
*- Carl T. Hayden Veterans' Administration Medical Center, AZ (644)*


> I did the arrival check in on my mobile phone. arrived in the clinic 10 minutes prior to my appointment, however the electronic application did not make it to the provider and I waited for 30 minutes to be seen. PII_NAME was very apologetic I'm just concered the automation might get in the way of care and could back up appointments.<br>
*- Seattle VA Medical Center, WA (663)*


> I checked in online, as instructed. However, at two minutes after my appointment time, I asked what was going on. I had been there for 30 minutes, as instructed. I was told the online check-in didn’t work for audiology. It would be nice to know that, and not be told to check in online.  Because of that disconnect in communication, I was over 15 minutes late getting out of my appointment.<br>
*- Dallas VA Medical Center, TX (549)*


> I checked in ahead of apt thru text I received morning of apt. I stopped by check in station to confirm I was checked in, was told yes. Nurse came out 10 min after my apt time and called my name.  The nurse and Dr both said I was not checked in? I will check in at counter from now on…I don’t trust the virtual check in now.<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*




**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> They changed where you check in, I only knew that when I read a posted letter on the elevator.<br>
*- Biloxi VA Medical Center, MS (520)*


> More signs in the hallways that tell you where to go for your check in and room of your appointment.<br>
*- West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, CA (691)*


> Refers to question #1 answer. It would be helpful to have directions to clinical areas better marked. Maybe a kiosk map with areas marked and you are here? 
I only knew where to go because I know some employees and asked for directions before I got there.<br>
*- White City VA Medical Center, OR (692)*


> Getting to where I needed to be was very frustrating. I had no idea where i needed to be.  One person finally assisted and got is to the right area but then was told we were in the opposite area we needed to be in, we were then sent to another area.  the person checking us in made sure we new we were 20 minutes late.  The Dr was very nice and respectful.<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital, FL (673)*


> When you come in the front door.... have signs or someone to help direct you where to go... front desk is to close to front door at Everett clinic...when checking in... I didn't know what to do where to go, if I even need to check in? No one gave instructions so your just standing there no knowing what to do... only one person there behind the desk net a line on 10 people all not knowing what 2 do<br>
*- Seattle VA Medical Center, WA (663)*


> Need to clearly indicate where exactly audiology waiting area is at for early appointments (0730).  There wasn't any one there to checkin with, even though I checked in electronically.  I was still called upon on time for my 0730 appointment.  just a little confusing if I was in the correct waiting area.<br>
*- Hampton VA Medical Center, VA (590)*




**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> I checked in and was told my appointment was cancelled then the receptionist said wait a minute and then got me in with a different doctor for a hearing follow up. 2 days later in the mail was my notification that my appointment was cancelled. I do email and text messages, never received any.<br>
*- Cincinnati VA Medical Center, OH (539)*




**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> It is hard to check in, I have to wonder around looking for someone who can check me in.  It was so much easier with the electronic kiosks.<br>
*- Fayetteville VA Medical Center, AR (564)*


> Please bring back the check-in kiosks<br>
*- Harlingen VA Clinic, TX (740)*


> You need to put back in place the kiosk for travel pay, because not everyone has effective access to internet. Don’t understand why you took them out. I have missed out on so much travel pay since you have done that.<br>
*- Nashville VA Medical Center, TN (626)*
