## Noteworthy Comments

**BT recommendations**

> When I check in and out of an appointment, it should automatically be routed to Travel pay so that I can be reimbursed. 

**Mobile network issue inside facilities**

> The system network is really slow on responding, for check in and making appointments. 

**Positive feedback on clinic visits**

> The staff from checkin to the nurse to the doctor was very smooth, [respectful], and polite. I felt more like I was checking into a resort than a doctor's visit. (Naples VA Clinic)

> When you check into a 4-5 star hotel it's usually obvious by the manner and treatment of the staff. Mather medical facility is like checking into a 4-5 star hotel. (Sacramento VA Medical Center) 

**Positive eCheck-in feedback**

> The new check in online is great and it's similar to how we checked in with the kiosks. However, why can't we do travel as well with the new check in? It's exactly like we did with the kiosks. Please add travel to the check in. Thanks. 

> Online check in was simple to do. 

> The new check-in feature via text message was great, I checked-in in the parking lot and by the time I was walking through the door my name was already being called...and I was 15 minutes early!

> The phone check-in worked well and I had a quick attention and treatment.

**VA clinical operations not meeting Veteran expectations**

> I went to the clinic for my scheduled appointment. I arrived on time 30 minutes ahead of time as told to do. When I got there to check in, I was told that my appointment was canceled. Asked if I received a phone call the night before, my reply was if I did I wouldn't be here now. I was rescheduled for late January. 

> Sometimes we wait hours before seeing our doctors. Why is it that if we are 15 minutes late the clinic just reschedule your appointment? No call or text saying hey we're about to cancel your appointment. And yes I understand the volume of which this might that to complete but some of us travel to get to those appointments. Maybe something automatic if you don't check in by said time. Thank you. 

> At check-in I was informed that my appointment had been canceled but I was not contacted. A new appointment date was arranged. 

> I canceled my appointment after waiting for 40 minutes and after going to check in desk to see why so slow I was informed they were short staffed, and didn't plan on being spending the day there. (John J. Cochran Veterans Hospital)

> I arrived to my [redacted] appointment 15 minutes early. I believe that is the request of the VA Hospital. The attendant at the desk said I was too early to check in to my appointment and to return closer to my appointment time. This is not very helpful and quite counterproductive. I'm not sure that this has become policy but it was a strange experience. There was another Vet baffled as well. (Raymond G. Murphy Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center) 

> I attempted to check in for my [redacted] appointment on the website emailed to me by the VA. I received a message stating that my Next of Kin, and emergency contact information needed to be updated. The message informed me to contact a front desk receptionist. They could not assist me with the update, and referred me to the [redacted] clinic who also couldn't update the information. (American Lake VA Medical Center)

**No PCI posters in clinics**

> Had an [redacted] appointment and the receptionist to check in wasn't there this was for a 730 appointment. However I didn't know about the online check in because someone there was talking about it so I got on my phone and checked in.

**Staff misunderstanding PCI and VSECS and/or marking checked in Veterans as "No Shows"**

> I received a text for pre-checkin [eCheck-in] which I completed and was told I was checked in to go into the waiting area and someone would be calling me for my appt. With the Dr. I sat and waited for over 40 mins until 10 mins past my appt time and ask the desk if the pre-checkin [eCheck-in] I completed was the same as an in-person check in at the counter. They said no and checked me in. (Bruce B. Downs Boulevard VA Clinic)

> I received a text telling me to use it to check in to my appointment. When I got to the front desk, the attendant told me I still need to check in at her desk. So why did I get a text saying I was checked in and no further action is necessary?? (Phoenix 32nd Street VA Clinic) 

> Before my arrival I received a communication from the VA advising me that I could check in online. Thought this was a good idea and did so. After checking in online software advised me that I just need to go to the waiting room and wait for someone to come and get me. However as time passed no one came to get me. So I went to the window for assistance. Software doesn't alert staff. (Pittsburg VA Medical Center-University Drive.) 

> Everything went exceptionally well. The only issue was the check in. I was notified by text that I could check in with my cell phone. And that's what I did. But was told later that function does not work. (Syracuse VA Medical Center) 

> En route to the clinic I received a text telling me to click a link to sign in on arrival. When I arrived I clicked on the link to check in and then it told me to wait in the lobby to be called. After about 30 minutes, I checked with someone who was calling another patient. Turns out although I had checked in via the link they had not seen that and I was listed as a no show. (Yuma VA Clinic)

> I checked in because I received a text to click when I wanted to check in. Which is just inefficient as I was told when I got to the 5th floor that I still needed to check in to the receptionist. WHY? Don't send me a text if it doesn't count for anything.
