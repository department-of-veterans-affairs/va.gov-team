## Noteworthy Comments

**Like PCI**


> I liked the new online check-in text and option to file my travel reimbersment from that link. The members of my PACT Team are friendly, listen to my concerns, and provide appropriate feedback! THANK YOU!<br>
*- James H. Quillen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, TN (621)*

> I like the easy check in on my IPhone as I entered building including travel pay application.<br>
*- Olin E. Teague Veterans' Center, TX (674)*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> I checked in via the automated "text" and after waiting 20 minutes,  the nurse came into the lobby calling my name. When I identified myself,  she informed me I hadn't checked in.  This despite having the confirmation on my phone that I had. When I told her this, she informed me that the automated system doesn't work.  Why have a check in kiosk that doesn't work?  Are you aware of this glitch in the system?<br>
*- C.W. Bill Young Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (516)*


> I completed the E-check in and was promptly called back for vitals.  Then I waited for one and half hours to be called back.  I went to the check in desk and they said I didn’t check in.  Yet I had and had my vitals taken.  Eventually I was seen.  Additionally I was told it was my fault that I waited the hour and half by the front desk staff and provider. Why can’t an appointment go like it’s suppose to?<br>
*- Olin E. Teague Veterans' Center, TX (674)*


> I was checked in but not in all the systems so my provider never knew I was there<br>
*- Battle Creek VA Medical Center, MI (515)*


> I checked in to my appt digitally and waited almost 40 minutes. I was not prompted to also check in at the window as well when I arrived.<br>
*- Providence VA Medical Center, RI (650)*


> I was sent a text message from VA. gov to check in. Tucson VA does not recognize that check in process.<br>
*- Tucson VA Medical Center, AZ (678)*


> Checking in by my phone was not good. I checked in with receptionist , then she told me I wasn’t checked in because checking in on my phone didn’t finish. I had checked in physically why have to check in twice. Also had wrong information on my wife but was unable to change it. Someone should have been able to correct that information but receptionist couldn’t do it!!<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*


> I don’t believe the mobile checkin works or is not used by staff<br>
*- Nashville VA Medical Center, TN (626)*


> After checking in 1/2  hour before my appointment,  l set  waiting to be called for a little over 1 hour.  Saw my doctor come out as l was walking up to the counter.  I ask what was happening.  He said that they were told l was a no show.  He took me in right away.<br>
*- Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VA Medical Center, GA (508)*


> I used the online check-in provided to me via email.  After not being called back for my appointment, I checked at the desk and was told the online check-in does not work with the ENT department.  My doctor assumed I was late, but understood once I explained how I checked in.  I recommend putting a sign up to let patients know they must check in at the window.<br>
*- Dallas VA Medical Center, TX (549)*




**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> the info on where to go to check in was not efficient<br>
*- Cincinnati VA Medical Center, OH (539)*


> When you check in online for an appointment, instructions should be given for which waiting area to sit in, ie. 1st floor or 2nd floor I was late for my appointment because I was sitting in the main floor waiting room instead of the second floor waiting room.  Apologies!<br>
*- Sacramento VA Medical Center, CA (612A4)*


> When one comes into the clinic, there are no directions as to where to stand to check in. Audiology is in the very back, no directions. The lower question seems untruthful. Why would my demographics make ANY difference on the quality of care delivered to me???<br>
*- Carl T. Hayden Veterans' Administration Medical Center, AZ (644)*


> After checking in for my appointment I had no idea on where to go for my appointment I had a great person help to my appointment she knew I was lost and she walk me to my appointment area you should have more people standing by to help us when we are lost looking for our appointment<br>
*- Ralph H. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, SC (534)*


> I usually recieve an email to check in and file for travel. For this visit, I did not recieve a check-in or finance travel email. Checking in was confusing as the agent did not work for my clinic. I was told to go to Registration to file for travel. Registration said no, that I had to go to Room 17xx, and that they would help me. When I found the room, it was dark with no one working in travel. There was no one available to help me. It reminds me of the novel Catch 22, in which Major Major was in only when he was out. Your Vet deserves better.<br>
*- West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, CA (691)*


> I had an appointment with ENT. On the floor, they are located, there was no signage pertaining to ENT. The office was actually behind “Women’s Health Services” The front office staff directed me to the area to check in .<br>
*- West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, CA (691)*




**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> The check in process is totally different from the Savannah Clinic.  Finding my way around the campus was not a pleasant experience.  There was no computer check in available and there should be.  There was no method of claiming travel compensation.  When I arrived they said my appointment had been cancelled.  They said the cardiologist did not see patients on Friday afternoons.  After telling them I had traveled from the Savannah area, the found a cardiologist to see me.  IMO, it is not an efficient way to serve veterans.<br>
*- Ralph H. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, SC (534)*




**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> install self-serve check-in kiosks with the option to claim travel pay.<br>
*- Oklahoma City VA Medical Center, OK (635)*


> There is only one mileage reimbursement kiosk leaving out the front why? And that one seems hidden. We need more than one kiosk to many people were waiting to long because half the veterans don’t know how to use the kiosk again why is there only one?<br>
*- Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VA Medical Center, GA (508)*


> Please get the travel reimbursement kiosks operational as soon as possible.<br>
*- Richmond VA Medical Center, VA (652)*


> How about travel pay? 
You got rid of the kiosks that allowed us to put in for travel pay and didn’t give us a btw this is how you go about getting travel pay now…<br>
*- Manchester VA Medical Center, NH (608)*


> Wish we had the kiosks to do our travel paperwork<br>
*- West Palm Beach VA Medical Center, FL (548)*


> Get Kiosk back in the hospital, it is so much easier to use than online.<br>
*- Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans' Hospital, MO (589A4)*


> My main concern is waiting to check in. Always seems to be a line. Suggestion: bring back the kiosks!<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*




**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**


> I was not able to check in the the lab on line and there wasn't anyone at the lab desk to check in. I had to ask one of the lab techs where to check in.<br>
*- Danville VA Medical Center, IL (550)*


> Your desk service at check in can use some work. We stand in THE WAIT HERE LINE while being ignored. But I see you do have online check in which I will use in  the future. I would like to thank Dr. M Colon to explain what needed to be done and how to do it. I even asked her to be my Primary Care Doctor but she has no vacancies.<br>
*- C.W. Bill Young Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (516)*


> Checking in was difficult, almost impossible. Had to go from window to window and stand a while, no one would look up and ask if I needed to check in, checking out was pretty much the same. Once I get past the check in it is awesome!<br>
*- Lt. Col. Luke Weathers, Jr. VA Medical Center, TN (614)*


> Low staffing made it difficult to check in and make a follow up appointment. The staff that were there were very pleasant and helpful with my questions. They did not rush, made me feel important.<br>
*- Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson Campus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System, AK (463)*


> I am apart of the Gold Team and the past few appointment times, there have been a long wait to check in. Not because of that many people, but because the receptionist is either scrolling on her phone and not paying attention or someone is not at the desk. This last time/appointment on November 8, 2024. One of the veterans knocked on the door for one of the nurses to ask about someone checking us in. it was well after the time that the clinic was open.<br>
*- Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VA Medical Center, GA (508)*


> As specified, I was at least 15 minutes early for my appointment at 08:00. Problem was that there was only one person available checking in patients. There was at least eight patients in line waiting to check in. Either have check in folks available for the early morning appointments or begin the patient appointments at a time when reception is staffed. I can understand having to wait for a visit to a provider but not having to wait after my appointment time to check in.<br>
*- West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, CA (691)*


> When I entered the VA building . I knew to go to the second floor , I tried to check in with 3 people in boots all on the phone or telling me to wait , I was running late so I went to another check in office , They told me to go all the way to another building!! There was NO SIGNS any where ,I was late to the appointment then the computers were giving every one trouble , so in a way it didn't matter,
 After getting my stiches removed they told me to go to the therapy department , but when I finally found that office they couldnt let me see any therapist since It wasn't approved yet , so I left.<br>
*- Cincinnati VA Medical Center, OH (539)*


> I waited too long after I checked in. Although I was a bit upset, I appreciated that my dental hygienist took the time to apologize for the clinic making me wait all that time.<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital, FL (673)*


> I waited 12 minutes in line due to only one check in person. There is usually 2 check in persons<br>
*- Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans' Hospital, CA (605)*


> My main concern is waiting to check in. Always seems to be a line. Suggestion: bring back the kiosks!<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*


> There was no one there to check me in at my appointment time abd I had to find another desk in another area to check me in then I wasn't taken back until 30 min after .y appointment time. It took the reception nurse 30 min to ask questions to check me in and by now it was an hour past my appt time and I had to leave and they didn't even care to accommodate me . Wasted my time, gas, and toll money to drive 30 min to this appointment that I didn't even get seen at.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*




**Too many notifications**


> My only concern is that after two reminders, I was notified while driving to my appointment a third time for check in. This has happened one other time. The timing needs work. Thanks<br>
*- Dallas VA Medical Center, TX (549)*
