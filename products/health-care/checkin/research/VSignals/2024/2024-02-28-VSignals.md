## Noteworthy Comments

**Positive feedback about online check in and travel reimbursement** 

> The automated check in is great.

> I like the online check in & auto prompted travel claim option. It's convenient. 

> Excellent "new" online check-in process. 

> I was impressed by the automated check in through the VA app. By the time I reached the dental clinic, they were calling my name. Wow, can't believe I was at a VA appointment. 

>I like the fact that you can check in with your mobile phone now with the text message that they send you at the beginning of the day before your appointment. That's a good idea. Cause then. Wherever you're out of you're an area for another appointment. You can already check in for that appointment as well. 

> The new check in process was outstanding. 

> I was sent a text before my appointment and went I got to the VA I was sent another text to check in. This made very great experience and once I was check in I was sent another text to put in for my travel pay. This was great and made it easy to put for travel pay. Thank you. 

> I arrived 30 minutes before my appointment and parked the car and CHECKED IN BY CELL PHONE. This check in system works great. Walked to [REDACTED] arriving 15 minutes before my appointment and was processed immediately. My appointment was ON TIME and treatment was rendered competently and very timely. The procedure was well explained and I was on my way 15 minutes later. 

> I found the Cell phone notification, Check-in upon my arrival and the travel request function to be very efficient and hopefully a great new tool in the VA system. 

**Clinics not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> I was not seen on my appointment day because I checked in on the app and waited to be called but no one called me. After 30 minutes, I inquired as to how much longer it would take and I was asked if I checked in which I responded that I did on the link that was sent to me. I was told that that link does not work and that I did not check in. So I waited there for over half an hour. 

> Why text me telling me it is time to check in for my appointment before my appointment when other text tell not to report earlier than fifteen minutes early? 

> I checked into my appointment on my iPhone as the text message said. The message reported I was checked in. The waiting area had maybe 10 people waiting. I waited quite a while. As the area emptied out, a girl came out and said my name. Even though the VA iPhone app said I was checked in, I was told I should still check in at desk. I did not know.

> I was prompted to check in with my phone for my appointment upon arrival. After waiting beyond my appointment time to be seen I approached the reception window to check on my status. I was told online check in does not link to the provider or receptionist so they did not know I was there. 

> I received an email asking me to check in online upon arrival, which I did. After waiting an hour in the waiting room I asked the lady at the desk if they were running behind. She asked my name and told me I never checked in. I told her I checked in online as I was asked to do and she told me they were having issues with the online check in. 

> Despite the texts, emails, and large poster at the clinic entrance urging me to check in online, it became obvious that nobody expects anyone to use it. Thank goodness I didn't sit in my car and instead went in and sat down after checking in online. A staff person came looking for me and told me she didn't think anyone had used online check in since the bad days of COVID. <br/>

> The VA online checking in is a great plan but when I arrived they had a handwritten sign that said do NOT use the online checkin system. That seems silly.<br/>  
*- Deltona VA Clinic* 

> When I arrived to the Pensacola Clinic I received a text message asking me to check in which I did. I waited in the waiting area until 20 min past my appointment time, then asked the receptionist why the delay and they said that they had no checked me in, that they could not see the online check in, and that they repeatedly tell the Hospital that they don't use the online check in.<br/>

**Trouble navigating facilities, specifically where to check in, which is where clinic information in VistA, if accurate, would be helpful to Veterans in appointment reminders and in PCI**

> Please provide directions or a map to where to check in for appointments. 

> After checking in they need to explain better as to where you should go, not just C wing. Twice now we have been sitting in the wrong area of the correct wing.

> The kiosk is very good but the info on where to go for appointment does not match what is displayed at clinic. It is confusing on where to go. 

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

> My original appt was cancelled twice, once w while I was at the clinic preparing to check in.

> Too many appointments getting canceled by the VA. 

> I was not call or notify prior 1 day or 2 days of next day appointment. Luckily I open my note pad. Next, I show up on time after driving 2hrs in the rain (heavy) and went to the window to check in; surprise, your Doctor cancelled and did not show up. I was not notify. Not happy. 

> I showed up to my scheduled appointment on 2/8 and upon my check in, I was told that the provider called out sick. I waited two plus months for that appointment and when I rescheduled all they had was the end of April. 

>I had an appointment scheduled on 01/29/2024 at 0915, that I showed up for. At check in, I was told that my appointment had been cancelled because my provider called in sick. 

> The VA scheduling for a first timer like me has been the stuff of nightmares. It took three times of me showing up at regularly scheduled sleep studies to check in... only to be told, "our system says you were cancelled out." First visit, same opening, "We're showing YOU cancelled last night." Nope. 

> When I arrived to check in for my appointment, I was told it had been cancelled. No one could tell me a reason why but recommended that I reschedule. 

**Clinical operation concerns**

> My original appointment was 02/07/24 at 1120. I checked in at 1105 and waited in the waiting area. By 1140, 35 minutes, my name had not been called. I stepped up to the desk I used to check-in. They were somewhat dismayed that I had not been called. In attempting to contact the provider, it was determined they had been notified of my check-in, but were now at lunch. 

> I was an hour and a half early and they got me checked in. I traveled almost two hours to be there and upon arriving at check in I was told it was a phone appointment. I was not given any notice and then found out there is a delay on the services or equipment I would be needing. 

**Kiosk facilities**

> I see that the kiosk box thing is back for check in, and I really, really like it. It really does making checking in a lot easier. <br/>
*- Bath VA Medical Center*

> After checking in on the kiosk it indicated I was in the wrong area and to see the clerk. <br/>
*- WM Jennings Bryan Dorn Medical Center*
