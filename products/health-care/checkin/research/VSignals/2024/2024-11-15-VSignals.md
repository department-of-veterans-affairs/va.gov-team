## Noteworthy Comments

**Like PCI**


> My entire team was excellent, from the online check-in to the check-in desk, nurse, and nurse practitioner. The care and professionalism at each step truly made a difference.<br>
*- Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Kettles VA Medical Center, MI (506)*


> I like the fact that I can check in online!!<br>
*- Lebanon VA Medical Center, PA (595)*


> Very easy to check in with the link sent in my text messages and also to request mileage reimbursement.  I really like that.   Also the ladies at the Behavioral health desk were very friendly<br>
*- John D. Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, MI (553)*


> Had a great visit.  I checked in with my phone. Had my appointment and I was good to go. Thank you for good  visit and treatment.<br>
*- Robley Rex Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, KY (603)*




**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**


> I checked in to my appt digitally and waited almost 40 minutes. I was not prompted to also check in at the window as well when I arrived.<br>
*- Providence VA Medical Center, RI (650)*


> I was sent a text message from VA. gov to check in. Tucson VA does not recognize that check in process.<br>
*- Tucson VA Medical Center, AZ (678)*


> Checking in by my phone was not good. I checked in with receptionist , then she told me I wasn’t checked in because checking in on my phone didn’t finish. I had checked in physically why have to check in twice. Also had wrong information on my wife but was unable to change it. Someone should have been able to correct that information but receptionist couldn’t do it!!<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*


> I don’t believe the mobile checkin works or is not used by staff<br>
*- Nashville VA Medical Center, TN (626)*


> After checking in 1/2  hour before my appointment,  l set  waiting to be called for a little over 1 hour.  Saw my doctor come out as l was walking up to the counter.  I ask what was happening.  He said that they were told l was a no show.  He took me in right away.<br>
*- Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VA Medical Center, GA (508)*


> I used the online check-in provided to me via email.  After not being called back for my appointment, I checked at the desk and was told the online check-in does not work with the ENT department.  My doctor assumed I was late, but understood once I explained how I checked in.  I recommend putting a sign up to let patients know they must check in at the window.<br>
*- Dallas VA Medical Center, TX (549)*


> The check in procedure was very confusing. A link to my cell was sent to check in but the check in desk told me to not use it because their system doesn’t show I have arrived for my appointment. The check in online and in office system do not communicate and I sat waiting. 
In addition, I was under the impression that the provider I was seeing was my new female primary care physician (the previous one retired) but at the end of my appointment I was informed that she was only a fill in until the new female doctor has officially started. The doctor I saw was exceptional and was actually looking forward to having her but instead I will now have to recreate yet another new rapport with the doctor I will see in the future. 
The VA needs to work on communication with the veterans; it’s been lacking in the past and continues still.<br>
*- Togus VA Medical Center, ME (402)*




**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> I had an appointment with ENT. On the floor, they are located, there was no signage pertaining to ENT. The office was actually behind “Women’s Health Services” The front office staff directed me to the area to check in .<br>
*- West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, CA (691)*


> Dermo was on the first floor.  There was no signs. At the check in kiosk there should be a final "go here" message.<br>
*- Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, CA (664)*


**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> The check in process is totally different from the Savannah Clinic.  Finding my way around the campus was not a pleasant experience.  There was no computer check in available and there should be.  There was no method of claiming travel compensation.  When I arrived they said my appointment had been cancelled.  They said the cardiologist did not see patients on Friday afternoons.  After telling them I had traveled from the Savannah area, the found a cardiologist to see me.  IMO, it is not an efficient way to serve veterans.<br>
*- Ralph H. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, SC (534)*


> 35 minute delay for appointment.  Had to go to the check in desk to let them know I haven't been seen.  5 more minutes before being called in.  Then I was told she didn't understand why my appointment was made in the first place.  My appointment was scheduled for 1330 with cardiology.  Also 2nd appointment for an Echocardiogram was schedluled for 1430.  After the PA checked my file, she didn't understand why the Echo was scheduled.  I had already had one a couple of weeks earlier.  l feel the appointment was a total waste of my time as well as the PA.  I traveled from Ocala for the appointments which turned out to be a totally useless. This took time and gas I will not regain.  There seems to be a large lack of communications between the different departments in the Cardiology Division at MRDV.<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*


> My appointment was canceled and I was not notified. When I was waiting I noticed that this happened to many veterans I find this concerning because some of us have a scheduled our appointments months in advance and we have to set up our schedule and rides this is not fair to the veterans and their families. This has happened to me multiple times. I caught the discrepancy only by checking my health on line. This is very concerning to me.<br>
*- Olin E. Teague Veterans' Center, TX (674)*


> I was contacted by scheduling, with offer of earlier appt availability. I accepted the earlier appt. When I went to check in, I was informed I had no appt. And my previous appt had been cancelled.
Something about a new automated scheduling system had a few hiccups.<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*


**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> Please get the travel reimbursement kiosks operational as soon as possible.<br>
*- Richmond VA Medical Center, VA (652)*


> How about travel pay? You got rid of the kiosks that allowed us to put in for travel pay and didn’t give us a btw this is how you go about getting travel pay now…<br>
*- Manchester VA Medical Center, NH (608)*


> Wish we had the kiosks to do our travel paperwork<br>
*- West Palm Beach VA Medical Center, FL (548)*


> Get Kiosk back in the hospital, it is so much easier to use than online.<br>
*- Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans' Hospital, MO (589A4)*


> My recommendation would be that going back to the kiosk for travel pay would help get the claims processed faster and the veterans possibly would receive payment sooner.<br>
*- Sacramento VA Medical Center, CA (612A4)*


> Sometimes I get a text to send in a fuel reimbursement, this time I didn’t, and the Kiosk is now gone.  It would be nice if the VA could standardize this process.<br>
*- John D. Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, MI (553)*


> When there were signin kiosks, it was very easy to request travel pay. Once, I went online to make a request and I was confused with the process. Next time, I filled out a form and handed it in before I left. The time after that, the travel office moved and I didn’t look for it. This past visit, I was in a hurry and decided not to try to make a request. I think I have skipped about 3 travel pays for $20 each.<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*


> It sure would be nice if we could use the kiosk to do our mileage. Because I've had to go up there for mileage and I'm not sure that I got paid my mileage I can't check it so you know it'd be a lot easier to sit there and say okay I've checked in and I'm here and I can do my mileage and I'm I don't have comfortable knowing that my mileage will be paid. That's the only problem I have with Lima<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*




**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**


> There were long lines to check in since many vets were updating their ID's.  The system was not working properly.  There was up to 10 minutes to hit your photo.  Many vets were told to come back. The Release of Information office does a wonderful job.  However, they need more staff and a "Take a Number" system to help control all the folks needing helped.  Again, the office dies an outstanding job but they appear to me to be tucked away in a back corner.<br>
*- Louis A. Johnson Veterans' Administration Medical Center, WV (540)*


> I waited 12 minutes in line due to only one check in person. There is usually 2 check in persons<br>
*- Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans' Hospital, CA (605)*


> My main concern is waiting to check in. Always seems to be a line. Suggestion: bring back the kiosks!<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*


> There was no one there to check me in at my appointment time abd I had to find another desk in another area to check me in then I wasn't taken back until 30 min after .y appointment time. It took the reception nurse 30 min to ask questions to check me in and by now it was an hour past my appt time and I had to leave and they didn't even care to accommodate me . Wasted my time, gas, and toll money to drive 30 min to this appointment that I didn't even get seen at.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*


> The line that you have to stand in sometimes can be a half hour long and standing is very hard for me. Sometimes you go there for your doctors appointment and the check-in is fast other times long.<br>
*- Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center, WA (687)*


> I was not able to check in with my phone keep coming up with an error and there was no one at the window either<br>
*- Togus VA Medical Center, ME (402)*




**Too many notifications**


> Very frustrating getting a text 30 minutes before 15 minute early check in, asking if I had checked in yet.<br>
*- Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Kettles VA Medical Center, MI (506)*


> I get too many texts to confirm the same appointment, along with automated phone calls later for the same appointment as well.  When I have multiple appointments, it becomes very confusing.   I do not want to opt out, I only want a single confirmation of each appointment.  Once an appointment has been confirmed, it is confirmed.  If a change needs to be made I will call as necessary.  Also, the check in texts are always sent to me while I am driving to the facility and I consider that an UNSAFE time to take attention off the road to reply to.  This last one came in at 1317 when my appointment was at 1400!  43 minutes early, asking if I have arrived yet?  Make that 15-20 minutes to be more appropriate.<br>
*- James E. Van Zandt Veterans' Administration Medical Center, PA (503)*
