_E.g., not inclusive of all comments._

**Positive feedback about online check in, travel reimbursement and 45MR**

> It was easy to check-in online once I arrived at the facility. The wait time was acceptable and the staffing was awesome.  I was able to set-up future appointments while there and they had added it to my VA calendar for my reference.
*- La Crosse VA Clinic*

> Recently on a visit I received a text that allowed me to check in and complete my travel pay request. This only happened once. My following two appointments did not include the text. I highly recommend this method of check in.
*- Kernersville VA Clinic*

> I am very pleased with the overall attitude and congeniality of everyone I meet at the Knoxville VA. I was also pleased with the automated check-in by phone although the message should not be sent prior to the VA opening.
*- Knox West VA Clinic*

> I had appointment scheduled arrived 10 minutes early. Used self check in thru QR code as you enter. QR link said I checked in and to sit down.  Receptionist mentioned I was not checked in. 5 min later I was called and told I have to be on time. I thought I did everything right. I don’t know why the poster is present if it doesn’t work or employees don’t use it. I had to reschedule and was seen
*- St. Charles County VA Clinic*

> The online check in process is awesome. I didn't wait more than 5 minutes to be seen and the staff at Capt. Bryant Mariner Clinic are professional and extremely accommodating.
*- Captain Rosemary Bryant Mariner Outpatient Clinic*

> I responded to the audiology appointment reminder notification and subsequent telephone request to check in earlier.  I was seen immediately by the audiologist.  The audiologist listened to my concerns and immediately identified a solution. The audiologist explained the proper care of my hearing aids and provided the materials that I would need.
*- Burlington County VA Clinic*

> like the new check in
*- Lebanon VA Medical Center*

> I was impressed with the new check-in method from my phone..no need for forming lines; upon arrival, I was giving the option to check-in from my phone, and if wanted, verify with the front desk. I sat for 10 minutes before I was called. Kudos!
*- Lawrenceville VA Clinic*

> Automated check in and automated reimbursement system is a real step forward, for the VA
*- McClellan VA Clinic*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> I received a text to check-in online line for my appointment which I completed. I then received a second text telling me that I was checked in and my care team was aware I was in the building and ready for my appointment. However, while sitting awaiting to be called back, the front desk person informed me I was not checked in and proceeded to check me in as well. Systems need to be linked better.
*- Newnan VA Clinic*

*- St. Charles County VA Clinic*

> Check in is confusing.   I checked in in response to text messages from the VA, but the staff didn't realize I was there.   If you still need to notify the staff in person, then the text check-in is useless.
*- Fredericksburg 2 VA Clinic*

> Got seen 25 minutes early. The on line checkin does not notify the clinic that you are there. Kind of strange. Not like the id scanners I used in az a couple of years ago
*- Catskill VA Clinic*

**Trouble navigating larger facilities**

> Echo check in and waiting area could be better identified. I was seen over a half hour late for a * am appointment.  I was never contacted once during that time.
*- Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*

> When getting to medical clinic area it would be helpful to post signage that is more visible to patients so that they can check in at appropriate station. ( Signs on walls by the doors are too small.)
*- Fayetteville VA Medical Center*

> When I tried to check in for my appointment, at the place and time that was printed on the card I was sent to remind me of the appointment, I was told it was in a different area and floor of the hospital. I went where I was told and they said I was at the wrong place and need to go to another area of the hospital, which then told me I was in the wrong place and was told to check in where I had sta
*- Seattle VA Medical Center*

> I had a problem finding the proper place to check in.
*- Washington VA Medical Center*

> The new check-in places are very confusing (one on the first floor one on the second floor, and one on the third or forth floor.  I check in on the first floor as I had the last time I was at Oscar Johnson, they tell me I must go to the second floor to check in so up the elevator to the second floor check in oh, my appointment isn't for  an hour,  Go to the lab and get that done.  And then out of
*- Oscar G. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Facility*

> They need a sign on where to check in for lab work!
*- Tyler Centennial VA Clinic*

> Please update the information in the elevators and signage on the floors. I had two appointments that day and knew which floor to get off for my ENT appointment and dermatology appointment, but the elevator was not labeled, and getting off the elevator the check in on the floor was not labeled for the ENT area.
*- Pittsburgh VA Medical Center-University Drive*

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

> My original eye appointment was scheduled 13 May @0930. When I showed for my appointment and try to check-in via text I was told I didn’t any appointment. I spoke to he front desk and check my records and they said my appointment was cancelled. Informed them them I neither cancel my appointment nor I received an email or letter stating the cancellation.  I drove 40 miles one-way for this
*- St. Louis VA Medical Center-Jefferson Barracks*

> My first appointment was for April 22, 2024. When I arrived to check in, I was told my primary care giver was not available, and I was rescheduled for May 9, 2024. When I arrived for that appointment, I was told I had been rescheduled for May 28, 2024.In both cases, no attempt was made to contact me before I made the trip to the VA facility.
*- Walzem VA Clinic*

> Was in Colorado and traveled 6 hrs back to Albuquerque for the appointment. At check in I was informed appointment was cancellation at patient request. I informed receptionist this was a “lie” and request to talk to head nurse. Nurse admitted she cancelled appointment. Could not answer if notifications sent on cancellation. To appease me Doctor performed a extremely short and meanless exam.

**Concerns with check in at kiosks**

> The kiosks that were in the VA once upon a time were the best way to claim travel compensation that ever was. The person responsible for removing them should be terminated from their position. For the VA to spend all the money on the equipment and software and then just remove it for no good reason was a waist of tax payer healthcare dollars.
*- Staff Sergeant Alexander W. Conrad Veterans Affairs Health Care Clinic*

> Hi, Hope you're well. I liked the check in kiosks as it was easier to use, no waiting in lines and it always directed me to the right place. Your mail out notices have the unit info but the emails do not. Anyway, I get the older folks might not like/use it, but I was sad to see them gone.
*- Lee County VA Clinic*

> it would be so much easier and more convenient if the Check-In/check-Out/Travel pay Kiosks were returned to use.  Adding a cleaning station at the kiosk would be convenient also.
*- Olin E. Teague Veterans' Center*

> Bring back the travel kiosk. Checked in through my phone because it also does my travel pay but it said it was down that day. And we know the VA will not use common sense to process all those missed claims.
*- Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center*

> VA spent much money to have kiosks for check in and now not applying them, instead back to stand in line and wait for next available representative to either check you in. If representative at window check in is only option, than, than do not require them to answer telephones, and have other in office do such. Checking in for appointment or making new appointment or check out, is more important.
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center*

> PLEASE put travel pay kiosks at all entrances and exits at the Durham and Greenville facilities.   We don't need them at at check-in points.  Just the entrances and exits!   I'm sure you will save the difference in overtime being paid right now.  THE COMPUTER SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK FOR TRAVEL!  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!!!
*- Durham VA Medical Center*

> To receive travel pay is a real pain. Go back to the old way with the kiosk
*- Minneapolis VA Medical Center*

> Please bring back the Kiosks that allowed us to put in a travel claim by having it scan our VA card and answering  a few questions. It was a lot easier to put in a trave claim like that.
*- Greenville VA Clinic*

> If they plan on doing away with the manual paper submissions of travel vouchers there needs to be more kiosk machines in the various clinics throughout the Atlanta VA.
*- Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VA Medical Center*

**Facilities still using QR Codes**

**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**

> It took over 30 mins just to check in for my rx with only 3 people ahead of me. Once I was checked in it took another 15 mins to get my medication. The one female at the check in window was chatting with others in the pharmacy and appeared to just be sitting around killing time before calling the next number. The pharmacy was not busy.
*- North Central Federal VA Clinic*

> I checked in at the LAB station for labs/xrays.  The person checking me in sent to x-rays to check-in because there was a smaller line for x-rays.  I felt this made no sense as I had already gone through the line for labs and there weren't too many people waiting.  Nonetheless, I obliged to avoid any disagreements.  I ended up standing in a longer line once I returned for my labs, as I expected...
*- San Juan VA Medical Center*

> There was no where to check in and no one was at the counter where I would normally checkin. I stood there for about 10 min before I finally walked through a door that said no one allowed past this point to find someone to find out where I was suppose be.
*- Salem VA Medical Center*
