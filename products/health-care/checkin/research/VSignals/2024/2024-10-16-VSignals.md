## Noteworthy Comments

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> I checked myself in for my appointment using the link that was texted to me. However, it did not register to my provider in a timely manner. I waited a little over 15 mins before being called on. Self check in should register to the provider performing services in a more timely manner so patients aren’t waiting long in the wait area(s).<br>
*- Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, OH (541)*

> There was a sign on the door that told me to check-in for my appointment using the app or via text. I did this and waited for my name to be called. I felt the wait was a little long and both the provider and the lady at the Eye Clinic check-in desk both mentioned they didn't know where I was. Next time I will check-in with a physical person vice using the app.<br>
*- Richmond VA Medical Center, VA (652)*

> I found it frustrating to check in for the appointment on the app, but still being required to go all the way up to the clinic and physically check in, only to be told to then go back downstairs and wait in the lobby.
*- Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, OH (541)*

**Trouble navigating larger facilities**

> You need more signs and email telling which building vet's should check into , and maybe the floor and room of their check in point. I spent a lot of time parking in the right lot, and finding my first meet<br>
*- Togus VA Medical Center, ME (402)*

> When I arrived I asked for directions, this was my first time at this faciality. I was sent to the wrong location. I checked in and was told where to go next, again to the wrong location. I sat and waited 40 minutes past my appointment time. I check to see what the delay was told that I was in the wrong location. Once I got to where I should have been, everything went quickly. I spent 2 1/2 hours, for a 20 min. visit.<br>
*- Providence VA Medical Center, RI (650)*

> I was not told what Building to go to , but when checked in, I found out the building was at the the other side of Mather V.A. Hospital- building 727--  I was using my Walker to get there-- But I made it with 5  minutes to spare.<br>
*- Sacramento VA Medical Center, CA (612A4)*

> I keep getting told that I’m in the wrong check in when I show up. They either send me to 2 or 3 but never can state exactly which one. I go and check in at 2 and they tell me I’m wrong and go to 3 and when I get there they say the same thing about check in 2<br>
*- Harlingen VA Clinic, TX (740)*

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

> When I checked in for my appointment in Dermatology I was informed that the appointment  had been rescheduled for February, 2025.  In hindsight I should have been suspicious as I did not receive any reminders about my upcoming appointment. I was able to take care of another health issue.  Since my ear surgery a few years ago I have had difficullty removing ear wax.  The technician at audiology was able to fit me into the schedule and removed my ear wax.  My hearing immediately improved, which it does after each session of ear wax removal.  A bid thank you to the technician who helped me.<br>
*- Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center, CO (554)*

> I was early for my appointment @ Xray checked in & waited to be called.7:00 appointment came and went. I had a 7:30 appointment in Saturn with Ortho. I asked @ window when I could expect to be seen & found out that the tech
had called out. ??<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*

> This was the worst experience I’ve had and all my days with the VA. As I was trying to check in the Kia would not let me check in so I went to the front desk. The clerk came out and told me that my orthopedic appointment had been canceled. She had no idea when I could get into the orthopedics. She said the doctor is never coming back, she told me I could do a consult to Community care. After I left the VA she called me and told me she could not do a consult through community care because I had to go back to my primary care and get another referral for orthopedics. At the time, my knee was swollen in a brace and I knew that I could not wait to go through primary care to get back into orthopedics so I called the VA helpline for assistance. To this day, I still have not received an appointment for community care.<br>
*- Central Alabama VA Medical Center-Montgomery, AL (619)*

> If the Doctor says he wants me back in 4 weeks, and when you go to check out, the clerk tells you that the earliest is 8 WEEKS, And, you take the 8 weeks, then are called for the VA to say your appointment in CANCELED!!!  HOW IS THAT GOOD FOR MY HEALTHCARE????  The VA is the worst!!!!  This happens every singe time!!!!!!!!<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*

**Concerns with check in at kiosks**

> Why did you remove the kiosks? 
 Those were helpful to check in and change information. In addition, you did not have to state your last four of your SSN verbally upon check-in.<br>
*- Richmond VA Medical Center, VA (652)*

> The travel reimbursement needs to be repaired on the kiosk machines, it would be much more convenient if we could get our reimbursments proceessed easily on the kiosk. Either then that, everything else was superb<br>
*- Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, CA (664)*

> I would like to see a return of the kiosk where you used to scan your card and checked in and were told which waiting room to head for.<br>
*- Abie Abraham VA Clinic, PA (529)*

> Your auto check kiosks most of them do not work. Been in 3 times and none would read my card or had signs on them out of service.
Manual check in was easy so no problem in getting service.<br>
*- Birmingham VA Medical Center, AL (521)*

> The check-in kiosks don't seem to read VA identification cards.  Nonetheless, the check in process is pretty easy and quick using the touch screen questionnaire.<br>
*- Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, CA (664)*

> Excellent service from all the staff, doctors and volunteer's at the front desk.  Please put the machines back at the front desk area to check in and check your schedules. I talked to others Veterans and it appears that management just took it on their own to remove them and not ask us, the customers, which VA is suppose to service<br>
*- Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center, CO (554)*

> Removing the check in kiosk has made the VA experience worse. The kiosks made checking quicker and easier. Also, it was much easier to claim travel mileage with the kiosk<br>
*- Danville VA Medical Center, IL (550)*

**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**

> After some delay checking in, everything went smoothly. The staff was helpful and very friendly and had my best interest. Once in the operating room my doctor and her group were outstanding. I couldn’t have felt more comfortable and relaxed. I wish to thank everyone for their attention to my needs during my same day visit.<br>
*- Dallas VA Medical Center, TX (549)*

> Need more help with check ins.lines were long.<br>
*- Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center, PA (693)*

> More staff needed to check in. Waited in line a long time to be checked in  for 1:30 appointment.<br>
*- Harlingen VA Clinic, TX (740)*

> I arrived 10 min before appointment time as I've done before an got my appointment # for check in. Did not check in until 15 mins after appointment time. This is the second time the check in process has caused me to be late.<br>
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*

> THe Augustinere was no at the desk to check me in , I had to look for any that looked like the worked at the VA ,found a lady that went in to check me in, AND GOT THE DR FOR ME.<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*

> The check in - check out counter on the third floor (cardio) allows a long line to form. There can be 5 people behind the desk deep into their computer ignoring the line. One time a supervisor noticed this and directed the workers to drop what they were doing and take care of the customers. The line quickly went away. There was no lesson learned as on subsequent visits the workers were back into their computers and the line formed. I learned in business , that the customer comes first.<br>
*- Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center, PA (693)*

> There was no one in reception to check me in at 7:00am, my appointment time. Fortunately my provider came in looking for me. If you're going to make appointments at 7:00 someone aught to be there to start the process.<br>
*- Tibor Rubin VA Medical Center, CA (600)*

**Too many notifications**

> Please stop the excessive notifications of upcoming appointments and have you arrived notifications. They are received multiple times a day and for multiple days prior to the appointment. Even when appointment is confirmed the first time, the notifications continue until you arrive for the appointment and check in.<br>
*- James E. Van Zandt Veterans' Administration Medical Center, PA (503)*

> I receive text messages asking me if I am at the clinic and ready for my appointment almost 1 hour before my appointment.  It throws me off guard because I already know I need to be at the clinic 15 minutes before my appointment and checked in.  When I receive a text message so early (usually while I am driving to my appointment) it makes me think I am late, or going to miss it.<br>
