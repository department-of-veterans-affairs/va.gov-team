## Noteworthy Comments

**Positive feedback about online check in, travel reimbursement and 45MR** 
> "My entire care team at Pike are always professional, polite and patient.  I wish I could get all my health care needs here.   I also like the new check in procedure which includes travel reimbursement.  I need to be directed to someone who can assist me with my current claim  that was filed in November. Thanks to an amazing team!!!"

> "I wanted to leave a compliment. I received a link to check in on my smartphone for the first time for my previous appointment. I think that is one of the easiest and smartest things that has been offered."

> "Everything went fantastic. I even checked in from the parking lot and even submitted for travel mileage on that same check in."

> "The new online check-in for appointments is awesome.  I checked in when I parked and by the time I got to the waiting area, it was maybe 2 minutes before I was called for my appointment.  Keep up the great work"

> "I greatly appreciated the efficient treatment process and reminder/advance check in text messages."

> "Received a VA text shortly before I arrived in Conroe.The text was a link to check in and then took me to another link for my travel claim. I walked by everyone else as they stared at me and sat down. It wasn't 10 minutes and my name was called. The system works!"


**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**
> "Signs everywhere saying to check in on my phone which I did and it said I was checked in. After sitting there waiting for a while the wonderful receptionist asked if I checked in and I told her I did so on my phone. She then told me that is not good and you need to check in at the desk so I am confused. Does the phone check us in or not. Thanks"

> "AFTER CHECKING IN ON LINE, I was told I had to check in at the window? I had to wait for 1 hour before I ask why I was not called on time for my appointment? But rather an hour later? That was the excuse I was given?"

> "Need to allow for electronic check-in and filing for all travel reimbursement claims.  Some departments allow for this, but not all departments."

> "When appearing for an appointment for the lab, the wait time is extremely unreasonable. I once checked in online for the lab and received an all checked in proceed to be called by lab personnel and was never called. After 30-45 minutes. I finally asked an attendant at one of the manned admin stations, why I had not been called and was told "the online check in system for appointments does not work"

**Trouble navigating facilities, specifically where to check in, which is where clinic information in VistA, if accurate, would be helpful to Veterans in appointment reminders and in PCI**
> "Appointment letter and app do not show where the appointment is within the hospital or who to check in with"

> "I would like to suggest better signage, so people know where to check in.  At the time I checked in, there was a sign, but it was against the wall and pointed to the lab.   I'm sure there is more efficiencies to be gained by having a person check us in (I appreciate it) but it needs to be very clear."

> "The area names are to convoluted and DO NOT match the check in ticket!!!!!.  KEEP IT SIMPLE!.  I.e.  2nd Floor Area A as an area label AND a matching sign."

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**
> "Last Friday I had an appointment. When I was there to check in I was informed it was cancelled. I was not notified and it was my yearly check up"

**Concerns at Kiosk facilities**
> "Why in God's name did you get rid of the check-in kiosks?  The system worked fine! Got the locations to the clinics and times; filed for bene travel, all in one stop!  To me this was a solution searching for a problem!  Just dumb!"

> "Transitioning from Kiosk to smart phone QRC scan for checking in for appt was concerning. This may be helpful for the "younger" generation w/smart phones and the technical acumen.  I wondered how the older Vets were able to navigate the check-in without a smart phone or less tech savvy.  It was concerning as I am 56 and will more than likely be affected by technological changes in the future."

> "Where are the Kiosk we used to sign in. Weâ€™re promised would have Better ?"

> "Put the kiosk back up for our travel pay. It has cost me a lot of travel pay since taking the kiosk down during ."

> "I did like the kiosk and would like to see them return"

> "Travel pay reimbursement has become a pain. Firstly using ANY dotGOV website sign in and navigation is a hassle and burdensome. Whatever became of the Cash Pay Window or even the Kiosk??? Both were convenient and easy for  OLD VETERANS like me and my Brother. Tolls are another matter. How to collect them without having a receipt???? What kind of hockey is this? Burdensome nonsense. Fix it."

> "Was first time I used kiosk to check in. Would help if there were some instructions on how to use the kiosk. Use was not self-explanatory especially at start up."

> "Thank you for restoring the kiosks for sign in and travel request. The staff at Bath VA is great. Very courteous and professional.  They know what they are doing."

> "Recommendation - Bring the kiosks back for checking in and travel pay."

> "fix check-in equipment so we don't have to talk to people at front desk, sometimes you ck-in and you seem to have to remind them your there (really long wait time). fix eye exam equipment (eye glasses reader did not work)."

> "The check in machines don't seem to work properly. Good thing you have nice receptionist."

> "I miss the check in Kiosks and wondered why you discontinued them."

**Clinics still using QR Codes**
- NA

**Interest in expansion of filing for travel via text**
> "I have not received my travel pay in months when I checked in with the new text system in Gainesville FL with check in  53079 system sucks I'll probably get paid after the cancer kills me"
