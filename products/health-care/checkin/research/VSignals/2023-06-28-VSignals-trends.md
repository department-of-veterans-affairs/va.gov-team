## Noteworthy Comments

**Mobile comments**

> The new check in system seems very easy and streamlined for faster service, thank you.

> During the “text” check-in process, my residential address continued to be wrong despite several previous attempts to correct/change.  The receptionist again took my correct residential address and completed my check-in.  As it appeared she was unfamiliar with how to resolve the issue, she accepted direction from the other receptionist, was very proficient and completed my check-in.

> I'm not sure why a question was asked of me during my check-in about my sexual orientation? How does that apply to my health care? If I needed, I would have let my doctor know and I would have provided information to them. I do not feel the VA needs to ask questions of that nature, I was not comfortable.

> Checking in via smartphone from the parking lot was a failure. I use my DS Logon to sign into VA. I was required to provide my login info 3 times just to get to the page I needed, which took quite a while. I was unable to complete the check-in process before it was time to physically check in. I recommend that someone actually go through the steps, using a DS Logon, to confirm difficulty.

> Trying to get reimbursed for travel is a pure nightmare. I've been Hampton VA (5) times since April and have only received (1) reimbursement payment. The kioskes worked great. Why discontinue a process that worked flawless.

> My appointment on 6 June was with Podiatry. I arrived and the sign indicated I could check in at the desk OR use the QR scan code. They were busy at the desk so I checked in with my phone. I waited 20 minutes and checked in at the desk. She said "We aren't notified when you check in via smart phone." Recommend the sign be changed to direct veterans to check in at desk and remove the QR scan code.

> On a visit to the Joliet VA clinic prior to June 8, I used the new sign in method and it stated that the cell number was not the number on file. Went to one of the persons at the desjk to check in. THe person that helped me changed the cell number to the correct one. June 8th I tried to sign in and there was a mistake again, the phone number that was on record was my house phone not the cell num

> I usually get appointments 4 weeks or more in the future. My question is.....Why do I keep getting e-mails on my phone to confirm my next scheduled appointment when I confirmed my appointment immediately after the first e-mail reminder. I received 4 total e-mails to confirm my last appointment. One was received after I had done my pre check in. The next appointment I will only confirm once.
