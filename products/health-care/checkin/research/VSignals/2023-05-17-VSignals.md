## Noteworthy Comments

**Mobile comments**

> I'm sure that you have heard this from several veterans but, The new check in and out is very stressful. I can check in easily but, checking out and doing my travel pay is very stressful.

> Every time I complete online pre-checkin form, it presents me with incorrect "next of kin" info. I always indicate that the info is not correct, and the form says that it will be corrected during my visit, but no one ever asks. The couple times I have asked about it during a visit, they say they don't have access to correct it. I would like someone to contact me to correct my "next of kin" info.

> I wish the computer to check in was still available. I prefer not having to wait just to check in at the counter. I realize that there's a method to check in by phone but that's not an option I will ever use.

> Concerned with the new check-in method using a cell phone. No accommodations in this method for Veterans with low vision.

> I wish we had the machines instead of the current condition some Vets think that once u register online u don't have to check in at the desk. They sit out. It's a shame we Vets have to put up with this system.

> The check in gives no indication how to check in after texting your number. Need addressing

> The check in process was not good. Used my iPhone as recommended but check in was not achieved and I needed to go check in physically. That's not an issue per se, but it needs to work every time.

> Great provider, but really seems like a waste of resources to wait in line to check-in when technology can be used to do the same thing.

> The check in is so much better, way better than the other system!
