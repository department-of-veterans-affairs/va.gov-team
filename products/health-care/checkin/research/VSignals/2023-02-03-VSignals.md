## Notable Comments

- Travel pay recommendations
	> “How about a fast, easy link through MyHealtheVet?”
- Wifi connection / system errors - Veterans mention system not working or connection dropping
	> “The new website has frequent outages.”
- Veterans continue to report checking in via any method (mobile check-in, kiosk, or staff), then being told later that the system didn’t show them as checked in/staff weren’t notified that they were checked in. 
	> “The self check-in didn't check me in and waited over an hour to be seen.”
