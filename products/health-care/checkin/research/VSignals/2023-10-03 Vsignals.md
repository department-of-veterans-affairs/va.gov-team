# October 3, 2023 VSignals Summary

Created: October 3, 2023

This is an analysis of Veteran feedback from **September 5 - September 26, 2023**.

Feedback from Veterans is captured in VSignals. This report queries VSignals for comments that mention "check in" and "travel reimbursement." In this date range, there were a total of **521** comments. 

Beginning with the last few iterations, we've been very intentional about how we scored the feedback. For example, when reading "The lady at the check-in counter was great!" we didn't score that as positive feedback as it was more feedback on the employee than the actual process. When reading "Check-in was really efficient and quick" we did score that as positive feedback as it was describing the process. This intentionality caused a sharp decline in both good and bad total comments, as you'll see in the graphs below. However, it helps highlight the times when the feedback only focuses on the process itself rather than on an employee.

## Noteworthy Comments

### Check-in specific: 
> The new check in process is so easy to use.
> 
> The new check-in procedure is GREAT!
> 
> New check in system works very well...........!!
> 
> I was favorably impressed by the smartphone check-in.
> 
> Wait time after check-in has been reduced.
> 
> Why check in online and still check in at counter? Waited my 15 minutes. Went to counter. They said I also needed to check in at counter not just on the phone.
>
> I keep trying the auto-checkin using the scan code. It has never worked for me and I always end up at the back of the line. The pre-checkin that always gets texted to me is also a waste of time. It serves to purpose at all.
>
> I tried the cell phone check-in and was unsuccessful (said it could not check me in). The  cell phone check-in is convenient but not user friendly nor is it intuitive. When you finally get it to work it won't let you check-in and you still have to see someone at the desk. Very frustrating. 
 
### Concerns we're already addressing:
>
> I did the pre-check before my appointment and didn't realize there was another step for final check-in. The nurse noticed I did pre-check and came out to the waiting room to look for me instead of waiting for me to do the final check-in (which I didn't realize I had to do). She mentioned that most people don't realize that there is another check-in to do after the first pre-check.
> 
> Akios machine to check in and give irections about appointment locations would be convenient, sometimes I forget my appointment list.

### Possible future enhancements
> Too many texts to confirm visit. Pre visit check in DOES NOT WORK! Still need to stand in line to check in? 
> 
> Don't understand why a person has to check in twice if seeing two different people on same day and within an hour apart?
