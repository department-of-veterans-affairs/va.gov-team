## Noteworthy Comments

**Like PCI**

> Check-in with phone app is easy, and for those reimbursed for mileage...wow!<br>
*- Sacramento VA Medical Center, CA (612A4)*

> All staff and doctor were very courteous and professional.  On line check in and travel submission were easy.  Great team at the Livermore Ophthalmology clinic.<br>
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center, CA (640)*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> If possible can the signs at the Eye Clinic urging Veterans to check-in at the front desk instead of responding to the check-in text on their phones be larger and placed on the entrance doors to the clinic. Thank you<br>
*- Durham VA Medical Center, NC (558)*

> When I arrived, 30 minutes before my appointment, I received a text to check in. I did the check in, and sat in the lobby, after an hour and others who arrived after I did were called back, I went to see what taking so long. They had not received the check on. I had to check in at the desk. Then I waited til 4:30ish to see the provider for 5 minutes. You had me verify multiple times that I would be at the appointment, apparently multiple check ins. Seems to be a plethora of wasted steps, and very little concern for my time. The entire staff was pleasant and only said kind words. All seemed to enjoy their jobs, but several hours to have 1 stich cut and a drain removed atmy last appointment and 2 + hours to have the doc check all is good, does not speak efficient to me. Maybe I am just the unlucky one, to have appointments when emergencies are occurring,  but noone was running around with that type of purpose, in what I saw.<br>
*- Michael E. DeBakey Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, TX (580)*

> You require me to be there 15 minutes prior to my appointment, but you text me 45 minutes prior to the appointment asking me if I had checked in yet, please make it one or the other!<br>
*- Providence VA Medical Center, RI (650)*

> I checked in online in response to the text message I received. I recieved another text telling me I was checked in. After not being called back I asked at the desk and found out I was not checked in. That system is a fail<br>
*- Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans' Hospital, TX (671)*


> I like the new innovation regarding receiving a text message to check in which I did on this appointment. I waited 30 minutes and still not called for my appointment. I went to the front desk to see if I was checked in and they confirmed I was. Then I was told that I should have come to the front desk for them to fill out for the diagnostic exam.  There are no signs posted even though you electronically sign in you still need to go to the front desk but you would think that after you electronically sign in that a paper print out could be completed<br>
*- Edward Hines Junior Hospital, IL (578)*


> I checked in online but I guess I had to check in with the staff which wasn’t an option given to me online. I basically checked in and went to wait in the tiny waiting room. I was fortunate that the Sleep Lab staff took it upon themselves to check with me and physically checked me in. I guess that was the only hiccup I encountered<br>
*- Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans' Hospital, TX (671)*


> After checking in on line and at the desk, I got lost on the computer system. I had a wait of over 30 minutes. When I questioned the wait, I was told I got lost. I wasted almost an hour been I arrived for my scheduled apothecary, until I was seen.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*




**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> 2 too many check-in windows didn't know where to go. I mean, it's all i'm pretty excuse<br>
*- Spark M. Matsunaga Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, HI (459)*



**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> PLEASE bring back the kiosk for processing travel reimbursement the website is not only DIFFICULT it’s also CONFUSING to submit<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital, FL (673)*


> Applying for travel pay is a mess now that they took out the kiosk. Trying to apply on line, it never goes through and I can’t get anyone to tell me what I’m doing wrong. The website sure isn’t user friendly.<br>
*- Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center, AL (679)*


> When I tried to check in the new computer check in stands were very very hard to use. It took me a long time to get it to recognize and scan my card. I watched veteran after veteran try and fail to get the new setup to work! The new stands are awful! They need to be fixed or replaced!<br>
*- Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, GA (509)*


> The new kiosk is too difficult.<br>
*- Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, GA (509)*




**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**


> Check in procedure seems broken. Staff either aren’t at desk or u stand there while they work on their computer and ignore you. Some type of electronic check in like the kiosk I feel may improve this. Also there isn’t appropriate cell svc for txt to work in that process<br>
*- Dallas VA Medical Center, TX (549)*


> Checking in for an appointment USED to be simple and quick - when the ID cards were simply put into a card scanner. Now checking is can be slow and frustrating as it's necessary to actually wait for a clerk to check in in-person. This is especially true when in the clinics (red, green, blue, etc.) I had to wait for over 10 minutes at the red desk while we were held up by a few "confused" people in front of us. I'd recommend a simpler and quicker check in procedure. PS- checking in via cell phone doesn't work either. Thanks!<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*


> Checking in at Cancer Care Clinic for an IV appointment should of been smooth. The check in person who is always there was not in and that's where the problem began. 
The person who was sitting in that day, the 10th of February was not competent to do the job.  Simple checking in and notifying the IV Clinic that I was waiting. After waiting for 45 minutes my wife checks in again. He says, I got it..
Really so she sees the IV Clinic nurse, they say we don't show my husband's name. The VA needs people who have COMMON SENSE and take their job seriously.<br>
*- Seattle VA Medical Center, WA (663)*


> The check-in process is frustrating. The physical setup makes it hard for the front desk workers to notice and acknowledge people waiting to check-in. People checking in are met with a half circle setup that does not provide clear visibility to which checkin stations are open and when to approach to get checked in.<br>
*- Battle Creek VA Medical Center, MI (515)*


> It is extremely frustrating to search for a person to check in with. They all hide behind 2 computer screens so you look into each window to catch someone's attention,  This really needs to be addressed so you don't start your appt agitated.<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital, FL (673)*
