## Noteworthy Comments

**Like PCI**


> I checked in from the parking lot on my phone and barely had time to tell the receptionist my name when the nurse called me to the exam room. I got a referral to neurology and one for occupational therapy. I got a call from each today and have appointments arranged already. Great care.<br>
*- Grand Junction VA Medical Center, CO (575)*


> Reminders and online check in was handy<br>
*- Spark M. Matsunaga Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, HI (459)*


> Y'all make it so easy to get healthcare. I show up and valet parks my vehicle. I enter Building 143 and right inside is the information desk who will guide you seamlessly to your appointment. I check in online and take a seat in a very clean facility waiting area. You never have to wait long even though they're very busy. When they call your name and take you back to the treatment area they ALWAYS are pleasant and informative guiding you through to your destination/appointment. Thank-you so much for  all of this wonderful healthcare. I'd have died long ago without the VA.<br>
*- Salem VA Medical Center, VA (658)*




**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**


> As I entered, I received a txt to check in, I completed it but still had to check in at the window. I would like to see this clinic open on Fridays and second; with the issues of trying to get an appt with optometry now that they are cutting back on VA Community Care program and my provider can no longer issue consults for optometry, I would like to see all outpatient clinics not just Palatka, have an optometry section no matter how small a room they could get there.  Surely they could squeeze in there somewhere with minimal staff.<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*


> I completed online check-in before arriving and then clicked ‘I’ve arrived.’  It wasn’t clear to me that I STILL needed to stand in line to check in AGAIN so the staff knew I was there.  What’s the point of online check in?  Usually there are people at the front door who can answer questions.  This day there was only the security guard and he didn’t know.  My PCP quit several months ago but he was still listed as the doctor I was seeing.  The appointments were running 40 minutes late.  I was surprised to have a ‘temp’ doctor.  This is the first time I’ve had a negative experience at this VA.  It’s normally a great experience<br>
*- Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VA Medical Center, GA (508)*


> I received a sms text to check into my appointment via phone. I arrived 15 minutes early and after not being called 10 minutes after my appointment i was told the SMS check in never registered. You should not offer that option if it doesn’t actually work. we get a ton of notifications for our appointments this is one i would do without<br>
*- Washington VA Medical Center, DC (688)*


> I checked in on my iPhone and there was some confusion with the attending nurse.<br>
*- Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans' Hospital, CA (605)*


> I was told to check in on my phone, which I thought was weird as I never had to do that before (The person in the travel section of oral surgery was about to eat lunch, there was food on the counter). I checked in twice and when someone came to get me I was told I was not checked in. If checking in via phone doesn't work, why push people to do it? Please take the time to check people in. I waited an extra 20-30 minutes to get called in.<br>
*- Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans' Hospital, TX (671)*


> The "Text 53079" to file for travel reimbursement didn't work - it stated there was no record that I had an appointment that day, though I had just checked in for my scheduled appointment.  The lady at the desk said it doesn't always work and I should go to a different building to the travel office.  Very inconvenient.<br>
*- John J. Cochran Veterans Hospital, MO (657)*


> When I arrived I checked in on my phone buy apparently the system was not working. 
I waited 15 minutes went to check in desk only to find out I was not actually checked in.<br>
*- Durham VA Medical Center, NC (558)*




**Trouble navigating larger facilities**


> When making the appointment, VA rep should note where to go to check in for the appointment.  (I forgot to get that info when I made my appointment, so it took me an extra ten minutes and a couple of extra stops to find where to check in.)<br>
*- Washington VA Medical Center, DC (688)*


> The clinic had changed locations and it was unclear where I should go after checking in at a different location. I checked in at 1350 for a 1400 appointment. I wasn't taken into the exam room by a tech until 1420 and I wasn't seen by the PA until 1440. It was a brand new room for her and it took over 5 minutes for her to get one of the exam pieces odf equipment to work. Not her fault. I assume when I go there for the next appointment, things will be worked out.<br>
*- Sacramento VA Medical Center, CA (612A4)*


> When I reported to the lab check-in I was told to "go to the waiting room." The only waiting room I could see was across the hall, near the business office, so I waited there. And waited. And waited...come to find out, the waiting area for the lab is actually past the Medical Center reception desk, and hidden around a corner. Fortunately, I was curious why it was taking so long so I walked around and eventually heard my name being called, very faintly. In sum, the check-in staff needs to indicate where the lab wait area is.<br>
*- Tibor Rubin VA Medical Center, CA (600)*


> Appointment was on the third floor of building 50.  Construction confused access and we ended up transiting through the ER.  Upon arrival at the third floor, no sign identified the special procedures unit.  Staff had to direct where to check in.<br>
*- Tucson VA Medical Center, AZ (678)*


> There are no signs for Dermatology in the waiting room so it is unclear where to check-in for your appointment. I checked-in with Surgery even though there was no indication that it is where I should have done so. It would be helpful to have a sign for Dermatology so that veterans know where to go.<br>
*- Jamaica Plain VA Medical Center, MA (523)*




**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> When I arrived for my appointment, I was informed by the person checking me in, that my appointment had been cancelled. No call or text message. When I put in for travel expense, the VA wrote back and said I wasn't seen that day, so no travel mileage , enen though I traveled 20-25 min. to get there.<br>
*- Carl T. Hayden Veterans' Administration Medical Center, AZ (644)*


> Level 2 Snow Emergency was declared but not for where i Live but the VA. No one called to tell me that my provider dod not come int work that day and when i arrived was checked in by a receptionist who did not alert me to the fact that my provider was absent. I wouldn't of known any better if after 30 minutes I checked back in p front with the receptionist to discover that my provider was not there. Also those parking lots were hard foor me to get into with my car nd unplowed in the parking area. I can't imagine if someone had a scooter or walker that could of been tragic.<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*


> I arrived early for my appointment, checked in at the front desk and then waited fifteen minutes past my appointment time.  I went to the desk and was told they had no record of my appointment.  I had to wait another hour to see the audiologist.<br>
*- Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VA Medical Center, GA (508)*


> My appointment didn’t take place as it was canceled and I had no knowledge until I attempted to check in. According to the staff person, she called the house phone # and left a message. I advised her that I didn’t receive such message. Then she rescheduled the appointment for a month later, which is very inconvenient.<br>
*- East Orange VA Medical Center, NJ (561)*




**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> Self check in kiosks need to be brought back. Front receptionist are swamped and take way to long to check in vets. They help a vet for 5 mins and then look at their computer screens for another 4 mins before they call another vet. Need more efficient process. I arrived for my appt at 0855am waited until 0917 to get checked in for my 9:20am appointment.<br>
*- West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, CA (691)*


> Return to the Travel Pay Kiosk. This website process is cumbersome and a royal pain in the xxx. Go back to the OLD paper process. Even that is better than the current process.<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital, FL (673)*


> Travel reimbursement is a pain ever since removing the kiosks. Please bring this back…<br>
*- John J. Cochran Veterans Hospital, MO (657)*


> Bring back the checkin kiosks.<br>
*- Harlingen VA Clinic, TX (740)*


> The kiosk was not working.  So it took longer to check in.  The staff didn’t know the kiosks were down<br>
*- Ralph H. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, SC (534)*


> I would like the VA to put a Kiosk Machine at the clinic so I can get reimbursement for travel pay I tried doing it online and it always says incomplete, so I never get imbursed Please help with this problem Thank You<br>
*- Buffalo VA Medical Center, NY (528)*




**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**


> When I arrived for my appointment there wasn’t any one to check in with. It was a bad weather day. When I stopped be the receptionist desk she was very helpful and professional.<br>
*- John J. Cochran Veterans Hospital, MO (657)*


> I entered the building and approached the check-in station. The clerical staff appeared to be having some type of get together. A man who was sitting down told me that he thinks they are having a meeting so he just sat down. I sat down and patiently waited for someone to acknowledge me. The meeting or gathering was over a few minutes later but they did not acknowledge those of us who previously attempted to check-in. I waited for the individual who was ahead of me to approach them to check-in before I did. Need to work on customer service and acknowledging people when they come in for an appointment.<br>
*- Wilmington VA Medical Center, DE (460)*


> Most of the issues are with the non medical staff. When I entered the check in area, there were 3 or 4 patients seated and 0 in line. I stood in the checkin line for minutes while no one else was ahead of me and 4 workers sat at their station. That's the problem at the VA. The non veteran admin staff. In fact. I'm not standing in any lines anymore to check in or out. Ill sit and wait until someone comes to me and after 20 min, I'm walking.<br>
*- Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center, PA (693)*


> When I’m asked to be 30 minutes before my appointment why is there no one checking me in till 11:00 . The window was closed and the receptionist was in there but ignored everyone in the waiting room untill 11:00  I hope I’m never referred to this facility again . Drove around the parking lot for 20-30 minutes looking for a parking place .<br>
*- East Orange VA Medical Center, NJ (561)*


> Every time I came to checkin for my appt, the line is always long. You’ll see 4 or more people in line standing against the wall in the hall. Then when I am the 2nd person in line I see only 1 person working while the 2 other desk is closed. Mind that this is around 1:30pm. 
Or another time I’ll notice the guy closest to the glass window is working more efficiently than the person by the wall closest to the copy machine.<br>
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*


> The check in process at the desk at the Red and Blue teams needs immediate attention. At one point there were standing in line to check in and it moved very slowly. Either get more help on the desk or (better yet) go back to using the VA ID cards and the scanners. This is a weak spot in the whole VA appointment process.<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center, OH (552)*


> My appointment was scheduled for 7:30am, but nobody arrived to check me in until 7:40am, not only that, but after being checked in, I watched while 4 people were taken in for their appointment before me, finally, a nurse came out and called my name, then indicated that for some reason my check-in did not go through the system, so she didn't know that I was waiting to come in. I would like to complete the Doctor though; he is finally a Doctor that knows how to treat patients and listens. Dr Pueblo.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*




**Too many notifications**


> Automated Confirmation for Appointments, and Digital Check Ins are NOT FUNCTIONING Please fix them, or discontinue sending four; five; or even SIX reminder/confirmation texts. 
If my regular appointment confirmations CANNOT be responded to; why send them..? Again, and Again, and Again, and… I have multiple appointments every week. Receiving OVER “50 TEXT Messages”  a week is MORE than redundant. Not mentioning deleting them all several times across multiple devices. Technology really-really is only a convenience when it works.<br>
*- Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center, CO (554)*
