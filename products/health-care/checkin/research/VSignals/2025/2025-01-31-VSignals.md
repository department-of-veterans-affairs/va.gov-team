## Noteworthy Comments

**Like PCI**


> I love the early check in on my cell phone<br>
*- Providence VA Medical Center, RI (650)*


> The auto-check-in app worked well, I checked in while in the parking lot and was already checked in when I walked through the door, no standing in line. Appointment promptly started on time. PA took the time to ensure all my latest information was entered into my records and accurate...nicely done, good experience.<br>
*- Overton Brooks Veterans' Administration Medical Center, LA (667)*




**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**


> I used the online check in. It said that I was checked in but in reality I was not. I finally went up to the desk and asked to verify that I was checked in and was told I was not. I had waited 55 mins before go up and checking. So the online check in for me did not work.<br>
*- James H. Quillen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, TN (621)*


> I had an appointment for 9:30 am and when I got to the parking lot, I checked in according to the text I received. When I got to the fourth floor I took a seat waiting to be called. At that point the nurse behind the station asked me if I was PII_NAME and that she had already called my name before I got from the parking lot to the fourth floor. She was very informative and took care of me very graciously. At 9:30 she was finished and I had a seat waiting for my 9:30 appointment. Around 10:30 I finally got to see my doctor who told me I would have to be the first patient in the morning or else I would have to wait this long because she was busy. Whoever does the appointment needs to make them in 45 minutes interval instead of a half hour.<br>
*- C.W. Bill Young Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (516)*




**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**


> I recommend when an appointment is cancelled patient be notified immediately to reschedule. Sometimes I do not know that my appointment is cancelled until I get my update or check online.  Then I don't even know what clinic if I have multiple appointments.<br>
*- Richmond VA Medical Center, VA (652)*


> I received a phone call reminder on the 22nd saying I had an appointment on the 23rd at 0945. I was not aware of this appointment, and it was not listed in my va.gov account, so I called the appointment line to confirm. I called in and was told that I had an appointment for my CPAP. I asked if I was supposed to bring my CPAP in or not and the person didn't know, but suggested I bring it just in case. I went to the clinic to check in for my appointment and was told that I didn't have an appointment. So, I wasted an hour of my time driving there and back and waiting in line.<br>
*- Cheyenne VA Medical Center, WY (442)*


> I hade an appointment yesterday I was so mad I checking in I waiting for 45 minutes they never call me when I go to the clerk she told me my docter is not here today I was so peace off that’s disrespect full<br>
*- West Palm Beach VA Medical Center, FL (548)*


> I scheduled this appointment for a specific concern and I just happened to mention that I would see you in March; the nurse checked and the Mar appointment had been canceled. That appointment was to redo my blood work, so it couldn't have been done during this appointment.  I had made plans all around the March appointment, which had been scheduled at least 4 months. I was told it was canceled because you can't have two appointments at one time. What is the point in telling what you're coming in for if it's not being looked at. It should have been obvious they were different. Plus I don’t believe I was ever notified that it was canceled. I was fortunate that it was caught if not I would  have been a very unhappy, more so than I was having to move it a month later.<br>
*- Biloxi VA Medical Center, MS (520)*




**Concerns with check in at kiosks**


> The two people at the reception desk up front did not appear knowledgeable about the operations of the clinic or any VA matters. One person was busily engaged in doing a crossword puzzle and barely looked up when I asked a question. I was told I could check in at the Kiosk, but it did not work.<br>
*- Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, CA (664)*


> You have three employees at the “CHECK IN” area and before I say anything, I am told to go to the check in machine. This is the most DISRESPECTFUL thing a veteran can be told. I’m not there to use a machine. If they are not there to check in veterans, change the SIGN. 
The use of a 80 pulse old gentleman ushering veterans to the check in machine is wrong. You could use him to greet veterans without standing in front of them or taking ME by the arm to use the check in machine.<br>
*- Central Alabama VA Medical Center-Montgomery, AL (619)*




**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**


> need faster checkins, when check in is overloaded check out should assist.....<br>
*- C.W. Bill Young Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (516)*


> The front desk personnel do not care how long you stand in line to check in or check out and they do not care if you can hear them or not. The hide behind their computer screens and do not care if you die in front of them.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*


> When I arrived at Primary Care, Section D to check in....
I had to wait about 4 or 5 minutes before checking in and speaking with a VAMC, Primary Care, Section D Front Desk Clerk. At the time, there were only two available Front Desk Clerks there however, several other chairs at the Front Desk were empty; no other Front Desk Clerks were scheduled to be there.  Why?<br>
*- Sacramento VA Medical Center, CA (612A4)*


> The Dental Checkin counter is undermanned.  
Myself and other veterans had to stand 10-15 minutes waiting on service with Noone there at the Checkin Counter.<br>
*- Chillicothe VA Medical Center, OH (538)*


> I had to wait about 15 minutes to check in for my appointment. No one was at the check in desks. Both of the women that were working the desk were late that day.<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*


> The two people at the reception desk up front did not appear knowledgeable about the operations of the clinic or any VA matters. One person was busily engaged in doing a crossword puzzle and barely looked up when I asked a question. I was told I could check in at the Kiosk, but it did not work.<br>
*- Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, CA (664)*


> Took 20min to check in. Only had one new girl checking people in and two people standing behind her. After about 10min one of the persons went over and checked in a couple people and then went to the back.<br>
*- Orlando VA Medical Center, FL (675)*


> Use a check-in kiosk to sign in faster. One or two open windows with several people in line just ro check-in, took 20 minutes.<br>
*- Michael E. DeBakey Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, TX (580)*




**Too many notifications**


> I feel I very too many messages to confirm, text and phone calls even after I confirm I still get more confirmations. But the check in process is very simple and easy on the phone. The app and notifications and easy access to all info is great and convenient<br>
*- West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, CA (691)*
