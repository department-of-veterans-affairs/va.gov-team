## Noteworthy Comments

### Check-in specific: 
>
> I received a text before my appointment time allowing me to check into my appointment and file my travel voucher while walking through the hospital to my appointment.
>
> I totally love the check-in procedure using my iPhone sitting in the parking lot. I got totally checked in and my mileage turned in. Then I went inside and had the best visit I've ever had at any doctor's office. Thank you, job well done.
>
> I want to let you know that this was the 1st time I received a text message that allowed me to check-in online and it also automatically allowed me to submit travel reimbursement. I'm IMPRESSED with this system and would love it if I could use this system for all my future appointments. This is a big step in the right direction and good use of technology!
>
> I like the new option to check in on the phone, wait time was less than 5 minutes. 
>
> First, let me say, check-in was great. I checked in online when I got there and was able to check in and get my travel reimbursement submitted with no problem.
>
> The smart phone check in works on some visits but not others.
>
> On the new text to check in, it needs to work better. I thought I checked in but had to check in in-person. 
>
> It would be nice if the administrators would find a check-in method and stick with it. Every time I come it is different.
>
> Use more QR codes for check in. There is a ridiculous amount of time waiting in lines for check in.
>
> The check in process is better than trying to scan through my phone (that didn't work).
>
> Online check in froze and I couldn't complete the process. I had the front desk try and they couldn't do it because it said I was in it? They need the override authority to complete the process of the patient. I asked her to just act like I never tried to do online check in and she could not. Please help fix this problem and update the app. 
 
### Concerns we're already addressing:
>
> During my visit I was not informed of any cancellation. The check-in had no information. I was rescheduled for January, by the time I reached home I was rescheduled for February.

### Possible future enhancements
>
> Directions on how to navigate the facility or where the appointment is in the building on the mobile application.  
> 
> Cell data does not work in {} VA clinic. Need wifi added for online check-in.
>
> I hope our phone check in for Rx and appointment info doesn't get more complex.
>
