## Noteworthy Comments

**Ease of use**

> I find it difficult to check in online with my phone. At times, the process doesn't work and the front desk has to check me in for my appointment. I feel as if I am bothering them. 

**Wayfinding**

> I used the QR code to check in at the Green Desk but there are three waiting areas and the text message did not say which one to wait in. I was far away and did not hear my name when it was time. 

**Thinking they're checked in, but not checked in**

> I checked in for my appointment using the scan a barcode at the clinic. When I finished the online portion, I sat down and waited until 15 min past my appointment time. Then I went to the counter, only to find out that apparently I was not fully signed in for my appointment. Nothing from the online check-in process told me to go to the counter. 

> Upon entering there was a prominent sign stating I could use my phone to check in via text. I did this and sat down. I found out later that I almost missed my appointment because I had not gone to the window to check in!

**Travel reimbursement**

> Filling out paperwork to receive travel pay is ridiculous. And it's discouraging. 

**QR code issues**

> Get rid of QR code at check in it messed up my bank account. 

> It seemed like the new check-in procedure would be a snap, yet once I scanned the bar code upon entering a screen came up with multiple requests that I had no idea what they meant or if I was even supposed to use them. I pressed the most logical choice and was immediately transferred to some site that wanted my credit card number. Did not seem to me that this was faster. 

**Cancelled appointments**

> I checked in using the text service, received the information and did the check-in. When I wasn't called for my appointment I approached the counter to check-in again. I was later told by the technician that the check-in showed that I cancelled the appointment. 

> When I get a text asking to confirm appointment with a reply Y, I reply Y with the number and then get a second confirmation saying I am confirmed for said appointment with a request to complete a pre-check-in with a link to a web page that then says, "Your appointment has been cancelled."
