## Noteworthy Comments

**Ease of use**

> The sign that reads if you're not being seen in 15 minutes, check in with the front desk. It's very encouraging.

> Both check-in and pickup were pleasant and quick thanks to the knowledgeable and friendly staff.

**Mobile comments**

> The check in via text is great!

> The new check in procudre isn't compatible with older cells that don't have QR. Plus the size of the older cell systems "smaller screen" older vets can't see the screens.

> New smartphone system won't let you check in for labs. Clerk had to check me in even though I had done so on my phone.

**Areas for improvement**

> When I checked in they told me I couldn't check in early. That was confusing.

> The ability to check in by phone was not available at this facility even though there were signs everywhere saying one could do so.

> I found concerning that upon confirming my appointment multiple times, checking in online I was instructed to complete an additional form to check in. Why all the redundancy?

> For all my VA appointments so far, I have been asked to check in 15 minutes early. All that has been required of me is to check in so I am there early but end up just waiting for the 15 minutes. Not sure what could improve this challenge.

> I showed up on 3.20.2023 for an appointment. I was told it was cancelled. It was frustrating because I know how important it is for me to make my appointments as other veterans might be waiting. I wasn't notified in advance of this cancellation until arrived to check in. Advance notice would be great.

> Too many require to log in i.e. my health, Travel, ID me, E authorization, DS log in. Totally confusing. Impossible to connect via phones for questions. Too many passwords, codes, etc. I gave up. Can't get travel reimb. Was simple with kiosk. I am 91. Make it simpler, please!

**Possible future opportunities**

> Please send email or letter correspondence anytime the check in or out procedures change, send a message notifying what they are. The previous visit I could use my VA card at a kiosk or a QR code. This visit was only QR code. I was confused. Lab check in was different as well.

> I would like to suggest once you're logged in to all one department you're able to login for all appointments for that day.
