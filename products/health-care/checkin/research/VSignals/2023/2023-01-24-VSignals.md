General check-in feedback includes any comments where the methods used to check-in can’t be determined or any comment generally referring to the “new” check-in process. With the “new” comments, it can’t be determined if they are referring to just the removal of the kiosk, checking in with staff, or using mobile check-in. This section also gathers any feedback about the overall process, such as “Check-in was great.”
