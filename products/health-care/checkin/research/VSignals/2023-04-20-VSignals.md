## Noteworthy Comments

**Mobile comments**

> I thought checking in with cell phones was kind of dumb, since phone signal in the hospital sucks anways. Please put the machines back or has us check in with your wonderful staff instead.

> The Check-In procedure is confuting.  There is a sign on the door that instruct one to scan the OCR code to check in.  I did do and received a text telling me "I was all checked in".  It was only after sitting in the waiting room awhile that  I learned I must also check in with a receptionist.

> Upon arrival I found that there was a new check-in program using smart phones.  I found the old system to be easier.  I had trouble logging in on the new system.  I received some help from a staff member and was able to log in but now I need to know where in my phone this information gets stored for my next visit.  It would have been nice to have advanced notice of the change.

> I like the check in by scanning the QR code.

> I do not understand the "check-in" process now. Text message is more involved than using my VA card.

> I found the new checkin process annoying. The kiosks worked fine, and there are humans sitting 10 feet away perfectly capable of doing it too. Having a QR code taped over the kiosk screen with the cord coiled up and dragging over it is unprofessional and unnecessary, and all it did was send me to a website to go through several pages I could have done online the day. Cut it out.

> Don't like having to use phone to check into an appointment....The people behind the desk should can do it or a kiosk.

> The VA Center removed the check in kiosks and places where you apply for mileage. A poster said use a smart phone. Are you kidding! Many of these old vets donâ€™t have one nor can they follow all the steps. No one there to help you. Size 12 font on a piece of paper said you could fill out a mileage form and hand it it. I am glad I saw this as the web sites werenâ€™t working. This is a mess.

> I was 20 minutes early for my appointment after being asked to be there 15 minutes early. I watched the waiting room fill and empty 3 times. I was finally taken in after notifying the receptionist that I would be leaving after an hour and 40 minutes of waiting. Personally, I blame the kiosk for issue. When I check with a live person I don't seem to be lost in the system.

> "fix problems with check in system.  
stop sending so many appt reminders, one is enough."

> Drop the check-in kiosks and smart phone apps.  Many of the people I've talked to said it was time consuming, redundant, and problematic.

> The new text check in does not work for everyone.  It was unclear which window to check in for primary care.  Weigh in should not be done by the waiting area for all to see.

> Bring back the check in kiosk. A lot of us Veterans do not and will not get smartphones. Checking in used to be simple, not so much now. I don't have a smartphone and will not be getting one in the near future. There was nothing wrong with the check-in kiosks.

> Everything at the Hickory clinic usually runs very smoothly. I miss the automated check ins, and the new system that has you take a picture of the QR code never works for me, so I end up waiting for an available person to check in with.

> The new check in procedures at the V.A. clinic is still having problems, tried to check-in using the new system and it didn't respond back until after my appointment. Plus there was only one line open to help with check-in with alot of veterans waiting which made us late for are appointments

> I used the App at the office to check in and it was not working . I got a response from the App an hour later saying I was not checked in. ?????

> "When I entered the facility, I did not know where to pre-check in, as in the past. Additionally, the reminder text message link fro pre-checking is no longer valid."
