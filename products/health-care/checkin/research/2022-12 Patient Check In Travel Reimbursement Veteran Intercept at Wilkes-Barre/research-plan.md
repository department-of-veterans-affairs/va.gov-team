# Research Plan for Patient Check-In Travel Reimbursement Veteran Intercept at Wilkes-Barre 2022-12

Last modified: December 22, 2022


## Background 

The Patient Check In (PCI) product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The Modernized Check-In Experience Team created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check in” through VA.gov. I.e., letting clinic staff know that the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 

     - Confirming their appointment
     - Reviewing their contact information 
     - Reviewing their emergency contact information
     - Reviewing their next of kin information 

- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment

### Travel Reimbursement 

In June 2022, the Beneficiary Travel Reimbursement Path Analysis Team completed a review of the VA general health care travel reimbursement program, which included recommendations on improvements to the Veteran experience. One of those recommendations was to integrate travel reimbursement into the patient check-in ecosystem. 

As a result of that work, the Modernized Check-In Experience Team began developing user flows and wireframes to visualize the integration and gather feedback from Veterans. 

The travel reimbursement feature within the PCI application will be piloted in late January or early February with Wilkes-Barre Health Care System clinics that have eCheck-in enabled.

## Research Goals 

The purpose of this research is to **get feedback from Veterans on the new travel reimbursement feature in eCheck-in** on ease of use and what, if any, expectations were unmet, specifically around travel reimbursement tasks.  

### Research Questions

#### Primary Questions 

1. How easy or difficult is it to file a travel reimbursement claim during check in?
1. What is the cognitive load needed for Veterans to review and confirm their travel reimbursement claim eligibility?  
1. Is it clear or confusing to check in for an appointment and submit a travel reimbursement claim at the same time?
1. How well or not so well does filing a travel reimbursement claim during check-in meet Veteran’s expectations?  
1. How easy or difficult is it to understand the status (and associated next steps) of a travel reimbursement claim (whether filed or not) and check-in on the confirmation pages?  
1. What would Veterans change or add, if anything, to improve filing a travel reimbursement claim during check in? E.g., edit the address, upload receipts, file later, etc.  

#### Secondary Questions 

7. What’s most confusing or difficult about the mobile check in process (including pre-check-in)? 
8. What would Veterans change or add, if anything, to make the mobile check in process easier?
9. Would Veterans be more likely to complete mobile check in by responding to 1 or 2 text messages versus the current experience?  

### Hypothesis 

#### Primary

1. Veterans will think filing a travel reimbursement claim during check in is easy, but those that aren’t eligible may think it’s neither easy nor difficult.  
1. Veterans will be able to review and answer each of the travel reimbursement claim eligibility questions in a short amount of time.  
1. Veterans will think it’s easy and convenient to file a travel reimbursement claim while checking in for their appointment. 
1. Veterans will be pleasantly surprised at how few steps are required to file a travel reimbursement claim within the PCI application. 
1. Veterans will think the status of their travel reimbursement claim and check-in on the confirmation pages are easy to understand, but would like to see more definiteness or plain language around why their claim couldn’t be submitted and how to check the status of their claim. 
1. Veterans will have suggestions for supporting other travel types and other travel reimbursement tasks. E.g., edit the address, upload receipts, file later, file for other appointments, etc.  

#### Secondary

7. Veterans will identify the most confusing or difficult aspects of mobile check in to be the scanning the QR code and texting VA step and the perception that they thought they already completed check in by completing pre-check-in (e.g., not understanding the steps involved in the PCI workflow).  
8. Veterans will recommend removing the scanning the QR code and texting VA step of the PCI workflow. 
9. Some Veterans will prefer responding to 1 or 2 text messages to check in for their appointment, while other Veterans will feel they already receive too many VA text messages. 

## Method

This research will be conducted as a Veteran intercept during the check in process at Wilkes-Barre Health Care System clinics that have eCheck-in enabled. 

We will work with Wilkes-Barre Health Care System Health Administration Services (HAS) staff to determine the best approach for Veteran intercepts.    

Our goal is to intercept at least 5 Veterans each at no fewer than 5 clinics that would like to check in for their appointment using eCheck-In and file a travel reimbursement claim. After assisting those Veterans through the eCheck-in process (and confirming with clinic staff that they’re checked in), we will ask them a few questions to get feedback on the new travel reimbursement feature in Patient Check-In. 

1 or 2 researchers will be conducting this research.
