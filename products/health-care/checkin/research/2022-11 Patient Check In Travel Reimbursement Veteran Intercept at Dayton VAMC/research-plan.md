# Research Plan for Patient Check-In Travel Reimbursement Veteran Intercept at Dayton VA Medical Center 2022-11  

Last modified: November 22, 2022


## Background 

The Patient Check In (PCI) product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The Modernized Check-In Experience Team created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check in” through VA.gov. I.e., letting clinic staff know that the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 

     - Confirming their appointment
     - Reviewing their contact information 
     - Reviewing their emergency contact information
     - Reviewing their next of kin information 

- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment

### Travel Reimbursement 

In June 2022, the Beneficiary Travel Reimbursement Path Analysis Team completed a review of the VA general health care travel reimbursement program, which included recommendations on improvements to the Veteran experience. One of those recommendations was to integrate travel reimbursement into the patient check-in ecosystem. 

As a result of that work, the Modernized Check-In Experience Team began developing user flows and wireframes to visualize the integration and gather feedback from Veterans. 

The travel reimbursement feature within the PCI application will be piloted in late November or early December with Dayton VA Medical Center clinics that have eCheck-in enabled.

## Research Goals 

The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans on the new travel reimbursement feature in eCheck-in on ease of use and what, if any, expectations were unmet, specifically around travel reimbursement tasks.  

### Research Questions

#### Primary Questions 

1. How easy or difficult is it to file a travel reimbursement claim during check in?
1. What is the cognitive load needed for Veterans to review and confirm their travel reimbursement claim eligibility?  
1. Is it clear or confusing to check in for an appointment and submit a travel reimbursement claim at the same time?
1. How well or not so well does filing a travel reimbursement claim during check-in meet Veteran’s expectations?  
1. How easy or difficult is it to understand the status (and associated next steps) of a travel reimbursement claim (whether filed or not) and check-in on the confirmation pages?  
1. What would Veterans change or add, if anything, to improve filing a travel reimbursement claim during check in? E.g., edit the address, upload receipts, file later, etc.
