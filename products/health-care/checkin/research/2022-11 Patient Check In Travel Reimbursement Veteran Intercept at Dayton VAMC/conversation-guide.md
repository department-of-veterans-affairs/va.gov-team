Last modified: November 28, 2022

## Clinic Arrival Logistics

Upon arrival at the clinics, speak with staff on how to conduct Veteran intercepts. Specifically, seek responses to the following: 

- Do staff want to do the Veterans intercepts or can the researchers?  
Are there certain Veterans to intercept or avoid? I.e., according to patient flags. 

## Intercept Intro - 1 minute 

Hello, are you checking in for an appointment?

Great. Would you like to check in using your smartphone today? 

Great. My name is Ben and I’m a researcher for the VA. I’m here to help get you checked in using your smartphone and gather feedback on the mobile check in process. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions while helping you check in? It will help us continue to improve the check in process for Veterans like yourself. This is completely voluntary. 

*If no:* 

*Point them to the check in poster or to the MSAs.* 

*If yes:* 

Thank you. If you’d like to stop at any time, just let me know and we will.
