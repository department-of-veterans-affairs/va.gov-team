# Research Plan for [Check-in Experience Team, LoROTA Standalone Mileage-Only Travel Reimbursement Application, July, 2025]

## Background üèóÔ∏è
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>

`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Veterans who have medical appointments at VA health facilities that use Oracle Health EHR software (formerly CERNER) have a need to be able to file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim on the day of their appointment. The greatest value right now for this consortium of Veterans and patient tracking at clinics is to offer Veterans the ability to file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim using VA's Low Risk One Time Authentication (LoROTA) to streamline the "sign in" process for Veterans.**

`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**The online travel reimbursement feature for smartphones will be piloted at a VA health facility where Oracle Health use is mature, e.g., Portland or Columbus. Since in-person research is not feasible at this time, we plan to conduct a survey after participants have filed a claim through the LoROTA standalone mileage-only travel reimbursement application to gather insights and feedback about the experience.**

`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**The feature we are testing is a new iteration of the travel pay flow that will be the travel pay feature at OH facilities. Veterans who have used check-in, pre-check-in, or travel pay prior should have a general level of familiarity with this application and user flow.**

## Research Goals ü•Ö	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Gather feedback from Veterans on the LoROTA standalone mileage-only travel reimbursement application‚Äôs ease of use**

`2.` **Collect open-ended feedback from Veterans about the updated experience of signing in and filing a travel reimbursement claim through the LoROTA standalone mileage-only travel reimbursement application**

`3.` **Identify any challenges Veterans experience when filing a claim via the the LoROTA standalone mileage-only travel reimbursement application** 

### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**The learnings from this study will help us understand Veterans‚Äô experience with the LoROTA standalone mileage-only travel reimbursement application, identify opportunities for improvement, and make any necessary changes to the content, UI, or user flow.**

### Research questions

**`1.`How do Veterans find out about filing a travel reimbursement claim by texting travel to 54804?**

**`2.`How confident do Veterans feel that their travel reimbursement claim was filed?**

**`3.`How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to file a travel reimbursement claim?**

**`4.`Do Veterans understand what happens next in the reimbursement process?**

**`5.`How satisfied were Veterans with the experience of initiating and filing a claim?**

**`6.`How likely are Veterans to use this tool to file for travel reimbursement in the future?**

**`7.`Do Veterans have any open ended feedback related to signing in and/or filing a claim?**

### Hypotheses
---

**`1.`How do Veterans find out about filing a travel reimbursement claim by texting travel to 54804?**

- Most Veterans will find out through a poster at the clinic or through an online resource.

**`2.`How confident do Veterans feel that their travel reimbursement claim was filed?**

- Veterans will feel confident that their travel reimbursement claim was filed.

**`3.`How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to file a travel reimbursement claim?**

 - Veterans will find it extremely easy to file a claim from their smartphones.

**`4.`Do Veterans understand what happens next in the reimbursement process?**

- Veterans will understand what comes next in the travel reimbursement process; their claim will be processed/reviewed and they'll be alerted to their claim's status via other tools. 

**`5.`How satisfied were Veterans with the experience of initiating and filing a claim?**

- Veterans will be satisfied with the experience of using the LoROTA standalone mileage-only travel reimbursement application.

**`6.`How likely are Veterans to use this tool to file for travel reimbursement in the future?**

- While initial adoption may provide a challenge, once Veterans use this application they will be very likely to use this tool in the future.

**`7.`Do Veterans have any open ended feedback related to signing in and/or filing a claim?**

- Veterans will occasionally provide open ended feedback related to signing in and/or filing a claim

## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è
***Describe the method you‚Äôre planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.*** 
	
- `User acceptance testing (UAT) - survey`

</details>

**Veterans who complete the ‚Äòhappy path‚Äô (e.g., successfully file a claim through the LoROTA standalone mileage-only travel reimbursement application) will see a screen asking them to complete a survey about their experience. 
On the backend, this will be a Google Form set up by Perigean, to create the segmented capture of participants based on the criteria outlined below. 
After Veterans enter into the Perigean database, they will be routed to the survey in Optimal Workshop.**
