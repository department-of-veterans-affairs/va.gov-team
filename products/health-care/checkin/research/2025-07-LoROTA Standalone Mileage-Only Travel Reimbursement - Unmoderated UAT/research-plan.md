# Research Plan for [Check-in Experience Team, LoROTA Standalone Milege-Only Travel Reimbursement Application, July, 2025]

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>

`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**[Veterans who have medical appointments at VA health facilities that use Oracle Health EHR software (formerly CERNER) have a need to be able to file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim on the day of their appointment. The greatest value right now for this consortium of Veterans and patient tracking at clinics is to offer Veterans the ability to file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim using VA's Low Risk One Time Authentication (LoROTA) to streamline the "sign in" process for Veterans.]**

`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**[The online travel reimbursement feature for smartphones will be piloted at a VA health facility where Oracle Health use is mature, e.g., Portland or Columbus. Since in-person research is not feasible at this time, we plan to conduct a survey after participants have filed a claim through the LoROTA standalone mileage-only travel reimbursement application to gather insights and feedback about the experience. ]**

`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**[The feature we are testing is a new iteration of the travel pay flow that will be the travel pay feature at OH facilities. Veterans who have used check-in, pre-check-in, or travel pay prior should have a general level of familiarity with this application and user flow.]**

### Research questions

**`1.`[How do Veterans find out about filing a travel reimbursement claim by texting travel to 54804?]**

**`2.`[How confident do Veterans feel that their travel reimbursement claim was filed?]**

**`3.`[How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to file a travel reimbursement claim?]**

**`4.`[Do Veterans understand what happens next in the reimbursement process?]**

## Methodology  🛠️
***Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.*** 
	
- `User acceptance testing (UAT) - survey`

</details>

**[Veterans who complete the ‘happy path’ (e.g., successfully file a claim through the LoROTA standalone mileage-only travel reimbursement application) will see a screen asking them to complete a survey about their experience. 
On the backend, this will be a Google Form set up by Perigean, to create the segmented capture of participants based on the criteria outlined below. 
After Veterans enter into the Perigean database, they will be routed to the survey in Optimal Workshop.
