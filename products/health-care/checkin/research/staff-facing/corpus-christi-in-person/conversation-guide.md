## Intro - 1 minute 

Hello. My name is [Kristen or Nira] and I’m a researcher on the patient check-in team. We are interested in learning about how the new pre-check-in and check-in process has been working and impacting your job. Our goal is to listen and use your feedback to continue to improve the check-in process for Veterans and staff like yourself. 

Do you mind if I observe you interacting with Veterans and ask you a few questions? This is completely voluntary. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

## Section 6: Beneficiary Travel with Travel Clerks 

### Intro - 1 minute 

Hello. My name is Ben and I’m a researcher on the Patient Check-In (PCI) team. We are conducting research on behalf of OCTO to help evaluate how travel pay can be incorporated into Patient Check-In. 

What we’d like to do today is ask some questions that we’ve prepared to help our team better understand the travel reimbursement process both from the staff-side and the Veteran-side. We’ve been working together with other VA employees that are knowledgeable about the travel reimbursement process, so hopefully you’ll find that our questions are much more nuanced, looking for specific information, versus high-level questions. And from those questions, we’d like to listen and gather your responses. Our goal is to collect as much information as possible to improve the reimbursement process for Veterans.    
How does that sound? Any questions?  

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: 

- We want to hear your honest opinions. We will not be offended by any opinions you express. We welcome your feedback. 
- Also, are you comfortable if we record this session? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis. And, no comments are attributed to individuals. 
- Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. 

*Start recording.* 

I have started recording. And, once again for the record, are you comfortable if I record this session today? 

### Section 1: General Questions  

- We’ve heard that claims can get automatically approved. How does one get automatically approved? 
- What factors or information from Veterans can help reduce the chance a claim is manually reviewed (vs. automatically approved)?  
- What else causes issues with a claim? For example, we’ve heard that abbreviations or punctuations in the mailing address cause issues, missing checkboxes, etc. 
- When submitting a claim, are Veterans required to specify whether the appointment was a scheduled appointment or walk-in? If so, how do Veterans provide that information? Is there an appointment type field?  
- Roughly, what percentage of reimbursement claims get automatically approved? 
- Roughly, what percentage of claims get denied?
- Does the percentage of denied claims vary by submission modality? E.g., paper, in-person with staff kiosk, BTSSS, etc. 
- What happens when a claim gets denied? 
- How do Veterans get alerted about a denied claim?
- How does the process differ between submission modality? E.g., paper, in-person with staff kiosk, BTSSS, etc.   
- What are the typical reasons for a claim getting denied? 
- Do you know what types of notifications a Veteran receives when they submit a claim? For example, a confirmation email. 
- How do the notifications differ between submission modality? E.g., paper, in-person with staff kiosk, BTSSS, etc.  
- Do Veterans receive any other types of notifications? For example, when a claim is being reviewed, when a claim is approved, etc.    
- Do Veterans have to be checked out by the clinic in order to receive travel pay? If so, how do travel assistants check if they’ve been checked out? Do travel assistants have to review each claim and check VistA, for example?
- What happens when they're not checked out?  
- How long does it normally take to review a claim? I.e., the time from when a claim is submitted to when it is reviewed and approved.
- Roughly, what percentage of claims are for Veterans driving their own vehicle (vs. another transportation method)? 
- What are some of the other most common methods of transportation that Veterans file reimbursement for? 
- How often do claims for driving their own vehicle include additional expenses, such as meals, hotel, etc.? What are, typically, those expenses for?  
- Is it possible for a Veteran to add other expenses to a claim that’s already been submitted? For example, they forgot to add an expense. If so, how would a Veteran add that expense? Is it a separate claim or can they amend the existing claim?
- What (other) issues might arise related to amending a claim?    
- Is it possible for a Veteran or caregiver to file a travel reimbursement claim, but not actually be eligible to receive benefits? And, if so, would travel assistants spot that the Veteran or caregiver is not eligible during the review process?    
- Is eligibility for travel reimbursement determined when a Veteran receives their disability rating or when a caregiver gets approved through the caregiver program? Or, does approval for travel reimbursement happen separately? If so, what is that process and when does it happen?   
- Is it common for a Veteran to know whether or not they’re eligible to receive travel reimbursement? Is it common knowledge? 
- Is it possible for a claim to get submitted, but the Veteran has another issue that prevents them from receiving payment, such as their direct deposit isn’t set up? Does that happen? If so, what happens as a result? 
- Are there any safeguards, to your knowledge, that prevent a Veteran who’s ineligible to receive travel pay from filing? For example, maybe they can’t log in to the AccessVA claim portal. 
- Do most Veterans know that they can only file one claim per facility trip and not per appointment?  
- What can Veterans file when they have to visit two facilities in one day? 
- How often does it happen that Veterans file two claims for one day? What do travel assistants do when this happens? Are they able to easily determine the appropriate reimbursement from the claims? 
- Do you have any questions or comments for me?
