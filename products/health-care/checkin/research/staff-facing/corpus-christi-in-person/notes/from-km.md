# Corpus Christi Research Trip 
Kristen McConnell’s Notes

## July 19

### Corpus Christi VA Clinic
5283 Old Brownsville Road

![CorpusChristiVAClinic-Layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66287082/182220372-8216f3db-179f-4993-a429-0f19bc053650.jpg)

When you entered two security guards did a COVID screening. Immediately upon entering there is the check-in area and the only waiting room within the Outpatient clinic. There were 6 MSAs stationed within the waiting room. 3 oversaw check-in. 1 oversaw community care. 2 oversaw check-outs and scheduling next appointments, but they could also complete check-in. To the right when entering was a desk for one volunteer and the door to the VA police.

Observations:
- There were limited amounts of signage on the walls, so the check-in posters stuck out.
- A huge check-in poster blocked sight of the kiosk from the front door. The kiosk was behind the poster. 

#### MSA 1
- Has observed Veterans having problems texting/creating the text message. 
- Believes that the Annex’s (the second location visited today) physical layout causes a problem for check-ins. 
- VSE is not as user friendly as VetLink
  - Fields are greyed out 
  - Have to click on a special needs box to add a comment.
- Educating Veterans about check-in can take 2-5 minutes per Veteran
- Check-in NPS: 6/7
  - Reasons given for rating:
    - Needs simpler wording
    - Veterans can’t see on their phone. Too small of a screen.
    - Needs to be a 2-3 step process
      - It is too much to read.
- Pre-check-in NPS: 8/9
  - Reasons given for rating:
    - Needs to make the transition from pre-check-in to check-in better
    - However, likes the review of information before an appointment
- Reported hearing/seeing this scenario occur: The SMS URL link took too long to show up, so the Veteran though that they were checked in after texting “check in.”
- They don’t really look at the check-in statuses in VSE-GUI.
  - They don’t use VSE-CS, but they have a log-in.
- Canceled appointments
  - The VA cancels appointments if a provider is out sick or on vacation
  - Their supervisor has to let them know what to do (if appointments should be canceled or if they could be covered by someone else)
  - From the time that they know a provider is out on short notice to the time that the MSA is told to start canceling can be 1 - 2 hours. This is due to a plan needing to be made. 
  - If it is last minute, Veterans may already be in route, because of the rural population coming to this clinic.
  - If there is more notice, 
    - the MSA gets emailed a list of patients with the date or date range that need changed/canceled/rescheduled.
    - The MSA attempts to call the Veteran 2 times to notify them of the cancellation and reschedule. If the Veteran doesn’t pick up the phone or call back, then they send a letter.

#### MSA 2
- They aren’t always sure what each error means, so they have trouble assisting the Veterans sometimes.
  - They sited the no appointment error message as one that they find confusing, because they will look into the system and see an appointment, so they don’t know why the Veteran got the message.
    - After further probing, we realized that this occurs a lot for the CVT appointments.
- They said it seems like a lot of Veterans attempt PCI, but get messages to see someone.
- They do a lot of education with the Veteran.  
  - It can take 2- 5 minutes for each Veterans.
  - They have had to do the process for the Veteran.
  - This time on education and the amount of Veterans coming to the desk can make you get a line. If there is a line, then the MSA just doesn’t do PCI. They manually check everyone in, since it is faster.
- There are “a lot coming up [to the check-in desk] to check-in than before.”
- For the first couple of days, they had staff our front by the entrance.
- VSE-GUI Feedback
  - What you can change is good
    - Has to go to Vista to change:
      - Emergency Contact
      - Residential Address
  - VSE is similar to Vetlink, but VistA is old
  - What statuses do you utilize?
    - They look if the Veteran completed pre-check-in as a clue to know that the Veteran may use their phone for check-in.
    - Pre-check-in completed and check-in completed.
  - “It is good.”
  - Uses the colors in the calendar part of VSE-GUI to do verify check-in statuses.
- VSE-CS Feedback
  - Vaccine appts are walk-ins and providers can’t see it
  - All of the MSAs have log-ins to VSE-CS, but they don’t use it.
    - It mirrors VistA.
  - Due to problems with VSE-CS, the nurses come out to the waiting room and call everyone’s name who has an appointment, whether why display as checked in or not. They don’t a Veteran to be just sitting in the waiting room for a long time or be no show, because they aren’t checked in, but they think that they are.
- MSAs do sometimes message nursing on Teams. When problems occur with check-in then that equals problems with communication with nurses. Nursing may move onto the next patient.
- Veterans think that when they completed pre-check-n that they are checked in.
  - Some comes up to the desk to verify that they are indeed checked in.
- Pre-check-in NPS: 5/6
- Check-in NPS: 4
  - Reasons for check-in rating:
    - Doesn’t like it for our population (older/non-tech savvy) 
    - That is requires the use of a phone
- Beneficiary Travel
  - It can be completed after check-in is started.
  - This MSA does help Veterans submit a claim on the kiosk.
    - Most often Veterans are just insecure about filing that way and they help them through the process.
  - When you do have to refer a Veteran to the travel office?
    - They normally have the Veteran call, because the travel office is so far from Corpus Christi.
    - It is most often, because a Veteran hasn’t gotten paid for a claim that they submitted.
- Canceled appointments
  - Appointments aren’t often canceled by the VA. It happens when a provider is out sick or on vacation. 
  - Another reason can be if the Veteran hasn’t completed any labs within a long time. The provider will ask to cancel and reschedule for a later time after the labs are completed.
  - To notify the Veteran that an appointment was canceled, the MSA will call the Veteran 2 times. If they don’t answer then they will send a letter.

#### Veteran 1
- While talking to MSA 2, a Veteran came up to the window. They had utilized PCI, but received the insurance review message.

#### Veteran 2
- They came to the check-in desk and spoke with MSA 2. They had a text message that they had an appointment in the morning, but they didn’t. It was a cancelled appointment but the message was still sent out. 

#### Nursing
- We talked to 5 nurses and 1 nursing manager as a group
- Nursing manager - Things don’t show up in VSE-CS, so nurses have stopped using it.
- Nurse - yes, the list won’t show up. I go to home, then daily, then clinic, then get an error.
  - Clinic management have to reassign
  - Non scheduled, such as vaccines, homelessness, and walk-in appointments, don’t show up in the lists.
- They can’t tell if a patient is checked in or not.
  - This happens every day, multiple times a day.
- Nurses round now.They go out and call every Veterans to see if they are either whether they show up as checked in or not.
- Veteran check-ins aren’t showing up in VSE-CS.
- Nurses want to know what building the Veterans are at. Veterans go to the wrong location; it happens a few times a week at their location.
  - This was a problem that was occurring when VetLink was enabled, so it isn’t a new problem.
- They like the pre-visit summary, but not that they can’t access it until the day of.
  - They want to pull that information a week ahead of time.
  - They want to print out the pre-visit summary for pre-visit calls.
- Routing sheets and pre-visit summary
  - ![RoutingSheet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66287082/182219119-f25fcf3e-d731-40be-aeb0-7172d9441797.jpg)
  - Want the Vet’s last labs to be pulled into the pre-visit summary
  - They don’t see a lot of value in the Veteran reviewing their med list prior to an appointment; they are just going to ask them to review it again.
  - Would like Veterans to answer/review Clinical Reminders in a pre-visit experience
  - 4 nurses stated that they would like to see behavioral flags within VSE-CS. 
    - It will help them know if security needs to be with a Veteran before they see them (for example)
- They brought up that Veterans don’t understand clinic names. 
  - The nurse manager is trying to fix this for this location.
- They want VSE to show the last 4 of the Veterans
- They miss the auditory alert that was available in VetLink.
- VSE-CS isn’t showing where the Veterans checked into. They is a problem when they have multiple appointment.
  - The nurse went to get the patient, but they were at a different clinic.
  - Patients also don’t check-in twice for multiple appointments.
- They want the ability to add a note or comment about why the Veteran is there.
- They want to know when they “no show” a patient, where does that information go. They would like it to go to MSAs.
  - Nursing thinks that it would be great if the system would allow MSAs to do a “no show” note and send (maybe automatically) a letter.
- Nursing leadership and some nurses do rounds in the waiting room to see if Veterans are there, whether they are checked in or not.

#### MSA Supervisor
- It took 2 years for Veterans to trust the kiosk. Now they feel that VA gave something and took it away.
- The lobby is small, so line get long fast and easy. 
- Before they would have someone in the lobby showing Veterans how to check-in. This was an MSA.
- Veterans don’t want to use the QR code.
- Younger vets use PCI.
- Wants to be able to monitor is PCI is working or not.
  - Also would like to tracked, who checks in on what team and by what employee, so they could tell…
    - If one desk is busier compared to other desks
  - They have looked at Power BI dashboards in the past.
    - Everyone Is getting used to the new working and training part. They want to know how to pull it.
- Pain points: it is time consuming, the demographic review is a lot. This is the same problem as the kiosk. However, they way it is on the phone (to scroll) that makes it seem like more.
- If Veterans aren’t able to check-in, because they see an error, the system tells them to check-in with a clerk. Veterans think that they checked in, but they didn’t. Vets seeing an error, yet think that they are checked in.
- Improvement suggestions:
  - Make it easier for elderly to use it/catch onto it.
  - Education is needed
- Prior to COVID, they had volunteers to help check-in and now they only have a few volunteers. Volunteers find it harder to help on Vet’s personal phone compared to the kiosks. They have to get closer to help and some Veteran don’t like that now due to COVID.
  - The size of a phone matter.
- They are interested in replicating the volunteer position with an MSA.
  - Wants to have an extra MSA in the lobby to train and educate. 
    - However, lost 3 MSAs in the last month, so education/being able to train Veterans is hard.
- Interested in us talking to Veterans more.
- Researcher: want anything else in VSE-CS?
  - Not sure on that one.
- Researcher: what would help with adoption or buy-in?
  - Education
- PCI has affected staffing. MSAs are assigned to a desk for a week. It affects who they can assign where. Check-ins take longer now, because there are more people checking in with MSA now. 
- Researcher: how has pre-check-in been working?
  - They have only seen a few. They estimate around 10%.
  - It delays day of check-in, because it confuses the patient. Veterans don’t understand the difference between the two.
  - They have seen a flyer, but suggests that other promo materials might help.
  - They don’t like pre-check-in. The have only seen a few pre-check-in statuses.
  - Pre-check-in NPS: 5
- Cancelled appointments
  - Depends on if a provider calls in sick or a provider wants to switch from in-person to telemedicine. This can happen 10-15 times per day. They call the Veteran to make sure that switching from in-person to a telemedicine appointment is ok.
  - They try to notice Veterans 45 days in advance (for provider leave scenarios). However, they may have to cancel on the day of the appointment.
  - 10-15% of cancellations are within 30 days or a week.
  - They will call and try to reschedule 
    - They will send a letter if they can print and mail it in time for the Veteran to actually receive it.
  - They make 2 phone calls, leave voicemails, and send a letter.
  - Veterans have/will show up for cancelled appointments.
    - If they di arrive, the staff will see if they can fit them in. They can be triaged by a nurse, but some/most will have to be rescheduled.
    - Travel pay for cancelled appointments can be claimed for one way.
- Volunteers can help with check-in/pre-check-in, but it is up to them. It really depends upon if they understand it themselves or not.

- We completed these intercepts over a 2 hour time period. We weren't able to intercept everyone.

### Annex
It is located in the building directly behind the Corpus Christi VA Clinic.

Immediately after walking through the door, you walk into the waiting room. The check-in desks are to the left. There are 5 check-in desks with 4 MSAs and 1 Health Benefits Administrator. This location houses the following specialities and organizations:
- Audiology
- Vocational Rehab
- Dietician
- Texas Veterans Commission (VSOs)
  - The MSAs have to message the VSOs over Teams if a Veterans has an appointment/wants to speak with the VSOs.
- Hud-vash (Homeless Veterans)
  - They don’t have appointments.

The kiosks are this location are currently used for:
- Health benefit advisor appointments
- Requests for medical records
- Travel pay
- To Change information 

#### Health Benefits Advisor
- Veterans use the kiosk and checking in for an appointment with them. When they call the Veteran up, they realize that the Veteran thought they were checking in for a medical appointment. As a result, they often have to complete check-in for the Veteran.

#### MSA 1
- They only have the overview of what specialities are available at this Annex location.

#### MSA 2
- Veteran get scared about going to va.gov to complete check-in (thoughts about logging in)
- They sometimes see that a Veteran started check-in, but did not complete it.
- However, they only really review the check-in status if part of their team asks for them to check on a Veteran
- At the Annex, this MSA assist Veterans checking in. They educate Veterans, but it is a smaller and slower location.
- Nurses at this location come out to the waiting room and call Veterans even if they don’t see them checked in.
- Has to sometimes help educate Veterans as they use the kiosk.
- Does a lot of education on PCI.
- Check-in NPS: 10
- Pre-check-in
  - Looks at the pre-check-in started status in VSE-GUI
  - Says that 50% do it and 50% don’t.
  - Some Veterans are upset on day of check-in, because they think that they did everything already
  - NPS: no opinion

#### Chief
**First Meeting**
- Feedback on reporting
  - Can only see one clinic at a time
  - Can’t see more than one clinic.
  - Is interested in viewing by division (so all of Corpus Christi or one entire facility in Corpus Christi)
- Corpus Christi outpatient had an ~50% VetLink usage rate
- The labs under their purview still allow VetLink kiosk check-ins.
  - They have scheduled appointments for all labs.
    - However, a “Scheduled” lab doesn’t have to occur at the exact time it is scheduled for. A Veteran can come anytime within 14 days after the order is placed.
    - For example, if the appointment was 2 days ago, then they will still check the Veteran in for their lab.
  - There are no MSAs supporting/stationed at the labs. There isn’t anyone there to schedule Veterans into the lab.
- VISN 17 has another year with the kiosks (through FY23). The contract could possibly go through FY24, since they are no longer nationally supported.
- To truly get rid of all of their kiosks, they would want PCI to handle:
  - Walk-in appointments
  - Release of information requests
  - Health benefit advisor appointments
  - Travel pay
- They also looked at a kiosk recently and it had a Whole Health option. Saw this at Harlingen. They weren’t sure what the exact workflow for this way. They will look into it more of us and share the informaiton.
- Does’t know the ins and outs of travel pay, but mentions that the current system prints out a paper copy of the claim at the travel office upon submission. It may be ok to send the claim directly into BTSSS. Recommends talking to travel clerks more. We reassured them that we are.

**Second Meeting**
- CSE-CS isn’t refreshing, so nursing doesn’t know when a Veteran arrived
- Problem is PCI going down and VSE-CS going down a few times
- They watched Veterans checking in
- The QR code isn’t returning an anything in Harlingen - service isn’t good with AT&T customers there.
  - Knows that they need to increase wifi in Harlingen
- Looking into other reports that VSE-CS isn’t being used a lot (not sure what location that is happening at).
- Have CPRS access to see the behavioral flag report. The new Power BI report is going VISN wide.
  - They will send the report to us.
- They are going to check on the whole health workflow that exists on the kiosks. They aren’t sure what it exactly does.
- 90% use VSE-CS, but it isn’t required.
  - VSE-GUI is used by MSAs.
- They want the ability to present weekly numbers on check-in.

#### Veterans
- We didn’t intercept any Veterans while at the Annex. There were only a few the entered the facility and we were actively talking to staff when they did.
- Did witness one Veteran come in to talk with a VSO. After the MSA messaged the VSO, they realized that the Veteran didn’t have a scheduled appointment

#### MSA 4
- Their overall assessment of how the new check-in process is going: “Not very well, a lot get messages to see the MSA.”
  - It “made [check-in] more work.”
  - Veterans “type in check-in and think that they are done” until they come up to complain that they haven’t been seen or to double check that they are checked in.
  - Believes older Veterans have a difficult time with it.
  - More people are coming to MSAs. It is more work. 
  - Why can’t they do updates on their phones? - referring to contact, emergency contact, and next of kin
  - This can cause lines of patients.
- In VSE-GUI…
  - They use the calendar view to review the check-in status colors. However, they only look when a member of their team asks or when they are actively checking someone in.
  - What status is the most useful?
    - Check-in completed is used to know.
    - They have used the future status as well to let Veterans know that their appointment is in the future.
- They get Teams messages from their team sometimes asking if someone really isn’t checked in. They look if that person is or not.
- The nurses are using VSE-CS, but they heard from an LPN that the check-in statuses don’t always update.
  - They have a log in to VSE-CS, but they don’t use it.
- Patients complain about the new system not working correctly or that they didn’t bring a phone to their appointment.
- A couple of times a day they are teaching a Veterans to use PCI.
  - If it is busy, then they just check the Veteran in.
  - If it is slow, then they will educate the Veteran on PCI.
- Estimates that 20% of Veterans attempt PCI and many are frustrated that the kiosk is going away.
- They never received an email about mobile check-in until a month later it was live.
- How many bi-lingual Veterans do you encounter?
  - There are probably a lot, but they only encounter a few that don’t speak English. A lot of times, it is the caregiver who speaks Spanish.
- If someone does speak Spanish, how does check-in go?
  - A Spanish-speaking MSA normally helps.
- What would you change?
  - Make is simpler. This new system is more steps.
  - Gives an example from their civilian provider: SMS link is sent to them and when clicked it does directly to the appointment information
- Saw Veterans use “I’m here” for check-in.
- Check-in NPS: 3/4
- Pre-check-in
  - Sees comments that Veterans don’t know what the difference is between pre-check-in and check-in.
  - Patients come up after pre-checkin and have to check-in.
  - NPS: ?
- Canceled appointments
  - Reasons VA cancels: Provider is on leave or out sick
  - For short notice situations
    - another provider may cover for the provider, then the MSAs call to make sure the Veteran wants to see the new provider.
    - Otherwise, the MSA makes a phone call and leave a message. They may call back again.
    - Sometimes the patient comes into the office and they find coverage for them
  - For more notice, they make 2 phone calls, then send a letter.
- Travel pay
  - It happens after check-in.
  - Some Veterans ask for paper copies
  - They tell the Veteran to call the travel office when they have issues with getting a payment, want to claim more than 30 days in the past, or more than same day appointment.
  - They would want eligibility checked in any system that is created. 


## July 20

### South Enterprize VA Clinic
205 South Enterprize Parkway

#### Administrative Officier and MSA Supervisor
- Older population who don't care for the system.
- The security guards at the entrance help educate Veterans about PCI.
  - They tried to train security how to use the QR code, so they could teach others.
- MSA Supervisor and leads were without training in the beginning. They made it mandatory to help Veterans learn the system for 1.5 weeks.
- Veterans seem to prefer text to QR code
- They have MSAs encourage usage of the system. If more people use PCI it will help the MSAs, because there will be less back-up.
- Some Vets go to the kiosk. Have travel on the kiosk confused them (maybe).
- Want signage about check-in in the parking lot.
- MSA have a difficult time using the system. There is frustration about the amount of interruptions they experience.
- Veterans have asked them "Why did you get rid of the kiosk?" They assumed it was due to COVID and HIPAA.
- MSA love VSE-GUI compared to VetLink. Using only one system is great.
- Providers don't use VSE-CS, since it was optional.
- Nursing does use VSE-CS to see that a patient has checked in.
- Their lab is talking abotu using PCI, because they have scheduled labs. 
- They have 3 check-in areas within at this location: right by the front door, telemental health and mental health.
- There is a Spanish speaking population that are patients at this location.
  - If they have problems checking in, they use the kiosk and check-in using their phone
- Pre-check-in
  - They have seen about 20% ust. it

  - They recently added...MSA call Veterans if they are 5 minutes late and some say that they are already here.
- Travel pay
  - They can file right after checking in.
  - Paper submissions would increase if it goes away on the kiosk.
  - MSAs fill out travel paperwork a lot.
  - If they never filed a claim, then they fill out initial paperwork for the direct deposit and mail it.

  - They haven't seen too much about this new check-in process.
  - Wondered about something to reach older generations.
 
#### MSA 1
- Was stationed at the general check-in desks by the front door.
- Mentioned that some Veterans want to have a town hall to discussion the new check-in process. They aren't happy about it. I wasn't sure if they planned to attend an existing meeting or if they wanted to schedule something separate.
  - Older Veterans don't want to have to use their phone and be required to learn new technology.
- They see a lot of error regarding insurance. A Veteran will use PCI and get a message that their insurance needs to be checked, but the MSA looks in ICB and they aren't lsited.
- The new process has resulted in them checking in more Veterans. They are more busy.
- They had a question about TriCare. The pateints don't have their cards. The MSA wanted to know what they were supposed to do about that.
- Estimates that 5 - 6 Veterans from the clinic(S) they oversee utilize PCI per day.
- They do a lot of educating on how to text if problems arise with the QR code
  - Particularly educates about how to start a new text thread.
- VSE - the software changes are good, because it is the same at VetLink.
  - Entering some things takes a few more steps.
  - Like that they can enter insurance instead of using ICB, but ICB is more accurate.
  - They like that they are using less software systems.
  - ICB doesn't stay up. If you aren't watching, you get logged out.
- There are no changes to communications with clinicians.
  - They use Teams if VSE-CS is slow.
- NPS: would not recommend
- Pre-check-in: haven't hear about it. Hasn't seen the status in VSE.
- Cancelled appt
  - VA has to cancel appointment if the provider is out.
  - They alsocancel if the patient or call center says to cancel.
  - When it occur with short notice before the appt...
    - Call the patient right away and leave a message if necessary
    - Leave a message in the computer that they couldn't get ahold of the patient
    - If vet already cam in, the nurse will tell the Vet that it is cancelled and bring them up to reschedule.
  - Longer notice...
    - 2 calls, then send a letter. They wait 14 days. If 14 days pass, then discontinue the RTC.

#### Visual observations
- not overwhelmed with signage
- Talked about training Veterans/educating
- appt. check-in signs over the kiosk
- [diagram of the area added from notes]

#### Veteran Intercepts

**1**
- Had a question about scheduling.

**2**
- Didn't know that he needed to click the link in the SMS
- Successfully submitted

**3**
- Needed to make an appointment

**4**
- In a rush and didn't want to check-in with us.
- Tried to check-in on the kiosk.
- Came back to us, then said that they didn't know how to text.

**5**
- Doesn't want to try

**6**
- Doesn't want to try
- Wanted to use the kiosk
- Came to the wrong location and asked the MSA for a list of future appts.
- 
**7**
- Tried before and had trouble
- We helped educate them
- It took awhile for va.gov to load. It took so long that they got a time out error (err-timed-out).

**8**
- Tried once and "not smart enough for smart phone"
- Tried the kiosk

**9**
- Thought they were checked in after sending "check in"
- Got "clinic not enabled" message sent to him. Sent him to the clerk.

**10**
- Didn't want to try
- "That is what they [clerks] are here for."

**11**
- Tried it before we got to intercept then.
- Received a message that they needed to have their insurance reviewed.

**12**
- Going to the lab

**13**
- Scheduling an appt.

**14**
- Going to the pharmacy

**15**
- Wasn't interested in PCI

**16**
- Going to the lab.

**17**
- Second time using it.
- Used QR code
- Text and va.gov loaded quickly
- Successful check-in
- They didn't have to review contact information/pre-registration. Our guess is that they ust have done pre-check-in, because their last appointment was 2 weeks ago.

#### Volunteer 1
- Sends Veterans to the MSA to answer PCI questions
- "99% can't do it."
- Some other volunteers know the system better than them and try to help.
- They tried it themself and didn't get it to work.

#### Volunteer 2 and 3
- Mondays and Wednesdays are really busy.
- Most Veterans don't have a smartphone when they enter the building.
- A lot say it is harder. Just don't want to do it.
- Volunteer 3 educates Veterans abotu PCI. "It is the same as the kiosk, but different."
  - "Key to getting them to do it is to share that we are learningtoo and to be patient."
  - They believe that time will help.
  - This gives them a choice, which helps with their response.
    - Some found it easy.
  - Need to educate - this is key.
  - They haven't seen any errors that couldn't be handled some other way.
  - Researcher: what would you improve?
    - "Too early to tell."
- Volunteer 2
  - Researcher: what should we improve?
    - Open kiosks again.
    - Can do on a regular phone.
  - No errors that they can't explain.
  - Check-in is improving over time.
    - Vets are more educated.
  - Some don't have a phone.
  - Researcher: Do you do any assiting with Spanish-speaking visitors?
    - Not really. Haven't needed to to help a Veteran with Spanish.

#### MSA 2
- Located at the general check-in area desks at the front of the buildiing.
- Deals with a lot of complaints
- It takes 2 - 3 minutes to help educate some Veterans about check-in.
- It makes them more busy, makes the lines longer, and hindes what they have to get done.
- The QR code is the most difficult. They don't know that they have to go past just scanning the QR code.
- They put "VA Check in" as a contact within some Veterans' phones.
- They have had Veterans come back and ask the same questions again about PCI.
- They do review the check=in statuses all the tie in VSE-GUI.
  - Researcher: what statuses are the most valuable?
    - Some Veterans don't check in, so they look at the statuses to see if that Veteran did check in.
    - If it shows that they haven't checked in that status is helpful
    - They utilize the statuses at the top of the screen more than the colors in the calendar at the bottom.
- They have to work faster.
- Some don't want to use a phone and say "Why does VA change everything?"
- Check-in hasn't changed communication with providers.
- MSAs and providers don't use VSE-CS.
- They have to educate a lot more, than Vet says no, you just check me in.
- It made some Veterans get upset and walk out.
- They heard that some Veterans don't want to do it, because it will be a charge on my phone."
- Some think they are checked in and the MSA sees:
  - 5 a day show up as mobile check-in started and not complete
  - Now, the MSA looks for the "Check-in started" status.
- 15/20 out of 50 use PCI
- Pre-check-in
  - Estimates usage to be 10% of time
  - Works most of the time, but some Veterans think pre-check-in equals check-in
  - NPS: 10
    - "as long as we can fix the confusion with pre-check-in and check-in.
- Check-in NPS: 3
  - Having 2 options hinders check-in.
- Canceled appts
  - Provider called out, leave request. Don't have enough staff or proper equipment for procedures (issues recently in Dental)
  - Supposed to give a couple of weeks notice, but the majority of of provider notices are same day.
    - We have to call to cancel, then reschedule
  - If there is more notice
    - Call Veteran and reschedule
    - Does send a letter after 2 calls
  - No showed, canceled, or initial schedule are all reasons that they send letters.
- Travel pay
  - They can file on the day of their visit
    - Done at the clerk- they try to do it after the appt.
    - Kiosk can do it @ check-in.
  - Some Veterans think they do travel on kiosk that they are checked in for their appointment.
  - MSAs help Veterans fill it out, because their hands shake or other reasons. The Veteran just signs the form. 
    - On the form, it they don't have their card, then they can just fill in their SSN.
    - Veterans have to call the travel office if they haven't gotten paid, are waiting for awhile, or got denied.
    - "If you can add travel pay to check-in that would be great to do it at the saem time."
    - It would be perfect if they utilize it.
- When they check-in, it doesn't show them where they shoudl be, so some check-in @ the wrong location.
  - Adding address would be good.
  - *The 2 locations here are only 5 minutes apart.*

#### MSA 3
- located at the front desk in the general check-in area)
- About check-in, "No one likes it. They come to the window."
- MSAs just check the Veteran in.
- They try to educate the Veterans abotu PCI, but they end up checking in a lot.
- Hears alot of "Oh, I don't have my phone."
- Impact to their work: it is more work. Veterans are constantly coming.
- Keeps VSE-GUI up at all times. it times out too much, so they have to log back in. *Researcher notices that they currently have VSE-GUI and ICB up on their screen.*
- They find the check-in started, but not completed status helpful.
  - If a Veteran asks, then they use the status to check if whatever the Veteran was expecting is true.
- "It was just a process to learn." - speaking about the changes to the MSA workflow.
  - In VSE, they can't change contact information in as little steps as VetLink.
- A Veteran tried to check-in with the kiosk when we were talking to this MSA. 
  - They came up to the MSA, because they weren't sure if they were checked in or not.
  - MSA says that this happens frequently.
- Nurses can see when Veterans are checked in.
  - So it is good. Problem is if person is only half checked in. Nurse will message on Teams asking if check in is correct, but the Vet is already back in their appt. Nurses starts a note, but can't due to the Veteran not actually being checked in. This can happen ~2 times a day. This MSa oversaw Dental.
  - Nurses use VSE-CS to see statuses.
    - They can see who has checked in on ICB too, so they might use that.
- Think that Veterans aren't paying attention, so they don't fully check-in.
- Check-in NPS: 3
- Pre-check-in: 
  - Problem when appt is cancelled and they are pre-checked in. hty have to remove/cancel the appt. *Though this proces for cancellation is the ssame whether or not pre-check-in was completed.*
  - Veteran usage - don't think they do use pre-check-in. Only noticed a handful in the software.
  - Pre-check-in has no impact on check-in to them.
  - No Veteran feedback to them about pre-check-in.
  - NPS: 5 
    - Reason: because they personally don't like to do it for their doctor
- Canceled appts.
  - Provider is out. Has 4 docs and 3 hygenists that they manage the front desk for.
  - They give lke 3-4 days notice and have to reschedule like 5 patients per day.
  - It only happened to 2 patients this month though.
  - The process: The notification goes to the Supervisor. The supervisor lets the MSA know what the plan is and gives them a list of patients. They cancel the appointment in the system and call the patient. If they get a hold of the patient, then they reschedule. They call 2 times, then send a letter.
- Travel pay
  - On kiosk - only works right now if they don't use their ID.
    - Sometimes they walk the Veteran through the steps.
  - If a Veterans comes up to them, then they hand them a paper to fill out.
    - They do this after the appointment is complete.
    - Sometimes they have to help the Veteran fill out the paperwork. The Veteran just signs and dates.
  - They have had to look up dates of past appointments for Veterans filing.
  - They don't believe that Veterans should get travel pay.
  - They think it could be included with check-in. "Whatever is easiest for the Veteran."

#### 2 nurses
- Biggest pain point: VSE-CS doesn't refresh right away
  - A Veteran can be there, so they go out at the scheduled time
- Liked the auditory alert in VetLink.
  - They have an alert, but it is for every clinic not the one that they oversee for the day.
  - They also get updates for all statuses.
  - They want to only be notified when check-in is complete.
  - The base notification don't tell them what clinic the check in was for or the patient.
    - They have to check every clinic to see what happened.
  - They even get notifications abotu travel.
  - There are too many notifications.
  - They don't know which alert is for which clinic.
    - They are notified about cancellations. It takes time to remove.
- If a Veteran has multiple appointments, they are notified, since they don't oversee the other clinics.
  - They have to mark the statuses, but they don't have time to do it. They don't use it.
  - Veterans may not be checking in for 2nd/3rd appt.
  - The routing from the first appointment through the rest of the appointments isn't working.
  - Seeing checked-in and checked-out would be helpful.
  - You can see in VetLink the patient's whole schedule (even if it wasn't your clinic). You got to see, because they have at least one appointment with you that day.
- They used to see if a Veteran started check-in, which was helpful.
  - They only see check-in time when it is complete.
- The med list in VSE-CS is not helpful.
  - They don't use the pre-visit summary capabilities.
  - They already know this information.
  - They just want VSE-CS to help for check-in.
  - They scrub (AKA: call the Veteran to ask pre-visit questions) about a week ahead of time. Pre-visit summary would be helpful then. 
  - Patient-generated information would be helpful.
    - Knowing if they recently went to the ER would be helpful. Knowing this by the morning of the appointment would be great.
    - They don't expect this upon check-in though. They expect this information to be in CPRS.
    - Veterans do share some of this information with their office through secure messaging already.
  - If we did have a med list, they asked if it would only be what it is CPRS or everything the Veteran should take. They want outside VA medicines as well.
  - Most of the time it is the caregiver who fills out this informaiton.
- VSE-CS has worked in the morning, but caused errors later in the day.
  - When the errors occur, they can't see anything in the system. 
  - Log outs happen faster compared to other systems. 
    - Though it is a simple 2-3 step login.
- Used to see behavioral flags in VetLink.
  - Havne;t seen it in VSE-CS.
  - Good for them to know about. 
  - Want to know about escort needs, suicide ones, or drug seeking.
- They have heard some complaints about appointment reminders from Veterans.
  - The Veterans get too many.
  - They have appointments canceled for no reason at all.
  - Vets see notificaitons, but still get many even after confirming.
- Liked that you can customize your list in VSE-CS.
  - Can make lists for each day.
  - If you don't change the default, you can stay on the page. If it logs out, then you have to change it again.
- Wish there was better training for this new system.
  - Training on Friday on short notice and they went live on Monday.
  - had to put in an IT ticket, if it wasn't working on the first day.
- There has been no education for Veterans
  - Need someone to help patients troubleshoot.
- Veterans and staff want to know if the Veterans are in the wrong building.
  - VetLink - you can see if they checked in somewhere else.
  - Clinic names and info in reminders aren't enough.
- Canceled appts.
  - Falls off right away if patient canceled online. If the clerk is called, then they do the cancellation right away.
  - CPRS shows specifics.
  - Notifications for this aren't specific enough in VSE-CS. They should remain on the screen like Facbook and they clikc on it to see more detail.
  - They don't want the patient to be removed if canceled. They want to see the status or a better notification about cancellation.
- Spanish-speaking
  - It would be nice to have a flag that they prefer Spanish or English.
  - But, this really isn't an issue.
  - Don't have too many patients who only speak Spanish. If this is the case, they tend to have someone come in with them to help.

#### 3 MSAs and 1 MSA Supervisor for Behavioral health
- PCI isn't working with older Vets
- Some do pre-check-in and think that they are checked in.
- They encourage the Veterans o verify with teh clerk that they are checked in.
- The majority of the Veterans pop is retired there.
  - "I have a flip phone."
  - "I don't have a phone."
- Some still come to window to check-in.
  - Some are having a hard time with the change.
- Kiosks. They liked the bigger screens. It is a lot of information to fit on a small screen.
  - Vets still try to check-in on the kiosks.
- Researcher: Is anything going well?
  - I wouldn't say it yet, but it takse awhile for the transition.
  - The 20-somethings get it - some of them (they have about 10 a day).
  - One MSA just think that it is going to take time. "They originally pushed back with the kiosk."
    - Estimated that it took ~6 months for the kiosk complaints to die down.
- Researcher: How often do you have to engage with a Veteran about check-in?
  - Sometimes sends them to MHV coordinator to answer questions. This same MSA also said that they show Vets flyers about PCI to take home.
  - The hardest part that Veterans need help with is scanning. "They aren't used to it."
  - MSA3. The hardest part if encouraging them to do it. Younger vets are more phrone to try.
- Researcher: What would you change?
  - MSA 1. Clearer information on phone about steps or have less steps that would be beneficial
  - MSA 3. Going through the process to get an error isn't great. Would want to let them know sooner.
- MSA like large touch screen at the social securityo office. Asks why VA couldn't do something like that.
- Check-in NPS:
  - 5
  - 6/5 (depends upon the demographic)
  - 7 (took awhile to get used to telemed appointments. Thinks this is the same.)
  - 4
- Pre-check-in
  - doesn't seem like a lot did it, because they seem to have to deal with staff anyway
  - less than half do
  - today 3 out of 20 in the morning did check-in on their phone 
  - NPS:
    - 5
    - 4
    - 4
    - 4
  - There is confusiiong between pre-check-in and check-in. Veterans are in a rush.
    - Veterans that use public transportation that are late due to the bus, so they are in a rush.
  - In mental health, probably even less use it.
- Cancelled appts
  - Too often. Cancels all the time. Cancels due to providers being out or scheduling changes.
  - Sometimes they cancel for in advance
  - Some Veterans have to be rescheduled again and again.
  - Alot of appointments are canceled on short term notice.
  - They call to notify the Veteran, but sometimes the Veterans is already driving to the facility and it is canceled.
  - One time a doctor put their notice in LEAF (it sounded like they said this, but I haven't heard of this before) and the supervisor didn't see it.
  - Canceling on short notice has happened a lot recently, but last month was good.
  - VeText lets Vets know if it is far enough out.
  - They make 2 calls, then send a letter. (Behavioral health was recently doing 1 call and a letter0
  - A lot they get a hold of during the first call to reschedule.
- Travel pay
  - They can do it on the kiosk at check-in or with an MSA after the appointment is completed.
  - The don't really have to refer Veterans to call the travel office that much.
  - Wants travel pay done with checkin.
- One MSA only ever used VSE-GUI, so doesn't know much as transition from VetLink over.
- One MSA still uses VetLink to update infomration. They haven't tried in VSE yet. LetLink is all in one screen, so they don't have to open many windows.
- Changes wanted to the system...Less steps, bigger fonts, clear what the Veterans needs to complete.
- Pre-check-in is confusing
- Training happened on Friday before the Monday launch.
  - This was not enough time to prepare.

#### 2 Behavioral Health MSAs
- Veterans don't know how to text or use phones.
- Older ones don't want to deal with it.
- They try to use the kiosk to check-in.
- The ones that do use it, their information isn't up-to-date, so they have to see the MSA anyway. "It is a waste."
- Tries to educate every single time.
- More often than not they go up to the front to check-in.
- This isn't too positive in their area.
- Researcher: What would you change?
  - Put kiosk back and take PCI away.
- Pre-check-in
  - Doesn't work at the time.
  - The status says complete
  - Confusiont between pre-check-in and checkin
  - MSA calls people on list whether they are checked in or not.
    - This help save clinical operations. 
  - Rarely sees the status.
  - Pre-check-in NPS: 3
- Check-in NPS: 5
- Impact of adding editing capabilities: Doesn't think that will ahve a big impact. They want to use the kiosk.
- Cancelled appt
  - Past couple of months - quite a few appts have been canceled due to providers leaving or being out sick.
  - It can be the morning of and tkae up he majority of their day
  - VVC appt can happen before MSAs get in, so the appt happen because they even know to cancel.
  - Steps to cancel:
    - Provider will tell the supervisor, who talks to the MSA. Sometimes the MSAs split up the lists of who needs to be called.
    - They call, then send cancel letter.
      - If they are able to reschedule the Veterans, then they send the rescheduled letter.
- 2nd MSA
  - PCI will be awesome. We just have an older population and it won't work for them. Most know how to send a text.
  - Compares this to the kiosk. Everyone hated the kiosk at first, but now they hate that we are getting rid of it.
  - Vetes don't know how to set up a new text. They tell Vets to go to their reminder text and send check in.
- Providers can see if a Veteran checked in.
- Bene travel
  - I don't know when to do travel
  - I don't know/when they are leaving?
  - MSA will help Vets at the machine. They send Vets to the kiosk.
  - Typical issues...think they can use the machine, but they can't
  - If a Veteran has questions, they direct them to call the travel office.
  - Not sure about travel pay and check-in - doesn't like it, but it may increase the number of Veterans that check-in and leave.
- Researcher: What would you change?
  - Don't use QR code
  - Want to be able to edit
