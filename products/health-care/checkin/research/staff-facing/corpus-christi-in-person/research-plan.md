# Check-In Research Plan for In-Person Staff Interviews at Corpus Christi, TX

Date: June 30, 2022

## Background 

The Modernized Check-In Team is reimaging the experience between a Veteran scheduling a medical appointment and having their appointment. In particular, the Modernized Check-In Team has created the portion of the ecosystem that enables Veterans to utilize their smartphone to “check in” to their appointments through VA.gov, which lets the VA know the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 

  - Confirming their appointment
  - Reviewing their contact information 
  - Reviewing their emergency contact information
  - Reviewing their next of kin information 

- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment

In speaking with the [Beneficiary Travel Reimbursement Path Analysis Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/104), we also know that travel reimbursement is being considered for integration with the check-in product. The following draft mock ups have been created to communicate the workflow:

### OCTO Objectives 

This research plan supports the following OCTO objectives: 

- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Increase completion rate of online transactions
- Increase usage of digital self-service tools
- Decrease time to successfully complete and submit online transactions 

### Veteran Journey

This research plan maps to the following moment within the Veteran journey:

## Research Goals 

Our goal for this research is to utilize our [baseline research plan for the St. Louis pilot](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/pilot-feedback/research-plan.md), and more recently, [Bay Pines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/bay-pines-in-person-uat/research-plan.md), to evaluate pre-check-in and check-in at additional VAMCs.

Utilization for check-in across all VISNs with check-in enabled during the week of June 20 - 24 was 1.2%. Within that week, Texas Valley Coastal Bend HCS (Harlingen, TX) VISN had a utilization of 11%, which far exceeded the average. Our goal is to uncover how Texas Valley Coastal Bend HCS has implemented and operationalized check-in in order to share those findings with product owners, trainers and other VISNs.  

In addition, the Modernized Check-In Team is building off of the [beneficiary travel research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/104) that is pointing to a potential solution that integrates travel reimbursement with check-in. 

Specifically, we’re looking to accomplish the following: 

- Evaluate the effectiveness of pre-check-in and check-in with MSAs
- Better understand the percentage of Spanish speakers and if nuances exist within that population about patient check-in  
- Identify strengths, pain points and opportunities for improvement within the check-in ecosystem 
- Understand how, if at all, MSAs are using VSE-CS
- Understand what staff roles are interested in PCI reports as well as what data they are interested in reviewing
- Gain insights on the process for staff needing to cancel appointments 
- Gain insights on understanding the optimal experience for incorporating travel reimbursement into the check-in experience for Veterans 
- Understand what information travel assistants use and how to review and approve reimbursement requests 

### Research Questions

- What’s working and not working with pre-check-in and check-in? 
- What changes could help improve the check-in process?  
- How often are MSAs interacting with Veterans during the check-in process? 
- Are MSAs checking in Veterans with VSE that need help versus requiring them to use mobile check in? 
- What’s been the impact on MSA workload? 
- How often are MSAs troubleshooting errors or clearing review flags?
- How comfortable are MSAs troubleshooting errors or clearing review flags? 
- What are the issues that MSAs are helping Veterans troubleshoot?  
- What changes in MSA to clinician communication for check-in have changed?
- What changes to check-in can help improve MSA to clinician communication for check-in?  
- Are MSAs using VSE-CS? If so, how is it being used and why is it being used?  
- How do Veterans feel about pre-check-in and check-in?
- What's the percentage of Veterans that are bi-lingual and low English proficient Spanish speakers? 
- What are some of the potential nuances of check-in that might be challenging for Spanish speakers to understand?  
- What staff role are interested in PCI report?
- What data do staff members want to review within PCI reports?
- How frequently does staff need to cancel appointments? 
- What's the process when staff needs to cancel an appointment? 
- How do staff notify Veterans that their appointment was canceled?
- How many days out do appointments typically get cancelled? 
- When do Veterans expect to complete a travel reimbursement claim in relation to their appointment? 
- What information do travel asisstants use to review and approve reimbursement requests?
- How do travel assistants use that information to review and approve a request?  

### Hypothesis 

1. The pre-check-in experience makes day-of check-in easier for staff since contact information, emergency contact information and next of kin information has been reviewed. 
2. MSAs will have limited interaction with Veterans during check-in since Veterans are able to check-in on their smartphone. 
3. MSAs will check Veterans in with VSE that don’t have a smartphone or have difficulty using their smartphone. 
4. MSAs will have shorter lines of Veterans waiting to be checked in. 
5. The number of applications that MSAs use to manage the check-in process will be reduced and, therefore, workload will be decreased. 
6. MSAs are comfortable with troubleshooting error messages with Veterans and know how to clear appropriate review flags in VSE. 
7. MSAs will indicate that communication between MSAs and clinicians is frictionless due to the staff applications working as intended. 
8. MSAs provide Spanish translation support in an ad-hoc fashion to Veterans/caregivers when needed.
9. Staff will be able to enumerate which PCI data they want to review within reports.
10. MSAs will indicate that Veterans would prefer to file a travel reimbursement with their check-in versus a separate encounter. 
11. Travel clerks will indicate that the workflow in the travel reimbursement prototypes are optimal for Veterans and that no required steps are missing. 

## Method

This research will be conducted as in-person interviews at Corpus Christi VA Clinic and other clinics that the Corpus Christi VA Clinic Health Administration Services (HAS) team is able to identify. E.g., South Enterprize VA Clinic, Old Brownsville VA Clinic. Our preference is to visit various clinics within the facilities during times of high appointment check-ins. 

We will ask MSAs questions from our conversation guide to measure their perceptions on pre-check-in, check-in, travel reimbursement, Spanish translations, etc. and document responses, comments, improvements, etc.  

We will also arrange a time to meet with travel assistants and ask them questions from our conversation guide to understand what information is used and how to review and approve reimbursement requests. 

Two researchers will be conducting this research.
