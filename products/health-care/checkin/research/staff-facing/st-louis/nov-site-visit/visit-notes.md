## November 10, 2021

## Franklin County VA Clinic in Washington, Missouri

### General Clinic set up
* We spoke with 3 MSA, 1 MSA Lead, 1 MSA Supervisor, and the Clinic Manager
* At the clinic there are:
    * 3 primary care provider (2 are part-time)
        * One of the part-time providers is new and taking new patients.
            * One of the only providers in the area taking new patients.
            * St. Charles is closed for new patients.
    * 1 pharmacist
    * 1 dietician
    * lab tech (only area taking walk-ins since COVID)
    * 1 psychologist
    * 1 Telehealth tech
    * 1 chiropractor (2 days a week)
    * 1 occupational therapist, physical therapist, and acupuncturist (1 day a week)
    * Will be starting again soon…cardiologist once a month
* First patient appoint of the day is 9 AM for primary care and 8 AM for PT.
* Patient population: 1,800
* There is one waiting room for all of the above providers with ~20 seats; however, most of the seats are covered to promote social distancing
* 2 of the MSA sit at the front counter that is visible to the waiting room; however, they are planning a redesign, so all three MSAs can be out front.
    * Each MSA is assigned to a PACT team, but they can check-in anyone
        * PACT team is made up of MSA, LPN, RN, and provider
* They have one kiosk machine available in the waiting room. It is turned on and actively being used by Veterans.
* Software utilized by MSAs
    * VeText
    * VistA
    * VetLink
    * Teams
    * VSE GUI
    * ICB (Insurance Capture Buffer)
    * CPRS
        * If all systems go down they will revert to writing everything down on paper, then enter it when the systems come back up.
        * They have gone back to VistA, but MSAs aren’t really taught VistA anymore. Multiple MSAs discussed learning VistA on the job when necessary.
* When asked, staff did not know about the After Visit Summary/Pre-visit Summary product. 
* Providers have access to VetLink, but not VSE.
* A lot of their walls have art or posters on them. There isn’t a lot of wall space.
* They don’t really have long lines of Veterans waiting (according to MSAs)
* Location compared to other St. Louis VA facilities
    * It is about a 1 hour drive from John Cochran (main VA hospital)
        * There are two main hospital campuses for St. Louis – John Cochran, which is the main facility and Jefferson Barracks which is mostly rehab and mental health
    * Next closest clinics are: 
        * St. Charles about 30 min away 
        * Jefferson City and St. James about an hour away
    * It is about a 1 hour drive to John Cochran (main VA hospital)
        * There are two main hospital campuses in St Louis: John Cochran, which is the main facility and Jefferson Barracks which is mostly rehab and mental health
* Labs are walk-in except for PTT/INR appts. From Coumadin clinc.
     * Pharmacy has scheduled appointment, no walk-ins.
* Posters for VeText's "I am here" product in the parking lot are covered, so as not to be used
    * Vets have sat in car for an hour plus, because of no alert to MSAs when using VeText.
    * Often doesn't show that they've checked in. Sometimes the VeText email comes 2 hours later. Also, if the cell number is not linked to the vet's account, then the message never shows up. For example the Veteran uses a wife's phone or caregiver's phone that isn't in the system.

### General quote from staff about our visit
- “So glad you came.”

### Number of appointments
* It is estimated the 50% of their patients have multiple appointments a day. 
    * Many are traveling long distances to get to this clinic
    * This definitely happens with pharmacy and nutritionist.
    * Patients also double up if they have a co-pay. The co-pay tends to be per day, so if they see multiple providers on one day, then they only have one co-pay.
        * OT, PT, and Nutritionist appointment in particular are bundled together, but can bundle a primary care appointment as well. 

### Routine questions asked by staff when Veteran checks in
* Asks about the Veteran’s insurance if the Veteran is listed on the ICB
* Ask for last name and last 4 of SSN
* Ask who they are seeing today

### Too late/too early times at this clinic
* Normally 15 minutes past the appointment time
    * One primary care provider will see patients 30 minutes past their appointment time
* Some Veterans check-in 2 hours early, but that doesn’t happen that often
    * This can cause flow problems for the back, because they do try to see them early if they can.


### Patient Tracking
* For patient tracking, multiple of the staff members mentioned previous use of the Bingo Board in CPRS
* Clinical manager and MSA mention the VeText? (might be VetLink) capability of a notification that flashes at the top and says there is a new patient. It flashed at the top, so it doesn’t matter what clinic you are viewing.
* There is a screener at the front door. The door is closed, so everyone interacting must talk to the screener. The screener asks COVID questions and takes everyone’s temperature. They ask for the Veteran's name, then send out a Teams message (with patient name, temp and provider team) to their clinic channel that the Veteran has entered the building. 
* Nurses do look at VetLink, but the MSAs also send a Teams message to the clinic channel as a back-up, when a Veteran checks in.
    * They didn’t really send Teams messages prior to COVID. They only relied on VetLink.
    * They ike that the Teams icon changes colors when there is a new message.
* Upon a successful check-in, a routing sheet and medication list automatically print outs. 
    * The MSAs take these sheets and place them in the appropriate provider’s folder.
    * The med list has future appointments on it.
        * It is a JCAHO compliance requirement.
        * They tell patients to bring their medications into their appointment with them, so they can review if the patient is taking them correctly.
    * This cover sheet is really all that a patient goes home with. Providers may write notes on this cover sheet. It serves as an After Visit Summary.
* When a Veteran check-in at this clinic, they check them in for all of their appointments for the day (even if they have multiple and it isn’t just a triage appointment)
    * As a result, the routing sheet is important to know where all the patient has to go that day.
    * The provider either walks them to their next appointment or sends a Teams message (Channel called “Franklin screening”) to the clinic channel that the Vet is back in the waiting room.
        * This teams channel works most of the time, but messages can get missed if multiple Veterans check-in at once or a bunch of messages are sent at once.
    * It is on the specialists to look at the VetLink system or Teams channels, but LPN monitor it for primary care. 
* If a Veteran call and says that they are running late, then they send a Teams message.

### VetLink functionalities
* MSAs do utilize the notes feature in VetLink a lot to communicate with clinical staff. 
    * It is most often utilized after a phone call from a Veteran. However, some notes are entered during check-in.
* There is an audible ding when a patient checks in, but if you don’t have the sound way up when the phone rings, then you can’t heard the ding. 
    * A visual indicator would be good in this instance.
* For some reason, all their PT, chiropractic, acupuncture, and OT appointments tell the patient that they are in the wrong are when checking in via the kiosk. This causes confusion, because the patients aren’t in the wrong spot.
* MSA find having to help Veterans with the kiosk as often as they do to be a big frustrations.
    * If they don’t have their card, then the MSAs often have to talk Veterans through how to check-in with their SSN.
* VetLink shows the most recent patient at the top. It will flash "new patient" if you are in another screen.

### VSE Feedback
* It doesn’t automatically refresh, so you can’t see the colors change for the patient statuses on the calendar until you force a refresh.
    * When you click the refresh button on the screen, it clears out the clinical view (calendar and bottom part of the screen). When you are trying to observe the patient’s status, this is a problem. You have to leave the screen and come back to see patients populate. There is also a lag when refreshing.
* There is a lag time when looking at VSE GUI.
* Access to correct clinics need to be easier. Currently, they have to manually pull them up often. - Mentioned by MSA and MSA lead. 

### Pre-registration
* They don’t change any demographic information, especially patient address information.
    * This changed about a year ago. The change was due to the impacts on travel benefits and mailing medications.
        * Mailing medications to an incorrect address is a big problem.
            * **Lost 1.5 million due to lost medications.** 
                * I think they said this number is for the last year. I don’t know what VA area this number applies to.
            * They receive approximately 40 - 50 phone calls a week on lost medications.
                * When this occurs, they send a note to the RN or transfer the information to the Pharmacy, because they have the ability to track the medication package. Medications are sent through UPS now, but used to be through the post office.
        * VBA was having travel fraud. They tried to get VHA away from that and focus on healthcare.
    * They only have the ability to change it for 30 days
        * During that time Veterans need to show proof of the change to the eligibility office. The eligibility office send a letter via the mail to the Veteran requesting proof.
* However, the kiosk has the capability to change it permanently, so MSAs try to direct Veterans to make the updates on the kiosk.
* MSAs do not ask if the Veterans need to update their advance directive. They let the social worker deal with that.
* For Power of Attorney, the MSEs send the paperwork to the social worker.
* If a Veteran needs to update their next of kin or emergency contact, the MSAs tell them to…
    * Go to the kiosk
    * Go to eligibility (which is at a different location, John Cochran, which takes some time to get to). This can be done over the phone with the eligibility office as well.
    * Send the information to the eligibility office via interoffice mail.
* If a Veteran needs their insurance reviewed (they are listed in ICB), the MSAs call the patient up to the desk.
    * They print out the list from ICB first thing in the morning.
* Email is very important to capture accurately due to video appointments.
* Capturing pre-registration information in mobile check-in/pre-check-in would “be very helpful to MSAs”

### Pre-check-in
* Currently they call all of their patients 7 days prior to their appointment
    * LPNs spend a lot of time on these calls.
    * They are a reminder to the vet about the appointment as wel as instructions to bring any outsides records, bring in their meds, answer questions about why they're being seen, and confirm any needed updates to their informaiton.
* They worry about appointment notification overload. Patients get so many reminders that they start to ignore them. 
    * Even with this overload, a few Veterans a week will show up for an appointment at the wrong time or the wrong day.
        * Some providers will still try to squeeze them in if possible.

### Accessibility and check-in
* The kiosk are hard to use for blind Veterans
    * Most have a caregiver with them though.

### Travel Pay
* Staff believe that Vets know their travel pay
* Vets can file for travel pay immediately upon checking in on the kiosk or they can do it upon check out.
    * It isn’t officially complete until the provider completes the appointment.

### Staff status indicators
* The staff found value in being able to view the following check-in statuses
    * E-check-in started and complete
        * They definitely want to know if someone started check-in, but didn’t finish. It means that they need to track down this person. This was mentioned by multiple MSAs and supervisors.
        * Check-in complete is good to know along with the time, so they can know if the provider has come to get them or not. They can send a Teams message as a result.
    * Need an insurance review would be good, but they also want ICB and VSE to talk. They want to make sure this information is still in the ICB.
    * Pre-check-in complete is of interest.
        * It would let them know that they don’t have to make their pre-appointment phone call. 
        * Knowing if they still needed to do a demographic review or insurance review would be helpful.

### MSA job duties
* Handles phones, check-in and check-out. Deals with routining a lot of paperwork to other offices or providers.
* Goes over the clinic schedule in a clinic huddle each morning
    * Reviews any changes
    * Normally pulls the schedule mid-day to the end of the day for the next day
* Review ICB list every morning of who needs to have their insurance reviewed. They must cross reference the ICB list with their patient list (scheduled appts).
    * The ICB list shows check-in status, but sometimes this gets missed.
* Mail lab results letters
* Handles a lot of faxes about medical records
    * Adding outside VA records, so VA providers can review 
    * Sending VA records to other providers.
    * This is a rural location, so a lot of the Veterans see outside VA providers.
    * For the MSA working with the provider that is taking new patients, this is a large part of their current workload.
        * They other part of their workload is being on the phone with the new patients.
        * They created a new patient folder that they send to all new patients (photos of the folder).
* Take photos for patient IDs, then sends them to John Cochran to print the IDs
    * Photos for IDs do not require an appointment.
        * A Veteran will just walk-in and let the MSAs know that they need their photo taken. 
            * Normally, the MSAs jus stop what they are doing and take the person’s photo.
                * If they are really busy or the system is down, then they ask the Veteran to come back.

### Veteran check-in observations
**Veteran 1 - checks in for a lab test**
* scans VHIC
* Enters DOB
* Confirms who they are
* Prints out paper with #
    * However, this lab doesn’t have a board (like Pittsburgh) that shows what number they are on)
    * Lab tech just looks in VetLink and come out to get the Vet from the waiting room. They are called by name.
        * They do have some lab appointments for anticoag.

**Veteran 2 - checks in for appointment**
* Goes to the kiosk
* Scans VHIC card
* Enters DOB
* Confirms who they are
* Reviews their contact information (address, phone(s), and email)
    * Gets an inactivity message and got flustered (MSA helped them out)
    * Had to change their home and mobile phone numbers, because they were backwards
        * Staff had to help with this
* Reviews insurance information
    * Had BSCS and medicare. Medicare wasn’t in the system, so they had to add it.
        * MSA made a copy of the card.
* Checked in for two appointments at once
* Were shown their future appointments
* Were asked to watch a video, but there was no video to actually watch
* Were asked to take a satisfaction survey

**Veteran 3 - checking out**
* MSA looked at their return to clinic order, then scheduled their next appointment.
* MSA prints out a letter about their next appointment (can offer to mail it to them instead)
    * Give this to the Vet unless the Vet says that they don’t need it. 
        * MSA stated a lot of younger Vets don’t take the paper, they just put the appointment into their phones.

### If you could change one thing about check-in what would it be…
* MSA Supervisor - get rid of VeText, be able to change patient demographics, and a system to notify clinical staff (this notification to clinical staff is most important piece to this person)
* Clinic Manager - get rid of VeText and add staff notification 
    * Staff should have to acknowledge that the Veteran is here)
* MSA Lead - Add notifications. We also need to see all clinics and notifications for all clinics.
* MSA - The clinic view in VetLink is very helpful, so something similar would be great. 
* MSA - wants routing and med sheet to print automatically
    * If a provider writes a note in the patient’s file before their appointment, then the routing sheet and med list don’t automatically print
        * Only supervisors can cancel a checked out appointment, so printing med list and routing slip manually is a lot of work
* MSA - automatic printing of routing sheet and med list if very important. It can be a pain and increase workload when it isn’t working.
    * Wants a visual indicator or alert that the Veterans are here.

### Reporting needs (mainly talked to clinic manager about this)
* PAC standard is 30 minutes from check-in to seen, so understanding time is important
* No one at this site really review the kiosk reports
* There is a check-in sales report that does exist at the VISN level to help grade locations
    * AO Jason Holtman would be the person to contact more about the current report and needs. A new AO just started too. They think her name is Courtney.
* They would like to see how many checked in and where things go wrong.
    * If they didn’t finish why and can we let them know. 
    * Knowing that a Vet started, but ddn’t finished would be good. 
    * How many of each appt type would be valuable to them
    * Being able to report on how many people do you see a day would be helpful

### Veterans in crisis during check-in
* MSAs believe they are able to notice sometimes due to Veteran’s behavior or the Veteran actually saying something.
    * They will notify the psychologist 
        * If the psychologist isn’t there, they notify the Veteran’s provider or the clinic manager
* MSAs have noticed that even these Veterans tend to check-in on their own, but then need help or intervention

### Concerns about mobile check-in
* Worked about their older patient population
    * Some don’t have cell phones
* Cell reception is a concern 
    * The big providers (AT&T, TMobile, and Verizon) usually have service in the waiting room but the smaller providers have no service. 
* Being notified that the Veteran checked in within a timely manner is a concern.
    * This didn’t happen with VeText. Veterans would be sitting in their car for an hour and they never received a notification. Other times, the notification came 20 minutes after the Veteran sent the text.

### Quotes:
* “We rely very heavily on vetlink to tell us when someone is here”
* “The functionality of vetlink is quite robust”
* “We need something to blink on something” (when a patient checks in)
* “what I like about vet link is it flashes”
* “They could never get rid of VistA”

## St. Charles County VA Clinic in O’Fallon, Missouri

### General clinic set up
* We spoke with the clinic manager, MSA Supervisor, 3 MSAs, and the MSA lead. 
* This clinic is within an office building. There are other businesses besides VA in the building. They have outgrown the location and looking into a new location.
* The kiosk are on the far wall of the waiting room. Veterans have to pass the check-in desk and waiting room seats to utilize the kiosk.
    * This placement causes flow problems. MSAs are told to direct the Veterans to the kiosks, but their desk is really the first stop. A lot of Veterans are like “why can’t you just help me.”
* There are 4 primary care providers.
    * They aren’t taking new patients, because the providers are full.
* PT comes four days a week here.
* They have all the same specialities as Franklin.
* Providers have access to VetLink, but not VSE.
* Software utilized by MSAs
    * VetLink
    * VeText
    * VSE
    * CPRS
    * VistA
    * Teams
    * Outlook
    * ICB

### On St. Charles being the pilot site instead of Franklin
* When talking with the clinic manager and MSA supervisor, they suggested St Charles might be a better pilot site. They said that they proposed that earlier, but the idea was turned down.
* They believe St. Charles has a younger, more tech-savvy patient population. The cell reception is better. It is a busier clinic, so we would get more Veterans testing it out. The site also has more staff members. The MSA supervisor is at this location more throughout the week than Franklin.

### Feedback on our team visiting
- “This is great. There are so many times people don’t talk to us to find out how things work on the ground to make it better. This is nice.”

### Check-in day of workflow and feedback
* We must know that the Veteran is here, so being alerted is key. 
    * “I don’t want to miss anybody.”
* Too late is normally 15 minutes, but most of the providers try to fit the Veteran in anyway.
* Veterans currently have to come back to the waiting room to check-in for labs after they already had an appointment. There could be 15 people that came in for lab during that time period, so the Veteran would has been there for awhile ends up at the back of the line.
* Labs are walk-ins at this clinic and they utilize the VetLink solution, so they are concerned about VetLink going away without another way to handle these walk-ins.
* They also have walk-in primary care appointment.
    * The patients talk to the MSA and can check-in at the kiosk. These patients are triaged first.
* If the systems go down, then MSAs
    * Send Teams messages
    * Write everything down on paper to enter into the system when they are back up and running.

### Patient tracking
* One MSA used to work in a VA ER. They liked the Bingo Board, which was a screen on the wall. It had different colors to signify steps for where the patient was. The status stays up until you interact with it
    * The clinic manager also mentioned the bingo board in CPRS as a way to track patients.
* They mostly utilize VetLink for patient tracking with some Teams.
    * They do have a clinic wide channel in Teams, but don’t use it as heavily as Franklin for patient tracking.
        * About Teams, “It works pretty well, but some messages can get lost in the thread.”
    * MSA also mentioned that they can sometimes physically talk to the provider to let them know.
* MSA wants an alert to know that the patient checked in.
* They also utilize notes a lot in VetLink as well as the status buttons once the Veteran is back with the provider.
* MSA emphasized how important this step is (notifying the providers that the Veteran is here).
* Patients check in for all appointments at once. 
    * As a result, there isn’t a way to see if they are done with a provider and now they are in the waiting room.
    * This process isn’t smooth. 
    * They tend to communicate this information in the clinic Teams channel.

### MSA pain points
* There are too many screens and systems to keep switching between - commented on by all the MSAs.
* Due to inactivity, getting kicked out of applications as often as they do. They realize this is for security purposes, but it happens a lot.
* The received complaints from Veterans about VeText.
    * Most that the Veteran texted and no one got back to them, but staff don’t receive the notices in VeText until really late. - commented on by all the MSAs
* The kiosk tells some Veterans that they are in the wrong location, but they aren’t.
    * This happens for COVID and psychologist appointments.
* Not being able to have routing/cover sheets automatically print adds a lot of additional work for the MSAs.
* Veterans get frustrated by all the questions asked on the kiosk, so they give up. Veterans also don’t remember the answers to some of the questions and quit. The MSAs have to step in and help the Veterans a lot with the kiosk.
* Since they have a COVID screener now, some Veterans think that they are checked in after talking to the screener, so they sit down and don’t use the kiosk or check-in with the MSA.

### Pre-check-in
* We asked about the following statuses: pre-check-in started; pre-check-in completed; pre-check-in completed, but demographic review needed; pre-check-in completed, but insurance review needed; check-in started; check-in completed; check-in completed, but demographic review needed; check-in completed, but insurance review needed
    * MSA 1 - Interested in all pre-check-in and check-in statuses
        * Can you take a picture of their insurance card? It would help us eliminate the scanning of the card.
        * If we want to ask someone more about insurance, the St. Louis insurance group can be reached at 573-778-4272.
    * MSA 2 - If a Veteran fills out pre-check-in, they only want to know if they still need to do a demographic review or insurance review. 
    * MSA 3 - check-in started is important, so they know something is wrong
        * Check-in not completed is important as well as check-in completed, but needs demographic review
            * Suggested that this isn’t done every appointment, maybe every 3-6 months
        * All pre-check-in statuses, they find useful.
            * Asks if we can add a reminder for the Veteran to arrive 15 minutes early to their appointment to pre-check-in.
* 2 MSAs like the idea of pre-check-in as a concept, but they don’t believe that older Veterans  will complete it.
* LPNs call each patient 7 day prior to an appointment to do basically our concept of pre-check-in over the phone.
    * The clinic manager stated that he would still call the patients a head of time due to clinical reminders.
        * We also discussed how medication reconciliation is a big deal to review prior to an appointment.

### Reporting wants
* The clinic manager is interested in the following metrics
    * Time when the Veteran arrives
    * Time when the nurse and doctor see them
    * Time when the Veteran checks out.

### If you could make one change to check-in, what would it be…
* Kiosk don’t work a lot
* VeText doesn’t give you an alerts, so you have to physically pull it up to see if someone texted. Veterans get lost in the parking lot.
    * The nursing staff doesn’t get VetLink alerts for COVID, so MSAs have to send Teams messages.
* VetLink currently only prints med lists. The routing sheets don’t print, so the MSA have to manually write out a routing sheet for each patient. It is time consuming.
* Add an alert that pops up no matter what screen you are on. 
    * It needs to be system-wide.
* A clinic view where the calendar changed color would be ok too
    * Though the MSAs do oversee multiple clinics
* Just have the Veterans come to the front desk, so you know that you didn’t miss anyone - 2 MSAs
    * The lines at this clinic tend to max out at 5 to 6 Veterans waiting to talk to the MSAs.

### Pre-registration
* Pre-registration is mostly Veteran-led meaning that the Veteran lets them know that something needs to be updated. The staff don’t necessary ask for updates. 
* They only do temporary address updated. The updates are done in VSE. If a Veterans permanent address needs to be updated, then they send them to eligibility. 
    * They may email eligibility about the change for the Veteran or they have the patient contact eligibility themself.
* They do update phone and email in VSE.
* Some MSAs ask about next of kin or emergency contact, while other don’t.
* They do not ask if someone needs a change to their advance directive.
* 2 MSAs would like to be able to mark which phone is the Veteran’s preferred phone number.

### MSA tasks
* Check-in and check-out
* Scheduling new appointments
* They print out ICB list in the morning.
    * They have to keep refreshing ICB throughout the day.
    * They can’t currently check insurance for VVC appointments.
* At the end of the day, they print out schedule an pre-write the cover routing sheets
    * MSA feels they are killing trees, because there are no shows that they prepare cover sheets for.
* They help new patients, by walking them through the kiosk process.

### Accessibility and check-in
* They tend to know their patients, so they know who needs help.
    * For example, they will bring a wheelchair for certain Veterans. 
- The kiosks tend to be tall for people in wheelchairs.
* Disabled Veterans tend to end up checking in with an MSA or they sometime have a helper with them. The helper will check-in at the kiosk for the Veteran.
* For Veterans with hearing disabilities (but can still hear some), the MSAs tend to yell, which they acknowledge “isn’t the best, because then everyone hears.”
