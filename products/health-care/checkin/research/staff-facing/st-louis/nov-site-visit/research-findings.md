## OCTO-DE goals that this research supports
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Measures to increase
  - Completion rate of online transactions
  - Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Measures to decrease
  - Time to successful complete and submit online transactions

## Background and Methodology
### Background
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. One portion of the ecosystem enables Veterans to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via va.gov. Another portion, called pre-check-in, allows the Veteran to complete a series of tasks, in order to prepare for their appointment, a few days before the appointment.

With this round of research, we were looking to understand the current check-in workflows at the Franklin County VA Clinic in Washington, Missouri, which is the proposed next pilot site for the product. We also wanted to get feedback on pre-check-in, pre-registration, and staff indicators/alerts. Once we arrived onsite, we were invited by the MSA Supervisor to visit St. Charles County VA Clinic in O’Fallon, Missouri.

The complete [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/nov-site-visit/conversation-guide.md) utilized at both locations as well as the [notes from the visit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/nov-site-visit/visit-notes.md) can be found on VA’s GitHub.

### Methodology
- At Franklin County VA Clinic, we conducted interviews with and observed the following staff:
  - 3 Medical Support Assistants (MSA)
  - 1 MSA Lead
  - 1 MSA Supervisor (same person as St. Charles County)
  - 1 Clinic Manager
- We also observed a few Veterans checking in on a kiosk as staff assisted them. We did not engage Veterans or ask them questions.

- At St. Charles County VA Clinic, we conducted interviews with and observed the following staff:
  - 3 MSAs
  - 1 MSA Lead (very briefly)
  - 1 MSA Supervisor (same person as Franklin County)
  - 1 Clinic Manager

- One waiting room for 3 primary care providers and 9 other specialties, such as physical therapy and labs.
- An hour away from the main St. Louis VAMC, not super close to other VA locations, and in a more rural location.

### About St. Charles County VA Clinic
- One waiting room for 4 primary care providers and 9 other specialties, such as physical therapy and labs.
- A larger, younger and more tech-savvy patient population than Franklin with better cell reception and closer to St. Louis.

## Key Findings
### Patient Tracking
- Franklin utilizes VetLink and Teams messages to notify clinical staff that Veterans have arrived. St. Charles mostly used VetLink for these notifications and sent Teams messages as an extreme back-up.
- St. Charles utilizes VetLink statuses throughout the entire appointment.
- MSAs requested visual alerts be added to the new check-in solution. They want the alerts to remain on the screen until they are acknowledged.
- Clinic managers are interested in understanding how long it takes a Veteran to go through each stage of an appointment.

### Pre-registration, Pre-check-in, and Statuses for Staff 
- Franklin and St. Charles MSAs don’t update permanent addresses for Veterans. Phone, email, next of kin and emergency contact changes are most often made if the Veteran requests them.
- MSAs do not have a way to determine a Veteran’s preferred phone number.
- Pre-check-in may occur at the same time as other appointment notifications, such as phone calls from LPNs. Staff commented that Veterans already receive too many appointment notifications, thus they ignore them.
- All staff found it valuable to know when a Veteran completed pre-check-in, started check-in, and completed check-in via mobile check-in. They also wanted to know if they needed to review demographic or insurance information with the Veteran.

### Printing
- A routing sheet/cover sheet and medication list automatically print when a Veteran checks in. The MSA’s workload greatly increases when this printing capability isn’t working. The routing sheet serves multiple purposes for both the Veteran and provider.

### Pilot Site Location Feedback
- The MSA Supervisor and Clinic Manager suggested that St. Charles might be a better pilot site due to better cell reception and a younger/more tech-savvy patient population.

## Detailed Research Findings
### Patient Tracking
**Franklin utilizes VetLink and Teams messages to notify clinical staff that Veterans have arrived. St. Charles mostly used VetLink for these notifications and sent Teams messages as an extreme back-up.**
- Most specialists and LPNs monitor VetLink; clinical staff do not have access to VSE GUI.
  - Some providers still periodically check the waiting room to see if a Veteran arrived.
- When Teams messages were sent, they were sent to a channel with everyone in the clinic.
- Some Teams messages were also sent to coordinate next steps, such as letting the MSA know a Veteran needs to schedule a follow-up appointments.

**St. Charles utilizes VetLink statuses throughout the entire appointment.**
- The clinical staff will mark that the Veteran is with the nurse or done within VetLink.

**MSAs requested visual alerts be added to the new check-in solution. They want the alerts to remain on the screen until they are acknowledged.**
- The current Teams messages get lost due to interruptions and multiple messages coming in at once.
- Due to phone calls and other noises, some of the currently existing audible alerts have been missed.
- Due to utilizing multiple applications, overseeing multiple clinics, and dealing with constant interruptions, MSAs want the alert to stay up until it is acknowledged. They worry the alert might be missed otherwise.

**Clinic managers are interested in understanding how long it takes a Veteran to go through each stage of an appointment.**
- They mentioned the following time intervals to be of interest:
  - time when the Veteran arrives.
  - time when the nurse calls them back.
  - time when the doctor/provider starts to see them.
  - time when the Veteran checks out.

### Pre-registration, Pre-check-in, and Statuses for Staff
**Franklin and St. Charles MSAs don’t update permanent addresses for Veterans. Phone, email, next of kin and emergency contact changes are most often made if the Veteran requests them.**
- Since they can only impact permanent address changes for 30 days, they no longer update permanent addresses for Veterans.
  - Veterans are directed to the kiosk or eligibility department to update their permanent address. MSAs will send information to eligibility on behalf of the  Veteran if the Veteran prefers.
- Other demographics are most often updated when the Veteran mentions to the MSA that they need an update and not by the MSA asking. 
  - Both sites try to direct Veterans to check in via the kiosk, which does make the Veteran review all of this information.
- Staff say the kiosk asks too many questions, which results in Veterans abandoning their check-in or getting frustrated. 
- Often the MSAs have to leave their post behind the counter and go into the waiting room to help Veterans with the kiosk. 
- These clinics state that having a correct address is very important due to travel pay fraud and medications being sent to the wrong location.
  - Franklin staff mentioned that they receive 40-50 phone calls a week about lost medications.

**MSAs do not have a way to determine a Veteran’s preferred phone number.**
- They can view mobile, home, and work phone numbers, but they do not know if the Veteran wants them to call their mobile or home.

**Pre-check-in may occur at the same time as other appointment notifications, such as phone calls from LPNs. Staff commented that Veterans already receive too many appointment notifications, thus they ignore them.**
- Staff believe some no shows or Veterans coming onsite at incorrect times or days is partially due to ignoring current appointment notifications.
  - Staff mentioned that it might be better to review demographic information every so often and not at every appointment.
- LPNs call about a week prior to an appointment and ask a lot of the same questions that are planned for pre-check-in.
- One clinic manager stated that they would not stop their LPNS from making certain pre-visit phone calls without medication reconciliation and clinical reminders being a part of pre-check-in.

**All staff found it valuable to know when a Veteran completed pre-check-in, started check-in, and completed check-in via mobile check-in. They also wanted to know if they needed to review demographic or insurance information with the Veteran.**
- Pre-check-in started was the only status that some staff thought wouldn’t be valuable to them.
- Staff absolutely wanted to know if a Veteran started check-in, but didn’t finish. They would have to find and help that Veteran complete check-in.
- MSAs wanted to know when a Veteran successfully checked in, so they could notify clinical staff.
- Knowing if they needed to take action and review demographic or insurance information was important to MSAs. 

### Printing
**A routing/cover sheet and medication list automatically print when a Veteran checks in. The MSA’s workload greatly increases when this printing capability isn’t working. The routing sheet serves multiple purposes for both the Veteran and provider.**
- The routing sheet hasn’t been printing at St. Charles for awhile. As a result, MSAs have to manually write out routing sheets for each Veteran.
- The routing sheets purposes are:
  - They tell the provider who the Veteran is and some basic information about them. 
  - Since Veterans check in for all appointments at once at the beginning of the day, this sheets help “route” the Veteran through multiple appointments.
    - Most Veterans at Franklin have multiple appointments in a day, since many travel long distances to come to the site.
      - It also helps limit their co-pays, since Veterans normally receive co-pays on a per day basis (according the Franklin staff).
  - A summary of the Veteran’s diagnosis and what was discussed at the appointment are handwritten by providers on this sheet of paper. 
    - A list of referrals for additional appointments are also listed on this sheet.
  - At the end of the appointment, the Veteran leaves with this paper.

### Pilot Site Location Feedback
**The MSA Supervisor and Clinic Manager suggested that St. Charles might be a better pilot site due to better cell reception and a younger/more tech-savvy patient population.**
- St. Charles also has a higher volume of patients. 
- However, St. Charles is going to move locations.

## Recommendations and Next Steps
### Patient Tracking
- Implement visual alerts for MSAs that require acknowledgement, so the messages aren’t missed due to complex and busy environments.
- Implement alerting for clinical staff, so they know a Veteran has checked in.
- Explore ways to report on each phase of the appointment for clinic managers and administrators.

### Pre-registration, Pre-check-in, and Statuses for Staff
- Create guidelines on the frequency that pre-registration information should be reviewed by Veterans.
- Look into medication reconciliation and clinical reminders within the pre-check-in experience.
- Look further into the rules and protocols around updating permanent addresses.
- Add preferred phone capabilities for Veteran and staff. 
- Look into the current landscape of appointment notifications.
  - Look into notification preferences for pre-check-in data and appointment notifications.
- For the short-term, review when pre-check-in links are sent compared to LPN phone calls. Make sure the two methods don’t result in duplicate questions being asked to the Veteran.
- Add “pre-check-in complete,” “check-in started,” “check-in complete,” “demographics needs to be reviewed,” and “insurance needs to be reviewed” statuses for MSA. Further evaluate the need for the “pre-check-in started” status.

### Printing
- Explore alternative solutions to automatic printing that meet the same needs as current printing.
- Share co-pay information and number of weekly phone calls about lost medications with va.gov and mobile app teams working in those areas.

### Pilot Site Location Feedback
- After visiting both locations, we agree that St. Charles might be the better pilot site. However, an alternative solution to printing and staff alerts are needed before either can become a pilot site.
