### Key Findings

- MSAs see value in allowing editing of demographic information in pre-check-in. 
- Some staff felt that the roll out lacked proper communication and training. Staff would benefit from training on a variety of fronts. E.g., how to use Workflows in VSE-CS, how to fix specific "hard stops" during check-in, when MSAs should check in Veterans themselves, etc. The amount of training MSAs received was a major factor on whether they felt their job was greatly impacted. 
- Some MSAs are using VSE-CS, which was not the original intent. Often to avoid the “lag” between systems, the want to use fewer systems or for reasons we do not yet understand. 
- Technical and network issues have been the root of some staff unhappiness, however most see the potential of check-in when those issues are resolved.
- Staff had a variety of recommendations for VSE-CS, including more visual alerts for status changes, open text box option for Workflow status, adding last 4 digits of SSN to patient name and filtering options in Workflow. 
- Some staff see value in adding patients flags to VSE-CS, while others are content with using CPRS. 
- Each clinic handles pre-registration for patients with telephone appointments differently.
