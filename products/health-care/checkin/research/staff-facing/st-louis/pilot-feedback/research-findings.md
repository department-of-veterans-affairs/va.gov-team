# Research Goals

The check-in product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The check-in experience team, in particular, has created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check-in” through VA.gov (e.g., letting the VA know that the patient has arrived for their appointment). 

With this round of research, we are looking to gather feedback on the pilot release from staff across the St. Louis area. We are also interested in gaining insights into how to connect telemedicine appointments to pre-check-in and display patient record flags. Going on-site allows us to quickly interview many more Medical Support Assistants (MSA) and clinic management members compared to remote interviews.

The purpose of this research was to: 

- Evaluate effectiveness of check-in and pre-check-in experiences with Veterans and staff at St. Louis pilot clinics.
- Identify strengths, pain points and opportunities to inform product team and roadmap (as VISN rollouts begin). 
- Evaluate effectiveness of new poster that addresses low-vision concerns. 
- Gain insights and opinions on product naming.  
- Gain insights from VA staff on opportunities to integrate telephone appointments with pre-check-in and displaying patient record flags in VSE-CS. 

# Research Questions

- Are Veterans able to complete pre-check-in successfully from home? Do they understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in? 
- What friction points arise for Veterans during check-in? How easy or difficult is check-in to complete on VA.gov? 
- What is the impact on the new poster addressing low vision concerns? 
- How do Veterans refer to the check-in process? 
- How do MSAs interact with Veterans during the check-in process? What impact does pre-check-in and check-in have on MSAs workflow? 
- What are the overall impressions of check-in among Veterans and staff? 
- How are patient record flags currently used by staff? 
- How would adding telephone appointments to the pre-check-in experience impact staff workflow?  

# Methodology 

From April 27-29, 2022, we visited St. Louis VAMC, North County CBOC and Olive Street VA Clinic to conduct intercept interviews with Veterans when they arrived for their appointment. We observed Veterans interact with the updated poster, complete check-in on their mobile device and asked follow-up questions. 

We also observed and interviewed a variety of VA staff who have a role in the check-in process, including MSAs and clinicians. We used a [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/pilot-feedback/conversation-guide.md) to steer those conversations. 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans should be able to successfully complete pre-check-in from the comfort of their homes. Veterans will correctly assume that they still need to complete mobile check-in even if they completed pre-check-in. The pre-check-in experience improves the staff experience, since they need to review contact, next of kin and emergency contact information with fewer Veterans.<br>
    1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: Most Veterans we spoke with did not complete pre-check-in. Therefore, there wasn't enough information to determine ease of use or perceptions about how it's related to check-in. However, staff said that when Veterans complete pre-check-in, it creates a more seamless check-in experience on the day of the appointment. 
1. Veterans will be able to successfully check-in via their mobile device, verify their identity and confirm their demographic information without any friction. In the ideal scenario, Veterans will be able to complete check-in with little to no intervention from MSAs. Therefore, MSAs should have shorter lines of Veterans waiting to check in, since Veterans will be utilizing the new check-in solution in the waiting area. 
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Some Veterans were able to complete check-in on their own, while others needed assistance from MSAs. In addition, in some clinics, MSAs engaged Veterans to help with the check-in process. Of course, there were Veterans that did not want to use the mobile check-in process, therefore requiring MSAs to assist them with check-in through VSE-GUI. 
1. The updated poster enables low-vision Veterans to easily read check-in instructions. 
    1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: Based on the nature of the research, we were not able to capture demograhpic information from Veterans. Many Veterans at the eye clinic were not thrilled with checking in on their mobile device, but it's unclear if the poster was problematic for them. 
1. MSAs will still check-in Veterans who prefer in-person over mobile. 
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Some clinics checked Veterans in through VSE-GUI that didn't want to use their phone, while other clinics were much more insistent on Veterans using thier phones.  
1. Veteran responses will indicate that the pre-check-in and mobile phone check-in solutions are useful and do not negatively impact their care experience.
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Responses were mixed. Some Veterans simply do not want to use their phone to check in, and of course, some cannot due to various reasons. However, other Veterans had no difficulty with the new process. 
1. Staff responses will indicate that the mobile check-in solution is useful and does not negatively impact experience or clinical workflow.
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Staff see the potential, but are hesitant until technical and lag issues are resolved. 
1. Properly displaying patient record flags is very important to staff.
    1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: There were mixed opinions on where patient record flags should reside. Some feel that flags could be added to VSE-CS, while others are content with CPRS. 
1. Gathering necessary pre-registration and other information prior to a telephone appointment can be difficult. Adding telephone appointments to pre-check-in would solve the staff pain point of reviewing pre-registration during appointments.
    1. LIKELY TRUE: Clinics and providers seem to be inconsistent in how pre-registration is completed for telephone appointments. Therefore, utilizing the new check-in process would create consistencies. 

# Key Findings

1. MSAs see value in allowing editing of demographic information in pre-check-in. 
1. Some staff felt that the roll out lacked proper communication and training. Staff would benefit from training on a variety of fronts. E.g., how to use Workflows in VSE-CS, how to fix specific "hard stops" during check-in, when MSAs should check in Veterans themselves, etc. The amount of training MSAs received was a major factor on whether they felt their job was greatly impacted. Some MSAs are using VSE-CS, which was not the original intent. Often to avoid the “lag” between systems, the want to use fewer systems or for reasons we do not yet understand. 
1. Technical and network issues have been the root of some staff unhappiness, however most see the potential of check-in when those issues are resolved.
1. Staff had a variety of recommendations for VSE-CS, including more visual alerts for status changes, open text box option for Workflow status, adding last 4 digits of SSN to patient name and filtering options in Workflow. 
1. Some staff see value in adding patients flags to VSE-CS, while others are content with using CPRS. 
1. Each clinic handles pre-registration for patients with telephone appointments differently.

# Details of Findings 

Labels: AUD: Staff, PRDT: health-care-check-in, RESRCH: Interviews, VETSJNY: Taking care of themselves

**MSAs see value in allowing editing of demographic information in pre-check-in.**

MSAs felt that allowing Veterans to edit their information in pre-check-in would expedite the check-in process. I.e., Veterans wouldn't be required to speak with an MSA if their information needs to be updated. In turn, shortening the line of Veterans that have to speak to MSAs on the day of their appointment. 

> _If the Veteran does pre-check-in, it saves us time. They should be able to update their demographic information in pre-check-in._

**Some staff felt that the roll out lacked proper communication and training. Based on our observations, staff would benefit from training on a variety of fronts. Some MSAs are using VSE-CS, which was not the original intent. Often to avoid the “lag” between systems, the want to use fewer systems or for reasons we do not yet understand.**

Direction on how to use VSE-GUI and VSE-CS seemed inconsistent at times across clinics or individual MSAs. For example, some MSAs were instructed to use VSE-CS for specific activities, while others weren't. And, some MSAs were more persistent in requiring Veterans to use mobile check-in vs. simply using VSE-GUI to check them in. 

Clinics that received sufficient training and were staffed higher compared to others viewed the changes to be fairly easy and convenient. 

> _No one knew about it; neither staff or Veterans._

**Technical, network and cellular service have been the root of some staff unhappiness, however, most see the potential with check-in when those issues are resolved.**

The most common complaint received was that cellular service is not good in many locations. The second most common complaint is technical issues. E.g., where there is lag or the system is down for everyone or specific individuals. 

Clinicians in multiple clinics were frustrated at VSE-CS and said it doesn't work. E.g., concern around time it takes for statuses to change in VSE-CS. Their work has increased considerably, which is negatively impacting patient care. They are constantly having to go to the waiting room to look for patients. Then, they have to stop and assist Veterans with check-in. 

Two OT's were very unhappy with VSE-CS, primarily because of its slowness in updating patient statuses and how it was rolled out. However, when VSE-CS is working as it's supposed to, they like it. 

> _There’s potential to reduce work and improve wait times when the system is functioning properly and when Veterans have more fully adopted it._

> _It has impacted our work for the better. But, it really hurts us when the system is slow._

> _Some Veterans don’t get good cellular service in the office. In addition, many of the Veterans do not have unlimited plans, so they get charged for each text message. Sometimes, cellular service may be turned off too and the Veteran doesn’t know how to connect to WiFi or turn off airplane mode._

**Staff had a variety of recommendations for VSE-CS, including more visual alerts for status changes, open text box option for Workflow status, adding last 4 digits of SSN to patient name and filtering options in Workflow.**

- Many clinicians mentioned they’d like to see alerts in VSE-CS that persist to notify them that patients are checked in and ready to be seen. Or, highlight the row when statuses change. 
- Would like to see visual indicators, like sounds, colors, flashing, etc., to know that the screen has refreshed and there is new information. 
- One OT requested that alerts be sent to their VA pager when a patient checks in. This solution was proposed because the OT does not have a laptop and has to go back to their office to find out if their patient has arrived. (Other clinics also had clinicians that don’t have easy access to a computer.)  
- Adding last 4 digits of SSN in VSE-CS seemed helpful to most clinicians and MSAs. 
- Two clinicians talked about the need for an “other” option in the VSE-CS’s Workflow dropdown that offered an open text box. E.g., to document which provider the patient is with or enter information specific to their clinic. (It was mentioned this option was available in the previous system.) 
- The MSAs in the Speciality Care clinic would like the patient summaries to print out automatically when the patient checks in. They’d like to see the patient’s future appointments added to the Patient Summary, as well as current medications, but not discontinued medications. 
- One nurse would like the ability to use filters to shorten the list of patients by check-in status in VSE-CS, such as only show checked-in patients.

**Some staff see value in adding patient flags to VSE-CS, while others are content with using CPRS.**

- MSAs don’t always look at the patient record flags, depending on how busy they are. Most know who the patients are and their needs. 
- Some clinics use national, local, behavioral or both types of flags. 
- Two OT’s said patient flags are not needed in VSE-CS. Patient flags are in CPRS and it would be overkill to have them in both places. 

> _We don’t use patient flags. Not useful in VSE-CS. We typically see the flags in CPRS and acknowledge them._

> _Would like to see patient flags added to VSE-CS on the Workflow List as an indicator near the patient name (or in a new column). Hover text would be great. I want to avoid clicking to get the information._

> _The flag should pop up when the patient checks in._

**Each clinic handles pre-registration for patients with telephone appointments differently.**

Some clinics do more telephone appointments than others, typically based on the speciality, treatment, etc. E.g., physical therapy can’t not do phone appointments. 

Completing pre-registration is inconsistent. E.g., MSA may call before or after the appointment. Depends on how busy they are. Or, sometimes nurse will call. 

One provider was asking whether or not they could check a patient in through VSE-CS since MSAs aren’t involved with check-in for those patients. Sometimes, the MSA will mark them as a “no show” the following day because it appears they never arrived. 

# Recommendations

* **Pre-check-in**
    * Explore opportunities to increase utilization of pre-check-in with Veterans (and ensure it doesn’t “get lost”). 
        * Communicate the value to Veterans (in marketing communications, text message, etc.) 
        * Test new text messages (e.g., test moving the pre-check-in link into initial confirmation text message) 
        * Send text message at a different time or day after confirming their appointment
        * Send pre-check-in message multiple times, if not completed
        * Introduce email for pre-check-in 
    * Consider implementing editing of demographic information in pre-check-in.  

* **Check-in**
    * Consider implementing a push text message on day of appointment, e.g., pushing the check-in link out to Veterans (knowing that Veterans are arriving earlier than 30 minutes). And, consider increasing the check-in window beyond 30 minutes. 
    * Look for opportunities (via an audit) to provide more context in error messages on VA.gov pages to expedite check-in process for Veterans and staff.
    * Explore opportunities to improve the CHIP text response when 0 appointments are found. E.g., avoid Veteran confusion if/when directed to va.gov/find-locations.   
    * Work with engineers to replicate (and correct, if possible) the scenario where users are starting lower on the page after identity verification.  

* **Check-in poster**
    * Consider finding a way to include the “30 minute window” message into the poster to increase Veteran satisfaction. In addition, consider adding a VA logo to the poster to add credibility and authenticity.  
    * Consider testing a poster option where text option is primary and QR code is secondary (knowing that it’s troublesome for some Veterans and devices). 
    * Look into creating recommendations and guidelines for poster placement in clinics. Or, look for opportunities for Human Centered Designers to offer assistance at clinics when setting up posters. 

* **Back of the house**
    * Continue to look for opportunities to improve lag time between VSE-GUI and VSE-CS. 
    * Share knowledge with stakeholders and training team about the impact that training has on MSA’s workload and usage of VSE-GUI and VSE-CS. I.e., with a goal to create better consistencies on how staff use these systems, how they work with Veterans to get checked in and how to mitigate when Veterans reach hard stops. 
    * Talk to more MSAs to understand why they’re using VSE-CS. 
    * Share knowledge with stakeholders and training team on successes of a dedicated staff member helping Veterans with check-in. As a result, recommend testing at high-volume clinics. 
    * Work with VSE-CS team to understand and prioritize suggested improvements to VSE-CS. E.g., more visual alerts for status changes, open text box option for Workflow status, adding last 4 digits of SSN to patient name, filtering options in Workflow, etc. 

* **Feature enhancements**
    * Talk with additional staff to understand if patient record flags are desirable in VSE-CS.
    * Cross-reference telephone appointment findings with usability testing findings to determine if additional gaps exist prior to piloting. 
    * Prioritize feature enhancements with product owners, including:  
        * Integration of travel reimbursement into check-in 
        * Ability for caregivers to check in for Veterans 
        * Expansion into walk-in appointments

## Who we talked to

9 MSAs, MSA Leads and clinic administrators
6 clinicians

Due to the intercept method used for this research, we were unable to collect demographic information that supports the VA's inclusive research guidelines. 

We spoke with staff from a number of clinics, including:

- North County CBOC, St. Louis (Primary care, wellness, nutrition, etc.) 
- GI Lab, Eye Clinic, OT/PT, Speciality Care Clinic (at St. Louis VAMC) 
- Olive Street VA Clinic (Women's Health and Dermatology Clinic)
