# Franklin County VA Clinic New Patient Folder
Lead Researcher: Kristen McConnell, kristen.mcconnell@adhocteam.us

During the [check-in product's Nov. 2021 research trip to St. Louis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/nov-site-visit), we found out about a folder that the MSAs prepare for new patients to their primary care providers. Attached are a series of PDFs of this new patient folder's contents.
