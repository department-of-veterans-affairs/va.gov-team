## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience with checking Veterans in and tracking Veterans through their appointment or services at VA.

I’ll give a bit of background on why we want to talk to you and then tell you a bit about what this hour is going to look like. The team I'm working with is looking at how VA medical centers and CBOCs currently handle checking Veterans in and tracking Veteran through their appointment or services. As you know, the kiosk tool and VetLink software that many sites use are being deprecated in the next year, and we are talking to staff, as well as Veterans, to make sure that what is built in its place meets the needs of everyone involved. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
-	This entire session should take about 60 min. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
-	In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
-	If we’re talking about a particular software tool you use, I may ask you to share your screen so you can show me how you use it. Is that something you’re comfortable with? It’s helpful to us to see your desktop set up. We are not testing your ability.
-	If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
-	Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  -	If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
__Start recording.__
-	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
-	First off, can you tell me a bit about how your current role connects to Veteran check-in? And what about patient-tracking?
-	How long have you been in this role? _Also listen for whether they've been in a similar role elsewhere - either different site or outside of the VA network)_
-	In one word, how would you describe:
  -	The process of checking in Veterans to your facility
  - The process of queuing and tracking patients through their appointments and services at your facility

_For these tasks: stick to questions that are relevant to the participant’s role, ie for Admins, skip to Task 3, for on-the-ground staff, focus on Tasks 1 & 2._
