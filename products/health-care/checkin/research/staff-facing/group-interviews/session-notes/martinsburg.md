## Rough Notes (Full video available on Teams) 
- Researcher 1: What is the current check-in process at your facility.
- Participant 4: Process - Name and last 4. Pull them up. Verify email and address, phone number, verify insurance sometimes.They have a seat and we wait for clinical staff to come and get them.
- Participant 2 - Mentions that they use VeText. Staff send acknowledgment that we know you are here.
- Researcher 1: Kiosks in use?
- Participant 1: One in use in Pharmacy service. Used for Queuing. We have to retain that capability. 
- Researcher 1: Describe the area for check-in and waiting?
- Participant 1: Wait areas vary by department. Some are shared spaces between departments. They try to use VeText as much as they can. They have small real estate. They still promote VeText. Very few of our Veterans are very pro technology. Most like to do things in person. 
- Researcher 1: Ask about space to hang posters?
- Participant 1: Yes, but some places are small. We have other required signage up. Bene travel fraud. Walls have a lot of posters on it. Veterans bypass some signage currently. There is so much on the walls at times that they don’t see it.
- Researcher 1: How do we over come that?
- Participant 1: Face-to-face interactions.
- Participant 4: We would take the time to explain.
- Researcher 1: What is the cell coverage like at your facility?
- Participant 1: Depends upon location and carrier. Middle of hospital has no cell cover. They have a wifi hotspot by the canteen. Some of the other facilities (Cumberland) don’t have the best wifi.
- Participant 4: It is next to my clinic. (Her clinic is probably the best of WiFi.)
- Researcher 1: What check-in metrics are important at your sites?
- Participant 1: ICB, Pre-reg, Patient check-in time, Patient safety, phone numbers. 90% ICB. Phone number is safety issue if meds go to the wrong place or they have to send an ambulance there. Address is very important for beneficary travel - they try to get the most money possible. They say they live 120 miles away and like really live like 5. Pharmacy is always concerned about address. They mandate pre-reg at every desk that they check in at. 
- Participant 2: Asks about what staff can see VSE. We explained.
- VSE is the primary application in rehab and physical medicine. Seemed to be primary in other areas, but hard to confirm.
- Researcher 1: Asks about other tools.
- Participant 4: They still use Blue Vista.
- Participant 4: They still made Veterans check-in face to face if they checked in with VetLink.
- Participant 4: Most clinical staff don’t have access to VSE. Some have read only. We notify using IM that they have patients here. Otherwise, staff just come out and get them (based upon their overall schedule for the day).
- Researcher 1: How do you help prep for the day?
- Participant 4: We print a list for the day for each provider. Or, they go into CPRS and look. In Rehab, they look at VSE.
- Participant 1: There is a list if Veterans cancels that is sent out to the services. There is a list of VeText that comes in. They send that out.
- Participant 2: Except the lab, they have a list of who needs to be rescheduled or canceled.
- Researcher 1: When is a Veterans deemed too late for their appointment?
- Participant 4: Halfway through the appointment time, then the Veteran gets no showed.
- Participant 1: Clinical services retain some ability to see Veterans that do show up late.
- Researcher 1: What would you change about the check-in process?
- Participant 1: Wrap everything into one system. MSAs have 6 -7 applications open at a time.
- Participant 4: Agrees.
- Participant 2: Kiosks eliminates stress on the MSAs. Phone check-in is good, but we still need a standing piece of hardware.
- Researcher 1: What to keep?
- Participant 1: Support the kiosks. The telephone is a monitor measure as well. Having a kiosk on the floor is a timesaving and takes burden off MSAs.
- Participant 4: All for phone check-in, but I’m old school enough to know that face-to-face will still happen. They need to work together smoothly. MSAs need to use both smoothly.
