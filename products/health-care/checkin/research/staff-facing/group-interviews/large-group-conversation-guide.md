## Intro - 5 minutes
Hi everyone, thank you all so much for taking time out of your day to talk with us. I'm [name], I'll be guiding our conversation today. A few of my colleagues are on the call to take notes and listen in.

I’ll give a bit of background on why we want to talk to you all and then tell you a bit about what this hour is going to look like. So, the team I'm working with is looking at how VA medical centers and CBOCs currently handle checking Veterans in and tracking Veteran through their appointment or services. As you know, the kiosk tool and VetLink software that many sites use are being decommissioned in the next year, and we are talking to staff as well as Veterans to make sure that what is built in its place meets the needs of everyone involved. 

What I'm hoping we will do today is have a conversation about how check in and patient tracking work at your facility, what’s working and what’s not working. I know you are all involved at different levels and different points in the process, I want to hear about each of your perspectives. I expect there to be differences in your perspectives, and that is actually really helpful. The purpose of this conversation is not to reach any sort of consensus. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about 60 min. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers. I’m not going to be offended, I’m interested in honesty.
- I know you all have other responsibilities besides talking to me for an hour, so if you have to hop off at any time, we understand. 
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

__Start recording.__
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes
Let's start with a quick round of introductions, you all might know each other, but my colleagues and I don't know you yet.

- If you could, share your name (and pronouns if you’d like to share them), your area or clinics & how your current role connects to check-in and patient tracking.

Thanks for doing that, gives me a bit more context for our conversation. 

We have a large diverse group on the line today, so let's dive right in to some questions.

## Check-in Questions - 30 min
- Could you describe the check in process from end to end, starting with the Veteran entering the building, and ending when they are called back into a clinical area.

- Are there any special check-in processes for rehab, radiology, primary care?

- Could you describe the area for check in and waiting? (If not included in their original description)

- Is there a place to easily hang posters or signage in your clinic?

- How is cell coverage in your clinic?

- What about check-in is important to you as admins? What metrics do you track?

- Are there any activities staff do at the start of the day to prep for that Veteran's visit?

- What tools do you use to check patients into your clinic?

- Are kiosks currently in use?

- Are staff using VetLink for check-in currently?

- Is it common for single appointments in primary care, GI, internal medicine to be split in VistA into a triage appt and a provider appt?

- What do staff do when the check-in systems go down, what is the workaround they use?

- How are front desk staff trained?

- How do front desk staff let clinical staff know that a patient is here? And why do you use that method?

- When kiosks are/were used, how would front desk staff know that Veterans are checked in?

- How do staff communicate to Veterans when they are ready for their appointment or services?

- What tools do providers and nurses have access to?

- At what point after an appt time is a Veteran considered late? How does that affect your clinic? What do staff do to accommodate late patients?

- What assistance do you provide for Veterans who may have low-vision or hearing difficulties?

## Final Thoughts - 10 min
- If you could change one thing about the check-in process, what would it be to make it easier for staff?

- What worries do you have about the Kiosk & Vet link software going away and a new check-in process/system being available in its place?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 min
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on this experience for both staff and Veterans.

- Are there other folks from your site who weren’t in this conversation who have a different perspective that we should to talk to prior to pilot?

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
