# Dallas Site Visit Interview Notes – Day 1 (June 24,2021)

## Conversation with MAS Staff
Claims travel used to take 20s and now takes 15 min, was useful to have on kiosks

Vetlink working 8/10 for Dallas.
Provider buy in for vetlink took 2 years.
Training for Vetlink took 3-6 months.

Vetext was all or nothing, which sucks – you have to turn it on for the whole facility, only worked well at CBOCs. 
So many complaints about people waiting in cars.

MAS supports MSA staff at all but a handful of clinics

Insurance capture rates are important to admins.

MAS staff are not managing the kiosk question flow/content.

Tried a wayfinding kiosk a couple years ago, removed it. 

MSAs could probably handle the no-kiosk check in, from a volume stand point.

Site security staff member says connecting to velocity, and badging system would be great?

## Observing MSA Staff

Sat at clinic check-in area for 3 ish hours. This is a high-functioning team of MSAs, they pick up the phone quickly, they follow through with Veterans to make sure that they are scheduled for follow ups, they give instructions to folks who are walking by, they help eachother out etc.

### Environment
Primary Care Check-in Station on main hallway, sliding windows for each workstation on the top of the counter surface.
Small waiting area across from check in desk.
One kiosk is enabled, (especially for our visit) situated next to the waiting room. Otherwise kiosks are not enabled at this facility.
3 MSAs for 4 doctors.
Each MSA has a laptop connected to two monitors (they used to have a desktop, with two smaller monitors) sometimes the programs all crash simultaneously.
Other things in the room: shredder bin, big copier/printer. 
The environment can get noisy, if multiple Veterans are being served, the MSAs have to speak up to be heard through the gap in the windows

### Sequence
Print out roster of appts per doc every day, from VistA or CPRS? Printout gets put in file organizer for nurses to grab.
When Veteran approaches counter, MSA asks for last name and last four, search in VetLink ("Smith 1234" = s1234) Vetlink shows list of matches, select correct match based on last name. Opens that patient, clicks check-in box and reviews ‘pre-registration’ information page. MSA confirms Veteran appointment, or if provider is not in the clinic, then redirects to the correct clinic. If in correct place, MSA asks “phone, address, insurance all up to date?” 
* MSA asks this everytime, because know way to know when it was last updated.
* Insurance updates happen in ICB, ICB filters by clinic, and only shows folks who have appointments for that day in that clinic who need an insurance check. Manually enter insurance card information, because insurance scanner is unreliable, and sometimes insurance cards aren’t in great shape.
MSA clicks complete button (save?) on vetlink and Veteran is now checked in. Can also check-in via VSE, but don’t do it because it’s not as simple as it is in VetLink.
After checking in, MSA looks up which Nurse is associated with the provider (schedules change hourxhour if coverage for a nurse who is out). Then message that nurse or lvn (who does vitals etc) in Teams that the patient has arrived. 
* For last couple weeks, MSAs have been told to not use Teams to communicate with clinical staff, because if everyone decides to use VetLink, it protects the MSAs from accusations of not notifying providers that the patient has arrived (which has happened before).
* Nurses/providers don’t always check VetLink for patients check-in status
Nurse comes out to call patient, if patient isn't there, then nurse checks with MSA to make sure they're calling the right person. MSA might call the Veteran on the phone to see where they are. 
Afer appt, Veteran comes to desk to schedule next appointment if they have a return to clinic order.
Checking in is “very easy”, there was training but it’s really “self-explanatory”
If Veteran asks about travel, then MSAs hand them a paper form or a packet of instructions to do it online.


Notes: 
* If a patient checks in at another area, we don’t know where they are.
* VetLink doesn’t show upcoming appointments. 
* This team doesn’t use memo field, except when they used to resolve travel.
* If VetLink is out, can use VSE, if VSE is out, can use VistA.
* Training from VSE came in a ppt.
* When other staff schedule an RTC in VistA, it doesn’t automatically connect to the order, then have to manually resolve (condition?) the order in VSE. If you schedule from VSE from the order, it auto resovles the order.
* MSAs are required to verify patient information, and saving it on vetlink, even if no changes, serves as proof of verification with patient.
* In VSE checked in patients are Yellow, checked out patients are orange, not yet checked in patients are purple, no-shows are red.
* Very rare that a Veteran has issue with eligibility or enrollment, would show up in VetLink and CPRS.

### Observed Interactions
Veteran attempts to check-in via kiosk, takes a long time (multiple minutes), then Vet says they’re all set. Looking at VetLink, says no appointments, but MSA looks and sees that that they do have an appointment with a provider in this area, but the clinic hasn’t been updated in Vetlink to include the new provider. MSA has to finish check-in for the patient in VetLink.

Patient calls to talk to nurse, either route to nurse or open message manager from CPRS to send Nurse a message to call patient back.

Veteran approaches window for appt, appt was cancelled yesterday because provider left clinic, patient wasn’t notified of cancellation. 

MSA staff holler out of window to Veteran in waiting room to make sure they're checked in and waiting in the right place.

MSA hollers after patient after their appt, making sure they scheduled their next appt. Veteran wants to print out their upcoming appt list, MSA does that for them, reminds veteran to get labs before next appt (2wks - 2hrs before).

Interruptions to ask for directions:
* I’m lost – trying to find parking lot
* Where is conference room
* Staff member asks MSAs for help in helping patient find MS clinic
* Is this where covid vaccines are happening

Veteran approaches window saying they are having pain in their arm and it’s so messed up that they can’t come see the doctor. Veteran is on the verge of tears. MSAs offer to schedule appt, direct to ER.


### Anecdotes:
* Once a patient called to make sure their myhealthevet phone number change populated.
* Sometimes patients want to add temp address so their meds send to the right place.
* Sometimes, MSAs float to other places, have to learn other clinics systems.
* When theres only one MSA, having the kiosk helps relieve the pressure on the one staff member doing check in.
