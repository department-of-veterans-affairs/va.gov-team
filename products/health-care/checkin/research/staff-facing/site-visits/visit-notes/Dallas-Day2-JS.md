# Day 2 Dallas site visit
## Overall
### Environment
All kiosks need to be plugged into the ethernet, in addition to power, so ports determine where the kiosks can be placed.
There are signs all over this VA, some are more highly produced, with official branding, and in banner stands. Some are printed on A4 paper with 'use next window' taped to the glass on windows. 

## Enrollment & Eligibility, Decedent Affairs, ID
### Environment
8-10 booths for service, 2 dedicated to check-in only. Waiting area with table – multiple Veterans sitting at table filling out forms. No line, no Veterans seeking services at windows.

### Notes
Used to use VetLink kiosk for queuing, volume is way down now – so much of it can be done online (1010EZ). 

VetLink also acted as a staff performance tracking tool, because some people would only see one Veteran in a day, and some would see 10, but adding in VetLink made a big difference.

Now, only thing that would be useful would be to have ID queuing.

## PM&R
### Environment
•	Upstairs, waiting area with one large clinic area through a door, clinic area is on opposite side of waiting room from the check-in desk. One kiosk at main entrance to the waiting room. Additional treatment room down hallway, not connected to the waiting room.
•	Provider work stations in treatment area down hallway are cubicles within the main treatment area with rehabilitation equipment filling the room. Didn’t look at the check-in set up to see what workstations look like for MSAs, but only 2 MSAs at desk.
•	In the treatment rooms there are large monitors on the walls, currently they show system error message.

### Provider-Facing Sequence
There used to be a sign at the kiosk instructing Veterans to check-in at the kiosk and then also check in at the desk.

Therapist reports that when patients used to check in via kiosk, it doesn’t show them as checked in in VistA/VetLink. Therapist said that the clerk has to mark them as checked-in in VetLink and Vista. “It would really be great if VetLink and VistA could talk to eachother”

Therapist uses VistA all the time, that’s how they currently see if a Veteran is checked in. 

Sometimes the MSAs will let therapists know if a Veteran is there using Teams (“skype”), but therapist reports this happens inconsistently, and VistA is the most reliable source of information.

Used to be that when a Veteran arrived, their last name, first initial and clinic would appear in a list on the monitors throughout the treatment area. 

Just started using Vocera, used to use pagers “10 o’clock is here”

MSA Sequence – conversation with Supervisor and off-site CBOC supervisor (who used to be MSA)
Not using VetLink to check-in, using VSE or VistA. Report that Vetlink does insurance verification, because ICB and VetLink talk to eachother.
“It would be great if the Kiosk also did pre-registration”
Doing all of these steps would be great because they are part of the MSA performance evaluation.
Vets sometimes have 3-4 appts / week at PM&R, asking them the preregistration questions is silly, but it’s part of the MSA eval. 

Sometimes Vets are in line to schedule 16 follow up appointments all at once, and some Vets just need to check-in. So if it takes a while to check-in then they’re late to their appt, and they’ve missed half of their 30 min appt but they’re there in the waiting room waiting in line.
150 appointments / day, which is just about back at pre-covid levels. Only two kiosks and two MSAs.

“Check-in on the phone would be awesome”

I am here – “It was good” “sometimes we didn’t see that they sent a message” “you was frustrated – wooo, yes”
It would be great if we didn’t have to tell them to come in, like we did with VEText, but they could still check-in on their phones.

We would like it if providers were on VetLink, but they say “I’m not on my computer”

Took three years to get Vocera acquired and on site. 

Monitor in the treatment rooms was good, shows last name, first initial, clinic. Therapist knows what clinic they are in. 

Some people work here and they never learn anything about the clinical, but we’re trying to provide good customer service.

## Primary Care Clinic 2

### Environment
Check in for these primary care clinics is in a large courtyard/atrium, only clinic numbers on signage. Middle of large room has many waiting room cubicles, each with about 6 chairs, and 3 TV screens in the cubicle wall, one screen has TV, the other two are either blank or have console message, there are probably 8-12 of these waiting room cubicles. The atrium is open, with balconies to multiple floors of other clinics overlooking the waiting area).

MSA’s sit in booths, with walls on either side separating the MSAs from eachother and the Veterans from eachother. Booths for check in have those mirror curved things on the side walls, that let staff sitting in cubicles see if folks are in line to check in. 

Sequence conversation with LVN Fill-in (who is actually RN, float)
LVN has CPRS and VetLink open on two monitors, looking at VetLink for when patients have checked in. 

LVN also has a printed roster of patients for each doc they’re covering. On the top of the page an RN has written the room number the doctor is assigned to for the day.

Before, without VetLink, if you went out to call someone and they were in the bathroom, you might mark them as a no-show because you didn’t know if they were here. (RN doesn’t have access to VSE).

“Someone wrote ‘with Nurse’, I’ve never written a note, but that way I know I don’t need to go get them” Note: none of the activity buttons on VetLink were visible on the screen.
“none of the providers can see [VetLink].

When patient shows as checked in, RN goes and calls their name – sometimes yelling it into the whole atrium waiting area.

LVN has their own space to do initial screen (or maybe they take to the room the provider is assigned to for the day?), in the case of the person we talked to, it was a closet-sized space with a small desk and a chair that was also a scale.

LVN takes vitals, does preventative screens (depression/suicide screen, fall risk, etc) and any other Due Now items (vaccines, etc) in the reminder section of CPRS. Sometimes the Veteran says “why are you asking me all these questions”

After completing intake tasks LVN will either:
•	Message doc in Teams to see if they are ready for patient
•	Walk by the providers room to see if they are ready
•	Escort the patient back into the lobby, where the provider will call for them when the provider is ready.

After the provider sees the patient, they would close the encounter note in CPRS but they don’t necessarily do that right away, they might do it all at the end of the day.

Sometimes the LVN/RN will look in VistA at schedules to see about availability for a followup, but LVN/RN doesn’t schedule the appt (no access to VSE), instead coordinates between doc and MSA about RTC order.

If a patient on the roster hasn’t checked in after their scheduled appt time, LVN will call them on their listed number and see where they are. If they are five minutes away, they maybe wouldn’t call the next patient – assuming the next patient is ready early. Or if the earlier patient is 30 minutes away the LVN/RN might call the later patient back if they are there early.

Do all clinics like calling patients when they’re a few minutes late? No, different clinics do it differently. Some say, don’t call the patients, it takes too long, and if theres too much volume at that clinic we don’t have time to call.

### Notes
•	Someone else set up the clinic / filter view for the LVN
•	This clinic does not use room flags or routing slips on doors to indicate patient readiness for the provider.
•	Today only covering 1 doc, who has 3 patients that day.

### Interactions
Doc poked head in the room to see if a different LVN was around, because a patient needed a shingles vaccine. Interviewee wrote down name and last four of patient, and ‘shing 2nd dose’ on the patient roster. A few minutes later the provider came back to see if interviewee had already given the shot because the other LVN was back and said they would do it but the interviewee had already gone to get the patient. 


## Pharmacy
### Environment
Pharmacy has three points of service, all along a hallway, across from the Lab and Travel office. At one end, are three kiosks, each with a large sign of instructions for the Pharmacy process. Next to the kiosks is a sub-section of the lab department, next to that is the second Pharmacy service area, with two booths for pharmacists.

Behind the pharmacists desks are 3 screens, two say ‘ScriptPro’ on them, the other was a standard monitor. Under the desks was an input switch box, because ScriptPro doesn’t run on the same machine as the rest of the computer, so staff have to use the switch box to tell the computer whether they want their mouse/keyboard to connect to the ScriptPro machine or their desktop.

Outside the second service area, above the entrance, are two large screens, one has the current queue number, with the booth/window number listed, and the other has a list of patient names. A staff member stands outside the second service area to wave folks towards the kiosks. Across from this service area is a small waiting area with a few chairs.

The third service area is for pharmacy pickup, this bay is located on the other side of the second service area from the kiosks. It is a semi-enclosed bay with 5-10 glass covered service windows, with a series of stanchions defining a line through the middle of the space. There are monitors above the entrance to this service area as well. Queue numbers are also broad cast over speakers to the pharmacy area.

Monitors displaying the pharmacy rx-ready list are also visible in the canteen. 

### Sequence
Veterans start the process at the kiosks, however staff report that often times Vets will go straight to the pickup window. A staff member outside the second service area looks for Vets looking for pharmacy and directs them to the kiosk, this person also helps Veterans who need mobility assistance or other help with the kiosk.

Veterans scans their ID card or enters their full social security number.
The screen asks them if they saw a doctor today – need more clarity on this flow.
Then it asks if they are here for pharmacy, if then say yes, it prints out a ticket with a queue number. If they say no, it says we can’t give you a ticket at this time.

Veterans then wait for their number to be called for the service area. When we were observing, there was a queue of about 6 Veterans, and only one pharmacists. The one pharmacist was able to see folks quickly enough that longest wait was about 10 minutes. 

The pharmacist has ScriptPro open, script pro shows the ticket queue, with wait times, names, ticket status, any exceptions, etc.
It also shows other pages with ticket dispersing, pharmacy orders, etc. – we did not focus on those parts.

The pharmacist can look at the whole list in scriptpro and select the next Veteran in line, look over their details and then call them to the window. When the Veteran’s number is called, it displays on the monitors in the hall, monitors inside the service area, as well as being announced over the intercom. 

If a Veteran doesn’t respond, the pharmacist can call them a second time, and mark an exception in ScriptPro (basically a reason for skipping).

The pharmacist then works with the patient, doing med counselling, etc, and works to resolve any issues with the orders – ie you have no orders, have to call your doctor to make sure they put them in, etc. Then the pharmacists tells the Veteran that when their name appears on the board outside, their meds are ready. 

Veterans then go to the pharmacy pick up window, and wait in line. The med-ready monitor shows the Veteran’s full name alphabetically by last name, and scrolls one name at a time, we didn’t time how long it takes to go through however many names, but there were probably 50 ish names on the board. Some names had a queue number next to them and some didn’t?

The line for pharm pickup was at times 5-6 people long while we were there, and only a few of the many pickup windows were open.

Old system: used to have one point of service, everyone would get in line, if a Veteran didn’t have orders in the system, then the tech at the window would have to problem solve, call the pharmacist or doc, etc. and the person would have to get back in line again to pick up their prescription.

### Interactions
Veteran number skipped (called 3936, when 3935 hadn’t been served) 3935 said – hey I haven’t been seen yet, and pharmacist explains that sometimes it shows up in her system in a different order because the software glitches if two people check in at the same time.

We observed a pharmacy staff member push a Veteran in a non-motorized wheelchair through all three steps in the process, including waiting with them in line for rx pickup.

## Lab
### Environment
Lab has a reception/waiting area that is a big rectangular bay off a main high-traffic hallway. The whole area is open to the hallway, with no wall or glass separating the two spaces. Lab service areas (where draws happen, etc) are split into two sections – one behind the reception area and one next to the pharmacy kiosks on the other side of the hall. There is one kiosk at each of the two front corners of the lab waiting area. Chairs are arranged in rows between the hallway and the reception desk, there are approximately 20 chairs. There are no chairs against the walls of the waiting area (reception staff indicated this is where folks with wheelchairs usually wait). Signs point to the kiosks instructing Vets to check-in for lab at Kiosk.

There are multiple large monitors in the waiting area, one over each of the kiosks and one very large one behind the reception desk. The left side of the monitor shows rotating announcements, (ie – a list of time windows for getting labs: 2wk-2hr before primary care, not more than 7 days for xyz care, etc). The right side of the screen shows the ticket numbers that are being called and the location they are being called to – either a booth number or a reception number. 

Four reception staff share a desk meant for two-three workstations. Some staff have one monitor, and some have two monitors. One reception staff stands at the end of the desk, their monitor and keyboard are on the top surface of the desk, not on the lower work surface. Each workstation also has a scanner, and two sticker printers sit on a file cabinet behind the reception desk. Each workstation has a sign in front indicating the reception window number in a plastic standup sleeve. On either end of the reception desk are doors to the lab service area. Above the stage right doors the sign says ‘Booths 1-9’, the sign above the stage left doors says something like ‘collection dropoff’ though I missed the exact wording.

### Sequence
When a Veteran arrives, they approach a kiosk at the hallway side of the waiting area. Reception staff report that sometimes Veterans will walk up to the desk before checking in at the kiosk to double check if they do in fact have lab orders outstanding. At the kiosk, Veterans select one of three options ‘All lab work’, ‘Urine only’, ‘specimen drop off only’. Then the kiosks asks about if the Veteran is in a wheelchair or not. We did not see the wheelchair ‘yes’ flow, but based on the reception-facing view, if a Veteran says yes to using a wheelchair, then they may be asked if the wheelchair is motorized or not. After responding to the accessibility question, the kiosks print a ticket with a letter and three digit number. The date, time, location, service type are also printed on the ticket. The veteran enters no identifying information into the 

The Veteran waits until their number appears on the monitor (I believe the number is also announced automatically on the speaker, but I didn’t write that down). When the Veteran’s name appears on the monitor, their assigned reception booth is listed under their number. If a Veteran is using a non-motorized wheelchair, they will appear on a non-motorized wheelchair queue and the receptionist might go and help them to the counter if they don’t have an escort to push their chair.

If a Veteran doesn’t arrive at the counter, the staff may look in the waiting area and call the number again verbally, or skip the Veteran in Qmatic *didn’t see how they do this in Qmatic, but there were Veterans that had been skipped and showed as having been waiting for over an hour. The Staff could clear these skipped numbers from the queue manually.

The staff member has three VistA windows open and a web browser with Qmatic open. Qmatic shows all the different queues (including wheel chair/non-motorized wheel chair as separate queues) and the wait times for each number in the queue. Staff can call numbers from the queue through Qmatic. 

When the Veteran arrives at the desk, the staff member asks for their Veteran ID card, which the staff member scans with a handheld barcode scanner. If the Veteran doesn’t have their ID card, then the staff request that the Veteran complete a business card with their full SSN, name and DOB, this information is entered into VistA, to find the specific Veteran accurately and precisely. Staff described that unlike a primary care clinic, they are searching the whole world of Veterans, and labels print automatically, so they need to get the one right Veteran, not a list of matches from “Smith 1234”, “s1234”. 

If there are no lab orders, then reception will call the clinic to resolve the issue. *how does reception know which clinic to call? 

Qmatic automatically identifies which ‘booth’ or lab draw service station to assign the Veteran to. If the booth is available now, the Veteran is called immediately and proceeds to the appropriate booth. If a wait is required, the process of waiting for the number to be called on the monitor is repeated. The Veteran keeps the same number throughout both queueing steps.

Staff in the back can view Qmatic to see how many people are in line.

Every hour on the hour, the printers pause for some reason (we were there an noon and both clerks working had to wait about a minute for stickers to print)


### Notes:
•	While we did talk to staff during a lower traffic part of the day, we did not have dedicated access to them without interruption, and in respect of their time, did not spend as much time on follow up questions.
•	The Qmatic system has been in place for 3 years, “I like it”.
•	Before Qmatic system was in place “it was crazy”, there was a deli counter queuing ticket system, and people would stand in a line as well, reception verbally calling ‘next’. 
•	Pre Covid the lab was very busy, standing room only.


## Travel
### Environment 
Travel Reimbursement office is on a high-traffic hallway next to the Lab reception area. There are at least 5 service windows, but only one of them is open at the far end. There is a counter in front of the open window with various forms and papers, including a packet of instructions for how to submit for reimbursement online. 

On the wall next to the entrance, there is a large poster (10ft wide, 4ft tall ish) with instructions on how to submit travel mileage online. Underneath the large poster is a drop box with stacks of the travel form.

### Sequence
Veterans can get paper travel forms from MSAs or in person at the travel office. For the paper form, Veterans complete only the highlighted parts of the form, and submit back to the MSA, the dropbox at the travel office. Not sure how forms get from MSAs to travel staff. Veterans can also complete the process online.

Half of the staff process online forms, half process paper forms. For paper forms, staff enter the information on the form into ? BTSSS ? 
Staff review the submission against the criteria for reimbursement, which sometimes is simple, and sometimes is more complicated. It gets more complicated if it’s a community care appointment or if the staff member has to look up whether the services could have been provided at a closer facility. 
Paper forms have to be kept and managed, because they contain protected information, which is a disadvantage to the paper system. Vets handwriting can also be difficult to read or they may leave off important information, which can make paper processing more difficult.

When travel used to be available on the kiosks, most Veterans would submit there, and it would automatically print to the back travel office for processing. Now, most people do the paper form, not online.

### Interactions
We observed many veterans completing their forms and submitting them into the drop box. One Veteran stood at the dropbox holding their form halfway into the slot, while looking up at the poster for at least 30 seconds, and ultimately they released their form into the drop box.

## Radiology
No in depth observation or interview component, just passive observation from waiting room.

### Environment
Long rectangular waiting area, on the 3rd floor of the building with the big atrium. Enter the waiting room on the left side (wall of windows separates the right side of the waiting room from the hallway), at the far end of the left side of the room is the MSA desk. On the right side of the back wall is a set of double doors. A kiosk is turned to face the wall on the left side of the waiting room as you approach the front desk. The waiting area on the right has ~20 chairs, and is about half full. There are ~3 tvs playing with the sound on in the waiting room. 

There is only 1 MSA at the desk, and the line is consistently 3-5 people long. Some people walk back through the double doors after checking in, and some go to the waiting room. The MSA has to get up and walk across their desk area to open the double doors for Veterans.

## Medical Admin Services - Staff Interview

Vocera is a hospital wide initiative, now that we have it we don’t know what to do with it. Took 3 years to get. 

Quick review of departments we didn’t get to: Wants us to connect with Shabu Matthew in Radiology. We can visit the ED at another time, they use paper for pre-registration, and weren’t using the kiosks pre-covid. Pharmacy used to use VetLink and did not like it. Employee health was using kiosk for walk-in appointments.

- What problem was the kiosk solving with regard to insurance?
  - They were creating a problem - Vets learned to bypass insurance on the Kiosk by saying they did not have any updates to make, even if they were marked in ICB for more specific follow up by MSAs, the kiosk wouldn’t hold accountable to ICB list. Clerks then would call Veterans on ICB list on the phone to verify their insurance information.
  - We do insurance harvesting as well, but it’s a cost to the VA.
- Why is insurance capture important to you?
  - For the funds
  - CPAP and ICB folks want us to ask for Medicare now as well
  - Exec leadership didn’t push VetLink in the way they should have
-	Who would access metrics on staff performance?
  - Leadership in MAS
  -	Enrollment and Eligibility would use VetLink metrics for performance tracking and queue management. Don’t expect there to be long lines in the future, IDs are the only thing being done in person. 
  -	Used also for utilization metrics, a bit easier than using VSSC.
-	How do you solve VetLink-VistA clinic reconciliation – eg when a new provider is added, VetLink has to be updated
  -	Some of the MAS admins are part of the ‘kiosk team’ that makes these changes.
  -	Also there is a team that will manage the transition to the new kiosk.
-	Are there any benefits to turning the Kiosks back on?
  -	Veteran convenience, we don’t plan to turn them back on. 
-	How did the addition of ScriptPro and Qmatic come about?
  -	Pharmacy and Lab have the flexibility to make their own decisions, wanted something more coverage than VetLink. Dr Brown researched and initiated, it was a local decision.
-	Cell connectivity survey of your facility?
  -	No.
  -	ATT coverage is pretty bad, Verizon is good
-	Is there a labor relations side of the MSA work? Would changing the workflow impact negotiations?
  -	For MSA duties, this would be included in the functional statements, and the union involvement is minimal these days. Might need exec level management to be involved.


Things I missed:
- Photo of the pharmacy kiosk instructions
- Photo of lab queue display board
- What happens if the pharm kiosk recognizes the patient – does it ask about the patients doctors visit? 
- How do pts cancel appts, what’s staff responsibility in managing those cancellations?
  - Who reviews vetext cancellations?
- In lab / pharm what happens when the kiosks run out of paper to print? What happens when system breaks / malfunctions?


Questions:
-	Can veterans use their drivers license as an id at the kiosk or lab?
