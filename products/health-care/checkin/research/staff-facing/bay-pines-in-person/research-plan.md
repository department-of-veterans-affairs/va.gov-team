# Check-In Research Plan for In-Person Staff Interviews at Bay Pines

Date: June 2, 2022

## Background 

The Modernized Check-In Team is reimaging the experience between a Veteran scheduling a medical appointment and having their appointment. In particular, the Modernized Check-In Team has created the portion of the ecosystem that enables Veterans to utilize their smartphone to “check in” to their appointments through VA.gov, which lets the VA know the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 

  - Confirming their appointment
  - Reviewing their contact information 
  - Reviewing their emergency contact information
  - Reviewing their next of kin information 

- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment

In speaking with the [Beneficiary Travel Reimbursement Path Analysis Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/104), we also know that travel reimbursement is being considered for integration with the check-in product. The following draft mock ups have been created to communicate the workflow:

### OCTO Objectives 

This research plan supports the following OCTO objectives: 

- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Increase completion rate of online transactions
- Increase usage of digital self-service tools
- Decrease time to successfully complete and submit online transactions 

### Veteran Journey

This research plan maps to the following moment within the Veteran journey:

## Research Goals 

Our goal for this research is to utilize our [baseline research plan for the St. Louis pilot](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/pilot-feedback/research-plan.md) to evaluate pre-check-in and check-in at additional VAMCs. In addition, the Modernized Check-In Team is building off of the [beneficiary travel research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/104) that is pointing to a potential solution that integrates travel reimbursement with check-in. Specifically, we’re looking to accomplish the following: 

- Evaluate the effectiveness of pre-check-in and check-in with MSAs
- Identify strengths, pain points and opportunities for improvement within the check-in ecosystem 
- Understand how, if at all, MSAs are using VSE-CS
- Gain insights on understanding the optimal experience for incorporating travel reimbursement into the check-in experience for Veterans 

### Research Questions

- What’s working and not working with pre-check-in and check-in? 
- What changes could help improve the check-in process?  
- How often are MSAs interacting with Veterans during the check-in process? 
- Are MSAs checking in Veterans with VSE that need help versus requiring them to use mobile check in? 
- What’s been the impact on MSA workload? 
- How often are MSAs troubleshooting errors or clearing review flags?
- How comfortable are MSAs troubleshooting errors or clearing review flags? 
- What are the issues that MSAs are helping Veterans troubleshoot?  
- What changes in MSA to clinician communication for check-in have changed?
- What changes to check-in can help improve MSA to clinician communication for check-in?  
- Are MSAs using VSE-CS? If so, how is it being used and why is it being used?  
- How do Veterans feel about pre-check-in and check-in?
- When do Veterans expect to complete a travel reimbursement claim in relation to their appointment? 
- What steps should a Veteran have to complete for filing a travel reimbursement claim? 
- What steps could be removed from the existing BTSSS process to make it easier for Veterans to file a claim?  

### Hypothesis 

1. The pre-check-in experience makes day-of check-in easier for staff since contact information, emergency contact information and next of kin information has been reviewed. 
1. MSAs will have limited interaction with Veterans during check-in since Veterans are able to check-in on their smartphone. 
1. MSAs will check Veterans in with VSE that don’t have a smartphone or have difficulty using their smartphone. 
1. MSAs will have shorter lines of Veterans waiting to be checked in. 
1. The number of applications that MSAs use to manage the check-in process will be reduced and, therefore, workload will be decreased. 
1. MSAs are comfortable with troubleshooting error messages with Veterans and know how to clear appropriate review flags in VSE. 
1. MSAs will indicate that communication between MSAs and clinicians is frictionless due to the staff applications working as intended. 
1. Travel clerks will indicate that the workflow in the travel reimbursement prototypes are optimal for Veterans and that no required steps are missing. 

## Method

This research will be conducted as in-person interviews at Bay Pines VAMC and other clinics that the Bay Pines team is able to identify. Our preference is to visit various clinics at Bay Pines VAMC and an additional two CBOCs that are scheduled during times of high appointment check-ins. 

We will ask MSAs questions from our [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/bay-pines-in-person/conversation-guide.md) to measure their perceptions on pre-check-in, check-in, etc. and document responses, comments, improvements, etc.  

We will also incorporate in-person usability testing on the travel reimbursement prototypes with staff familiar with this process. E.g., MSAs, travel clerks, etc. 

Two researchers will be conducting this research. In addition, at least one product owner (Stephen Barrs) from VA OCTO will be in attendance.
