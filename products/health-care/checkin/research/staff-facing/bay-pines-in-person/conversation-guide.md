## Intro - 1 minute 

Hello. My name is Ben and I’m a researcher on the patient check-in team. We are interested in learning about how the new pre-check-in and check-in process has been working and impacting your job. Our goal is to listen and use your feedback to continue to improve the check-in process for Veterans and staff like yourself. 

Do you mind if I observe you interacting with Veterans and ask you a few questions? This is completely voluntary. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: 

- We want to hear your honest opinions. We will not be offended by any opinions you express. We welcome your feedback. 
- If for any reason, and at any time, you want to stop this session, just let me know.

## Section 3: Beneficiary Travel with MSAs

We’d also like to get your input on travel reimbursement. 

- When is a Veteran able to start the claim process? E.g., once the appointment is scheduled, once the Veteran checks in, once the appointment is marked complete in VistA, etc. 
- Did the kiosks have a different starting point? If so, what were the reasons this changed with BTSSS?

- In the future, is there a reason that the claim process couldn’t begin during check-in? Why or why not? 

## Section 4: Patient Record Flags with MSAs

We’d also like to get your input on the use and value of patient record flags. 

- How do you currently use patient record flags, if at all? 
- Where do you see the flag and how do you respond? 
- Do you use national or local flags? 
- If patient record flags were added to VSE-CS, where or when would you expect to see them? 
- Would it be helpful to only see specific flags, such as behavioral? 
- Is there any other patient information you would want to be alerted to that’s not in VSE-CS?

## Section 5: Beneficiary Travel with Travel Clerks 

### Introduction 

We are conducting research on behalf of OCTO to help evaluate BTSSS and the beneficiary travel reimbursement process to improve both the Veteran and staff experience. A team we partner with within OCTO has created some ideas on how the Veteran experience could be updated to reach those goals.  

What we’d like to do is demo those ideas, listen and gather feedback and ask some follow up questions.  

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: 

- We want to hear your honest opinions. We will not be offended by any opinions you express. We welcome your feedback. 
- Are you comfortable if we record this session? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis. No comments are attributed to individuals. 
- Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. 

*Start recording.*
