This is a decision register to capture decisions the team feels need to be documented in a centralized place.

| The Pre-Checkin token validity will be for 24 hours and the veteran will need to re-authenticate after that period. | Patrick | 11/10/2021 | | [slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C022AC2STBM/p1636566903374900?thread_ts=1636564483.369900&cid=C022AC2STBM) |




Team Check-In "North Star" Vision- key takeaways from vision discussion on 11/17

What functionality does the Veteran need at launch?
 - To be able to check in to appointments and receive care. (We already do this.)
 - Ability to check in easily if blind/visually impaired. Alternative to poster? (Team agreed we value ensuring our product is accessible to vision-impaired folks.)
 - Reassurance that the process worked, and assurance that the staff won't ask them for the same info on appointment day.
 - Assurance that their information gets updated across the VA.

What do the MSAs need at launch?
 - An easy way to see pre-check in status.
 - An easy way to know if they need to review contact or insurance information.
 - Confidence that no Veterans will slip through the cracks.



What must be true within the product ecosystem?
 - Ability to easily troubleshoot production support issues as they come in. (Product dashboard and developer dashboard? Ensure we can view record of instance(s) that may have had issues- which facility and check-in, and ability to pull logs to find out what went wrong.)
 - Discussed ensuring clinics have sufficient wifi/phone coverage to use mobile check-in. Per Patrick, we will have a white list of clinics that can use mobile check-in. This will need some planning before go-live.
