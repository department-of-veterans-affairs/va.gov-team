This is a decision register to capture decisions the team feels need to be documented in a centralized place.

| Decision  | Owner | Date | Notes | Link |
| --------- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| Text solution for Travel: It was decided that we need a way to notify the Veteran that their travel reimbursement claim was submitted to BTSSS, however, the response time for the BTSSS to return the response for the submission is expected to be ~45 seconds; it was determined that this would be unacceptable and, because the BTSSS API team was not going to have the capacity to change the response time, we would, instead of displaying the response message to the Veteran in the web application we would send them a text with the submission claim status | Mark Dewey | 12/2022 | | |
| UPDATED priorities for the team are: Focusing onLoROTA security updates, Spanish translation, Discovery for phone appointments | Sarah Knopp | 3/9/2022 | Priority change was discussed on 3/28 in a meeting w/Stephen. Previously priorities were Priorities for the team are (1) editing capability for demographics, EC, and NOK (2) Spanish language translation for CI & PCI (3) PCI support for virtual appointments. | ---- |
| We are going to keep the Y/N questions during check-in instead of adding editing. If a Veteran has selected "no" to the question of if their demographic info is up to date, they will receive a link to VA Profile to go through the full auth and update their information there (and if they do not continue, they will have to speak to a staff member to update their info.) If they answer "no" to NOK and/or EC, they will receive messaging indicating they should speak to a staff member to update their information. CHIP will read data from VA Profile instead of VistA, and populate that data in Lorota. Vets-api will continue to read from Lorota. we need to discuss with VA.GOV Profile team on how to best transition a user to their service. The transition to full auth should be the same regardless of what app is redirecting to va . gov profile. Likely this is the standard auth modal.| Stephen | 3/28/2022 | ----- | ---- |
| The Pre-Checkin token validity will be for 24 hours and the veteran will need to re-authenticate after that period. | Patrick | 11/10/2021 | | [slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C022AC2STBM/p1636566903374900?thread_ts=1636564483.369900&cid=C022AC2STBM) |
| Appointments at multiple facilities on the same day will not be supported until post-MVP at the soonest | Stephen + Patrick | 11/16/2021 | | [slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C022AC2STBM/p1637078951426300?thread_ts=1636550509.363200&cid=C022AC2STBM) |
| Appointments at multiple facilities on the same day will not be supported until post-MVP at the soonest | Corey | 12/22/2021 | After meeting to go through Pre-Check-in staging testing, it was decided to wait until new year to release to prod due to additional deployments needed, UX review, and code freeze going into effect 12/17/2021 UPDATE: additionally, pre-checkin cannot be launched until https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/chip/issues/338 has been resolved and deployed to prod. | [slack]( https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C022AC2STBM/p1640202748439300) |
| URL Shortener will use DynamoDB as a data store instead of S3 | Shane, Stephen | 1/31/2022 | | [slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C02G6AB3ZRS/p1643649918524849?thread_ts=1643647614.222829&cid=C02G6AB3ZRS), [slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C02G6AB3ZRS/p1643649142159969?thread_ts=1643647614.222829&cid=C02G6AB3ZRS) |
| For reporting purposes, we will consider Pre-Check-In to have been started when a Veteran completes the LoROTA auth during the Pre-Check-In flow. This is where the "pre-check-in-started" status will be set in the "initiateprecheckin" lambda.|Team|2/16/2022|We made this decision because we feel completing the authentication shows intent to complete the pre-check-in.|n/a|
| vets-api: Any error when calling CHIP set-precheckin-started endpoint will be handled within vets-api, and not returned to website. It'll be logged to Sentry for investigation and resolution|Stephen, Corey, Adrian, Gaurav|2/22/2022|We discussed that allowing the veteran to continue pre check-in will lead to a better experience than showing them an error, even if this means a temporary discrepancy in staff facing app|[details](vets-api-set-precheckin-status.md)|
|Editing decisions: vets-api will integrate directly with lighthouse (not CHIP) for address verification; stephen will work to get a timeline on lighthouse profile read/write api & if lighthouse timeline is too long, vets-api will work to integrate directly with va profile api; FE will work on both full auth and edit screens, kept behind feature flag; we know that there is a risk of having different data in vista & vets-api, and that sometimes a veteran might see different data after fully auth'ing| Stephen + Engineers| 02/24/2022| Decided at engineering planning meeting| insert link to arch doc|


Team Check-In "North Star" Vision- key takeaways from vision discussion on 11/17

What functionality does the Veteran need at launch?
 - To be able to check in to appointments and receive care. (We already do this.)
 - Ability to check in easily if blind/visually impaired. Alternative to poster? (Team agreed we value ensuring our product is accessible to vision-impaired folks.)
 - Reassurance that the process worked, and assurance that the staff won't ask them for the same info on appointment day.
 - Assurance that their information gets updated across the VA.

What do the MSAs need at launch?
 - An easy way to see pre-check in status.
 - An easy way to know if they need to review contact or insurance information.
 - Confidence that no Veterans will slip through the cracks.



What must be true within the product ecosystem?
 - Ability to easily troubleshoot production support issues as they come in. (Product dashboard and developer dashboard? Ensure we can view record of instance(s) that may have had issues- which facility and check-in, and ability to pull logs to find out what went wrong.)
 - Discussed ensuring clinics have sufficient wifi/phone coverage to use mobile check-in. Per Patrick, we will have a white list of clinics that can use mobile check-in. This will need some planning before go-live.
