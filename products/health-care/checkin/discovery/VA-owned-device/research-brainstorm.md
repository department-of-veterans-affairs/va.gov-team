# VA-owned Device: Research Strategy and Outstanding Questions

## Research questions
- ~~Do a subset of Veterans find our VA-owned device solution interesting and something that they would use to check-in?~~ Note: We know this from previous work.
- What is the minimum that needs to change in the current mobile experience for this new modality?
  - Does MVP need to include VHIC card scanning?
  - Do we need to make touch target (button size) changes?
  - Do we need to make any workflow order changes?
- Does the proposed identity verfication method match Veteran expectations?
- Does Veteran's feedback have any implications to hardware choices?

## Test Details and MVP Scope Proposal
Crossed out means that it isn't part of the MVP scope proposal or how we will test the MVP.

1. Location
  - **On-site**
    - Recruit Veterans after they checked in or Veterans who are done with their appointment.
  - ~~Remote~~
2. MVP Scope Proposal
  - **Change the screen size (responsive)**
  - **Changes to identity verification**
  - **Auto logout**
  - **Remove header/footer**
  - **Provide an easy way to quit**
  - **Visual impairment - using built-in iOS capabilities and best software development practices**
  - ~~VHIC card scanning~~
  - ~~Visual design (touch targets, font sizes, etc)~~
  - ~~Editing contact information, next of kin, and emergency contact capabilities~~
3. Type of prototype
  - **Hi-fi Sketch or UX Pin prototype**
  - ~~Coded prototype~~
  - ~~Paper or low-fi prototype (allows more focus on the workflow order)~~
4. Device
  - **Tablet**
  - ~~Computer~~

## Identity verification brainstorm and ideation

## Overall VA-owned device outstanding questions
- How does the Veteran even know this piece of hardware can be used to check-in?
- How do we get a tablet to test with and connect it to the VA network? Choose a site for the test that meets connectivity requirements.
- What identity verfication method do we need to use? How does physically securing the device play into our options? - Shawn Adams to share what the Charleston VA-owned device solution included.
- Are there any changes needed to the staff-facing app (staff notifications, such as when check-in started is triggered)?
- What are the steps for getting a new device connected to the VA network, and how might that impact our ability to configure that device?
- Should we talk to staff who are part of purchasing equipment? Who would buy this? - Answer: Not part of the initial UX research study.
- What hardware solution are we recommending?
