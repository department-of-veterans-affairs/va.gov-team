## What is it?
VetLink is the Veteran-facing and VA employee-facing software that helps with the Check-in process. The kiosks located within VA lobbies and main check-in areas have the VetLink software on them. This va.gov project is being explored as the replacement for the VetLink Veteran-facing capabilities.
