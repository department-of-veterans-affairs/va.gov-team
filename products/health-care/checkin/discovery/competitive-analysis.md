# Competitive Analysis

This is a place for us to list other check-in experiences (from other government agencies or other industries) that we could learn something from. Provide links and descriptions of what you found useful/not useful for each example.

## Emory COVID Vaccination Check-in
- User received a text message to complete pre-checkin, which had a link to a website.
- On the website, the user was asked to enter their last name and DOB to autheticate.
- Once it was closer to the appointment time, then the user was sent another text message. It included text saying if there was no Wifi, then they were to just walk into the facility.

## UPMC Pre-appointment Check-in
- Sent an email asking to "Pre-register" 3 days before the appointment and again 1 day before. The "Pre-register button opened a web experience.
- Intro webpage gave information on the appointment location, date, provider name, and time. It also provided information on what you will need to complete to pre-register: Verify who you are, Review your information, and Make a payment.
- Page 2: Enter DOB
- Page 3: COVID screening
- Page 4: Reminder to wear a mask and rules on how many support people you can have with you.
- Page 5: Check if you are the patient filling this out or you are filling it out on behalf of someone.
- Page 6: Contact information (address and phone number)
- Page 7: Review and update insurance information on file
- Page 8: Signing Privacy Policy, Consent to Treat etc. Radio button to accept each policy, then text field to type in name and checkbox to show authorization.
- Page 9: Thank you for registering and next steps when you arrive for your appointment. The next steps say that you will receive your actual check-in link 20 minutes prior to arrival. Fill out the actual check-in and have a seat in the waiting room.
- I didn't see the payment screens, since it was a covered appointment.

## UPMC Day of Check-in
- Email with a check-in link, which opened a website.
- Completed the COVID screening
- I don't remember what questions were asked to verify I was who I said I was. This workflow was a lot shorter than the pre-registration. I don't know what it would have looked like if I hadn't pre-registered.

## UPMC COVID Vaccination Check-in
- Received text message confirming appointment date and time right after scheduling. 
- Received another text the morning of the appointment with time and location information. There was also a link to a QR code to upon arrival.
- Once at the location, they didn't actually use the QR code. They only asked for last name.

## Look into airline check-in examples.
