## Interview questions: 

### Background: 

- How many providers make up the Family Medicine practice at Fayetteville Veterans Affairs Medical Center?     

- Do you see patients at any other locations?

- Do all providers within the Family Medicine practice at FVAMC accept telephone appointments? 

### Current telephone appointment workflow: 

- How do patients currently schedule telephone appointments? (In person, over the phone, etc.) When does it typically take place? E.g., before or after an appointment. And, what information is collected from patients? 

- Is there any information that you’d like collected that currently isn’t? (And, how might that information be used?)  

- Are all patients (e.g., new vs. returning), appointment types (e.g., screening, follow up, etc.) and reasons for their visit all able to schedule a telephone appointment (vs. in-person)? What are some of those patient eligibility requirements to schedule a telephone appointment? 

- Are appointment reminders or any pre-registration sent to patients before a scheduled telephone appointment? If so, what information is typically in those communications and how are they delivered to patients? E.g., VeText, phone calls, emails, etc. 

- What typically happens immediately before a scheduled telephone appointment? For example, does the provider call the patient directly at the time of the appointment? Are there multiple phone numbers to try if the patient doesn’t pick up? 

- Besides the provider, are any other administrative or clinical staff involved during a scheduled telephone appointment? 

### Current telephone appointment feedback: 

- Are there any common logistical problems the day of a scheduled phone appointment? E.g., wrong phone number, patient didn’t answer, patient is late, etc. 

- What steps, solutions or ideas, if any, do you think could help improve or fix those types of problems? 

### Future state: 

- Any thoughts (e.g., advantages or disadvantages) about a scenario where scheduled telephone appointments are connected with a patient mobile pre-registration or mobile day-of, check-in solution (that confirms patient contact information or notifies the provider the patient is ready for their appointment)? 

- Has there been any existing plans discussed at your practice or other ideas you haven’t yet shared to help improve or streamline the patient experience for scheduling a telephone appointment? Specifically, the time between when a patient schedules an appointment to when their appointment begins?  

- Lastly, are there any other providers, clinical or administrative staff that you feel would be valuable for us to speak with about understanding the current process or pain points of scheduling or beginning a telephone appointment (to help improve the Veteran or staff experience)? 

### If time permits: 

- Have you heard any feedback, positive or negative, from Veterans, providers or administrative staff about telephone appointments?

- When scheduling a telephone appointment, is any information captured from a patient that’s different from an in-person visit?
