## Topic
What other appointment modalities should we support in Pre-Check-in and/or eCheck-in?

## Attendees
- Shawn Adams
- Ben Brasso
- Lori Pusey

## Notes
- Definitions related to video appointments
    - VA Video Service (VVS) is the VVC database
    - Virtual Care Manager (VCM) is the staff-facing application
    - Virtual Medical Room (VMR)

- Business needs with respect to VVC (VA Video Connect, or [VA Video Connect at home](https://www.figma.com/file/JpGM8LGBCqAlL8qh3DmFk8/Home-Page-Redesign?type=design&node-id=2173-58228&t=9nDPRHFRlKWXlhlq-0)) appointments
    - No ability to know if a patient has confirmed their VVC appt (i.e. indicates they're intending on showing up). 
    - Minimal to zero demographics or insurance review.
    - Action required issues; don't know if the provider saw the patient

- Potential value of PCI for VVC appointments
     - Might be beneficial to do Pre-Check-in, but we would need to coordinate with the telehealth department (Office of Connected Care)
     - If Veteran indicated that demographics or insurance needs review, then MSAs could join the care encounter or call them before the appointment 
     - Office of Connected Care would want to ensure that their recent Cerner integration plan will not be effected
     - There are a lot of notifications that the VVC software sends out, which are delivered differently from the VEText set up 
          - When it is scheduled in VCM
          - 7, 3, 1 day before

- Potential value of eCheck-in for phone appointments
     - May be able to have support for telehphone in eCheck-in after we do the 45-minute reminder
          - Don't kick out if demographics is wrong
          - List all of the business logic to see what is applicable & what is not
     - VCE-CS could be used to let providers know that the patient is ready 
     
## Potential Next Steps
- Create user flow for eCheck-in for phone appointments
