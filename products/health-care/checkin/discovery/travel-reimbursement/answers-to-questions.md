| Yes              | 8/09/2022  | **[BTSSS_INGEST_API]** Are we able to check the BTS3 account database programmatically to determine if a Veteran has a BTS3 account set up? If so, how do we go about doing that? **[ASKED_IN_ANOTHER_WAY]** Word on the street is that there is an endpoint that we can use to check a Veteran's eligibility status (Do they have an account set up, Is direct deposit setup, etc.) Does that exist?

| Yes              | 8/09/2022  | **[BTSSS_INGEST_API]** Does BTS3 have the functionality in place to hold a claim for ~36 hours before it’s processed?

| Yes              | 8/09/2022  | **[WORKFLOW]** Do Veterans receive a confirmation email when they create/submit a new claim for review in BTS3? Or, are there any other notifications such as a text message? If not, at what point do they first hear back about the status of their claim? And, is the notification an email, text, letter, etc.? Within the Patient Check In app, to the extent possible, we'd like to be able to set expectations on when or how Veterans will be notified once they submit a new claim. <br><br> F/U Q: To confirm, there are no notifications within BTSSS? Those all appear in the Veteran portal? But, a change in status to the claim will be available in BTSSS as well, correct? Is it also safe to assume status changes from a paper form claim can also be found in the Veteran portal? | BTSSS uses the Veteran portal for all notifications to the Veterans as far as claim status.  Once the Veteran submits their claim on the portal side the claim is pushed thorough the internal rules engine, from there it will either be submitted for payment or in manual review.  If the claim is submitted for payment when the Financial Service Center pays this claim it will change to claim paid.  If the claim goes into manual review it is the BT Clerks responsibility to adjudicate the claim and from there the status will change to on hold, denied, partial payment or approved for payment.  Again all of this can be seen on the Veteran portal.<br><br> F/U Response: There are no notifications in BTSSS. You can just check the status of a claim. Same with the Veterans Portal, and to be clear the Veteran’s portal is the Veteran facing side of the application, what they see. Employees see BTSSS. If a paper claim form is submitted, through manual entry in BTSSS it becomes a claim just like any other claim with the document uploaded by an employee on the claim to provide proof the Veteran applied. And just like any claim you can see the status of it in the Veterans Portal, but you wouldn’t be able to see that claim the Veteran filed for via paper (VA Form 10-3542) until a claim is created for them in BTSSS. | Justin Kramer                         |
| Yes              | 8/09/2022  | **[WORKFLOW]** Do Veterans receive a one-way reimbursement for showing up for a cancelled appointment? For example, this was something we heard from the Corpus Christi travel office and we’re trying to determine its impact on reimbursing travel from within Patient Check In.                   there is an exception that can be documented that it was not the fault of the Veteran or the appointment was cancelled after arrival, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Out of scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Justin Kramer                         |
| No               | 8/09/2022  | **[CONTENT]** It was mentioned that we should reference some existing messaging to better ask the question around whether the Veteran drove their own vehicle. Something along the lines of, “Did you incur an expense while traveling in your own vehicle?” What was the specific messaging in reference? Or is there a paper form or resource we can use to see it used?  This response from me in the meeting was because the current messaging only asks if they drove their vehicle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Veterans can be reimbursed if they incurred an expense and are eligible. Therefore the messaging should be more broad in case they took a bus, non-for-profit that charges, taxi, etc. The point is them driving themselves is only one way they might be eligible to file a claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Justin Kramer                         |
