## MVP Requirements 

- As a Veteran, During the check in flow, a Veteran can submit a claim for travel that is `round trip`, `mileage only` travel from their `home address` to the BTSSS system. 
- As a Veteran, I should be shown my Claim Number during check in so that I can track the claim in the BTSSS system. 
- As a Veteran, I should see this current claims list in the existing Travel Pay system. 
- As the Product team, we should able to track a claim through the whole system from end to end and determine `average time to paid`

## Current assumptions

- We are displaying the question for all users. 
- During the check in process, We have access to the Veterans ICN, the veterans home address and the facility address. 
- No staff facing enhancements are happening for MVP 
- Little flexibility in the BTSSS API, assumed  none until something is needed. 
- If a claim is submitted before an appoinment is checked out, the claim will go into manual review 

## Future Iterations Initiatives

- Asycnronous Claim Submission
- Veteran notifiction
- Performance Tweaks 
- Filter Eligilbity 
- Better feedback for veterans (textin/portal)
- Add more expenses to the claim
