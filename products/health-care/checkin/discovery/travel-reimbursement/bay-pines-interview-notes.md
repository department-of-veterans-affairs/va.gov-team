## Who we spoke with 

- We interviewed 2 travel assistants and 1 travel supervisor for Bay Pines Healthcare System. Travel office located in Lee County VA Clinic, Care Coral, FL.  

## Assumptions

- Unless otherwise stated, these findings are specific to VA Bay Pines Healthcare System. There may be differences in other VA locations. 

## The current travel reimbursement process for Veterans is complex due to nuances in how BTSSS works, eligibility criteria (e.g., community care vs. VA clinic appointments), claim review process, etc.   

- Most claims are manually reviewed by travel assistants. 
- Community care appointments are eligible for reimbursement. However, they require an extra step compared to VA appointments. I.e., a doctor’s note that contains no protected health information (PHI). If there’s no note provided in the claim, travel assistants send them a letter explaining why their claim was denied. This process is a cause for confusion and frustration among Veterans and staff. 
- Sometimes the clinic doesn’t check the patient out. When this happens, the travel assistants on site tell the Veteran to go back to the clinic to get checked out, which is a cause of frustration.
- Lab appointments, EKGs, X Rays, etc. (i.e., walk-ins) don’t get checked out. Travel assistants can override in BTSSS. 
- There’s a national database that travel assistants use to determine driving routes and mileage. 
- Mileage disputes will occur when Veterans file a claim for visiting a VA location that is farther away from a closer location that offers the same service or treatment.
- 9/10 claims submitted are incomplete. E.g., information was missing, information was not entered in the correct format, etc. This means that travel assistants have to spend time with each claim to correct it before it’s approved. 
- If a Veteran was to file a claim during check-in, wait for their appointment and leave because the wait is too long, that would be problematic from a reimbursement perspective. Therefore, it’s important to ensure the Veteran has completed their appointment before a claim can be submitted.  
- Walk-in appointments are eligible for one-way reimbursement. Often in BTSSS, these appointments come in as round trip that need to be changed. 
- Travel reimbursement is paid by the visit, not the appointment.
 
## Travel assistants recommend avoiding the inclusion of options in the travel reimbursement experience for Veterans that likely lead to a denial of reimbursement, such as “Other” fields, VTS and carpool. 

>*“Don’t show options that aren’t eligible for reimbursement, such as VTS or carpool.”* 

>*“Don’t include “Other” options. It’s just another opportunity that could lead to a denied claim.”*
