Generative research / interview - standalone travel app for VistA sites
===========================================================================================

Discussion with Kristen McConnell and Check-in UX team members to understand more about the background behind the standalone app for VistA and any implications for Check-in. 

## Background:

- **_Could you tell me a little about how we got to this point? / What was the catalyst for the standalone travel app discussion for VistA sites specifically? / How did that discussion go?_**

  - **Response:** Statistically, current experience accounts for 18% of all claims. So, how can we increase the digital footprint, but to also decrease the paper claims submitted. So, increasing the digital reach to Veterans that don't typically use digital tools. So, reaching different audiences at different time frames, e.g., after a visit, claims with receipts, etc. Not necessarily anything wrong with PCI. So, moving in the direction of filing for past appointments. Like, text "travel" whenever and file a claim for any appt in the last 30 days. 

- **_Has there been feedback or data from sites that point in that direction?_**

  - **Response:** Less to do with PCI usage. More about increasing digital modernization of BT. 

  - **Response:** (Is this in response to OH launching at Lovell?) It's always been in the vision to expand to different channels and expand to different user groups. E.g., can we reach others that are less digital inclined, etc. And, expanding different types of claims, different places like the mobile app, etc. 

  - **Response:** eCheck-in is still a fraction of total check ins, but that's still a different challenge. However, adding travel was an idea to help increase utilization. No intention to shut down or pull out travel from eCheck-in. Idea: Pre-check-in travel pay, but hold it in a queue and somehow confirm during check in. Kristen said that might be too far of a step back. Too many implications on the BTSSS API and claim review side.  

## Goals:

- _**What are the goals/intended outcomes from this particular solution of a standalone travel app?** (Ex: Reaching Veterans who can't access check-in? To help with internet/cell access by not requiring it to be at an appointment? Knowing that Veterans use "check in" X amount, do we think they'd use "travel" X amount more? As a catalyst to move travel separate entirely? Or expand in other ways/include travel elsewhere?)_

  - **Response:** Getting travel claims to more people.
  
  - **Response:** How do we direct Veterans better to use this since it's a past appt experience? 

  - **Response:** (Should we further differentiate it from "check in?") Might have to make changes to the check in experience, but would be good to understand if Veterans see check in and filing for travel in the same world.  

- _**What are the expected KPIs?** (Ex: 25% increase in claims filed? Ex: Identify time saved for Veterans for filing in this modality vs filing in BTS3: Reducing avg time to file a claim from 8 min in BTS3 to 2 min in the standalone app? Reducing wait times (standing in line) at the travel offices?)_

  - **Response:** (From Lisa K, VES product line manager for travel pay.) Increase auto-adjudicated claims for VA appointments (not CC) to X % (85%??? TBD). Is filing for a past appt a safeguard or factor for supporting that goal? Yes. So, more digital claims filed = increase % of auto-adjudicated claims = improve overall claim review time, e.g., time it takes travel assistants to review manual claims. (We should find out what the % is right now for comparison sake.)

  - **Shared info: UAE FY24 OKRs**
    - Increase number of Veterans who can successfully request, schedule, pre-check-in, check-in, view an AVS, and submit a travel pay claim for an appointment.
    - Increase Veteran satisfaction rates of VA online scheduling experience.​
    - Improve access to accurate appointment data​
    - Reduce time from submission to reimbursement for travel pay claims​
    - VA.gov handles all fatal performance errors from the backend gracefully

## Implications for Check-in / Check-in plans:

- **_What do you see as the implications (good or bad) for Check-in with the creation of a standalone travel app for VistA sites? (Ex: fewer people using check-in?)_**
  - **Response:** Potentially attractive different Veterans at a different time point. But, it is a research question to understand if Veterans might not use eCheck-in, for example, as a result of it.

- **_What are the top priorities between eCheck-in and standalone travel? Is this shifting?_**
  - **Response:** Really thinking more of all of this as unified appts experience, everything the time a Veteran decides to check until filing for travel and reviewing their AVS. So, expanding the scope of what "check in" team is a part of now. And, we'll balance priorities across that spectrum and teams.

- _**Are there any upcoming plans for Check-in that work into this / are related?** (Ex: Intent to change the check-in approach? Pulling Travel out of Check-in? Intent to not focus on Check-in as much?)_
  - **Response:** "No" to pulling out travel from eCheck-in. Still want to do the Unified Check In work. 

## Additional questions:

- _**How does the 45-min message reminder come into play with a standalone travel app? Will we use a similar messaging approach?**_
  - **Response:** Yeah, could be, but need to think where in the timeline of the appt that that should happen for this experience, and we can make proposals and talk with VeText about getting it on the roadmap.

- _**When do you foresee Veterans being able to file for an appointment in the last 30 days?**_
  - **Response:** LoROTA past appt workflow.

- _**As we grow the list of things Veterans can now text to initiate (texting check in and travel), where do you see that going? / What are your thoughts on how that will shape up?** (Example: being able to cancel appointments via text)_
  - **Response:** Not sure we know the answer. Have identified these texting workflows as helpful to Veterans. Have been leaning towards yes, let's do these since they work.

- _**What do you see as the benefits and challenges of having more texting options?**_
  - **Response:** Phase 1 is posters, but a phase 2 would be the learned behavior (and marketing of) texting "appt" or "travel" to ######. Would be good to ask Veterans about how they learn about these features or how they would prefer to learn about features supported in texting. (Could pair up with VeText researcher - will get their name in a moment.)
