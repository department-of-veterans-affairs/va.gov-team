## Who we spoke with 

- We interviewed 2 travel assistants and 1 travel supervisor for VA Texas Valley Health Care. Travel office located in Harlingen VA Clinic in Harlingen, TX. 

## Assumptions

- Unless otherwise stated, these findings are specific to VA Texas Valley Health Care. There may be differences in other VA locations. 

## Key findings 

- Most claims that are manually reviewed (~90% of total claims) are for community care appointments and/or claims not submitted through BTSSS. I.e., BTSSS tends to have claims that are automatically approved.  
- PO Boxes in the address field cause problems. In addition, not separating out the address to two address fields causes problems. Rather, the claim won’t get automatically approved. If this happens, travel assistants will use Bing Maps to look up the address and fix it. 
- Approximately 10-15% of travel claims are denied. Most are denied because they don’t have the proper proof that service took place. E.g., a visit summary for community care appointments. Unfortunately, BTSSS does not prevent a Veteran from filing a community care claim without proof of service. Other reasons include: names of facilities or dates of service were missing, eligibility criteria was not met or they filed for a Compensation & Pension Benefits appointment, which travel pay does not cover. When a claim is denied, Veterans will receive a letter that explains why the claim was denied. The letter may also include a VA Form 10-10EZR that Veterans need to fill out and return to potentially become eligible for reimbursement. E.g., the Veteran needs to update their annual income. However, when a claim is submitted through BTSSS, Veterans can get notifications of claim activities in realtime. We did not learn what type of notifications they receive. E.g., email notifications, text notifications, etc.       
- If a Veteran attempts to use the kiosk and their appointment isn’t complete, then they will have to file a paper claim at the travel office. Chances are, when the travel assistant submits the claim into BTSSS, the clinic will have checked the Veteran out. In Dallas and Houston, the travel office pays Veterans in cash for when a claim is submitted in person. Most other facilities do not have a cashier to do so. Therefore, in PCI, it might be worth including information at the start and/or end of the experience to remind them how payments are made.    
- 75-85% of claims are for driving their own vehicle. Of that, 25-30% have additional expenses to file. However, Veterans have to receive pre-authorization for additional expenses. Approval is based on the VA understanding the reason, type of treatment, time of the appointment and how it impacts travel, etc.  
- While it doesn’t happen very often, Veterans can submit a supplemental claim if they forgot to include their pre-authorized expenses. While it’s unclear how this is handled in BTSSS, a Veteran could provide a receipt to the travel office in person, by fax or email, at which point the travel office will create a supplemental claim for the same appointment. Travel assistants annotate as much as possible on the claims to be able to communicate details back to the Veteran or other travel assistants at a later date.
- BTSSS will flag claims that have the same appointment date. Travel assistants will review them and determine their travel pay.
 
## Other findings 

- Approximately 10% of travel reimbursement claims are automatically approved. A claim can be automatically approved when all the information is entered correctly. However, we’re still unclear of all the nuances, which may be different depending on a variety of factors. E.g., how it was submitted, if it was a VA or community care appointment, if proper receipts were attached, etc. 
- On rare occasions, travel assistants have to update the Veteran’s address in their claim to their local address versus their home address, which may be out of state. However, we didn’t find out how the travel assistant knows to check if it’s their local address.  
- Walk-in appointments (e.g., labs, bloodwork, etc.) are reimbursed for one-way. If the appointment type is not clear to the travel assistant, they will log in to CPRS and VistA to confirm.  
- In South Texas, a lot of Veterans receive care from community providers. Therefore, if submitted correctly, and their direct deposit is set up (i.e., vendorized), their claim might take 3-5 weeks to get processed, which includes processing in VistA with the travel assistants, plus fiscal review and release of payment. There’s a variety of factors that determine how quickly a claim is processed. If submitted correctly in BTSSS, a claim could be processed in 3-5 days. The national standard is 45 days. 
- Some Veterans are unaware of the travel reimbursement eligibility criteria. 
- Community care appointments can get automatically approved.

## What we’re still looking to validate 

- Is it okay with the travel office that all claims from PCI will be placed in manual review, since the Veteran’s appointment won’t be marked complete in CPRS and VistA? 
- Does the PCI product team have enough information to know if we should show the travel pay question each time a Veteran uses mobile check-in on the same day? 
- How do Veterans receive pre-authorization for expenses?
