# VetLink Open Office Hours
**April 27, 2021**

- Shawn Adams announced the phasing out of Vetlink and the new product to all the current people using Vetlink.
  - Let everyone know that it will be available on the VA digital front door as a mobile solution.
  - Announced dates for releases: MVP by Dec. 1, 2021 and deployment by March 2022.
  - Said that more information about the new product will be shared at a future date to this group.
  - There was a question about having the solution utilize VetLink. (They seemed interested in that.)
  
  
- One person wanted the ability for the Beneficiary Travel to be sent to their S:Drive. 
  - It isn't possible, since the system isn't doing any further development.
- Beneficiary Travel only stay for 45 days, then the ability to recall the form is no more.
  - They are hearing that there is an uptick of how long Beneficiary Travel takes to complete right now due to COVID.
  - People asked to extend to 90 days before, but that isn't possible.
  - Sometimes the breakdown has been the printer. The form doesn't print out in the travel office.
  - This is a pain point for Veteran as that they wait months to get their travel reimbursement, then call. Then, they hear that there is no record of their form.
