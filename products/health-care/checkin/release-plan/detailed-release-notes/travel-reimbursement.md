### When a Veteran chooses to use eCheck-in to check-in for an in-person appointment and after they confirm their personal, emergency, and next-of-kin contact information, they will now be asked if they would like to file a Travel Reimbursement claim

### If the Veteran chooses to file a claim, they will be asked three questions

#### Question 1: Did you travel in your own vehicle?

### If the Veteran used their own vehicle from their home address and has no receipts to file, after they check-in for their appointment they will be notified that a Travel Reimbursement claim has been forwarded to the Travel Office

### If the Veteran has not used their own vehicle or did not travel from their on-file home address or has receipts, after they check-in for their appointment they will be notified that they will need to submit a Travel Reimbursement claim using the BTSSS system or a paper form

### If the Veteran chooses to not file a claim, they will continue to check-in with their appointment and no claim is filed
