# SPANISH TRANSLATIONS FOR CHECK-IN AND PRE-CHECK-IN

## PURPOSE

- To allow Veterans who's native language is Spanish to view the Pre-Check-in and Check-in content in Spanish

## DESCRIPTION

- Veterans will be able to indicate if they prefer to see the page content in English or Spanish; the default language will follow the Veteran's configured browser language, if any, or English where there is no default specified
