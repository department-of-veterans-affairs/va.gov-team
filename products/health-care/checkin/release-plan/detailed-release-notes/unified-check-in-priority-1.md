## Description

The Unified Check-in initiative comprises a number of enhancements (aka priorities) to the online check-in applications. The goal for these enhancements is to reduce the confusion among Veterans and staff with regards to the differences between and purposes for the pre-Check-in and check-in workflows. All enhancements may not necessarily be needed to achieve the desired outcome, which is to reduce confusion and increase the use of online check-in. The team will monitor feedback after each enhancement's release and work with our VA Product Owner to determine when our objectives have been achieved.

This enhancement/priority includes a new landing page that follows the same task-based design pattern in both Online Check-in and Pre-Check-in. Veterans will have a better understanding of the tasks they need to complete before a health appointment and the differences between the two applications will become less important.

## Wireframes

These release notes highlight the significant changes to Pre-Check-in and Online Check-in as part of this enhancement. However, there are some minor changes that are also included, such as accordion open/closed defaults, differences between phone and in-person appointments, and differences between single and grouped appointments.
