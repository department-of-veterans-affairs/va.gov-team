## Description

Proactively send Veterans, 45-minutes before their health care appointment time, a text message that contains their customized check-in link. Veterans will now be able to complete online check-in without having to text "check in" to 53079 to receive the check-in link.

- NOTES:
    - Veterans who use the link from their 45-minute text will be marked as having started online check-in when they verify their identity (Veterans who text "check in" to 53079 will be marked when they send the text)
    - Veterans who do NOT have text notifications enabled will NOT receive the new text message
    - Veterans who have a health appointment at a facility where online check-in is NOT enabled will NOT receive the next text message
    - Veterans who have already checked in for their health appointment with staff will NOT receive the new text message 

## Changes to Pre-Check-in

- When Veterans complete the pre-check-in workflow, they will see a message on the confirmation page that tells them that they will be receiving a text 45-minutes before their health appointment that will provide them with their check-in link.
