# Remove QR Code from Check-in Poster

## Purpose 

Remove QR code as an option for initiating eCheck-in from check-in poster due to issues reported from the field from Veterans. For example, scanning QR code results in taking Veterans to incorrect destination.

## Release

**How will we measure success?**

- Was there a noticeable increase in Veterans using the check-in poster? (Staff observation) 
- Was there a realized increase in Veterans using the check-in poster? (PCI Power BI Dashboard)
- Or, was there an increase in complaints from Veterans to staff about the check-in poster? (Staff observation)

**What does success look like?**

We expect a very small increase in check-in utilization for participating clinics and facilities. And, we expect a decrease in complaints from Veterans to staff about issues with the QR code.

**How will we know if we're ready to increase participating sites?**

- To start, add new poster to 1-2 buildings at eligible clinics at participating pilot facilities.
- If check-in utilization has not decreased and complaints to staff about the QR code have not increased after 2 weeks, then add new poster to remaining buildings/clinics at participating pilot facilities.
- If after 4 weeks, check-in utilization has not decreased and complaints to staff about the QR code have not increased, then the poster is ready for wider distribution to other facilities and VISNs.

**How will we collect feedback?**

Monthly meeting with participating pilot facility leadership to hear feedback from the field.
