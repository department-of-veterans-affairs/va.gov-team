### The SSN and date of birth will be hashed in the LoROTA data store

### Data in LoROTA will be populated only when the Veteran needs it to confirm their contact, emergency contact, and next-of-kin information; Data will be removed from the data store when no longer needed

### LoROTA authentication attempts will be limited to 3 tries and LoROTA data will be deleted when all attempts fail
