# LoROTA SECURITY UPDATES

## PURPOSE

- To offer a more secure environment in which to allow Veterans to use the low-risk one-time authorization (LoROTA) for completing the pre-check-in and check-in workflows.

## DESCRIPTION

- Veterans will no longer sign in using the last 4 digits of their Social Security Number; they will instead sign in using their date of birth
