# MOVE ACTION LINK ON PRE-CHECK-IN INTRO PAGE

## PURPOSE

- Due to high bounce rates on the Pre-Check-in landing/intro page, we will be moving the action link to the top of the page. This link is where Veterans initiate the verification of their demographics, emergency contact, and next of kin information to complete Pre-Check-in for a health appointment.

- [Wireframes](https://app.abstract.com/projects/d9d1d6b4-192b-4ee6-95ab-e7cf42a1ac03/branches/dd0abdeb-4889-4b3d-9845-c6571ab7684a/collections/e3ec9ae8-794d-4cfb-8a05-42a7cd7b2ba8)

## RELEASE STRATEGY
This change will be released to a small percentage of users and increased over time. Metrics will be monitored to see if the change has an affect on bounce rates.
