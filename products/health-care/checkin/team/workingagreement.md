<h1>Team Working Agreement- Chick'n Eggsperience Team</h1>

<h3>Communication</h3>

We can communicate with each other asynchronously on Slack and respect each other’s time zones. We will respond to messages within 4 working hours.

We will “default to open” whenever possible and share our knowledge with other teams in open forums such as the DSVA Slack.

<h3>Meetings & Scrum Ceremonies</h3>

We agree to respect each other’s time, value each other’s perspectives and investments, and therefore we agree to be fully present in meetings.

To respect each other’s time zones, we will conduct synchronous work (including meetings) between 11:30-4 Eastern, M-Th.

We will attempt to honor “No meeting Fridays” by having no scrum ceremonies on Fridays.

Each meeting or synchronous work session should have a purpose, topic, and/or outcome indicated on the calendar invitation so that participants can understand what the meeting is about.

We would like to have as much advance notice as possible for meetings, ideally at least 24 hours.

Key decisions made during the sprint should be reviewed during the Sprint Review.

We will try to open meetings to the whole team where possible/practical. When creating a meeting, invite key team members and put the meeting on the team calendar so that interested parties can attend.

<s>When determining who to invite to a meeting, we establish volunteer “owners” of each practice area and invite the rest of the team as optional.</s>

We conduct structured team demos at the end of the sprint, including a brief agenda and review of the sprint goals. We will post our demo recording and materials for others to access.

<h3>Software</h3>

As soon as a team member commits code, it becomes our code.

If you worked on the work item/ticket, you are considered the "owner" of this item and are responsible for getting it validated.

We will prioritize collaborative work whenever possible and believe that this process leads to superior results and helps prevent knowledge siloing.

For front end code reviews, the reviewer should pull down the pull request and run the code locally.

<h3>General</h3>

We use “we” for success and “I” for accountability.

We celebrate our successes.

We collectively do the thing!
