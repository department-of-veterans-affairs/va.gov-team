<h1>Team Working Agreement- Chick'n Eggsperience Team</h1>

## General

- <b>We use ‚Äúwe‚Äù for success and ‚ÄúI‚Äù for accountability.</b>
- <b>We celebrate our successes.</b>
- <b>We collectively do the thing!</b> 

## Communication
- We can communicate with each other asynchronously on Slack and respect each other‚Äôs time zones. We will respond to messages within 4 working hours.
- We will ‚Äúdefault to open‚Äù whenever possible and share our knowledge with other teams in open forums such as the DSVA Slack.

## Meetings & Scrum Ceremonies
- We agree to respect each other‚Äôs time, value each other‚Äôs perspectives and investments, and therefore we agree to be fully present in meetings.
- To respect each other‚Äôs time zones, we will conduct synchronous work (including meetings) between 11:30-4 Eastern, M-Th.
- We will attempt to honor ‚ÄúNo meeting Fridays‚Äù by having no scrum ceremonies on Fridays.
- Each meeting or synchronous work session should have a purpose, topic, and/or outcome indicated on the calendar invitation so that participants can understand what the meeting is about.
- We would like to have as much advance notice as possible for meetings, ideally at least 24 hours.
- Key decisions made during the sprint should be reviewed during the Sprint Review.
- We will try to open meetings to the whole team where possible/practical. When creating a meeting, invite key team members and put the meeting on the team calendar so that interested parties can attend.
- <s>When determining who to invite to a meeting, we establish volunteer ‚Äúowners‚Äù of each practice area and invite the rest of the team as optional.</s>
- We conduct structured team demos at the end of the sprint, including a brief agenda and review of the sprint goals. We will post our demo recording and materials for others to access.

## Importance of Keeping User Stories Updated
We understand that maintaining up-to-date user stories with status and comments is crucial. It provides better transparency and visibility to the team, and also ensures continuity in the face of unforeseen circumstances (e.g. unexpected life events), so that the next person can seamlessly pick up where the previous owner left off.

## Sprint Closure
Sprint closure occurs every other Tuesday at the close of business (COB), designating Tuesday as the cut-off day. We agree to close our stories by this time. For stories in progress rolling over to the next sprint, we agree to:
- ‚úÖ Update the story with current status
- ‚úÖ Clearly mark completed Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
- ‚úÖ Add comments specifying outstanding work and the remaining points

<b>Early Closure:</b>
If the remaining work on a story is minimal and the story can be demoed the next day, the owner may move the story to <b>'closed'</b>.

## Software
<b>As soon as a team member commits code, it becomes our code.</b>

- If you worked on the work item/ticket, you are considered the "owner" of this item and are responsible for getting it validated
- We will prioritize collaborative work whenever possible and believe that this process leads to superior results and helps prevent knowledge siloing
- For front end code reviews, the reviewer should pull down the pull request and run the code locally

## Out of Office
- <b>Early notification (when possible):</b> We agree to provide advance notice to the team regarding our out-of-office plans, including dates and the expected duration of our absence. However, we understand that in necessary or personal situations, we may not have enough time to give advance notice to the rest of the team.
- <b>Story updates:</b> Before our absence, we agree to update status of our respective stories, and add detailed comments
- <b>Story handover:</b> For stories in progress, we agree to designate a backup and ensure that he/she understands the story details, tasks and current progress in order to complete the story. 
- <b>CIE Calendar updates:</b> We agree to add the <b>'event'</b> to the CIE Calendar (‚ö† üü† don't set 'out of office' as it will auto-decline other events): 
  - Subject: Joe - ooo - 5/15-5/25 (or for example 9am-12pm) 
  - Set dates
  - Set All day event
  - Switch from ‚ÄúBusy‚Äù to ‚ÄúFree‚Äù (so that other invitations don‚Äôt get declined)
- <b>Personal Calendar updates:</b> the same as above, and 
  - Automatically decline meetings: New and existing meetings
- <b>VA out of office email notification</b> (for ooo that is 5 days long or greater). Example:
  - Hello,
