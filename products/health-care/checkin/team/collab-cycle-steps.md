## GUIDELINES FOR FOLLOWING THIS PROCESS
- We should follow this process for new features that are substantial in nature
- We may choose to follow this process but may not necessarily need to complete every step; in this case, we will explain in the ticket when we do not need a step 
- We may choose to bypass these steps for smaller efforts but still reach out to and collaborate with these individual teams to get their feedback
    - Design team
    - Sitewide team (i.e. content)
    - Analytics
    - Research
- If requested artifacts are not available or relevant, we will explain that in the ticket
