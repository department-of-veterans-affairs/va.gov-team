# UX onboarding 

## Platform Orientation 

- Individuals on a new VFS team or an existing VFS team will need to complete the [New VFS Team Member Platform Orientation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/guidance-for-new-teams-and-team-members#Guidancefornewteamsandteammembers-NewVFSteammembers). The contractor PO or DM will take the first steps.

### While waiting to go through New VFS Team Member Platform Onboarding

- Review documentation within [Platform Orientation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/platform-orientation)
- Review the [VA Design System website](https://design.va.gov/)

**Might require additional access**

- Review [PCI service blueprint](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1696788763395/d3aa60a7420ece422a6f6b84659c33350279b782)
- Review latest [PCI Product Guides](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/product/product-guides#product-guides) (used by VA Contact Center)

## Tasks to complete in the first 30 days 

- Get added to relevant meetings
- Join relevant Slack channels
- Review [UX issue pointing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/team/Pointing.md#story-point-baseline)
- Once you have access to GitHub and Figma, set up a meeting with the CIE designers to get a walk through of Figma file structure.
- To get comfortable with the Figma file structure, create a Feature Page with 1 frame in 1 of the Figma files, have it reviewed by the CIE designers, and finish the process of moving it into the Production file. When finished with this process, delete the work.
- Get familiar with updating the [CIE Sprint Goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/sprints/sprint-goals.md). For example, add the check icon to a task to show that it's been completed and commit the change. Then, edit the page again, remove the check icon from the task, and commit the change.

## Using staging to validate or review the Veteran experience

_Complete within first 60 days. Set up time with a front-end engineer to walk you through setting up an appointment on staging and accessing the application in staging._


- Get on the VA Network
- Access the [appointment scheduling tool](https://vigilant-couscous-ab7fb4a4.pages.github.io/?baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fstaging.va.gov)
- Set up an appointment using one of the [Staging Users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/engineering/qa/test-data-setup.md#assigned-dfns)
- Copy the check-in or pre-check-in link so you have it available locally
- Paste the check-in or pre-check-in link into your local web browser
- Emulate a mobile screen in your web browser
- Use the last name and DoB for that [Staging Users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/engineering/qa/test-data-setup.md#assigned-dfns) to authenticate
- Complete check-in or pre-check-in

## Using local env to validate or review the Veteran experience

_Complete within first 90 days. Set up time with a front-end engineer to walk you through setting up vets website and the applications locally. Running the applications locally can be quicker than running it through staging, and depending on how engineers have used specific feature toggles or not, there might be scenarios where work can only be validated locally before it reaches production. But, engineers will provide this guidance._

- Download Visual Code Studio or another code editor
- Download GitHub Desktop
- Get Node, Yarn, and vets-website loaded on your machine
- Once Node, Yarn, and vets-website are loaded on your machine, [run the application locally](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/tree/main/src/applications/check-in#quick-start-to-get-running-locally). E.g., no need to be on the VA network.
