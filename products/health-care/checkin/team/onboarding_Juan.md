**Questions**
- Who is Juan's mentor on the mobile side? Tim
- Will Juan join agile ceremonies of the mobile team? yes in first few weeks of onboarding, so that he is in sync with the mobile team, and mentor. Juan will be attending UAE ceremonies selectively
- Discuss collaboration with the UAE team: intent, tickets, tracking the work
- - How does the mobile team handle UAE product backlog? Do they create tickets themselves, or work with tickets that are on the UAE board? Development tickets will be on the UAE product backlog side
- - What git labels does the mobile team use? "mobile"
- what is the intake process?
- - Intake process will be used in case there are API (Web) changes, so that mobile api needs to get updated
- - No intake process for minor updates (for example: content)
- what elase does the mobile team need from the UAE team during the whole development cycle:
- - need to collaborate around PRs
- - Note: tickets need to be verified/validated by the mobile QA Team (function testing, QA team signs off on the ticket before merges)
- **Per Kristen**: The plan is to implement a collab cycle in the future for mobile.
