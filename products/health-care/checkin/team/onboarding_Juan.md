## Questions
- Who is Juan's mentor on the mobile side? Tim Wright
- Will Juan join agile ceremonies of the mobile team? yes in first few weeks of onboarding, so that he is in sync with the mobile team, and mentor. Juan will be attending UAE ceremonies selectively
- Discuss collaboration with the UAE team: intent, tickets, tracking the work
  - How does the mobile team handle UAE product backlog? Do they create tickets themselves, or work with tickets that are on the UAE board? Development tickets will be on the UAE product backlog side
  - What git labels does the mobile team use? "mobile"
- what is the intake process?
  - Intake process will be used in case there are API (Web) changes, so that mobile api needs to get updated
  - No intake process for minor updates (for example: content)
- what elase does the mobile team need from the UAE team during the whole development cycle:
  - need to collaborate around PRs
  - Note: tickets need to be verified/validated by the mobile QA Team (function testing, QA team signs off on the ticket before merges)
- **Per Kristen**: The plan is to implement a collab cycle in the future for mobile.

## Mobile onboarding - Feedback from Juan
- What went well:
   - Mobile onboaridng ticket had nearly everything required to get started from scracth.
   - Mobile docs ❤️
   - [New VFS Team Member] onboarding ticket (helpfull to figure out what to do)
   - Mobile app dev setup
- Improvement opportunities:
  - Avoid using `@va.gov` email for project invites to avoid having to log into Citrix. Speeds up development a bit unless there is a security reason to only use `@va.gov` emails.
  - A section in Mobile Docs about "Phisical Devies" (are they needed?)
  - No mention of the project on the Google play console and no invite to that project. Not critical.
  - Mobile docs could have a link to [React Native Dev Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) 
  - Add a mobile specific checklist section to [New VFS Team Member] template that focuses on mobile. I used the "Front-end Engineers" checklist and that covers most of it but some things might not apply.
    - Mobile specific checklist item [Review Mobile Docs](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/intro) 
  - Some mobile doc pages have broken links to the figma components they reference
  - In the mobile docs the "Read and bookmark VA mobile general documentation" item should have sub tasks as some of the other tasks in the list like "Review how to set up deep linking in the app" are redundant if the "Read and bookmark VA mobile general documentation" is complete
  - A list of helpfull links that will be used in the day to day of the project. See my list below that I demed might be used on a day to day.
