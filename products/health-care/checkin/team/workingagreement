Team Working Agreement- CIE
last modified February 9, 2022

We use “we” for success and “I” for accountability.
We agree to respect each other’s time, value each other’s perspectives and investments, and therefore we agree to be fully present in meetings.
We can communicate with each other asynchronously on Slack and respect each other’s time zones. We will respond to messages within 4 working hours.
To respect each other’s time zones, we will conduct synchronous work (including meetings) between 11:30-4 Eastern, M-Th.
We will attempt to honor “No meeting Fridays” by having no scrum ceremonies on Fridays.
Each meeting or synchronous work session should have a purpose, topic, and/or outcome indicated on the calendar invitation so that participants can understand what the meeting is about.
For front end code reviews, the reviewer should pull down the pull request and run the code locally.
We celebrate our successes.
We conduct structured team demos at the end of the sprint, including a brief agenda and review of the sprint goals. We will post our demo recording and materials for others to access.
We will prioritize collaborative work whenever possible and believe that this process leads to superior results and helps prevent knowledge siloing. 
We will “default to open” whenever possible and share our knowledge with other teams in open forums such as the DSVA Slack.
We would like to have as much advance notice as possible for meetings, ideally at least 24 hours.
When determining who to invite to a meeting, we establish volunteer “owners” of each practice area and invite the rest of the team as optional.
We encourage following the “board norms” we have agreed upon.
As soon as a team member commits code, it becomes our code.

We collectively do the thing!
