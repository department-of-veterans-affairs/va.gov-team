## Daily Huddle / Daily Scrum
- Team Member will
    - Raise your virtual hand when you enter the Daily Huddle and take it down after you have given your update
    - Answer the following questions
        - What is your Balance score?
        - What did you do yesterday towards our Sprint goals?
        - What are you doing today towards our Sprint goals?
        - Do you have any blockers?
    - Discuss who is responsible for reviewing any tickets that need validation and a timeframe for completion

## CIE Team & UX Team Collaboration
- UX Team will hold a face-to-face feature feasibility discussion prior to the feature being approved by OCTO
    - Invitees
        - Involved UX team members
        - At least 1 FE and 1 BE CIE engineer        
        - CIE PM & DM
    - The intent of this discussion is to allow the engineers to raise any concerns or technical risks/impossibilities about the feature before it is presented to OCTO
- UX Team will hold a face-to-face discussion prior to the feature's wireframes finalization
   - Invitees
       - Involved UX team members
       - All CIE FE & BE engineers 
       - CIE PM & DM
    - The intent of this discussion is to allow the engineers & PM to raise any concerns about the UI or functionality before it is finalized     
- UX Team will hold a face-to-face technical hand-off when the feature is ready to be implemented
   - Invitees
        - Involved UX team members
        - All CIE FE & BE engineers (engineers that will work on it are required, others are optional)
        - CIE PM & DM
    - The intent of this discussion is to walk the team through the feature and answer any questions the engineers may have about functionality prior to implementing
    - Figma files will be locked down and made availabile in the "Waiting for release" section
    - Any changes that may be necessary after the hand-off will be evaluated by UX & the CIE team and a decision made about whether the changes must be incorporated into the planned release or pushed to a different release

## Refinement 
- Team will 
    - Answer & document in the Epic the following questions for each Epic /Ticket
        - How will we release the work for this Epic/Ticket? 
            - Scheduled & Coordinated - will we use a Feature Flag or Feature Branch? 
                - All Epics should be scheduled and coordinated
            - Upon Completion & Approval
                - Bugs not related to an Epic plus Tech Debt can be released upon completion & approval
        - Is this in the Planned Releases list yet or does it not need to be?
            - Pick a release date that is at least 2 weeks from the day it is added to the Planned Releases list    
        - Does this Epic need a release note?
   - Discuss and modify Acceptance Criteria, as necessary
   - Estimate/Point each Ticket (or apply a time box)
   - Understand the work that is necessary (high level) for each Ticket and how it is being released
   - Ensure tickets are created, as necessary, and added to each Epic based on what work is needed; the following GitHub templates are available to use as approrpirate

 ## Planning
 - Epics 
    - Product will 
        - Add an Epic to the [Planned Releases](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/release-plan/check-in-planned-releases.md) list as soon as it enters our Product Backlog
        - Create pre-release notes for each item in the Planned Releases list
        - Include a release date or range with each Planned Release item (can be TBD)
        - Update the estimated release date in Planned Releases when one has been agreed upon by the Team
        - Notify Training, Contact Center, & Comms of updates to Planned Releases (see [Notifications of Releases & Updates to Planned Releases](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/team/processes.md#notifications-of-releases--updates-to-planned-releases)) 
        - **NOT** put **Tech Debt & Bug** items on the Planned Releases list   
    - Team will 
        - Determine an estimated release date that is at least 2 weeks from the date it was decided for scheduled & coordinated releases      
        - Estimate team's capacity for the Sprint using the [Sprint Capacity Calculator](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/9418761/VASprintCapacityCalculator.xlsx)
        - Pull tickets into the Sprint
        - Agree on the Sprint goals
        - Agree on the Sprint content
    - Product will assign the current sprint to each ticket in the Sprint
 
 ## Validating

    - Ticket owner will
        - Move the ticket to the Validate column                 
        - Attach at least 1 of the following to the ticket per ticket type
            - For design/wireframe tickets
                - Screenshots of wireframes
                - Links to section in Abstract with relevant wireframes

                - Link to video demonstrating the feature
                - Do a quick Zoom call
        - Notify approvers in the UX or Engineering channels that the ticket is ready to be validated
        - Close the ticket once all reviews have been completed
    - Reviewer will
        - Use appropriate test cases in TestRail to validate features
