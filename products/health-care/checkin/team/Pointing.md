# Story Points


Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work.

When we estimate with story points, we assign a point value to each item. The raw values we assign are unimportant. What matters are the _relative values_. A story that is assigned a 2 should be twice as much as a story that is assigned a 1. It should also be two-thirds of a story that is estimated as 3 story points.

### Story Point Baseline

| Story Points  |  Engineering  |User Experience|
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------
|       1       |  Content Change - replacing text only <br /> Copy-paste/reusing code type work| Regiving a presentation/presentation with no prep required<br>Making a quick UI Change<br>Having a quick meeting with no prep |
|       2       | FE single component change <br /> Adding a minor code change that is simple to test + unit test |Attending a brainstorming session<br /> Designing for an existing feature or workflow<br>UI Change with moderate complexity |
|       3       | Adding a new, simple component/page (working from well-defined spec) <br /> Adding a new feature toggle<br/> A minor code change that has complicated testing associated with it.<br/> Adding calls to a new CHIP endpoint |Design and content changes without changing UI pattern <br /> Designing a feature based off examples w/no changes to design system<br>UI Change with extensive complexity|
|       5       | New feature that touches multiple parts of the application | Designing a feature that requires a new workflow|
|       8       |  |  |
