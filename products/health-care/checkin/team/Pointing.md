# Story Points

Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work.

When we estimate with story points, we assign a point value to each item. The raw values we assign are unimportant. What matters are the _relative values_. A story that is assigned a 2 should be twice as much as a story that is assigned a 1. It should also be two-thirds of a story that is estimated as 3 story points.

## Pointing Assumptions 

### Engineering
-

### UX

- Includes updating prototype interactions, if applicable. (E.g., on Sketch production file Pages.)
- Includes time to update documentation or links in Git, Sketch, etc., if applicable. 
- Includes time to update the Annotations page and/or add inline annotations to artboards or Pages, if applicable. E.g., aria labels, headings, heading styles, link destinations, etc.
- Includes time to receive and make minor changes from SMEs and Platform, from officr hours, for example. E.g., content or a11y SMEs, platform design, UX team, check in team, VA OCTO PO's, check in PO, Angela Fowler (a11y) or Sara Sterkenburg (IA).
- Includes time to create or update symbols in Sketch (or Figma), and validate across relevant Pages and artboards using those symbols, if applicable. 

## Story Point Baseline

| Story Points  |  Engineering  | UX |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------
|       1       |  Content Change - replacing text only <br /> Copy-paste/reusing code type work| - 1-3 wireframe updates that are content only updates and content is already provided<br>- 1 meeting or spike, minimal prep<br>- Creating a CAIA intake ticket for a feature<br>- Copy a few (under 6) wireframes to the production sketch file and arrange them in a clear way on the page<br>- 1-5 wireframe updates that are specific components only updates and components are already confirmed. Not including reorganizing symbols |
|       2       | FE single component change <br /> Adding a minor code change that is simple to test + unit test | - Update product guide<br>- VSignals on a regular sprint<br>- Minor updates to a prototype e.g., "Update Prototype to match latest Sketch design or content changes"<br>- Writing new content for a singular workflow<br>- Create md file for research findings, schedule readout with Naomi and move card in research repo<br>- 1 meeting or spike, but prepping is required, e.g., reviewing a couple artifacts<br>Update design artifact<br>- Update the design documentation/spec for a confirmed component of different status |
|       3       | Adding a new, simple component/page (working from well-defined spec) <br /> Adding a new feature toggle<br/> A minor code change that has complicated testing associated with it.<br/> Adding calls to a new CHIP endpoint | - VSignals if there are more than 1 sprint's worth to review<br>- Writing content for multiple workflows<br>- Create new user flow for small new feature (e.g., 45 min text reminder)<br>- Create a new CodePen prototype using existing templates<br>- Create 1 or 2 new wireframes for a new scenario with content. Includes looking up components in DS, looking at other VFS's work if they have a similar scenario, writing content<br>- For now (with PCI, CI, and Unified) updating multiple wireframes for a workflow that appears in all 3<br>- Arrange or update design documentation/spec for a component that needs clarification or which's statuses are complex<br>- Update poster layout with content|
|       5       | New feature that touches multiple parts of the application | - Create research plan<br>- Create research convo guide<br>- Create research presentation<br>- Create new user flow for large new feature (e.g., introduced travel into check in, BT claims for past appts)<br>- Update components across a flow. Includes looking up components in DS, evaluate different design options / position, review with other teams and iterate the option<br>- Product guides if there is a brand new feature/workflow (like travel pay) involved in the update<br>- Create an entirely new CodePen prototype<br>- Create 3-5 new wireframes for a new scenario with content. Includes looking up components in DS, looking at other VFS's work if they have a similar scenario, writing content|
|       8       |  | - Conduct a research study<br>- Research synthesis<br>- Something that takes up your entire time in sprint |
