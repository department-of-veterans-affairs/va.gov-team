"""
Compares 2 json files and finds all keys that are present in the first file but not in the second file
   First dialog box asks for the base file that contains all of the necessary keys
   Second dialog box asks for the comparison file that is searched for missing keys
   Input box asks for the name of your output file (extension is optional)
