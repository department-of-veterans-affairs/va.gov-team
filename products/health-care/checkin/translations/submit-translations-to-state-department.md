# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING TRANSLATIONS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT

- Generate 2 json comparison files (see [Instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/translations/json-compare/README.md))
  - 1 json file for missing Spanish keys
  - 1 json file for missing Tagalog keys
- Add any new text messages to a separate list
- Review the [Notes for Next Round](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/translations#notes-for-next-round) to see if there are any additions to the files that the comparison script won't pick up
  - Here are the engineering [instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/check-in/README.md#translations) for how keys are handled
- Generate screenshots that show the translated content in context (see [example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/translations/spanish-round-3/Spanish%20-%20Round%203_2022-11-28_20-30-21.pdf))
  - NOTE: this is only applicable if we have implemented the content (i.e. it's at least in staging but has not been translated)
