## Terminology
- **Pre-Registration:** The verification of up to date insurance information, contact information, next of kin, and emergency contact information for VA medical appointments. As a VHA Directive, pre-registration must be completed at least once within 7 days of an appointment and does not need to be completed again if another appointment is within 7 days of its completion.  
- **Pre-Check-In:** The Patient Check In (PCI) application workflow that occurs one to seven days before an appointment to collect Pre-Registration information. It is initiated after a Veteran confirms their appointment through an appointment reminder. 
- **Check In:** The Patient Check In (PCI) application workflow that occurs within a window that is no more than 45 minutes before and up to 15 minutes after a Veteran's appointment. Online check in has logic to include pre-registration, checking in (which sets the VistA status to e-check-in: complete, and filing for travel reimbursment.
