# Veteran and family member content information related to integrated health forms

This document describes the current and future state of Veteran and family member content on topics related to the integrated health forms. You can reach out to Danielle Thierry about any of this work.

## Camp Lejeune

### Current state

We currently have a [Camp Lejeune page](https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/camp-lejeune-water-contamination/) in the disability benefits hub. This page covers information on both disability and health care for Veterans and health care for family members. We also link to this page from the modernized VA.gov [health care hub family member benefits page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/family-caregiver-benefits/).

There is also information (some duplicative) in the legacy TeamSite environment on the [public health website](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/camp-lejeune/).

### Future state

We have 2 in-progress efforts that will change the content landscape for CHAMPVA content:
- **Content migration:** We're continuing to migrate all Veteran and family member content from the legacy TeamSite experience over into the modernized VA.gov experience. All relevant CHAMPVA content will move from TeamSite into the modernized VA.gov. We're not yet working on migration of the public health website.
- **Family member hub optimization:** We're iterating on the [family member benefits hub](https://www.va.gov/family-member-benefits/) to bring more family member content into the hub for a more cohesive experience for this audience. We may move the family member information about Camp Lejeune into this hub (with crosslinks remaining from the health care hub).

## CHAMPVA

### Current state

We currently house CHAMPVA content within the modernized VA.gov health care hub. The page is titled "[CHAMPVA benefits](https://www.va.gov/health-care/family-caregiver-benefits/champva/)." Additional CHAMPVA content currently lives within the legacy TeamSite community care website [CHAMPVA section](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/dependents/champva/index.asp).

### Future state

We have 2 in-progress efforts that will change the content landscape for CHAMPVA content:
- **Content migration:** We're continuing to migrate all Veteran and family member content from the legacy TeamSite experience over into the modernized VA.gov experience. All relevant CHAMPVA content will move from TeamSite into the modernized VA.gov. We're actively working on migrating this information and expect to have migration complete by the end of 2023.
- **Family member hub optimization:** We're iterating on the [family member benefits hub](https://www.va.gov/family-member-benefits/) to bring more family member content into the hub for a more cohesive experience for this audience. CHAMPVA content will likely move into this hub (with crosslinks remaining from the health care hub).

## Foreign Medical Program

### Current state

Content on the Foreign Medical Program currently lives in the legacy TeamSite environment in the [community care website's foreign medical program section](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/fmp/index.asp).

### Future state

**Content migration** work will change the content landscape for FMP content:

- We're nearing the launch of 3 new, modernized VA.gov FMP content pages in support of content migration (existing community care pages will then redirect to these new, modernized pages):
  - [Page preview: Foreign Medical Program](http://preview-prod.vfs.va.gov/preview?nodeId=50826) (will live in the health care benefits hub)
  - [Page preview: How to file a Foreign Medical Program claim](http://preview-prod.vfs.va.gov/preview?nodeId=49685) (will live in the health care benefits hub)
  - [Page preview: Getting care through the Foreign Medical Program](http://preview-prod.vfs.va.gov/preview?nodeId=50969) (will live in the resources and support section)

- We're also going to be working on migrating this [Veterans living overseas](https://www.benefits.va.gov/persona/veteran-abroad.asp) page from the legacy TeamSite environment into the modernized VA.gov environment in the future.

## Decision reviews

### Current state

Our VA.gov decision reviews hub is very VBA focused at this time.

### Future state

#### Phase 1 of health care information into decision reviews hub

We are currently working with the VHA appeals modernization team, in collaboration with VBA and BVA, to bring more health care information into the hub. This is very intentionally a phased approach to simply bring in missing information and update content at this time, with the goal to do deeper work and discovery in partnership with relevant teams and partners in the future. 

These 2 new pages are currently in review:
- [Clinical Appeals of medical treatment decisions](http://preview-prod.vfs.va.gov/preview?nodeId=57215)
- [Family caregiver program decision reviews and appeals](http://preview-prod.vfs.va.gov/preview?nodeId=57308)

We're also working on reviewing this resources and support page:
- [Choosing a decision review option](http://preview-prod.vfs.va.gov/preview?nodeId=23290)

And we've audited pages throughout the Decision reviews hub to identify where we need to add or update information to accomodate health care.

#### Phase 2 of decision reviews hub

This hub needs a reassessment as a whole. Content/accessibility/information architecture team will partner with relevant OCTO teams and VA partners to relook at this hub's organization more holistically in the future.

## Spina bifida

### Current state

We currently have information about spina bifida in terms of disability compensation (https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/special-claims/birth-defects/) and information about health care lives in the legacy TeamSite environment in the [community care website's spina bifida section](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/dependents/spinabifida/index.asp). We link out to the legacy health care information from the modernized VA.gov [health care hub family member benefits page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/family-caregiver-benefits/).

### Future state

We have 2 in-progress efforts that will change the content landscape for spina bifida content:
- **Content migration:** We're continuing to migrate all Veteran and family member content from the legacy TeamSite experience over into the modernized VA.gov experience. All relevant spina bifida content will move from TeamSite into the modernized VA.gov. We're actively working on migrating this information and expect to have migration complete by the end of 2023.
- **Family member hub optimization:** We're iterating on the [family member benefits hub](https://www.va.gov/family-member-benefits/) to bring more family member content into the hub for a more cohesive experience for this audience. Spina bifida content will likely move into this hub (with crosslinks remaining from the disability and health care hubs).
