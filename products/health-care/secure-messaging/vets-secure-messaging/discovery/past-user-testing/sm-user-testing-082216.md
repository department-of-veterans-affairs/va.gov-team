# SM User Testing SF Week of 8/22/16

On the week of 8/22/2016 we met with 3 Veterans and tested out the current and prototype experience. You can find the script we used here: [ConversationGuide-Aug2016.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/kudos-team/blob/master/SecureMessaging/Discovery/User%20Testing/Current%20and%20MHV%20Prototype/ConversationGuide-Aug2016.md)

## Key Takeaways
- All 3 did not use the signature feature.
They just signed their own names in the email message itself.
- All 3 liked having folders to organize messages by doctor or condition, but none of them used folders because they didn't feel that they had enough contacts or messages.
- 2 out of 3 mentioned that they liked getting email notifications when they received a message in SM. 
 - The second Veteran liked the idea of it because he did not seem to know that the feature existed on the current experience, but talked about how it would be a really useful feature. 
- All 3 thought the prototype version looked a little clearer with better contrast.
- 2 out of 3 mentioned that they did not attach files to messages, but understood the value of it.
 - They could see themselves attaching pictures of conditions. 
- All 3 wanted it to feel like it was their regular inboxes (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook)
- All 3 didn't like the the prototype version's disclaimer: "This message may not be from the person you originally message"
- All 3 thought subject vs. subject line were confusing. 

## What worked
- **Prototype version**
  - Radio buttons for topics/categories
    - Liked that all the topics were not hidden in a dropdown

## What didn't work
- **Current version**
 - Dropdown of topic/category
   - Our first missed that you could choose a different topic/category and had always use the default "general inquiry." 
 - Subject line
 - Disclaimer that this is not for emergencies
   - Our first Veteran kept wanting to use SM for emergencies. 

- **Prototype version**
 - Disclaimer when viewing or creating messages
   - "This message may not be from the person you originally message"
     - Didn't feel secure that the message could be sent to a different person.
     - "What's going on here? who is it from?...don't get the rationale here. Not the best way to convey that message, immediate sense of doubt."
 - Subject vs. subject line is confusing

## Quotes
- "If you have personal folders than I wouldn't even bother with the archive"
- "Nothing is faster then picking up a phone number and dialing it."
- "I don't have enough contacts" (regarding not using folders)
- "It's more important to see who it's from than the subject matter"
