### An Exploration of SM at Two Early-Adopter VA Medical Centers

**Content Categories: (How do these map to the categories that Veterans can choose from? The prototype categories are: Appointments, consultations, education, health records (including blue button), labs and tests, medications, other.)**
- Health issues
- Medication Renewal or Refill
- Medication Issue
- Test Issue
- Test Result
- Self-Reporting
- FYI-Informing
- Scheduling
- Referral
- Administrative
- Life Issue
- MHV/SM/Tech
- Appreciate
- Complaint
- Other

**Conclusions from the ppt:**
- Most frequent requests were medication renewal or refill and med issues, scheduling, and health issues. 
- Most threads were relatively short and completed within practice expectation or sooner (3 bus. days).
- Very few contained potentially problematic content such as urgent, chatty, or verbally abusive messages. 


### Cycle 9 - Findings & recommendations

**Folders:**
- Participants unanimously noted a preference for folders (versus labels)
- Those who indicated they use the folder system stated that they would rather move messages from their inbox manually versus auto-moving messages to folders.  
- A majority of users felt that they would not or did not receive enough messages to require a folder organizational structure.

**Recommendations:**
- If to be implemented, utilize folder structure rather than labels.
- Allow users to manually move messages to folders, rather than auto-organizing them.

**Other findings:**
- Users understand how to search for messages. 
- Users do not believe they would receive messages with enough volume or frequency to require folder organization.
- Users indicate that they do not use built-in messaging applications on any medical website.

**Random notes:** 
- The mockup that is shown has some things that are no longer in the prototype:
 - Settings link at the top
 - Archive button next to the move button
 - Topic vs. subject
 - Subject vs. subject line


### Cycle 14 - Findings & recommendations
*This is for the clinician side, but I think some of the findings and recommendations could be applied to the Veteran's side as well. Also, these are recommendations are directly from the ppt.* 

Participants were able to reply but they pointed out a number of ways in which it could be made easier and more efficient.

**Header of the message:**
- Some participants felt there was too much information in the header of the message
- **Recommendations:**
 - Make the header collapsible/expandable.
   - Collapse it by default showing just:
      - Sent:
      - From:
      - To:
      - Subject Line:
 - Attachment: [display only when attachment is present]
 - Remove "Message:" as it is self-evident that the boxed text is the message.

**Hyperlinks of the inbox table:** 
- Several participants were confused by the fact that every item in the row is hyperlinked. They assumed that each hyperlink went someplace different; they wasted time deliberating over which link to click on.
- **Recommendation:** If there is no functional need for all items to be hyperlinked, Human Factor Engineering (HFE) recommends only linking the “Subject Line” items.

**Message thread:**
- Participants liked the Message Thread.
- Participants debated if any or all of the messages in the thread should be expanded by default. There was no clear consensus.
- Participants liked being able to show and hide the message content in the Message Thread by clicking on the caret symbol.
- Participants very much liked the "Hide all messages | Show all messages" links but they tended to not see them right away.
  - **Recommendation:** Move all of the content on the right to the left. Change the order and wording as follows:
    - There are [#] messages in this thread.
     - Click on a subject line to see a message's content.
     - Hide all messages | Show all messages.
- P5 could not figure out how to collapse the Message Thread and the Workflow Thread because when she hovered her mouse over the minus signs the cursor did not change from an arrow to a finger to indicate the minus sign was clickable.
  - **Recommendation:** Have the cursor transform into a finger when hovering over the collapse and expand icons to make it clear they are clickable.

**Message workflow:**
- Participants liked the Message Workflow.
- Some participants felt the Message Workflow should be collapsed by default, but this was not a strongly held position.

**Reply:**
- Participants looked for the "Reply" button at the bottom of the message they were responding to, but it wasn't there.
- They didn't like having to scroll all the way back to the top of the message to click on "Reply."
  - **Recommendation:** Add a "Reply" link below the message.
- Participants noted that when they clicked on "Reply" and the reply screen showed up, they’d already forgotten the exact nature of the request so they had to go down and expand the first item in the message thread to refresh their memories.
  - **Recommendation:** After the user clicks on “Reply” and is taken to the “Reply to Message” screen, have the first item in the message thread automatically expanded so the user can immediately be reminded about the details of the request without making an extra click.

**Spell check:** 
- There is no spell check available before sending a message. Spell check would be especially valuable since many of the messages are being saved as progress notes in CPRS.
  - **Recommendation:** Although there is browser-based spell checking available, in the interest of efficiency, there should be a spell check link above the “Send” button.

**Character count:**
- Retain the current policy of having no character limit on the messages that Veterans can send the healthcare team.
  - **Recommendation:** Retain the current policy of having no character limit on the message that Veterans can send the healthcare team.

**Sent folder:**
- P5 was confused by the Sent message counter. The participant wondered why was it showing a number of sent messages.


### My HealtheVet Secure Messaging Face to Face

**We always hear 3 things from Veterans:**
- I want to be able to use SM with all of my providers
- I want a faster response to my message
- I want to know that I am communicating with my provider and not someone else on the team.

**Some other notes on SM for Veterans:**
- In the future, the Veteran will not be asked to accept a separate set of Terms and Conditions for SM. The Terms and Conditions for SM will be part of the MHV Terms and Conditions. When that change will occur is TBD.
- The new Dashboard will provide a link to SM that will be easier for the MHV user to find.
- For some reason, patients are not finding the “New Message” button in the current SM design. This should be made easy to find because it is preferable for patients to start a new message instead of finding an old one and just replying to it. This may be a candidate for an HFE Study.

Didn't find anything useful to SM except one note that said Veterans want mobile SM.

**Benefits of using SM**
- Access - benefits those who live far from a VA medical center
- Beats the long wait time over the phone
- More focused communication btwn patients and providers
- Improved communication of care received in non-VA settings
- Meets expected response (assumption)
- Response isn't dependent on one person, so more likely for patients to get a quick response.
- ** Better communication those VA with hearing loss


### Nazi 2013 The Personal Health Record Paradox_ Health Care Professionals’ Perspectives

- Users can set their preference to receive notifications

Secure messaging has had dramatic consequences for communication, patterns of communication,
and patient/provider relationships.
- Improves access and patient perceptions of access
- Avoidance of telephone tag
- Communication is more direct and focused
- Improves convenience and efficiency
- More frequent communication between periodic in-person visits
- Lowers the threshold at which patients will initiate - communication
- Improved patient engagement, satisfaction, and trust
- Enhances patient/provider relationships
- Concerns about workload implications with increased use

## Quotes

"Secure Messaging has been particularly helpful to her as most of her patients have profound hearing loss and cannot use the telephone."

"helps some patients feel more connected."

HCP04: I think it helps some patients feel more connected. And again I think it helps them feel like they’re more in control of their own health care. They don’t have to have a special device or another person make a phone call. I think it’s good…a good way for them to connect directly.

One nurse explains that because telephone calls to her outpatient clinic are routed through a local non-VA community hospital, patients do not even have the ability to call and leave her a message.

"Secure Messaging has been helpful for improving medication management for co-managed patients

**Clinicians on replying to a secure message:**
- “The green buttons are nice and consistent. The stuff you need to do is a green button.” (P3)
- "Actually opening these [each hyperlinked item in the row in the inbox] will be different. Currently I'm trying to figure out which of these links to click on, because they're all kind of hyperlinky. That's pretty confusing. I'm going to go to subject line.“ (P6)
- “I like the show all messages feature; that way I can click and see the whole thread, in case I wasn't on it the whole time or was out of the loop.” (P4)
- “I wish that there were a reply at the bottom of the screen, that way once I've read it I can click reply. That way I wouldn’t be scrolling back up to the top to reply.” (P4)
- “I don't see a spell check and I’m someone who always spell checks my notes, especially if we’re putting them in charts.” (P4)

## Questions

- What's is Message Workflow? And when should it displayed on the Veteran side. 
- Do patients and doctors every print or go over conversation?

**For Susan S. Woods (MyHealtheVet Grand Rounds Dec 15 2015_Final)**
- Would you tell us how Veteran's are currently being trained for using SM and if there has been any new ideas after your research on how to go about this? 
- ^ Same question for providers
- Variation across teams in response times and message handling suggests room for more effective handling of SM – Could you go deeper into this?
- Could you send us the file of the process map? Powerpoint has it's limitation on image resolutions
