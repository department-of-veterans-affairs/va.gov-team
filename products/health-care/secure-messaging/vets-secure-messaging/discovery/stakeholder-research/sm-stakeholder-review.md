# SM Stakeholder Review

| Topic | Stakeholder concerns from Dr. Evans and Dr. Douglas - 9/22 | Next steps | Solution | Stakeholder feedback 10/12 | Stakeholder cleared  | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Disclaimer | Rewrite the disclaimer to focus less on timeliness (“reply quickly”) and more plain language about the message going to the health care team | Come up with a better disclaimer. https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/kudos-team/issues/175 | **Before:** In order to reply back quickly, somebody else on your heath care team may reply back to your messages. **After:** The responder will vary depending on what you ask and may be anyone on your health care team. (see mockup below) | For some reason, I keep tripping over the use of the noun “responder” in Feedback Item 1. It’s fine and I’m not falling on my sword on this one. But I wonder if something like this might resonate more. –“The VA staff member who responds will vary depending on what you ask and may be anyone on your health care team.” |✔️|
| 2. Character count  | Remove the character limit (confirm the API doesn’t have a character limit) | Jeff Sartori Re:character count - "Yes there is a reason. The character count is design to control the users actions. We put on that count feature so the user would not author a SM that was long and rambling. While the instances of users developing long and rambling notes is very low. We felt this was the best option to control the users actions at this time." Theresa added "This was a provider request for the reasons Jeff mentioned." Will ask clincians we talk about this one as well.| Talk to stakeholders | Agree with excluding the character count. |✔️|
| 3. To | On “Compose” remove "from" from "select from your health care team” (I’ve never said “from” so often in one sentence) | Remove "from" from "Select your health care team" |    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/103496/18885101/0c7f2426-849f-11e6-9b05-9056471c5879.png) (See larger mock below)   | |✔️|
| 4. Subject line | We need to be sure there is no scenario where there is a blank subject line. So we either need to require it or fill something in if left blank | Right now, as long as a Veteran picks a subject from the dropdown the subject line will be filled with at least that subject in the subject line. The Veteran can choose to add more info in the text box which will append to the subject | Keep the solution we have for now, until we decide if want to get rid of the subject dropdown or not. | |✔️|
| 5. Select a subject | We could potentially remove “select a subject” dropdown | Find out if there are clinicians/coordinators that use the subject from the "select a subject" drop down to triage messages. The one clincian we talked to thought that it was helpful to have the subjects since MHV automatically creates subfolders that she sometimes uses, but didn't think it would be a big deal if the subjects/categories were gone. | Talk to stakeholers |  |✔️|
| 6. Impact on clinicians | They are confident these changes will not impact the clinicians or admins. | No action is really needed here, but we will talk to a couple more clinicials while we map out the triage/clinician process and could mention this if we find that useful.| N/A | N/A |✔️|
| 7. Overall look & feel | They thought it looked great, clean and simple | No action needed here | N/A | N/A |✔️|
| 8. Yellow banner | | | |An apostrophe is needed (provider’s). Further, I think I’d rewrite it to be more prescriptive (working my inner plain English self here). There are really two instructions for action. One instruction if the matter is urgent, another if it is a crisis. So I’d call them out in separate sentences for clarity. Possibility: If this is an urgent matter, please contact your VA health care facility/team by telephone. If this is a crisis situation, please call the Veterans Crisis Line. (I was debating facility vs. team in that sentence above and ended up just putting them both down. If we wanted to simplify, I think I’d go with facility. If its 9pm, the health care team won’t be there to answer the phone, but the call to the facility contact number should roll over to one of the WHEN (weekends, holidays, evenings, nights) call centers to get the person in touch with someone who can help.) |✔️|
