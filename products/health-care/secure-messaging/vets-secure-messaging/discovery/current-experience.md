## Purpose of this document:
The purpose of the document is for the vets.gov team to spend some time with the existing application to understand how it works. Many of the things we pointed out have been known issues within the VA for some time.

<a id="currentpages"></a>
## Current Pages:

**In order to use secure messaging, Veterans need:**
- Be a veteran enrolled at a VA health care facility
- Be registered as a VA Patient in My HealtheVet
- Have a My HealtheVet Premium account
 - In-person or online authentication

### Instructions on how to get a premium account:
![Instructions on how to get a premium account](screenshots/my-healthevet-upgrade-info.png?raw=true)

This has not been updated or reviewed in 4 years. If a Veteran can go in to a VA facility, it seems like their account can be upgraded once their info is verified. Otherwise it could take up to 20 days to complete the online authentication process and you need to have an eBenefits account.

Once a Veteran has a premium account. They have the option of opting in to secure messaging.

### My HealtheVet - Homepage:

### My HealtheVet - Login error:
![My HealtheVet - Login error](screenshots/my-healthevet-login-error.png?raw=true)

### My HealtheVet - Logged in:
![My HealtheVet - Logged in](screenshots/my-healthevet-logged-in.png?raw=true)

I logged in using one of our test accounts. Once I’m logged in as a premium account, there is still an advertisement to upgrade to a premium account.

### Secure Messaging Tab:
![Secure Messaging Tab](screenshots/secure-messaging-tab.png?raw=true)


When on the secure messaging page the login box on the side changes color from being in a blue box to a white box and loses its padding.

The button to access the secure messaging looks ad like and is low res so the button looks a little fuzzy to read.

The picture of what is to come doesn’t feel very trustworthy or secure.

When I press secure messaging it opens up in a different tab. Opening it up in a different tab makes it feel like I’m on a different site altogether. The header has the same logo but everything about the header is different.

### Secure Messaging - Terms and Conditions:
![Secure Messaging - Terms and Conditions](screenshots/secure-messaging-t&c.png?raw=true)

If this is the Veteran’s first time using secure messaging, then there is a screen with the T&C and a place for them to opt-in to secure messaging. (The test account already opted in so I didn’t get to see if this page is in a new tab or in the same tab).

The URLs don’t look very friendly:
- https://www.myhealthevet.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/mhv.portal?_nfpb=true&_nfto=false&_pageLabel=secureMessagingPage
- https://sm.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-sm-web/leftnav.action

### Secure Messaging - Inbox:
![Secure Messaging - Inbox](screenshots/secure-messaging-inbox.png?raw=true)

The buttons (search, delete selected, dropdown, move) are close to each other which makes it not immediately obvious that the dropdown and move button work together.

The delete selected seems like it should only work when items are selected. Otherwise right now the Veteran right now can select it even if nothing is selected and they get an error.

The subject lines and select options have an extra space that is underlined. The date field looks like it can be wider so the date can fit on one line.

The select options would make more sense at the top, so Veterans can see the inbox change below vs. above.

The number next to inbox is in parentheses vs. the other folders are in brackets.

The highlight of the inbox in the sidebar looks like the header of the of My Folders section.

Add folder is an action that the Veteran can perform that is different from the list of folders above it but they look too similar that it can be lost in the list even though there is a little more spacing.

The question mark next to help looks like it would be a tool tip that a Veteran could hover over and learn more about what is under the help page, but nothing actually happens. This could be removed.

There are no hover overs for links or buttons other than for the emails themselves.

Welcome in the header is blue like the link color and seems clickable but it is not.

Close secure messaging button closes the tab.

### Secure Messaging - Search:

### Secure Messaging - Read message:
![Secure Messaging - Read message](screenshots/secure-messaging-read-message.png?raw=true)

The main message could benefit from padding on the left. The previous message although not as important as the main message doesn’t need to be in a smaller font like it is.

### Secure Messaging - Reply error:
![Secure Messaging - Reply error](screenshots/secure-message-reply-error.png?raw=true)

### Secure Messaging - Read message with next message link:

### Secure Messaging - New message file attached
![Secure Messaging - New message file attached](screenshots/secure-messaging-new-message-with-attachment.png?raw=true)

As a user when I attach a file, save it as a draft and then go click on the draft to work on it again my attached file disappears.

### Secure Messaging - Instructions to attach a file:

### Secure Messaging - Opt in, opt out:
![Secure Messaging - Opt in, opt out](screenshots/secure-messaging-opt-in-opt-out.png?raw=true)

Once a user opts out and wants to opt back in, all of their previous messages will not be retrievable.

### Secure Messaging - Drafts:
![Secure Messaging - Drafts](screenshots/secure-messaging-drafts.png?raw=true)

### Secure Messaging - Sent:
![Secure Messaging - Sent](screenshots/secure-messaging-sent.png?raw=true)

### Secure Messaging - Deleted:
![Secure Messaging - Deleted](screenshots/secure-messaging-deleted.png?raw=true)

Once the emails are deleted, they stay here for 14 months before it goes into a secure messaging database indefinitely according to the user guide.

### Secure Messaging - Edit my folders:
![Secure Messaging - Edit my folders](screenshots/secure-messaging-edit-my-folders.png?raw=true)

### Secure Messaging - Rename folder:
![Secure Messaging - Rename folder](screenshots/secure-messaging-rename-folder.png?raw=true)

When I press rename it takes me a modal to change the name of the folder, but the modal doesn’t indicate what folder name I am changing.

### Secure Messaging - Add new folder:
![Secure Messaging - Add new folder](screenshots/secure-messaging-add-new-folder.png?raw=true)

### Secure Messaging - Technical support:
![Secure Messaging - Technical support](screenshots/secure-messaging-technical-support.png?raw=true)

The buttons here are red vs. bed on all the other pages. Also reset is used here vs. clear in the search interface.

### Secure Messaging - Technical support error:
![Secure Messaging - Technical support error](screenshots/secure-messaging-tech-support-errors.png?raw=true)

Note and error message have similar treatment. Also the “please note” is a different treatment than the “attention” in the new message, but both deliver similar messages.

### Secure Messaging - Technical support error tooltip:
![Secure Messaging - Technical support tooltip](screenshots/secure-messaging-tech-support-error-tooltip.png?raw=true)

Clicking on some fields shows a tooltip. This tooltip design is not consistent with the blue tooltip that is in new message.

### Secure Messaging - Technical support reset:
![Secure Messaging - Technical support reset](screenshots/secure-messaging-reset-tech-support.png?raw=true)

This modal is treated differently than the other modals. Also here dismiss is used instead of cancel and is now positioned on the left instead of the right.

### Secure Messaging - Technical support scroll in scroll:
![Secure Messaging - Technical support scroll in scroll](screenshots/secure-messaging-tech-support-scroll-within-a-scroll.png?raw=true)

The contact page allows you to scroll in another box that hides the buttons to submit. So it’s possible for people not to see the submit button.

### Secure Messaging - Help:
![Secure Messaging - Help](screenshots/secure-messaging-help.png?raw=true)

### Secure Messaging - Expired session:
![Secure Messaging - Expired session](screenshots/secure-messaging-expired-session.png?raw=true)

If your session is expired, it brings up a page to go log in to the My HealtheVet homepage where you have to choose if you want to login or register again. Veterans should be able to log back in on this page.

It can be confusing for secure messaging to open up in a new tab. When I had that tab open but then the session expired and I went back to sign in. I kept pressing the open secure message button and nothing seemed to happen, but that’s because I already had another tab with secure message open that was being refreshed.
