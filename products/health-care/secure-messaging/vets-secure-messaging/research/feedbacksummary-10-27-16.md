## Prescription Refill
- Overall, this went well.
  - Participants said it was "simple."
- Interface-related challenges
 - There was confusion about the difference between refills and history; perhaps "active refills" would be more clear.
 - Most participants preferred the list view of prescriptions in the history, whether due to accessibility-related scrolling challenges or just thinking it was simpler to see and sort the information.
 - On the prescription card view, the sort options weren't obvious to some participants.
- Data-related challeneges and requests
 - A couple participants wished that there was a chance to confimr their address for refill shipping; that is currently not included due to data availability.
 - When seeing the facility information for a refill, participants wanted to see the contact information for the prescribing provider, not just the facility the prescription was written in.
 - Participants loved the link to secure messaging from their precription pages, but wished that it would go to an auto-populated message to the correct provider with the prescription details rather than to the secure messaging inbox.

## Secure Messaging
- Overall, this went pretty well with participants comparing it to their regular email.
 - Threading also worked okay despite the test messages not being obvious to understand on first glance.
- Several participants missed the "compose" button at the left; perhaps it could be made to stand out more visually.
- Participants want to see their provider's name and specialty in the contact drop-down and from fields.
- No participants used the previous/next message buttons, and said they don't use them in their regular emails either.
- One partricipant had strong issues with not knowing how many providers can see his messages; he is very concerned about his messages going to a broader group than the doctor he addresses a message to and their assistant.

## Switching to Vets.gov
- There is a resistance to change that is typical for website use; participants expressed hesitance to switch to an unfamiliar system when they know how to use one that works "good enough."
 - Creating a new login for the new site will be an additional hurdle to users who do not like change.
