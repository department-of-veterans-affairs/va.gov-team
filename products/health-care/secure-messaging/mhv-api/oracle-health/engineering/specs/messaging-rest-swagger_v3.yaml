        Posted messages will most likely be stored in a data store that uses a character set of Windows-1252 or Windows-1256. Consumers must ensure that the characters used in the string attributes of the message are compatible with these character sets. If this requirement is not met, there is a chance of data loss when the message is stored.

        If the patient sends a message to an out of office provider , an out of office notification from the provider is sent to the patient's portal account. An atom feed to a publication url may be setup to fire upon a new message (including out of office messaging into the patient's inbox) to allow actions to be taken upon this knowledge (such as an email to an external email account).

        The capability to send messages to a secure email address is available with the following limitation:-

        1. The host Millennium system must have a provisioned e-mail account to represent the patient as a sender.

        2. When an e-mail type of receiver is included as a destination address only one will be allowed as either a Receiver or Carbon Copy Receiver. No other receivers will be allowed.

        3. Un-solicited inbound communication from a secure e-mail address is not supported at this time. It will be rejected by the host system and never reach the patient.

        4. Portal applications should be implemented with the expectation that this is a limited use, one way operation. When the destination address is invalid or unable to handle the message, a bounce-back message is possible when the destination system supports this capability and fully conforms to the e-mail specification. If the destination system hosting the receiver e-mail address does not conform, no indication of destination failure will be possible.

        5. E-mail provides no guarantee that the information reached its destination. As a best practice it is recommended that the patient follow-up with the destination recipient to confirm that the recipient received the message properly.
