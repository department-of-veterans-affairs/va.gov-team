## Mapping the health landscape 
### Products, people, and systems
In late 2020, we wanted to understand how Veterans think about health care, as well as the fragmented ecosystem Veterans and caregivers must navigate to get health care and disability benefits. This would help us modernize digital health by informing our overall strategy and our product, design, content, and user research thinking. We started by:
* Interviewing our partners/stakeholders working on things related to health, and 
* Mapping [VA's health products, people, and systems](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1606314329344/1d6343c768f02ec0ab12eab999c331b3c64b29eb). 

In traveling the product landscape and talking to people in OCTO and OCC (Office of Connected Care), we found a number of teams working on similar — or the same — functionality, as shown on the map of [products, people and systems](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1606314329344/1d6343c768f02ec0ab12eab999c331b3c64b29eb). For example, both My HealtheVet and the Cerner system have patient portals. Cerner's is called "My VA Health." 

Here's a [Mural focused on the Veteran health experience](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1604084474211/631b50e308fb47bdeaf39d81189e5d53ed6f057a) that preceded the map of [products, people, and systems](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1606314329344/1d6343c768f02ec0ab12eab999c331b3c64b29eb). In October-November 2020, product owners in OCTO added comments and products/efforts. (Note that the 3rd column titled "What do they do?" is unfinished.)

### Ways to interact with VA for health care 
In the first meeting on Digital Health Modernization, we showed product owners in areas related to health [the ways Veterans interact with VA for health care — and some of the fragmentation](
