### Background (5 minutes)
To get started, I’d like to get a little background information about you, and your experience with the VA.

1. *Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?* (Moderator can prompt the participant: where they live, branch of military, work or hobbies).
* Retired Army for 24 yrs
* 100% disabled
* Uses Providence healthcare system
* Was Vet svc rep, medically retired - VA employee at Providence VA on pre-determination team (when claims for compensation or pension come in, I wd work those claims — Worked for outreach section just b4 retired)
* Worked at special population clinic (homeless clinic), went to hospital 2x week. Job was to help ppl with benes, coord with hospital (bt hospital and regional office he worked at)
* Had a business and sold it
* From Rhode Island

2. *When did you leave the military?*
June 1, 2005. 

1st heard of VA benes from VFW rep at Ft Campbell, KY when he was outprocessing. 

3. *What VA benefits do you receive?*
“Everything. Prescripts, I’ve gotten some equipment from them,” oxygen. 

All the dealings with Prov reg ofc:
“They’re the best.” 
“If you feel you need something that’s gg to mk your life better, ask for it.” And 90% of time the Providence VA wd get it for you. 

He’s on Social Sec.

Retired from reg ofc in 2013. Then applied for SSDI. 

Applied for disability at Ft Campbell when did physicals. 

Applied for HC  probably in 2005 when out of svc. 

4. *Do you have any family members who you claim as dependents?* 
Wife, and she is on disability comp from Soc Sec. She does not get benes from VA. 

4.a. *Do your family members receive any benefits from the VA?*
No.

5. *Do you manage any of your VA benefits online?* 
I don’t use the portal, eBenefits. Have user name and password, know how to get in. 

Use MHV to:
* renew prescripts
* Blue Button to download doc notes, MRIs, labs

5.a. *Where do you do that? (Moderator can share screen and show MHV or VA.gov if participant seems unsure of website/account).*


6. *Do you use any mobile apps to manage your health?* 
No. 

*How did you learn about what was available to you as it relates to health?* 
1st appt with -primary care, which was pretty helpful (the provider).

Because I had filed the claim… I was probably gg thru a C&P exam when I started using VA health care. So my info was prob available to the hospital (doc notes, etc). 

Had a copy of my med records. Took my med records to my primary care, talked about what disabilities I had, what med issues I had — did this when I was retiring. 

Applied for disability 1st, before health care. (?) See below.

They had a VFW rep at Ft Campbell — there was a station we cd go thru to learn abt benes, how to file claims. The rep was pretty good. 

I was a wartime Veteran. I think I had my appts (health care) even before I was awarded my disability %age. 

Being a wartime Veteran, I was elig for health care. 

*Familiar with priority groups?* 
Think of the number of ppl who served. Govt has to prioritize based on your income and your service. “Triage.” 

I am in top priority group, so I get everything. 

Over 50%, no copays. Under 50%, you may have to pay a copay. 

I was married during his service. Married 3x. 

*What is it like to update your wife as a dependent?*
“It’s simple. It’s VA form 21-686C.” Does not hurt to send VA copy of current marriage certificate. May not need it but “it’s better to have it.” Did not do it online. 

Volunteered 1 day a week at hospital doing claims for DAV, Disabled American Veterans. 

*Used other VA svcs or benes?*
“The only complaint I have on the hospital side is the dental.” 

100% disabled - you are entitled to dental care. Very hard to get an appt. Also, you cd go a while without teeth. “I know guys.”

I know how to navigate the system. 

Rest of health care - not hard to get appt. Used to keep a day minder. In Providence, the appts came up fast. 

Have TriCare bc I’m a retiree. 

*Diff bt TriCare and VA?*
Have Medicare. Have TriCare for life. Used both of these for 1 surgery the VA didn’t cover. 

“I use the VA, total.”

TriCare
Bc I am military retiree, I cd use TriCare and pay for it. My wife is on it. I am 65 and now have Medicare, so TriCare is my secondary insurance. Can use TriCare for prescriptions but wd pay copays. Prescripts free at VA.

Wife has BC | BS with TriCare as secondary. She is still employed. 

“TriCare’s only like $300 and change a year.”

*Your outside health care - do you use anything similar to MHV?* 
No. “On MHV, you can input data on your health, I believe.” I don’t do that. 

I had gastric sleeve surgery. I brought my info to my primary care and they inputted the data into the hospital system.

“I was lazy. I didn’t want to do the input.” 

*Think it wd have been the same if you put the info into the portal as if it was inputted into the system?* 
Yes, probably. “I don’t know how that wd work for the hospital folks.”

6.a. (If yes) *What apps do you use? What do you use them for?*


### Mental model of health at the VA (20 minutes)

Now I’d like to hear about your experience transitioning from the military to the VA. *(10 minutes)*

1. *How did you learn about the health care available to you through the VA, and what was the process of applying for and accessing those benefits?* (In follow up, confirm if participant used any online tools or resources.)


2. *Tell me about the health care you receive through the VA.* 


2.a. (If they have dependents) *How do you manage your dependent’s health care?*


3. *Do you use any medical providers outside the VA for any of your health care needs?* 


3.a. (If yes) *Tell me a bit about the experience of using private and VA health care.* 


3.b. *Do you manage your private health care/insurance online?*


4. *Since you first became a Veteran, has there been a change in the types of VA benefits you’ve received?* 


4.a. (If yes) *What was the reason behind those changes?*


5. *How would you explain a “disability rating” to a new Veteran?*
“I’d show ‘em the charts bc that’s what they wd understand — the money.” 

Formula the “bean counters” use. 

If you lose an arm and they give you 80%, you can’t count the fingers bc you already have the arm.

The Vets don’t really ask that until they get their rating. You have to explain to them how the VA came to that conclusion. It’s based on the regulation. 

They might ask: “How come I only got 30% for my knee?”

I wd show them in the regulation and the table how it’s broken down, what you need to get to each % age. 


6. *In your mind, is there a relationship between “disability” and “health care”?*
He asked a clarifying question. Said they’re actually pretty fair. I don’t think the hospital looks at you have to be 100% for this, etc. (Later he said he does not think hospital treats you diff.)

The care that you receive, I don’t personally think the staff looks at you any differently. As far as the care itself, I don’t think there’s anything. 

*Does your disability rating impact your health care, coverage, the the types of things you can get from VA?*
Yes. I’m 100%. Get dental. 

Example: There is a clothing allowance. Can wear your slacks out from rubbing on (prosthesis, I think he’s suggesting). 

Special adapted housing or autos - there are rules the govt follows. 


7. *When it comes to your health care, what is the most important thing you need from the VA*?
“Communication. And feedback on tests and stuff like that. Because if you have an MRI or you’re being treated for something… “

Need feedback from tests. 

That’s where “Healthy Vet” comes in — you have read the notes and the CAT scans. (He does this.)

My last liver test and Googled it and got nervous, misinterpreted the readings — you have to be careful about that. 


Now I’d like to ask you how you manage information and tasks related to your health care. For each one, talk me through the steps you’d take. If there is something that you go online to complete, I may ask you to share your screen so I can see what you would do. *(10 minutes)*
*Tasks* Moderator should prompt about device usage if participant mentions digital tools or resources.

* *How would you reach out to your VA care team if you had a question?*
I would call the 273-7100 number and ask to have my primary care call me or whoever it is, if it’s one of the specialty clinics. 

Someone at clinic said I can send msgs thru MHV. I have never done this. 

At one time, I used to refill my prescriptions by calling that number ^ .

* *How would you refill a prescription you have with the VA?*
MHV. Just go to refill prescriptions. Can refill anything that if refillable. If expired, call the 7100 number (triage number), leave msg asking doc for refill. Never even talk to the doc. 

“With MHV, it’s so simple just to go in.” Tells you how many refills you have. “And they ship it right to your house.” 

*When mentioned we’d like to have him share screen:* 
“I’m a computer caveman.”

/*Steps:*/ 
* Typed in /myhealthyvet/ in browser bar for URL.
* Got Google results.
* Went to MHV. 
* Signed in with MHV. “I don’t have a card or…”
* Did forget password flow. Re: MHV: “It’s so simple to navigate.”
* Showed us the 4 boxes. “You can compose msgs and all that stuff.”
* Clicked on refill prescripts in box on MHV home.
* Selected the ones he needs to refill (6-8 of them). 
* Went to page 2 of prescript list. Submitted them.
* Went to tracking on left nav. “You can track your prescripts.”
* Showed us self-entered meds and supplements on left nav. Went to the page. He took that info to his primary care, and they entered the info. Taking these vitamins bc of gastric surgery. VA does not have the vitamins. “I gotta kick in some money.” 

A big plus of refilling prescripts - you don’t have to go to hospital and wait. You can msg your primary care if u c u r on last refill. Each doc prob has 1200 patients. They pass the info to your doc or (it goes) directly to your doc. 

He used the top navigation and dropdown to look for info. 

Showed us Blue Button, electronic sharing options. Can see doc notes there, and labs and test. 

I understand you can share the VA med stuff with outside primary care and vice versa. 

“I use the VA HC system for everything.” 

* (If applicable) *How would you go about checking the date of an upcoming medical exam you have for a disability claim?* (Note: this may have been a long time ago.)


* *How about an appointment for a yearly check up with your VA care team?*


* (If applicable) *Or a private provider (dentist, optometrist) outside the VA?*


* *How would you pay a VA health care bill, such as a copay?*


* *How would you request reimbursement from the VA for traveling to your health care appointments?*


* *How would you update the dependents on your VA benefits?*


* *How would you make updates to your health care benefits?*



### Branding and trust (5 minutes)

1. *How would you describe My HealtheVet to a fellow Veteran?* (Note if they mention MHV coordinators, newsletter or articles — something outside the patient portal).


2. *What about “VA health care”?*


3. *On a scale from 1-5, with 1 being very dissatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied, how satisfied are you with My HealtheVet?* 
5, “Very satis.” Being able to: 
* msg HC provides
* see notes
* see labs
* view appts >> put them in my day minder

“Refilling the prescripts is a biggie. You don’t have to go there and wait.”

“If the Veteran can manage it, it’s a good system.”

3.a. *What makes you rate it a [their rating]? What would make it better?*
See ^

4. *On a scale from 1-5, with 1 being very low, and 5 being very high, how would you rate your trust in My HealtheVet?* 
5 - definitely.

4.a. *What makes you rate it a [their rating]? What would make it better?*
“I think it’s secure. Your personal information is secure. That’s pretty much it.”

*Does it feel like all your info is up to date and accurate?*
Yes, even looking at the notes. Can wait 2-3 days from appt and go in and look. 

5. *If you have a question about your MHV account or something isn’t working, what do you do?*


6. *Have you ever been in touch with a My HealtheVet Coordinator?*


7. *How does My HealtheVet compare with other online health tools you’ve used?*



### My HealtheVet patient portal (15 minutes)
Let’s take a look at My HealtheVet together.
Moderator will ask participant to share screen if not already, or show logged in My HealtheVet account. *(5 minutes)*

1. *What do you use this website for the most?*


2. *What do you find the most valuable on this website?*


3. *What do you wish this website did that it doesn’t do right now?*
“Maybe a spouse’s portal. Without the spouse having access… Even though it’s a spouse, you still have to get the approval of the Veteran…”

“If MHV could do a limited portal or if there was a way for the Veteran to give approval for somebody to be able to access their med reports, reorder their prescriptions, or do whatever they can do, it would work good for caregivers” and especially “geriatric type Veterans.”

They could compose a msg and send to doc instead of tying up the doc on the phone. 

Call me if you have any other questions. 

4. *Outside of this website, are there other places you go to manage your VA health care?*


5. *When it comes to your My HealtheVet account, can you think of a time when you needed to give access to a family member or someone else?*
