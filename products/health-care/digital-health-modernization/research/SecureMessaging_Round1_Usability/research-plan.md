# Research Plan for Secure Messaging Usability Round 1
June 2022

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We developed a prototype of what Secure Messaging in MHV on VA.gov could look like on desktop and on a mobile device, which we are testing as part of this research.

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following objectives:
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	
The goals of this study are to:
- identify major usability or content issues with the current concept of secure messaging in MHV on VA.gov
- understand how Veterans use secure messaging


### Outcome
Results of this study will help us determine if our proof of concept is headed in the right direction, and if there are any big usability concerns that Veterans experience with the designs. This will inform later iterations of the design.

### Research questions
This research will help us answer:
- Are Veterans able to find who they want to message and understand who they are corresponding with?
- Based on the prototype do Veterans understand that secure messaging is not for use in emergencies? What would they do in an emergency?
- How do Veterans find and organize their messages?
- Are Veterans able to compose and reply to messages?


### Hypothesis
- Veterans will expect to be corresponding with a person through secure messaging.
- Veterans will understand that SM is a not a replacement for critical/emergency services.
- Veterans will have have widely varied methods for finding and organzing messages.
- Veterans will be able to send and reply to messages with minimal difficulty.


## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated usability studies using a high fidelity Sketch prototype. This round of research will test both the mobile user experience and the desktop user experience.


### Location
This research will be remote via Zoom.
