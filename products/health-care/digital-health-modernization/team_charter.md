# DRAFT Team Charter
ROUGH DRAFT of who is responsible for what and how we'll work together. This is intended as a conversation-starter, not as a mandate. At some point we'll formalize it by alignment if not consensus, and then it will help us answer as opposed to ask questions. 

# Values
I propose referring back to the USDS values (unless OCTO has already forked them) on the grounds that a Russian Doll of values frameworks will cause headaches without providing much guidance. 

# Practices
## Structuring the Week
- Core working hours 9:30 AM - 3:30 PM ET. Revisit if someone from another time zone joins. Plan to be available then. Everyone will obviously work more hours than that, but no one should care when as long as you're not @ing folks at 4 AM. 
- Product lead sets formal priorities weekly on Monday (if he's smart he'll have run them past affected people first the previous Friday). TBD if this is just a thing that happens at standup or a formal planning meeting. Probably the former for now and the latter if we grow and take on shipping software to production. 
- Tues-Fri morning standup in new faces / helps / events / interestings format. Aim for 5 mins, mic drop at 10, rotating moderator, moderator scribes in team Slack channel, no questions asked for anyone who skips live version and does it Slack instead. 
- Weekly retro Friday afternoon. Beer welcome. Rotating moderador. Moderator decides format. Action items tracked in a single, consistent format no matter what. 
- Weekly "demo" Friday. At first this coule be a narrative written by me about what we decided that week and what we need input on. I am 50-50 on this, it's a huge amount of work and if it becomes deeply includive and collaborative it will eat an entire day which might be worse than not dong it. When there is working software, demo that. 
- Weekly updates of team charter, team README and product startegy doc on Friday. Never let that stuff get more than one week stale unless we formally change the team charter. 
- Weekly or monthls meeting with steering committee (more on this below). 

## Time Off
- Mark leave on your VA calendar (we can see each-others' VA calendars). 
- Try to warn a week in advance for multi-day leave. 
- Try to warn a day in advance for one-day leave. 

## Meetings
- No rules for scheduling 1:1 conversations. Just do it. Conversations are not meetings. 
- Any meeting with >2 people needs **context**, an **agenda** and **desired outcomes** in the meeting invite. 
- If you are more than 20 hrs / week in meetings, bring it to the team as a problem. This is not effective. 

# Roles
## Steering Committee
- Lauren - Prioritize staffing and resolve conflicts / collaboration between Digital Health Modernization and other health crews
- Charles? - Advise on fit / lack thereof with OCTO's mission, vision and goals. 
- Chris? - Prioritize staffing and resolve conflicts between Health and non-health crews.

## Core Team
- Aryeh - Owns product strategy for how we will end up with a single, high-quality web version of appointments, prescriptions, messages and health data.
- Emily - Owns how we do exploratory research; does or delegates high-impact exploratory research; consults on evaluative research (ex., usability). Expected to influence product strategy because this helps us understand what the right problem is. 
- Leanna - Owns staffing and contracts. Expected to influence product strategy because if we can't get people we can't do it and if we can't give people the right incentives we can't do it well.  
- Meg - TBD by Meg! Of all of us, you have the most Job and are the only one who can see all the pieces of your job. 
- Engineer TBD - Owns architecture recommendations and agile estimation and planning for software changes. Expected to influence product strategy because if the strategy doesn't work for engineering, it's worth the pixels it's printed on. 
- Designer TBD (Meg? Bueller?) - Owns UX recommendations and evaluative research. Consults on generative research. Expected to influence product strategy because having a high-quality UX is a major reason we are doing this, and the designer gets to define high-quality. 

## Customer Advisory Board
Proposes adding a small group of Veterans and perhaps Caregivers to attend demos and give feedback on the regular. Needs fleshed out.
