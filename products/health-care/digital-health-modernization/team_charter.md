# DRAFT Team Charter
This needs to be re-written when we take on new team members. 

# Values
Refer back to the USDS values (unless OCTO has already forked them) on the grounds that a Russian Doll of values frameworks will cause headaches without providing much guidance. 

# Practices
## Structuring the Week
- Core working hours are
- Product lead sets formal priorities biweekly on
- Retro
- Demo
- Updates
- Steering meetings

## Time Off
- Mark leave on your personal calendar
- Send a "free" invite to Tracey Mulrooney for the days you are away
- Inform team members at least a week in advance
- Mark yourself as away "X" on slack

## Meetings
- No rules for scheduling 1:1 conversations. Just do it. Conversations are not meetings. 
- Any meeting with >2 people needs **context**, an **agenda** and **desired outcomes** in the meeting invite.
- If you are more than 20 hrs / week in meetings, bring it to the team as a problem.
