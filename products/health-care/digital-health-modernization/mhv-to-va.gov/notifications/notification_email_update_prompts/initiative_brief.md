# MHV on VA.gov Initiative Brief - Notification email update prompts
#### Overview

<details>
 
 *There is roughly a 1:many relationship between products and initiatives, or our attempts to improve a product/achieve Veteran outcomes. The same goes for product outlines and initiative briefs. This template can be used as product documentation for the Collaboration Cycle, especially when iterating an existing product. In addition, the Brief is an important communication tool within a team and between the team and Crew Chief/PO/other teams.*

- Product | My HealtheVet on VA.gov

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
  - 800,000 Veterans' VA.gov profile email address does not match their My HealtheVet email address where they have been receiving notifications from the My HealtheVet Classic notification system.  Another 66,000 have no email address in VA.gov Profile.  When the MHV Appointments, Messaging, Medications, Medical Records applications migrate their notifications to VA Notify later this year, these Veterans may not recieve important emails about their medical appointments, medications, messagages from providers, or medical images that are ready for download at their desired email address.
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
  - The My HealtheVet DBA recently ran a query to compare the two sets of email addresses.
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - It will ensure that Veterans reliably continue to receive their health notifications and know where to find related information on My HealtheVet.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
> ðŸ’¡ *VA.gov products measure success against Ease of use, Service Completion, Trust/Satisfaction, Health.*<sup>1</sup>\
> ðŸ’¡ *Identify balancing metrics to ensure you're not bringing about undesired outcomes.*

| Product KPI | Baseline | Target | Link to data source (e.g. GA, Domo) |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Veterans with mismatched VA Profile and MHV emails verify or change their email addresses | 0 | 800k | Data source is an SQL database query that cannot be linked. |
| Veterans without an email address in VA Profile add one | 66K | 0 | Data source is an SQL database query that cannot be linked. |

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Veterans may ignore the prompt.  We will monitor number of clicks on prompts, number of emails confirmed, added, and changed.
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Veterans may not understand why they need to confirm their address.   We will provide clear instructions explaining why this is important.
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
 - None noted
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
    - Veterans do not change or add email addresses before VA Notify migration is completed and do not receive notifications at the desired email address.
