# Release Plan - 3-tool integration on VA.gov, 2024

## Executive summary

It was decided on 4/11/2024 that the Phase 1 release of Medications would coincide with relase of a cohesive MHV-on-VA.gov portal experience. This will include the MHV-on-VA.gov landing page plus all three tools that will then be in Phase 1:
- Appointments
- Secure messages
- Medications

Medical records will continue to be available on MHV National Portal.

MHV-on-VA.gov UX will include:
- Secondary nav bar with 5 links (Home/landing page plus 4 tools)
- MHV-on-VA.gov Landing page links directly to VA.gov versions of tools
- Breadcrumbs on tool landing pages (only) will link back to MHV-on-VA.gov landing page
- The MHV-on-VA.gov landing page will include information about the new functionality on VA.gov

**Artifacts**:
- [IA (info architecture) Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1713450017254/6daf1f320cba1054fdfd840e4a7c881dda87120c?wid=0-1713461062826) covering changes for the integration

### Changes required within VA.gov tool applications
Required for integration go-live:
- Secure messaging side/secondary nav will need to change or be removed
- Tool landing pages have breadcrumbs with `< Back to My HealtheVet home` linking to the MHV-on-VA.gov landing page. ~~Child pages within apps should use dynamic < Back [to previous page H1] links.~~  
- Any link within a tool that cross-links directly to another tool in Phase 1 should point to VA.gov build (remove links to tools on the National Portal)
- MyHealtheVet secondary navigation component should display on the tools on VA.gov (SM, Appts, Meds) and their child pages
- All three tools on VA.gov need to provide an alert to patients with Oracle Health/Cerner facilities in their profiles that they may need to navigate to My VA Health to manage that care. (SM and Appts already have it as of 4/17/24)

Non-blocking content changes:
- Tool "About" pages will get content updates
- "Try me" banners on MHV classic will get content updates

### Critical path analysis

The MHV-on-VA.gov secondary navigation will have to go through the final stages of the Collab Cycle after it has been implemented by all teams: Staging Review, Contact Center Review, and Security & Readiness Review. Therefore, aside from a "go" decision on Medications Ph 1, the addition of secondary nav to the tool applications is the biggest dependency that will drive the release date for Medications Ph 1 and the MHV-on-VA.gov portal integration.

## Engineering notes on integration and release

### Secondary nav component

The MHV-on-VA.gov secondary navigation will be implemented by adding a shared component to each app that requries it. Cartographers will build this component. Placed at a particular location in the code, it will visually appear to be just below the primary navigation without any visible gap.

<img width="197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/4054752/30469bae-0134-45b6-8643-ae74f44f683d">

Tool teams can add the secondary nav component with a single line of code in each location where it is needed.
- Import the following: `import { MhvSecondaryNav } from '@department-of-veterans-affairs/mhv/exports';`
- Add the following element to add the secondary nav. This element should be added to the top of your application where it can take the entire width of the page: `<MhvSecondaryNav />`
- You will also need to include the following SASS file in your application's entry point (e.g. in your `app-entry.jsx` file): `import '~/platform/mhv/secondary-nav/sass/mhv-sec-nav.scss';`


### Feature Toggles

We will use [feature toggles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/cd3c891ea9fd80fb0023048dc24e3de3265b05d7/src/platform/utilities/feature-toggles/featureFlagNames.json#L105-L120) to release this integration.

This document must list all the toggles relevant to this integration release before we can do a final QA in Staging.

See Appendix for a list of toggles uncovered during discovery. It would be helpful for teams to update that table with information about any toggles relevant to this work.

#### Rolling out using feature toggles and/or deploys

1. Medications Ph1 enabled for 100% of users.
   - Toggle: `mhvMedicationsToVaGovRelease`
2. SM, Meds and Appts incorporate integration UX changes outlined in this document (above)
   - Toggle(s): _NEED toggle name_
3. Secondary nav enabled by its own feature toggle on Appointments, Medications, Secure messages, and the MHV-on-VA.gov landing page
   - Toggle: `mhvSecondaryNavigationEnabled`
4. MHV-on-VA.gov Landing page incorporates UX changes for integration (links to the tools on VA.gov (SM, Meds), content about Ph1 integration, etc.)
   - Toggles:
      - `mhvLandingPageEnableVaGovHealthToolsLinks`
      - `mhvHelpdeskInformationEnabled` (Help Desk component)
      - `mhvTransitionalMedicalRecordsLandingPage` (Medical records transitional page)
5. MHV Classic deploys try-me changes
   - Toggle: N/A

### Datadog analytics

Datadog Real User Monitoring (RUM) allows us to [specify names for click actions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/browser/tracking_user_actions/#declare-a-name-for-click-actions) using the `data-dd-action-name` attributes, and that's useful when auto-detected action name might be unclear or misleading.

#### Adding data-dd-action-name values

In the secondary nav, the values can follow a `ToolTitle - [Link Label]` format. So `data-dd-action-name="MHV Secondary Nav - Medications"` would be the attribute for the medications link in the MHV secondary nav component. 

For breadcrumbs, the format should be `AppTitle - Breadcrumb - [Breadcrumb Label]`. For the Medications tool, the breadcrumb pointing back to MHV-on-VA.gov home would be  `data-dd-action-name = "Medications - Breadcrumb - Back to My HealtheVet"`.

#### Testing/Verifying Datadog

- Enter `window.DD_RUM.getInternalContext()` in browser console to verify Datadog RUM is running
- Inject styles into the page to visualize elements that have `data-dd-action-name` attributes

We can use the [Stylus browser extension](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) to use inject custom CSS to visualize  `data-dd-action-name` attributes, as [platform docs for RUM recommend](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/main/platform/analytics/setup-real-user-monitoring.md#testing-for-exposed-content).

##### Stylus styles

The following will outline elements that have the `data-dd-action-name` attribute and display the value of the attribute on the page:

```
@-moz-document url-prefix("http://localhost:3001"), url-prefix("https://staging.va.gov/") {
:root {
    --hl-color: hsl(120, 77%, 39%);
    --bg-color: hsl(0, 0%, 14%);
}

[data-dd-action-name] {
    outline: 6px double var(--hl-color);
    position: relative;
}

[data-dd-action-name]::after {
    color: var(--hl-color);
    font: caption;
    content: '[dd-action-name]: "' attr(data-dd-action-name) '"';
    background-color: var(--bg-color);
    outline: 6px double var(--hl-color);
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: 6rem;
    padding: 0.5rem;
    min-width: 180px;
    z-index: 100;
}
}
```

## Release strategy

### QA approach

Testrail will be used to document the test cases and results from testing. There are two sections that will be used, one for the secondary nav component and another for the link changes. Once development is complete, QA will begin verifying and informing the team of any bugs that may arise from testing. 

Each team will QA their own implementation in Staging, including secondary nav component and link changes.

### Questions log
- Is any new handling required for Veterans with Oracle facilities?
  - No, beyond the alert mentioned above
- Should we suppress functionality on any tools for patients who ONLY have Cerner/OH facilities in their profile?
  * No, Kaitlin communicated on 4/22 [via Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04DRS3L9NV/p1713455728629549) that some facilities migrating to new EHR systems may have historic data on VistA and those patients need to be able to access both systems to retrieve their records. 

### Decisions log
| Date | Decider | Decision |
|-|-|-|
| 4/17/24 | Lauren & Kaitlin | unauth benefit hub pages will not be updated to direct users to MHV-on-VAgov for Phase 1; will revisit for Ph 2 |
| 4/17/24 | Lauren & Kaitlin | MyVA links to My HealtheVet National Portal will not be updated at this point, we will revisit after the initial integration and work with those teams more closely |
| 4/19/24 | Kaitlin | Leave link to "manage folders" under Messages box on landing page until we are able to do a redesign of landing page |
| 4/19/24 | Kaitlin + Mikki | Breadcrumbs on tool landing pages will link `< Back to My HealtheVet home` on VA.gov landing page, regardless of whether the user bypassed that page (i.e. cross-link or the secondary nav component); we want to drive more people to the landing page to discover additional tools and pages whenever possible). May use dynamic `< Back` link on subtasks and deeper pages of tools |
| 4/22/24 | Kaitlin | Do not suppress any functionality within tools for patients with ONLY Cerner/OH facilities in their profile, let alerts do their job if there is no data for certain patients |
| 4/22/24 | Laura, Kaitlin | Link text on MHV landing page for "Compose message" should be updated to "Start a new message"; "Medications and allergies" should be updated to "Review medications" (remove reference to "Allergies" until this is available on VA.gov, and then it should live under Medical Records) |
| 4/22/24| Kaitlin | Need to have a return link on My HealtheVet "home" page that sends users back to the National Portal landing page if they want to opt out|
| 4/22/24| Kaitlin | Focus on implementing secondary navigation on the "big four" tools, with a fast-follow to make decisions around implementation on other apps (i.e. 10-10EZR)|
| 4/22/24| Kaitlin | Implement a temporary landing page for medical records that will be linked to from the secondary navigation to provide a consistent experience for all four links. The temporary landing page will provide context for users and route them back to the National Portal to view/download their health records|
| 4/26/24| Kaitlin | Do not need to implement Cerner/OH gating alerts on the temporary medical records landing page|

### Existing feature toggles (as seen on frontend on 19 April)

The Appoinments tool has [27 `vaOnlineScheduling*` feature toggles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/cd3c891ea9fd80fb0023048dc24e3de3265b05d7/src/platform/utilities/feature-toggles/featureFlagNames.json#L204-L231), but is already live on VA.gov and so shouldn't need to add or flip on any feature toggles.
