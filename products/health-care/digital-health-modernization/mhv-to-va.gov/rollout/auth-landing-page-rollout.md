# My HealtheVet on VA.gov: Authenticated landing page rollout plan

Last Updated: 4/11/2023

## Overview
This document describes the phased rollout for the new My HealtheVet authenticated landing page on VA.gov. The authenticated landing page functions as a front door to other applications and content, whether hosted on VA.gov or in the existing My HealtheVet portal. As individual My HealtheVet tools are migrated from the existing My HealtheVet portal to MHV on VA.gov, this authenticated landing page will be updated to direct users to the correct version of each tool. Applications will connect to the landing page by the time they each reach Phase 2. 

## Objectives
The authenticated landing page will follow the phased rollout approach followed by other VA.gov products and features. In doing so, we intend to:
1. Validate the persistence of authenticated sessions between VA.gov and the existing My HealtheVet portal;
2. Validate that analytics tools are correctly capturing user behavior so as to generate accurate metrics;
3. Observe unmoderated production traffic to identify unexpected or unintended behavior;
4. Gather qualitative feedback from production users; and
5. Identify opportunities for incremental improvements using quantitative and qualitative data generated from the phased rollout.

## Rollout Phases
