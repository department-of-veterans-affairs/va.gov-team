## Agenda

   - MR generative research that kicked off this morning
   - Any updates from other teams that we should be aware of
   - High-level lessons learned from immunization work 


## Notes
**Secure Messaging**

- Coulton: Provides updates on the goals of the study. Threaded messages, folders, reply.  It’s focused on the prototype that we created and the usability of the prototype 

- Alex: You should talk to Jen Ecker. She did a lot of the work personally on secure messaging. 
  - It was interesting to see how people used folders  
  - Not a lot of people used folders - but the people that did were power users 
  - Jump into the Mobile app Slack channel if we have any questions and research can be found in the research repo 


**Medical Records** 

- Gave update by Robyn and Jonathan (shared goals and how the first session went this morning)

- Alex: Interesting to see if we really get people who use screen readers. That is super interesting what people consider assistive technology, etc 

- Alex: we are going to be doing a blind and low vision study entirely. It will be interesting to see who we get as participants. Like, I am a developer but also a screen reader user

- Also, Mobile app will do UAT around the pharmacy - we really enjoined working on the pharmacy with Maureen and Dr…

- Jonathan: Asked about who worked on Immunization. DF is rolling off mid-Nov so reach out to Ester before (Jonathan) Will look for any research around immunization in research repo
