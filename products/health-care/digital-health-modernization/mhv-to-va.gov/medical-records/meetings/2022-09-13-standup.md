# 2022-09-13 Daily Standup

## Attendees
- Marci McGuire
- Jonathan Nelson
- Robyn Singleton
- Lexi Wunder

## Notes
- Not done with interviews yet
- One today
- One this Thursday
- Trying to reach out to Ken Graham
- Work in next PI
  - Medical Records work will start next PI.  Our understanding is that there won't be any devs dedicated to this initially
  - Starting in October, we hope to be able to start prototyping designs
  - Doing that without the involvement of dev is probably not a good idea
  - Eric is probably meant to fill that role
  - Iterative prototyping and building mentality
  - Pulling some medical records data by the end of the PI would be ideal
  - Sure be a team dedicated to each of those teams
  - Will Robyn be working on Medical Records only?  TBD
