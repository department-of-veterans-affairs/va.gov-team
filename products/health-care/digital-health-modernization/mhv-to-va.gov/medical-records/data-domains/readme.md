# Medical Records Domain Briefs

## Overview
As part of the MHV on va.gov effort, OCTO conducted research to understand what would be needed to transition and modernize medical records.
* From Sept-Oct 2022, discovery research was conducted with internal subject matter experts and stakeholders to better understand the current state of MHV and policies surrounding medical records. [See discovery research report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/dda21cb2156ad04c2709819d014c36cba455257f/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/research/2022-09-informational-interviews/research-report.pdf)
* From Nov-Dec 2022, generative research was conducted with Veterans to better understand how they perceive and use medical records in MHV. [See generative research report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/9edca0cf4515c39a66d84fa5ff988a1cc83d9018/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/research/2022-10_Generative-research/2022-11-medical-records-readout.md)

Based on those efforts and continued desk research, the team created the following briefs for each domain in medical records. Each brief includes
* A description
* Use cases
* Requirements for the first iteration of that domain on va.gov
* A link to low fidelity mobile-based screen designs
* Associated research to date 
* Outstanding questions that need to be answered
* A detailed analaysis of data fields
