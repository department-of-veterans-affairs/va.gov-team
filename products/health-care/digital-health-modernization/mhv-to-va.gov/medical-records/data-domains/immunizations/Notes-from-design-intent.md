# Design Intent
**January 9, 2023**


Jonathan provides brief overview of project, wireframes, and Vaccines screen. 

## Questions/ Comments: 

Allison: Working w/ SM, trying to align w/ Check-in Team/ VAOS look and feel. Links the ticket to our Design Intent ticket. May want to follow suit, or maybe not. 

Anything not in Design System - make sure goes through contributing to DS. 

Share button - going to be pdf? URL? 

Jonathan: If had capability to share, would be electronically sharing. Would need workflow. Almost navigate to form - could be broken up into diff screens. 

Allison: Might want to consider verbiage being different. "Share" - could be share on social media. This is more like "send link to email." Mental model might be different. 

Shane: Could learn through testing - instead of download to print, people might not know how to save pdf from print dialogue. Would need to be tested. 

Jonathan: If just have download, still have print button? 

Shane: That's the design challenge for you - have both download and print button? 

Allison: If search a form, have download option. Don't know if use print anywhere. 

Matt: Have iconography for both, but don't know if have consistent usage. 

Allison: Claims just worked on this, but didn't see print a lot. 

Matt: Print VA Vaccines - similar to [this pattern](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/multiple-responses#how-to-design-and-build---add-item). 

Matt: Was experimental request recently for list display. Might be worth looking at as well. 

Allison: For share, worked on "share the page" or something similar... Can't remember, might not be applicable. Might have been to copy a link rather than kicking off a form. Mikki can't recall either. Allison will dig to see if can find. 

Sticky footer - talked about sticky navigation in past. Accessibility concerns, but feedback has some stickiness. Back to top as well. Need to be aware of other components that have stickiness.

Matt: Think about filtering/ sorting that list. 

Jonathan: Any examples on VA.gov? 

Matt: Iterating on some of those things to share back with SM, will also share w/ Jonathan. Answer is no - Design System is doing applications that are differnet than what have seen before. New challenges that aren't currently solved by the system. 

Sara: Sense of longest list of vaccines a user might have? 

Jonathan: No. 

Sara: Vaccine flow - seems like doing a lot of research and thinking. Nothing really to add. 

Brian: Might be cumbersome for tab stops depending on number of vaccines. Drop to view details might be better for accessibility/keyboard interaction. Depends on what metadata have to display for each vaccine - e.g., date, location. Sticky footer - makes nervous. Would need to test. Going to send link to something gov.uk did looking into sticky elements - found wasn't worth it. Print vs. download discussion - trouble verifying, but somewhere in head is idea that when print a pdf, open print dialoguea nd save pdf - version of pdf that gets saved strips out accessibility functionality. Going to verify if that's true. 

Shira: I think that's true. Another team's solution - download text files. Have alternative paths. 

Sara: VA Vaccines - means not pulling in DoD or self entered vaccines? 

Jonathan: Yes. Could be addressed by breaking up on page, but could add issue w/ pagination. Maybe landing page.
