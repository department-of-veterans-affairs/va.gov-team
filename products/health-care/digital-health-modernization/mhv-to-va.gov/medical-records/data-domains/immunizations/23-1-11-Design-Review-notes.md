# Notes from Design Review: 

- Lauren asked: Vaccines as sub to lab/tests? Or equivalent in IA? 
- Having print button - policy/ req? Could someone point us in direction of this policy? 
  - Patty: can't point to policy. 

- Beneficial to view series of vaccines? 
  - Patty things yes -> e.g., COVID vaccines

- If have something due -> having trigger
  - Patty: Just discontinued wellness reminders on MHV. Because no one wanted to maintain, inaccuracies in configuration and reporting. No one to own.
    
- Bresha: Curious about VA vaccines under labs/testâ€¦ 
  - Mistake. 

- Print/download -> had national standards  (Kim Nazi)
  - Bhanu - has old documentation. Not up to date - re: labs/ tests and Notes

- Ro has some documentation re: business logic on this. Ro will follow up with Kim for this document and will report back
  - Lauren: have print in appts, so as standard would have here as well

- Share: Policy/ stored knowledge re: sharing single record
  - Lauren wants to enable distinct sharing
  - Ro: confusing when talking about sharing. Means diff things. In MHV - have EHR Sharing (working with Release of Information office - they own; MHV enables)
  - Direct sharing - pilot. In prod, but for very limited users. 
  - Cerner had convo about sharing - provide option to email out spec things. Frowned upon by some groups, but if Veteran owns it, can do whatever want.
  - Frowned upon by Security and Privacy (we think - need to ask Carnetta)
  - Donna Alexander - Cerner contact who also might know more; Alexander, Donna <Donna.Alexander@Cerner.com>
  - HIMS - release of information. No limitation on what Veteran wants to share. 
  - No system exists today that allows that. 
  - Ro: I think it was a security issue - Carnetta would know more, but that is why we don't have that ability. DIRECT was going to go to specific providers via an approved exchange.
