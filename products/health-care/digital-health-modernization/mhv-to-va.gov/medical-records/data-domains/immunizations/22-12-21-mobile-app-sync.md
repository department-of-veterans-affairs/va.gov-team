# Mobile Flagship App Sync

Last updated: December 21, 2022


- What is the thinking around terminology “vaccine” vs “immunizations”?
- Alex: Was ~2 yrs ago; led by Melly. Happened during time when needed vaccination to prove (e.g., COVID)
Ashley Matthews involved - still around. 
Could explore more -> not dictated by VA policy. 


- Did you all consider self-reported vaccines?
- Alex: Was about proof - showing you were vaccinated against COVID. 


- Lessons learned or anything we should be aware of?
- Technical considerations? 
- Alex: Don’t recall. 
-
- Laws/policy/business considerations? 
- Alex: Disclosure/ privacy -> first iteration about proving to another human that had vaccine. 
Ways to bubble up things? Skewing towards respecting people’s privacy, not disclosing.
On front - doesn’t say “vaccine status - double boosted”. Not about individual person’s info, just links to vaccines. 
Most places gated - looks like solo app but connected to other things. Slows things down/ impedes additional features.  

- Anyone recommend coordinating with or talking to? 
- Alex: Keep Matt Hall in loop - could direct to others. Possibly Miko. Also Ashley Matthews -  might know where other things exist. 


- Related ^ any “We wish we did this” but…
- Alex: Cool to add to phone wallet (e.g., put vaccination status in wallet)

- Anything recall re: sharing/ printing? 
- Alex: Not sure. Use case for this -> holding phone in front of face to show. Or needing to know date of vaccination. 

- Conversation re: medical terms vs. lay terms for vaccines? 
- Alex: Information provided = what get from API. e.g., know Moderna (structured data), other data fields are string. Same with notes. 


- Do we have access to design file? https://www.figma.com/file/K9hthKiVlGNihyPkyIEq3e/VAMobile-Health1.0-Shipped-%F0%9F%9A%A2?node-id=502%3A20 

- Worth doing regular sync? 
- Alex: Syncs important, particularly as products get more complex. But value of giving status updates - helpful? Slack updates better?
