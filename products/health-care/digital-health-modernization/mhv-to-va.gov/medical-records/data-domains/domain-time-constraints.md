# Time constraints for each domain to prevent latency issues

## Background

To improve UX associated with MR on web and VAHB, we plan to limit how many days worth of data will show/load intially when a user arrives in that domain.

UX goals we need to meet before the OH integration Dec deadline.

Help users understand they can view 90 days worth of data at a time for:
Lab and test results
Care notes and summaries?
Help users use blue button/continuity of card document when appropriate
Help users filter data by 90 days
Note: PRs already exist to add a 90 day filter for web and VAHB mobile app experiences. This ticket is to iterate upon these designs.
