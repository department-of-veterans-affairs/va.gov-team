## Functional (How it works)

| 1/12/23  | Patty Henry          | Update: We will NOT be moving forward with directly sharing medical records via MHV or VA.gov per the conversation with Patty Henry in today's Jira Backlog Grooming meeting for the following reasons:| Because users own this information, they are free to download/print their records to send to anyone they choose, using their own delivery methods. The Legacy feature, "Send My VA Health Summary" was a pilot feature that has been decommissioned. This feature is owned by Veterans Health Information Exchange (VHIE) program, not MHV.|
