## Description of domain
This brief describes a page from which users can download a Blue Button report (name subject to change) or a VA Health Summary report.

## Use Cases

Things to think about that inform use cases: 
- Privacy
  - VA Health Summary and Blue Button Report contain private data protected by federal privacy protections.
  - Users need to be aware that once they choose to save, print, or download their VA Health Summary data, it may no longer be protected by federal privacy protections.
  - Users need to be made aware that it is their responsibility to keep their health data safe once they download, print, or save it.

- Data Sources
  - Data for the VA Health Summary report is derived from My HealtheVet eVault
  - Data for the Blue Button Report is derived from VistA, and also includes self-reported data.
  - The user owns their health data and is entitled to have access to it.

- Data Timeliness
  - The Blue Button Report selection/generation page displays several notices related to the timeliness of the data.  Some test data and VA Electronic Health Record data is only available after 36 hours, whereas Covid-19 test results are available immediately.
  - VA Health Summary Data may only be updated once every 24 hours.  This is currently achieved via an update button on the My VA Health Summary generation page.

**Common Use Cases**

What do people want to use their downloadable reports for? 
- To view current and/or past health information
- To share health informaton with HCPs to ensure HCP understands their health history
- To keep their own hard copy of their health information
- To save their own digital copy of their health information
- To take a digital copy of their health information to a HCP on a thumb drive or other storage device

## Research to date

### Findings from card sort

_Cards included:_ 
  - Labs/ test cards: Antibody test, Blood sugar tests, Blood test, COVID-19 test result, Lab/ test results, Pathology results
  - Imaging cards: Dental x-rays, MRI results, Radiology results and images, Ultrasound results

_Findings:_
- Labs/ test category was the most common category, and roughly 52% of all cards were grouped in that category across the 13 participants
- Imaging cards were combined with labs/ test cards approximately 48% of the time (25 out of 52).

### Findings from comparative analysis
[Comparative analysis of popular patient portals](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1659473055858/08b0e54ba40761f0893fc1c13454882a645e47ff?sender=u71ad98f94f5263595f9a4390) including Cerner's patient portal, Kaiser Permanente, BlueCross BlueShield, MyHealth powered by Epic, One Medical, Aetna OneRecord, and Apple Health, revealed that medical imaging and imaging reports are grouped with lab/test results.

These standards originated during the Obama administration. MyHealtheVet used to get measured against these standards, and while they no longer do, these standards are still considered best practice and pertain to viewing, downloading, and transmitting.


## Questions to answer
- How can we make the BB download page as efficient as possible?
- How closely do users associate the more comprehensive health report with the Blue Button name/brand? Is there a more descriptive name?
- Are users able to easily discern any differences between a My VA Summary report vs. a VA Blue Button report?
- What information can we provide up front to help users quickly identify the type of report best fits their needs?  Examples - a comparison matrix showing which option can be customized, which has the option to download XML, which contains DoD information, etc.
- Is it necessary to have user documentation if our testing finds that the tools are intuitive?
- What options are available for customizing the layout of each of these reports?
- Who do we need to get feedback from? 
   - Dr. Lorainne Josephs, Dr. Neil Evans, Theresa Hancock

# Appendix

## Detailed analysis of existing functionality

### UX considerations
- In the MyHealth*e*Vet site, the links for reports falls under Personal Information, which is not particularly intuitive.  In the new experience, these reports will be located within Medical Records as they are a form of medical record.

### When to show the downloadable reports section
- When a user with VA health care is logged in with an valid credential for MHV

### Where do downloadable reports fit within IA?
- In the MyHealth*e*Vet site, the links for reports falls under the Personal Information grouping, which is not particularly intuitive.  In the new experience, the current plan is to include reports within the Medical Records grouping as they are a form of medical record.

### Downloadable reports pages
This document describes the pages in the new health portal on VA.gov that will give users the ability to generate and download two different types of health record reports -- a *VA Health Summary* -- a summarized health record report that follows a pre-defined format, and a more comprehensive report currently referred to as a *VA Blue Button Report*, which can be customized to include or exclude certain pieces of health information.
- [Downloadable Reports Landing Page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/downloadable-reports/downloadable-reports.md#1-downloadable-reports-landing-page)
- [Blue Button Report generation page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/downloadable-reports/downloadable-reports.md#2-blue-button-report-generation-page)
- [Blue Button Download Results Page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/downloadable-reports/downloadable-reports.md#3-blue-button-download-results-page)
- [VA My Health Summary generation page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/downloadable-reports/downloadable-reports.md#4-va-my-health-summary-generation-page)
- [VA My Health Summary Results Page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/downloadable-reports/downloadable-reports.md#5-va-my-health-summary-results-page)

#### 1. Downloadable Reports Landing Page | [MyHealtheVet Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69174644/217010319-28687c62-d1ca-4c95-a1ba-46243b88d565.png)
This page provides the ability for the user to select which type of report they wish to generate.   It also provides a brief overview of each.  In the current MHV site, the description of the Blue Button Report on the landing page fails to point out that the report is highly customizable.  It is not until the user accesses the report generation page that they see the options.  

##### How this page and navigation differs from the MyHealth*e*Vet Download My Data landing page
MyHealtheVet provides four primary links in the left navigation:
- VA Blue Button Report
- VA Health Summary
- VA Medical Images and Reports 
- Electronic Record Sharing Options

The information archicture strategy for downloadable reports at the time of this writing is to make VA Medical Images and Reports a subset of Labs and Tests rather than a subset of downloadable reports (referred to as Download My Data on MyHealth*e*Vet).  This approach is supported by tree testing, card sorting exercises, and user interviews where users indicated that they expected to find imaging results and reports with their lab and test results.

Electronic Record Sharing Options is a way to opt in or out of sharing one's electronic health record through the Veterans Health Information Exchange.   At the time of this writing, the information architecture strategy is to integrate this preference into the VA.gov Profile preferences, similar to Secure Messaging preferences, so that we can work toward encapsulating all user preferences in one place on VA.gov.

In summary, the downloadable reports landing page in the new experience need only give options for generating VA Blue Button Report and VA Health Summary report pages.
