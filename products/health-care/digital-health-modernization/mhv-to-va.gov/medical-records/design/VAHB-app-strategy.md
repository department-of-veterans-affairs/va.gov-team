# UX Strategy: Medical Records in VA Health Benefits (VAHB) app and VA.gov

**Date: 12/1/25**

_Note: This work is ongoing and will be updated as needed._ 

This document sets out to clarify and document the UX strategy for medical records within the VAHB app and VA.gov website. 

### Background 

**The current VAHB app includes:** 
- Lab and test results 
- Allergies
- Vaccines

**Missing from app:** 
- Vitals
- Care summaries and notes 
- Health conditions 

**Additional missing from the VAHB app:** 

The Blue Button (BB) and Continuity of Care Document (CCD) will permanently be excluded from the VAHB app. 

**Other considerations:** 

The VAHB app will include the radiology report/interpretation. However, images will not be available on the VAHB app as some results involve thousands of images that need to be downloaded as a zip file. 

### Goals/Questions 

**Should we pull these remaining domains into VAHB?**  
- Vitals
- Care summaries and notes
- Health conditions

**If so, what form should that take? (Types of VAHB mobile UX modalities)**
- Native
- WebView
- Authenticated browser experience via SSO
- External link

### Overview recommendation/strategy  

**Lab and test results**, **Allergies**, and **Vaccines** should be retained within the app.

**Medical imaging results** should be separated from **Lab and test results** as a distinct category.

**Care summaries and notes** should be added.

Open questions

Do we include Vitals and Health conditions?
