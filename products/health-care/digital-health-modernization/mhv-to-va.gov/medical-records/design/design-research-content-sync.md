# Medical Records design, research, and content sync notes
This doc has notes, questions, and action items during our sync.

## [Date]
[notes]

## 8/27/25
### Agenda
- Continuity of Care work
- Release of information (ROI) work

### Continuity of Care work
**Notes**
- XML because providers use XML, so easier to share with your new provider
- From Carnetta: The reason why is that when we implemented the CCD, the BB .txt format was not widely used. Therefore, My HealtheVet classic offered the CCD .pdf and the “interactive” on line display

**Ideas**
- Order: XML, PDF, HTML
- Add file type to beginning of link

**Questions**
- Is the use case that the Veteran shares records w/ external EHR systems?
- So the problem we're solving is providing additional formats to download CCD besides XML?
   - Yes
- Is the use case that the Veteran shares records w/ external EHR systems?   

### Release of information (ROI) work
**Notes**
- SM is the preferred way to request records
- PO sync 8/27 on this work
- Timeline for this is ASAP because we've inadvertently removed functionality from Classic MHV

**Questions**
- Are all patients by default associated with an ROI triage group?
- What happens if associated with multiple facilities? Do they get multiple ROI triage group options?
- Confirm: Do they need to send the form? Or can they simply sign the electronic signature?
- Can they submit a request for partial records?
   - Ex: Only records associated with a certain facility 
- What if anything can we communicate to users about what to expect after they send off that message? Will they get a response in SM? Will they get a response via email/mail?
- Any sense of how long it takes to go from SM request to records being in the Veteran's hands?
- How does cross-facility coordination happen?

**Action items (AIs)**
- [ ] Robyn will kick off questions to Sylvia and Tracey, will cc' Jonathan, Tori, Marci, Becky.
