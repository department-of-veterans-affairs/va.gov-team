## Overview 

This document lays out the requirements for medical records on VA.gov. It is broken out by data domains and phases. We expect additional functionality to be iteratively added to the tool over time during the phased rollout. 

Medical records v1.0 consists of 6 data domains. 
* Allergies and reactions
* Vaccines
* Health conditions
* Vitals
* Care summaries and notes
  * Progress notes
  * Discharge summaries
* Lab and test results
  * Lab results (Chem/Hem)
  * Pathology reports
  * Microbiology reports
  * Radiology reports
 
**Key documents**
* [VistA -> PHR/MHV mapping document](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Medical%20Records/data%20mapping/MHV%20Documentation/MHV_PHR_API_to_FHIR_mapping.xlsx?d=w076667839ced465ca2506582e76618fb&csf=1&web=1&e=DFvMpe)

| The product will have a left navigation bar |  The introduction of a second domain necessitates secondary navigation  |
| There will be three primary pages: A landing page, a list of entries, details about each entry |       |
| We will initially launch the product with only one domain, allergies. |     |
| The landing page will be at the URL …/my-health/medical-records/ | | 
| The landing page will list all available domains, give a short descriptive blurb about each, and provide a link to the list view for each |   |
| Any printed or downloaded page will include two patient identifiers - name and date of birth |    |
| For Phase 0, we will only make downloads available as PDF. Downloading a TXT version will be a fast follow once all domains are in Phase 0. | Given the web version is fully 508 compliant, it will be the view that we recommend for all users to primarily access, including those who would need a TXT download rather than a PDF download  |\
| A user will be presented information on the consequences of downloading on a public computer |Many users may download their information on a public computer, and therefore, they should understand the PHI implications of this action.|

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------| 
| The Allergies domain name was updated to Allergies and reactions. | This was a recommendation based on SME feedback. Allergies and reactions captures the full breadth of the data entered into this section of information. Reactions refers to information such as an adverse drug reaction. |
| The list view will present each allergy in a card format. That card will include both the allergy logged and the date it was entered into the EHR by a provider. | Allergies may not be deduplicated across VistA sites. In order to make sure each card in the list view is unique and therefore accessible, we must include a second identifier. We chose date entered as that second identifier.    |
| The field formerly called reaction was updated to be called Signs and symptoms. | This was based on feedback from SMEs. Signs and symptoms is the terminology for this field used in the After Visit Summary. It also differentiates this field from the title of this entire section - Allergies and reactions |
| We will not include a link to send a SM if allergies info is incorrect. Instead, we will just tell a patient to inform their provider at their next appointment. | Based on feedback from Dr. Josephs, updating allergies information can wait until a patient's next appointment. This is also thought to decrease unecessary SMs.|

| The field for reactions will not be displayed as part of the vaccine data in production.                                  | After significant research and review of data, it was determined that CPRS 32b, which removed the reaction field from vaccines, was released Sep 29, 2022 and all sites (except those on Cerner) should have installed it by Dec 16, 2022.  This change made recording reactions as part of the vaccines record obsolete, and as a result, Dr. Josephs recommended that we not display it.  
| The domain name was will be Vaccines, not Immunizations| This was approved by SMEs. Vaccines is more recongizable and plain language than immunizations. |
| The vaccines list view will incldue a link to allergies. | Based on SME input, reactions and allergies to vaccines are typically documented in the allergies list.|
| The list view will present each vaccine in a card format. That card will include both the vaccine logged and the date it was received as entered into the EHR by a provider. | A user may get the same vaccine yearly, and therefore we need a second identifier to differenitate. Given a user cannot receive the same vaccine on the same day, date received fits the bill. |
| The following data can be shown to users once verified by KBS and if they are available. They do not need to be included at launch into phase 0: Vaccine series information, Manufacturer, Site (such as left arm), Vaccine status (such as completed) and Lot number. | These are important pieces of data for patients, but have not been shown in MHV in the past. Therefore, we must first verify their accuracy with KBS.|
| The following field should not be shown to users: CPT code, who administered the code | After discussion, the SMEs determined they were not needed for patient view and may cause confusion. A user would still be able to get this information by asking their provider directly or submitting a full records request.|

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|We will call this section of the record health conditions. |This section has been referred to as problem list in the past, but framing as problems is thought to be negative and also not incredibly plain language, as many things could be considered problems, but not all of them are actually health issues that would be logged|
|We will only show health conditions that have a status of Active. | Health conditions have not always been logged by providers in a consistent manner. Some providers have used health conditions to keep track of possible issues a patient is facing, but are not confirmed. These have been deemed inactive. Seeing these in the list as inactive gives the impression that a patient may have once had this issue when they never did - it was just suspected. Therefore, including inactive could be confusing. Therefore, just like MHV classic, we will only ever show active conditions.|
|In the list view, each card will show enough information about a health condition to consider that entry unique. We believe name and date entered suffices. | Health conditions may not be deduplicated across VistA sites. Therefore, just name may not be unique.|
|The following fields will not be shown to users: Clinical status, Date and time condition started, ICD type + code, Verification Status, Date and time condition abated | SMEs gave input that these fields are not necessary to show to patients and may not be reliable.|
|The following fields will not be shown to users at first, but may be if verified: Verification Status| SMEs gave input that this field may be helpful, but since it is not shown in MHV today, needs to be verified.|
