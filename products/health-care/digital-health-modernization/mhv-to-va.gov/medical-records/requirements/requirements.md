## Overview 

This document lays out the requirements for medical records on VA.gov. It is broken out by data domains and phases. We expect additional functionality to be iteratively added to the tool over time during the phased rollout. 

Medical records v1.0 consists of 6 data domains, as well as a way to download all records and opt into or out of sharing your health data to the Veterans Health Information Exchange. 
* Allergies and reactions
* Vaccines
* Health conditions
* Vitals
* Care summaries and notes
  * Progress notes
  * Discharge summaries
  * Consult results
* Lab and test results
  * Lab results (Chem/Hem)
  * Pathology reports
  * Microbiology reports
  * Radiology reports
* Download all records (fka Blue Button)
* Medical records settings
 
**Key documents**

| Decision | Reasoning |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------| 
| The product will have a left navigation bar |  The introduction of a second domain necessitates secondary navigation  |
| There will be three primary pages: A landing page, a list of entries, details about each entry |       |
| We will initially launch the product with only one domain, allergies. |     |
| The landing page will be at the URL …/my-health/medical-records/ | | 
| The landing page will list all available domains, give a short descriptive blurb about each, and provide a link to the list view for each | We had considered retiring this page post phase 0, but research showed that is is quite useful to help Veterans understand where to find their informaiton. It should not be removed.  |
| Any printed or downloaded page will include two patient identifiers - name and date of birth |    |
| For Phase 0, we will only make downloads available as PDF. Downloading a TXT version will be a fast follow once all domains are in Phase 0. | Given the web version is fully 508 compliant, it will be the view that we recommend for all users to primarily access, including those who would need a TXT download rather than a PDF download  |\
| A user will be presented information on the consequences of downloading on a public computer |Many users may download their information on a public computer, and therefore, they should understand the PHI implications of this action.|
| Health summary, aka CCD, will not be included in the first version of medical records on VA.gov | Research showed that there was a lot of confusion between Blue Button and the Health Summary. There is also signficant overlap between the two documetnation outputs - essentially, Health summary is just a Blue Button report limited to the past 180 days (this needs fact checked) put into the CCD format. To simplify, we received approval from Bresha Lipscomb on March 28, 2023 to not include the ability to download the CCD health summary on the first version of MR on VA.gov. Before health summary is incorporated into MHV, it should be clearly called a continuity of care document, and it should be clearly outlined how and when to use this document compared to downloading all records. This should be considered before moving to Phase 4.|

| The Allergies domain name was updated to Allergies and reactions. | This was a recommendation based on SME feedback. Allergies and reactions captures the full breadth of the data entered into this section of information. Reactions refers to information such as an adverse drug reaction. |
| The list view will present each allergy in a card format. That card will include both the allergy logged and the date it was entered into the EHR by a provider. | Allergies may not be deduplicated across VistA sites. In order to make sure each card in the list view is unique and therefore accessible, we must include a second identifier. We chose date entered as that second identifier.    |
| The field formerly called reaction was updated to be called Signs and symptoms. | This was based on feedback from SMEs. Signs and symptoms is the terminology for this field used in the After Visit Summary. It also differentiates this field from the title of this entire section - Allergies and reactions |
| We will not include a link to send a SM if allergies info is incorrect. Instead, we will just tell a patient to inform their provider at their next appointment. | Based on feedback from Dr. Josephs, updating allergies information can wait until a patient's next appointment. This is also thought to decrease unecessary SMs.|

| Decision | Reasoning |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------| 
|The field for provider comments will not be displayed for vaccines.|Decision made on 8/15 via email following discussion with PCP SME workgroup. Discovered the field was used only 8% of the time, there was no uniformity as to how it was used and there was a concern that the information may cause more confusion than add value for the Veteran.| 
| The field for reactions will not be displayed as part of the vaccine data in production.                                  | After significant research and review of data, it was determined that CPRS 32b, which removed the reaction field from vaccines, was released Sep 29, 2022 and all sites (except those on Cerner) should have installed it by Dec 16, 2022.  This change made recording reactions as part of the vaccines record obsolete, and as a result, Dr. Josephs recommended that we not display it.  
| The domain name was will be Vaccines, not Immunizations| This was approved by SMEs. Vaccines is more recongizable and plain language than immunizations. |
| The vaccines list view will incldue a link to allergies. | Based on SME input, reactions and allergies to vaccines are typically documented in the allergies list.|
| The list view will present each vaccine in a card format. That card will include both the vaccine logged and the date it was received as entered into the EHR by a provider. | A user may get the same vaccine yearly, and therefore we need a second identifier to differenitate. Given a user cannot receive the same vaccine on the same day, date received fits the bill. |
| The following data can be shown to users once verified by KBS and if they are available. They do not need to be included at launch into phase 0: Vaccine series information, Manufacturer, Site (such as left arm), Vaccine status (such as completed) and Lot number. | These are important pieces of data for patients, but have not been shown in MHV in the past. Therefore, we must first verify their accuracy with KBS.|
| The following field should not be shown to users: CPT code, who administered the code | After discussion, the SMEs determined they were not needed for patient view and may cause confusion. A user would still be able to get this information by asking their provider directly or submitting a full records request.|

| Decision | Reasoning |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|We will call this section of the record health conditions. |This section has been referred to as problem list in the past, but framing as problems is thought to be negative and also not incredibly plain language, as many things could be considered problems, but not all of them are actually health issues that would be logged|
|We will only show health conditions that have a status of Active. | Health conditions have not always been logged by providers in a consistent manner. Some providers have used health conditions to keep track of possible issues a patient is facing, but are not confirmed. These have been deemed inactive. Seeing these in the list as inactive gives the impression that a patient may have once had this issue when they never did - it was just suspected. Therefore, including inactive could be confusing. Therefore, just like MHV classic, we will only ever show active conditions.|
|In the list view, each card will show enough information about a health condition to consider that entry unique. We believe name and date entered suffices. | Health conditions may not be deduplicated across VistA sites. Therefore, just name may not be unique.|
|The following fields will not be shown to users: Clinical status, Date and time condition started, ICD type + code, Verification Status, Date and time condition abated | SMEs gave input that these fields are not necessary to show to patients and may not be reliable.|
|The following fields will not be shown to users at first, but may be if verified: Verification Status| SMEs gave input that this field may be helpful, but since it is not shown in MHV today, needs to be verified.|

|We will call this section of the record care summaries and notes. |This section has been referred to as VA Admission and Discharges and VA Notes in Blue Button download on MHV.  This section will include progress notes, admission and discharge summaries and consultation notes. In the future if other note types are determined valuable we will reevalutate if they should be included here.|
|Notes and admission and discharge summaries can have multiple addenda. Addenda will be presented as part of the original note to which they were added.|We discussed addenda with the SMEs and agreed that they should be treated as they are today in MHV.  When a provider writes an addendum today they are related to the context of the note. The unstructured text of the original progress note includes an alert at the top that says, “This note has addenda” and then the addendum is added to the note.|
|The following fields will not be shown to users at first on notes, but may be if verified: Status| SMEs gave input that this field may be helpful, if this includes additional values besides completed. But if completed is the only status then it will not be valuable.|
|The following fields will not be shown to users at first on admission and discharge summaries, but may be if verified: Date signed, Status, Attending physcian | SMEs gave input that status may be helpful, if this includes additional values besides completed. But if completed is the only status then it will not be valuable. Attending physcian will replace “person who discharged the patient” if available, if not we will keep as is.|

* H1 for this page should be the name of the microbiology lab test that was run. If name not available, use type of test.
* For each microbiology result, include the following information
   * Name of test _(used as H1)_
   * Date and time collected
   * Type of test - Microbiology _(backup for H1)_
   * Site or sample tested
   * Collection sample - e.g. swab
   * The provider who ordered the test
   * The location at which the specimen was collected
   * Date that the sample evaluation was completed
   * Information about understanding your results, presented within an additional info component
   * The actual resulting microbiology report - presented in monospaced font to preserve spacing
* During Phase 0 we will investigate the following field to confirm their value and the data displayed and confirm with SMEs if they should continue to be included.
   * Collection sample- This is useful for microbiology results but the most important thing to the veteran is the site or sample tested. There are some examples ie. a urine culture where there may be no data for the site or sample tested and collection sample would be the only way to determine the sample.  We saw this displayed differently depending on the VistA occurrence.
   * Date completed- We could not find an example of this field in our example data.  It displayed as "Date not available".  This may be more significant to pathology and may be site specific if data is included here.  Will continue investigation and determine if it is valuable.

#### Functionality
* Ability to download details of current result as a PDF or TXT file

<summary>Design decisions</summary>

| Decision | Reasoning |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|We will combine imaging and lab results into one section. |In [early tree testing studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-01-my-health-ia-tree-test/my-health-tree-test-findings.md#details-of-findings), combining these categories worked well.|
|In the list view, each card will show enough information about a lab result to consider that entry unique. We believe name and date speciment collected suffice.| The same lab or imaging test may be run multiple times.|
|The following imaging results fields will not be shown to users: ordering location | SMEs felt that the ordering location was not important data and could create confusion alongside performing location.|
|Lab and test result reports should be shown in monospaced fonts.| SMEs informed us that reports are written up in lab systems in monospaced fonts, and spacing is an important consideration. Therefore, that spacing should be retained when presenting to patients.|
|For phase 0, we do not need to show radiology images.|Radiology images are stored differently from other medical records data and can be quite large in size. This work is requires separate work than making the other MR data available. Due to the heavier lift, as well as the notion that images are less useful for patients than the report, we have decided to move forward with linking to MHV and add for Phase 1.  At that time we will include both DICOM and JPEGS.|
|For Phase 0 we will have one location field for all labs and tests.  We will call this field "location" removing any of the identifiers. We will continue further investigation about the location field and ask Veterans in research for feedback to determine if we need to make any adjustments moving forward.|Based on our technical investigation we identified that the three location fields we display in MHV today for labs and tests (Ordering location, Collected location and Performing location) are sourced from the same location, which is the VistA location providing the report. The only difference is performing location attempts to display the address instead of the facility name. |

|This section will be called Download all medical records, not Blue Button|Research showed that very few popeople recongize and understand exactly what Blue Button is. Therefore, we wanted to make it clear what this part of the application allows you to do. Instead of making Blue Button the H1, refer to Blue Button as the mechanism by which you can download all records. This allows us to clarify for Veterans while also connecting to MHV classic terminology. We also did research, and there are no requirements for using the Blue Button branding other than making sure it is labeled as registered, and it should be a way to download medical data. |
|At first, only allow for full record downloads.|Classic MHV allows users to select categories and time frames as parameters for downloading your data. To download a specifc category of data, a user should navigate to that section of MHV on VA.gov. THerefore, category selection doesn't make much sense in this new app. However, time frame does, but to limit scope, and because downloading all is required in all versions of the tool, we decided to start there. Consider adding time frame selection in future versions of the app.|

|Medical records settings will be its own page and will primarily be about opting into and out of VHIE|There was a lot of struggle for where to locate this VHIE functionality. There was an attempt to pair it with downloading medical records, but that proved confusing for both IA reasons (what do you call the combined things in a nav option) and even once navigated to, it was unclear why these two things were bundled. Additonally, research showed that callign this page something like "Share your medical records" did not afford nor align with the actual actions taken. Therefore, we landed on settings as the best option.|
