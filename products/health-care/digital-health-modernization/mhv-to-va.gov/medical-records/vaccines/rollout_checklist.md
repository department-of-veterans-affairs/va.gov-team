# Vaccines Phase 0 Rollout and Exit Criteria
Each application moving to VA.gov (e.g., Secure Messaging, Medical Records, Medications Appointments) will follow the same process defined below. 

Delineation of phases: [https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/vhaccmhvtovagovcomms/SitePages/timeline.aspx#what-to-expect-in-each-phase-of-a-feature’s-launch](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/vhaccmhvtovagovcomms/SitePages/timeline.aspx#what-to-expect-in-each-phase-of-a-feature’s-launch)
