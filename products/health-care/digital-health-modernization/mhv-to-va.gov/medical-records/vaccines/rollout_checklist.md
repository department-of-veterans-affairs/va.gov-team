# Vaccines Phase 0 Rollout and Exit Criteria
Each application moving to VA.gov (e.g., Secure Messaging, Medical Records, Medications Appointments) will follow the same process defined below. 

Delineation of phases: [https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/vhaccmhvtovagovcomms/SitePages/timeline.aspx#what-to-expect-in-each-phase-of-a-feature’s-launch](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/vhaccmhvtovagovcomms/SitePages/timeline.aspx#what-to-expect-in-each-phase-of-a-feature’s-launch)

Integrations needed are delinated on [Phase Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1667322271773/26b9a1c19e3d4f1dbcc1dba4e4218a56f0fbb75a?sender=ude85bb253763b7bbdaf46656)

### Phase 0 Overview 

Application exists on VA.gov in a published, authenticated state, but can only be found if users know the URL.  

### Phase 0 User Access:

- User links directly to new VA.gov tool via link provided in email. 

- MHV, My VA Health, or VA.gov will not link to the tool. 

- New tool will include “return to MHV” or “return to My VA Health” links.  

- Public websites, My VA continue to point users to the MHV application. 

*Currently, all pages are available in production (with mock data) if a user knows the URL, however we have a fix for this that will be implemented soon.*
