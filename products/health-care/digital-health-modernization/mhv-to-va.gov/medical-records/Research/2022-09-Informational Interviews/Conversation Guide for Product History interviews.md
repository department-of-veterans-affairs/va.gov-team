## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is <>. I am a user researcher with the VA within the office of the CTO. I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 

I work primarily on VA.gov and currently I’m part of a team exploring what it would take to bring MHV products to VA.gov. This work is being done in partnership with the Office of Connected Care, and the guidance of Theresa Hancock, Nancy Wilck, and Dr. Neil Evans. You may have heard of this work, but in case you haven’t, the purpose of it is to integrate MHV more tightly with VA.gov so that we are able to deliver a more unified and complete product and service experience to Veterans.

Your name came up as someone we should chat with, especially as it concerns the product history of MHV. Today, I’d love to talk about a specific part of MHV, medical records data. What user problems it was designed to solve, what problems it should solve but doesn’t, and more. Without better understanding this, we will be unable to recommend realistic improvements.

Lastly, a few things I want to mention before we dive in:

This entire session should take about an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you? Great! Any questions before we get started? 

## General

- When I say medical record functionality in MHV, what does that mean to you? 
- What is your experience with Medical Records?
- What have you heard about the use of Medical Records from Veterans? From VA staff?
- What are your priorities for Medical Records?

## Blue Button / Health Summary

- In your words, what is the difference between “Blue Button” and “VA Health Summary?”
- Why do these two sections exist separately?
- Is the superset of data available for the Blue Button report different than the superset of data available for the VA Health Summary?
- Let’s imagine that I’m a user of MHV. If I consult the same piece of data in the Blue Button Report and in the VA Health Summary, is there any chance that that data could be different? 
- When would I use Blue Button instead of VA Health Summary? When would I use VA Health Summary instead of Blue Button?
- In previous research, users struggled to understand the term Blue Button and to disambiguate it from the VA Health Summary. Is there any reason you can think of that we should not attempt to combine these sections into one user experience?


## Concepts

I now want to show you a few concepts for how we might make changes to how Medical Records information is displayed in MHV. Before we dive in though, I want to strongly caveat that these are very very much conceptual. We have no plans at this point to move forward with any of these concepts without further research. This is purely a brainstorming exercise. We think it’s important to show these concepts to folks like yourself super early as a way to get initial reactions, thoughts, and ideas. You know medical records and MHV much better than we do, and so your early input on these initial concepts is incredibly useful to informing what we will end up testing in the future. 

**Concept 1: Breaking the Medical Records monolith**

Let’s dive into concept 1. As you know, information like upcoming appointments, reminders for prescription refills, these are on pages separate from medical records today. Therefore, users must click into Medical Records, and then into another section to see new clinical results, recent vitals, and more, etc. 

This first concept explore what it might look like if we surfaced more of the information contained deep in Medical Records on the first page of MHV  when logging in? For example, a user could log in, and instead of just seeing four big tiles, they’d see Lab Results, Radiology Results, Visit Summaries, and be able to jump directly into seeing their immunizations, allergies, etc. 

- What are your initial reactions to this concept?
- In what ways do you think this improves on medical records, if at all? 
- In what ways do you think this won’t work? 

**Concept 2: View first, download second**

Let’s move to concept 2. 

Some patient portals divide records into a health summary section where the primary action is viewing your information without downloading and a medical records download section where the primary action is downloading for your records or to share with a new provider. 

We explored what this model could look like for MHV. In this concept, a user can quickly view all of their important health information in the browser. If they need to download their medical record, or share it with someone, they would be directly to a separate section where they could do that. 

* What are your initial reactions to this concept?
* In what ways do you think this improves on medical records, if at all? 
* In what ways do you think this won’t work? 


## Seventh Task: Closing - X minutes

- Where are the big pain points with Medical Records?
- What are the 1-2 biggest opportunities that you see?
- What ideas have been tried in the Medical Records space that failed?
- Have you seen Medical Records gone through major changes? What do you think we can learn from that? 
- Are there any projects in progress that touch on Medical Records?
- What constraints do you see on Medical Records that we should know about?
- If you were building Medical Records fresh, where would you start?
- If you could change any one thing about Medical Records right now, what would it be?
- Are there any studies, research or analytics related to medical records that we should look at?
- Is there anything else that we should know about Medical Records that we haven’t covered yet?
- Do you have any outstanding questions about Medical Records that we might be able to answer through our research?
- Is there anyone else that we should reach out to?
