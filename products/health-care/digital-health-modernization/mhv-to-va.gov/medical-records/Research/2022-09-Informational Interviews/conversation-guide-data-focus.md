## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is <>. I am a user researcher with the VA within the office of the CTO. I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 

I work primarily on VA.gov and currently I’m part of a team exploring what it would take to bring MHV products to VA.gov. This work is being done in partnership with the Office of Connected Care, and the guidance of Theresa Hancock, Nancy Wilck, and Dr. Neil Evans. You may have heard of this work, but in case you haven’t, the purpose of it is to integrate MHV more tightly with VA.gov so that we are able to deliver a more unified and complete product and service experience to Veterans.

Your name came up as someone we should chat with, especially as it concerns the technical underpinnings of MHV. Today, I’d love to talk about a specific part of MHV, medical records data. Where it is stored, how it is pulled into MHV, and any specific hurdles in that process. Without better understanding this, we will be unable to recommend realistic improvements.

Lastly, a few things I want to mention before we dive in:

This entire session should take about an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you? Great! Any questions before we get started?

## General

* First, can you tell me a little bit about yourself. What is your role and how have you worked on MHV?
* When we say medical records, what does that mean to you? What data is included in medical records? What functionality is included as part of medical records?
* What should we know about the Medical Records technical ecosystem?

## Blue Button

- What data is available in the Blue Button report?
- Can you explain where the data is pulled from for the Blue Button report? 
- How often is this data updated on the backend? 
- How often is it pulled into the patient portal?
- Patients may go to several different VA medical centers, and it’s my understanding that each medical center has its own instance of VistA. How is one patient’s data from across many VAMC’s combined to present a single medical record in MHV?

## VA Health Summary

- What data is available in the VA Health Summary? 
- Can you explain where the data is pulled from for the VA Health Summary? 
- How often is this data updated? 
- How often is it pulled?

## Differences between Blue Button and Health Summary

- Is the superset of data available for the Blue Button report different than the superset of data available for the VA Health Summary?
- Let’s imagine that I’m a user of MHV. If I consult the same piece of data in the Blue Button Report and in the VA Health Summary, is there any chance that that data could be different? 

## Limitations

- Are there any technical limitations that we should keep in mind? Is there anything that is possible technically but would be extremely difficult or time consuming?
- We have heard that there are data interoperability issues between VA & DoD. Can you tell us more about this?
- Can you tell us more about the relationship between patient generated data and the comprehensive health record?

## Cerner
- Are you at all familiar with the Cerner migration?
- Based on your understanding, how will the migration to Cerner affect a patient’s medical records? 
- If a patient goes to a facility that uses Cerner, and then returns to a facility that uses VistA, how will that be handled in MHV? 
- Do you have any ability, today, to access the medical records information created at one of the few Cerner facilities?  

## Closing

- Where are the biggest pain points with medical records for engineers?
- What are the 1-2 biggest opportunities you see in the Medical Records space?
- If you were building Medical Records fresh, where would you start?
- If you could change any one thing about Medical Records right now, what would it be?
- Is there anything else that we should know about Medical Records that we haven’t covered yet?
- Do you have any outstanding questions about Medical Records that we might be able to answer through our research?
- Are there any technical documents that outlines the Medical Records functionality you can point us to or share with us?
- Is there anyone else that we should reach out to?
