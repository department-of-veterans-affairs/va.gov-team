# Release Plan
## Guidance

_This Release Plan Template is intended to help ensure your new VSP product or feature is ready for launch and will deliver the desired user outcomes._
* _With the Medical Records release (and other subsequent features from MyHealtheVet) we are following the phase 0-4 approach as determined by the VA.gov leadership team.  The below summarizes the various phases and our plans to release_
* _In Phase 0 "Trusted Users", the application will be in a published state, but can only be found by knowing the URL.  In addition, users must be whitelisted to allow authentication.  Users that are not whitelisted will be redirected back to the MHV experience.  The invited users (a few hundred or less) will be provided an email address to direct feedback to.  There will be no changes to existing links or experiences on either VA.gov or MHV.  For Medical Records, Phase 0 will be done in increments of one or more domains, such as Allergies and Vaccines.   Once all domains have met their respective criteria to progress to Phase 1, the domains will be promoted together.
* _In Phase 1 "Try Me", a url path with be provided from MHV to the new application on VA.gov.  Users will no longer be invited/whitelisted to try the new experience.  They can also continue to use the MHV application.  Users will be asked to use the feedback feature (unlikely to provide just an email address).
* _In Phase 2 "VA.gov transitions", links will be added to both MHV and VA.gov to allow users to experience the new application.  New users from each site will be direction to this new application first.
* _In Phase 3 "MHV nudge", messaging will be added to MHV about the existing MHV messaging feature being retired on a specific date.  Additional communication about the change will start directing and informing users of the change.
* _In Phase 4 "MHV redirect to apartment", the final redirect of users will occur where all traffic will flow to the new application and the old application will no longer be accessible.

Throughout the phases, a rollout phase checklist is being completed and maintained by the leadership team.

## Phase 0: Trusted Users

### Planning:

## Post-launch Questions

*To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.*

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
2. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
3. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
4. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
