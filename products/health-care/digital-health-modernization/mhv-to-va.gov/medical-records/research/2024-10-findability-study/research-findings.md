## Research Goals

1. Identify any pain points Veterans may experience in accessing their medical records.  
2. Understand the criteria Veterans use to find and identify medical records.
3. Understand Veterans’ needs and expectations within Medical Records.

## Research Questions

1. How are Veterans finding specific health records in My HealtheVet Classic?
    - How does it compare to finding their health records in MyChart?
2. What would help Veterans find the information they need in their health records?
3. What types of information do Veterans need to understand and identify a record?
4. How do Veterans feel when searching within their health records?

## Methodology

We conducted contextual inquiry sessions in which we asked participants to navigate a live environment while we observed their behavior, and asked follow-up prompts as needed.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans can access their health records more quickly and easily in MyChart than in My HealtheVet Classic.

TRUE: Most Veterans expressed negative feelings while searching for records in My HealtheVet Classic compared to MyChart.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will use dates to find and identify records.

MOSTLY TRUE: All Veterans used test name and date to identify test results. Most Veterans used provider name, note date, and keywords to identify notes.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will prefer to have a sort, filter, or search function within their health records.

TRUE: Most Veterans mentioned the benefit of adding search, filter, or a table of contents to their Blue Button report.

## Key Findings

1. All participants (12 of 12) selected VA Laboratory Results while generating a report with all information related to their diabetes diagnosis, but few (2 of 12) selected VA Problem List or VA Notes.
    1. More participants (5 of 12) also selected some form of their VA Appointments list, VA Medication History, or Vitals and Readings.
2. Most participants (9 of 12) did not understand what information could be found in the “VA Problem List.”
3. All participants (10 of 10) understood what information could be found in “VA Notes.”
4. Most participants (11 of 12) relied on scrolling to navigate through their Blue Button report.
5. All participants (10 of 10) relied on scrolling through MyChart Test Results to identify their diabetes labs.
6. Most participants mentioned filters while looking for specific records across domains in Blue Button.
7. Most participants mentioned a search function while looking for specific records across domains in Blue Button.
8. Most participants (8 of 11) mentioned the potential benefits of jump links or a table of contents when finding the different sections within their Blue Button PDF report.
9. All participants (11 of 11) used both test title and date to identify specific labs in both My HealtheVet and MyChart.
    1. In MyChart, many participants (5 of 9) also used the provider’s name to identify a specific lab.
10. Most participants (8 of 11) used the provider’s name, note date, and (7 of 11) keywords associated with diabetes to identify notes about diabetes within their Blue Button report.
    1. In MyChart, all participants (7 of 7) used the provider’s name, and many participants (4 of 7) used the appointment date and clinic name or specialty to identify notes about diabetes.
11. Participants spent more time finding the VA Problem List section within their Blue Button report than time locating a specific condition on the list.
12. Most (8 of 11) participants expressed negative emotions while searching for a record in Blue Button compared to more neutral or positive emotions while using MyChart.

## Details of Findings

**Finding 1: All participants selected VA Laboratory Results while generating a report with information related to their diabetes diagnosis, but few selected VA Problem List or VA Notes.**

12 of 12 participants chose to include their VA Laboratory Results when asked to generate a report of all information related to their diabetes condition. 5 of the 12 participants also included VA Medications, VA Appointments and/or Vitals and Readings. However, only 2 of the 12 participants included their VA Problem List or VA Notes, suggesting that participants are not as familiar with the content of those sections.

_"I would have thought \[notes\] would have been included with one of the previous ones... I guess when I hit VA lab results, usually if labs are outside the norm, you get some sort of note affiliated with that." -_ Participant 19

**Finding 2: Most participants (9 of 12) did not understand what information could be found in the “VA Problem List.”**

2 of 12 participants included the VA Problem List in a Blue Button report of all the information related to their diabetes diagnosis. When asked what kinds of information could be found in the problem list, 9 of 12 participants either did not know or assumed it was something different than a list of health conditions, while 3 of 12 stated the correct meaning of the problem list after some hesitation.

This data suggests that these participants do not often include the VA Problem List in their typical Blue Button reports, nor do they understand the concept of a problem list, which could also explain past confusion within the Health Conditions domain in previous research studies conducted on Medical Records on VA.gov.

After they were familiarized with the problem list concept, participants located its equivalent in MyChart and most often clicked on My Conditions, Health Summary, and Health Issues. The names of these pages are more aligned with Health Conditions, the title of the problem list page within Medical Records on VA.gov.

_"I’ve never heard of a problem list... maybe it’s the VA problems that I’ve reported." -_ Participant 15

_“I have no idea... my diabetes, my back issues, surgeries I’ve had... I don’t know.”_ \- Participant 14

**Finding 3: All participants understood what information could be found in “VA Notes.”**

2 of 12 participants included VA Notes in a Blue Button report of all the information related to their diabetes diagnosis. When asked what information could be found in VA Notes, 10 of 10 participants answered correctly. This suggests that most participants were aware of the content that would be included in VA Notes and purposefully excluded it from their report.

_"\[VA Notes are\] findings by doctors and staff." -_ Participant 11

Labels: PRDT: Medical-records, SPG: Cognitive Consideration

**Finding 4: Most participants relied on scrolling to navigate through their Blue Button report.**

11 of 12 participants used scrolling as their primary navigation technique in Blue Button, with document sizes ranging from 68 to 2285 pages among participants. 5 of 12 participants used the scroll bar to navigate through the document, and 3 participants scrolled through the thumbnail outline in the left sidebar.

5 of 12 participants used the “Find” feature to search for specific keywords in the document. Only one participant tried jumping to specific page numbers in an effort to navigate through the document more quickly.

_"Right now I’m just kind of scrolling ‘cause I couldn’t really tell you how I’m going to find \[Lab Results\]." -_ Participant 16

_"Other than scrolling down through this thing, I don’t know any other way of \[finding Lab Results\]." -_ Participant 19

Labels: PRDT: Medical-records, SPG: Cognitive Consideration

**Finding 5: All participants relied on scrolling through MyChart Test Results to identify their diabetes labs.**

10 of 10 participants who viewed their test results in MyChart used scrolling as their primary navigation method. However, scrolling through MyChart produced fewer negative comments than scrolling through Blue Button.

_"In MyChart, you click on certain things, they open up instead of having to scroll through 500 pages or something in \[Blue Button\]." -_ Participant 16

Labels: PRDT: Medical-records, SPG: Cognitive Consideration

**Finding 6: Many participants mentioned filters while looking for specific records across domains in Blue Button.**

All participants (11 of 11) wanted to filter their VA Laboratory Results to find labs related to diabetes. Participants overwhelmingly mentioned filtering by date, but one participant wanted to filter by test name as well. To filter by date, participants would have needed to generate a new Blue Button report with narrower dates.

Some participants (4 of 11) mentioned filtering while searching through VA Notes. Filter criteria included date and specialty. Participants would have needed to generate a new Blue Button report with different dates to “filter” notes as well. There is currently no way to filter by specialty within Blue Button.

Across all domains, most participants (8 of 12) attempted to filter or narrow down records by condition. Participants repeatedly assumed that by searching “diabetes” within the report, they would see results for all information related to their condition.

_"I would look up three years ago 2021 as an isolator and I would mainly have to sift through this and just figure it out." -_ Participant 09

_"If there was a place where I could just put a word diabetes, it could go through my records and just pull out the diabetes stuff and not give me the whole shebang."_ \- Participant 07

**Finding 7: Most participants mentioned a search function while looking for specific records across domains in Blue Button.**

9 of 11 participants expressed their desire to search through VA Laboratory Results. When asked to find lab results related to their diabetes condition, participants most often searched for key terms such as “A1C “and “glucose.” Participants struggled to scroll directly to their lab results as they were often buried hundreds or thousands of pages into the Blue Button PDF, and searching lab-specific terms helped them to skip to the right section.

8 of 11 participants also wanted to search within VA Notes. The most common search criteria when searching for notes related to diabetes or a cardiologist appointment included “diabetes,” “A1C,” “cardio,” or their provider’s name. Using the search function helped participants to parse through the hundreds or thousands of pages of notes within their Blue Button PDF, a task that would have otherwise required them to read every note.

Participants used the "find" field in different ways—8 of 10 understood the function of an exact-word “find” field, but 2 of 10 expected it to work as a search engine, searching phrases such as “lab test 2021,” “lab history,” or “recent labs.”

_"If I was able to put in the keyword or something to prevent that tedious search, then that would help." -_ Participant 10

_“You need to read through everything, cause there’s no way to look for keyword.”_ \- Participant 08

**Finding 8: Most participants mentioned the potential benefits of jump links or a table of contents when finding the different sections within their Blue Button PDF report.**

Participants struggled to locate individual sections within their Blue Button report, especially when searching for VA Laboratory Results. 8 of 11 participants expressed the need for jump links or a table of contents with page numbers on the Download Request Summary page. Given the PDF format of the Blue Button report, participants were often forced to scroll past hundreds of pages of VA Notes.

_"As a PDF, it’s not indexed so that you could click on something and go down to the lab portion. If I had just selected the lab work, that would be easier." -_ Participant 12

Labels: PRDT: Medical-records, SPG: Cognitive Consideration

**Finding 9: All participants used both test title and date to identify specific labs in both My HealtheVet and MyChart.**

When navigating through Blue Button, 11 of 11 participants looked for both the test title and test date when searching for a specific lab result. 9 of 9 participants used the same criteria to identify lab results in MyChart. The most common test names mentioned were “A1C” and “glucose.” Participants preferred to additionally filter test results by date to find the correct records.

In MyChart, 5 of 9 participants also used the provider’s name assigned to their lab results to identify a specific result, which may be influenced by the different way test results are displayed between the two portals. MyChart lists just the test results on a screen with the title, date and provider name and picture. In order to view more details a user must click on the test name. Conversely, the Blue Button report whether in PDF or HTML format is a continuous text only document with details included.

_"I’m able to identify which test was done on which day" -_ Participant 09

_“\[MyChart\] gives you the heading of what type of test it was, the date it was performed, and the doctor that requested it... so much better than the info dump.”_ - Participant 11

Labels: PRDT: Medical-records, SPG: Cognitive Consideration

**Finding 10: Most participants used the provider’s name, note date, and keywords associated with diabetes to identify notes about diabetes.**

In Blue Button, 8 of 11 participants used both the provider’s name and note date to identify a specific note. 7 of 11 participants also used a specific keyword such as “diabetes” or “A1C” to search for and identify notes. Only 1 of 11 participants mentioned using the note title to aid in their search for a specific record.

Searching for a note in MyChart produced slightly different results. 7 of 7 participants used the provider’s name to identify their note, while 4 of 7 referenced the note date and the clinic name or specialty for identification. Participants did not mention keywords, as MyChart does not display note contents until the participant clicks into the note from the Visits and Appointments screen.

_"I’m going to look for that date because it’s first on the list, right?... Then after I see that... I would probably want to look for the doctor’s name" -_ Participant 06

_“\[MyChart\] gives you the information you need as to when it was, the doctor you saw, the clinic you went to, everything is contained right there.”_ - Participant 12

**Finding 11: Participants spent more time finding the VA Problem List section within their Blue Button report than time locating a specific condition on the list.**

5 of 6 participants needed assistance from the moderator to find the VA Problem List section of their Blue Button report. The moderator spent significant time explaining that the participant should look for a comprehensive list of diagnoses rather than a doctor’s note or lab result regarding a diagnosis, suggesting that the problem list is not familiar to most participants. Once all participants made it into the VA Problem List, they scrolled through the conditions to find their diabetes diagnosis.

When finding an equivalent page in MyChart, participants took less time to understand the task as it had already been explained for My HealtheVet. However, this workflow of locating a list of diagnoses was still unfamiliar to participants.

_“At this point, I have no clue \[where to find the diabetes diagnosis\]. It’s just a needle in a haystack for me.”_ \- Participant 11

Labels: PRDT: Medical-records, SPG: Cognitive Consideration

**Finding 12: Most participants expressed negative emotions while searching for a record in Blue Button compared to more neutral or positive emotions while using MyChart.**

8 of 11 participants had negative feedback or feelings about My HealtheVet compared to MyChart throughout the session. Participants frequently referred to MyChart as more “user friendly” compared to My HealtheVet and struggled to navigate through files up to 2,200 pages long.

Those who felt positively about Blue Button (3 of 11) said that it is a good resource if the user knows how to navigate it. They mentioned that it is better to have more information than less, and using Blue Button gives them a sense of independence.

_"\[Blue Button is\] relatively simple if you know what you’re looking for and can type it right, it works amazing" -_ Participant 15

_“I get overwhelmed with stuff like this... I only have so many \*\*\*\*s to give every day, and this is not one of them.”_ - Participant 11

_“It shouldn’t be a skill level thing that only people with certain skills can \[find records in Blue Button\].”_ - Participant 07

## Additional Insights

**Additional Finding 1: Most participants receive a notification when new lab results are posted in their MyChart.**

9 of 11 participants know they receive a notification from MyChart when new lab results are available in their portal. The remaining 2 either review their labs very shortly after leaving the clinic or do not review labs in MyChart at all.

On the other hand, 7 of 11 participants wait a few days after completing labs to see if their results are posted in My HealtheVet, while the remaining 4 believe they are notified when new results are available in their chart. There is currently no notification functionality set up for labs in My HealtheVet, so it is possible participants confused messages from their providers regarding lab results with a lab-specific notification or confused My HealtheVet and MyChart altogether.

_“I get a text that your labs are ready... I’ll pull \[my phone\] up and it says your labs are right here. It’s a great system and I wish the VA would do something this simple, but I get it.”_ \- Participant 15

_“I just usually wait a couple of days and then check \[for my results\]. I have not received any notices or anything that they’re posted.”_ - Participant 12

_“If I’m not mistaken \[the lab results\] come by email. I was going to say text, but I don’t know that the VA does text messages. But I know I get an email, ‘Your lab report is ready’ or something to that nature.”_ - Participant 15

**Additional Finding 2: Most participants needed moderator assistance with the calendar picker when generating a Blue Button report.**

6 of 8 participants struggled to generate a report for the last three years in the Blue Button calendar picker. Participants successfully chose a month and year in the calendar popup, then tried to move forward on the page without clicking a date, meaning their selections were not saved.

3 additional participants successfully generated a report for the last three years by typing into the date field rather than using the calendar picker.
