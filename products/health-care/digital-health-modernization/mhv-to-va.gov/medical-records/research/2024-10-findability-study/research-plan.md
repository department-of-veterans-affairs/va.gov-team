# **Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medical Records Findability Study, October 2024**

## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. In this study, we will be conducting interview sessions to discover Veterans’ pain points when finding and accessing information about their medical records. This effort reflects our commitment to creating a user-centric tool that meets the unique needs of all Veterans, to streamline their access to medical records.

**OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

**Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

&nbsp;

## **Research Goals**

1. Identify any pain points Veterans may experience in accessing their medical records.  
2. Understand the criteria Veterans use to find and identify medical records.
3. Understand Veterans’ needs and expectations within Medical Records.

## **Outcome**

The results of the study will uncover Veterans’ behaviors and expectations when accessing their Medical Records. Both findability and generative findings will inform future iterations of designs.

## **Research questions**

1. How are Veterans finding specific health records in My HealtheVet Classic?
    - How does it compare to finding their health records in MyChart?
2. What types of information do Veterans look for when trying to find a specific record?
3. What would help Veterans find the information they need in their health records?
4. What types of information do Veterans need to understand and identify a record?
5. How do Veterans feel when searching within their health records?

## **Hypothesis**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans can access their health records more quickly and easily in MyChart than in My HealtheVet Classic.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will use dates to find and identify records.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will prefer to have a sort, filter, or search function within their health records.

## **Methodology**

We will conduct contextual inquiry sessions in which we will ask participants to navigate a live environment while we observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

## **Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
