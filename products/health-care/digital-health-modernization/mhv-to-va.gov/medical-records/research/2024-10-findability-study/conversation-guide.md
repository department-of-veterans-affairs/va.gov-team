# **Conversation Guide: MHV on VA.gov, Medical Records Findability, October 2024**

## **Intro ~15 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you \[first name\]?

&nbsp;

My name is \[name\]. I'm a researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

&nbsp;

I would like to confirm that you have diabetes. How long have you had it?

I would like to confirm that you have MyChart through a community care clinic.

I just want to confirm that you will be joining us on a desktop or laptop today.

You will be interacting with your own health records today in both My HealtheVet and MyChart. To accurately document your experiences, we will need to observe and record your interactions with your patient portals. Your comfort and privacy are our top priorities. If you are not comfortable with me seeing and recording your health information, please let me know before we begin. By proceeding, you consent to the observation and documentation of your interactions for research purposes. Do I have your permission to proceed?

_\[If yes:\]_ Thank you. I will confirm that this is okay once more when we are recording.

_\[If no:\]_ \[_End the session\]_

Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

&nbsp;

- **This entire session should take about 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

&nbsp;

I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_\[If yes: \]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_\[If no:\]_  I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.


_\[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves\]_  

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your behavior accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

_\[If no:\]_ Would you be comfortable with a recording if we call you by a different name?

_\[If yes: \]_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

&nbsp;

_\[Start recording.\]_

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- We use recordings to confirm that we have captured your behavior accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your health information will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable sharing your personal health records with us from both My HealtheVet and MyChart?

## **Screen share/Remote share ~ 5-15 minutes**

_\[Participant will be on Desktop/Laptop:\]_ Have you shared your screen over Zoom before?

_\[If yes: \]_ Go ahead and share your desktop with me now.

_\[If no:\] \[Instruct the participant to share their screen\]_

&nbsp;

### **Participant Coaching**  

&nbsp;

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own.

&nbsp;

Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are in your patient portals today and I am on the phone with you and can’t see your screen. Does that make sense?

If you are ready, we can begin.

## **Part 1: BB Report ~ 10 minutes**

Do you currently have both My HealtheVet and MyChart open? Just as a reminder, I will be seeing your personal health records on both patient portals. If you are not comfortable with this, please tell me and we will stop the session now.

Our goal in these studies is to make sure we represent the point of view of all Veterans. This is why we are committed to recruiting participants with cognitive disabilities so that we are designing an experience that meets their needs.  

In your screener, you answered yes when asked about a cognitive disability.

_\[if no\]_  

We will be sure to make that correction. Thank you.
