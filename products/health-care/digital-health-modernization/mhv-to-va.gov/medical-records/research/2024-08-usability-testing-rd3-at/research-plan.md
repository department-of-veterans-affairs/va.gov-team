  # **Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medical Records, August 2024**

## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We initially built and tested a prototype of Medical Records in MHV on VA.gov. We conducted usability studies and collected feedback that informed iterations on the website. In this round of usability testing within a live environment, we will assess (1) whether the updates improve user experiences, and (2) test additional and new functionality, (3) include Veterans who require accessibility provisions and explore further pain points.

## **OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

## **Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

&nbsp;

## **Research Goals**

1. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience in accessing their Care Summaries and Notes, Lab and Test Results, and Health Conditions.  
2. Understand Veterans’ sensemaking of medical terminology in Medical Records.
3. Understand Veterans’ needs and expectations within Medical Records.

## **Outcome**

The results of the usability portion of the study will help us determine if our designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to access their medical records and help to identify any pain points. The results of the generative portion of the study will uncover Veterans’ behaviors and expectations when accessing their Medical Records. Both usability and generative findings will inform future iterations of designs.

## **Research questions**

1. Can Veterans find the information they need to manage their healthcare related to:
    - Care Summaries and Notes
    - Lab and Test Results
    - Health Conditions
2. How do Veterans make sense of the terminology in their medical records?
3. What goals are Veterans hoping to accomplish within Medical Records?
4. What are Veterans’ expectations and use cases for printing/downloading Medical Records?
5. What are Veterans’ perceptions of the new experience in which they view their records on screen?
6. How do the goals, expectations, and experiences with Medical Records for Veterans who use assistive technologies vary from those who do not?

## **Hypothesis**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their medical records to manage their health.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will struggle to understand some of the terminology information within their medical records.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will rate the new experience as “easy” or “very easy.”

## **Methodology**

We will conduct interviews and moderated usability testing sessions in which we will ask users to navigate a live environment while we observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

## **Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
