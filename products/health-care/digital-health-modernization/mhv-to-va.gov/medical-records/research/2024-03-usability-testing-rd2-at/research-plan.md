# **Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medical Records, March 2024**

**Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We initially built and tested a prototype of the Medical Records in MHV on VA.gov. We conducted a usability study and collected feedback that informed reiterations on the website. In this round of usability testing within a live environment, we will assess (1) whether the updates improve user experiences, and (2) test additional and new functionality, (3) include Veterans who require accessibility provisions and explore further pain points.

**OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

**Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

**Research Goals**

1. Understand how Veterans perceive their medical records landing page. Understand what Veterans expect to be able to do within the Medical Records portal.
2. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience in accessing their vaccines information in the Medical Records portal.
    - Identify what information Veterans expect to see within the detail view of their vaccines.
    - Identify if Veterans understand the information presented in the list and detail view of their vaccines.
3. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience in accessing their allergies information in the Medical Records portal.
    - Identify what information Veteran expect to see within the detail view of their allergies.
    - Identify if Veterans understand the information presented in the list and detail-view of their allergies.
4. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience in accessing their care summaries and notes information in the Medical Records portal.
    - Identify what information Veteran expect to see within the detail view of their care summaries and notes.
    - Identify if Veterans understand the differences between the types of notes.
    - Identify if Veterans understand the information presented in the list and detail view of their care summaries and notes.
5. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience in accessing their care Vitals information in the Medical Records portal.
6. Identify what information is helpful to Veterans in finding different parts of their medical records.
7. Identify if Veterans, especially AT users, know how to print/download both an individual record and list of medical record information?
8. Identify if Veterans understand the content within all parts of the Medical Records portal.
9. Identify any barriers that may prevent Veterans who use Assistive Technologies from completing their Medical Record management goals.
10. Identify any barriers that may prevent Veterans who have mild to severe Cognitive Disabilities from completing their Medical Records management goals.

**Hypothesis**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their ‘Vaccinations’ records to manage their health.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their ‘Allergies & reactions’ records to manage their health.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their “Care Summaries & Notes” to manage their health.

_Hypothesis 4_: Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their “Vitals” to manage their health.

_Hypothesis 5:_ Most Veterans will find the information presented in their Medical Records adequate for managing their health.

_Hypothesis 6:_ Most Veterans using Screen-reader will be able to easily access the downloaded PDF file of their medical record information.

**Methodology**

We will conduct moderated usability testing sessions in which we will ask users to navigate the staging website while we observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

**Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
