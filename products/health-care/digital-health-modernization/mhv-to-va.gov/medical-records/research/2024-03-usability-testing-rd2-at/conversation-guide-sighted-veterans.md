## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\]. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving the VA's websites and other resources for Participants. We reach out to Participants as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know.

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call.

I have one teammate who will take notes to ensure we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

- _(If yes, let them in. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")_
- _(NOTETAKER & OBSERVERS JOIN)_ We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's \[NAME\] Please turn on your camera and introduce yourself to \[PARTICIPANT\]
- Could the notetaker and observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? _(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")_

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Participants' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** _Start recording to the cloud._
- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions – 5 minutes**

- Do you use My HealtheVet?

_\[If yes\]_

- How often?
- Do you use it to access your health records?
  - _\[If yes\]_ How often?
  - What types of records do you access?
- Have you ever struggled to find a specific record?
  - _\[if yes\]_ Could you tell me about it?
 
    
- What device are you using today?

### **Remote mouse sharing instructions**

- Are you using a mouse today? _\[If no, be prepared to send the link and have participant share from their device\]_
-  I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get set up, I will give you instructions on what to do. _\[when ready\]_ I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen that says **Click to start the remote control of the share screen.** Click on that notification and then click again on the screen and then you will be able to control my mouse.

### **Mobile Screen sharing instructions**

I just sent you the link to access the prototype in the chat. If you don’t mind clicking that link to open up the page.

(_Help users navigate to chat when needed)_

- Getting to chat is a similar process as earlier. In the bottom (top in iPad) of your screen, there is a row of bottoms, one of the options should say ‘chat’, you may need to click on the 3 dots (on smaller screens) to bring up more options.

(Follow screen sharing protocol for specific operating system)

### **Participant Coaching**

Today we are trying to learn how a Participant might use this product if they were on their own. Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can’t see your screen.

_\[for MHV users\]_ This is going to look slightly familiar, but please remember that this is a new design we are testing and some elements you might expect to be there will not and some you don’t expect will. I would like you to treat this entire website like it were not MHV at all.

Since we are trying to make this experience as realistic as possible, you may notice that at the top right the name Pat. If this were your page, it would be your name, but for today you will notice Pat at the top of your screen. We will approach this from Pat’s point of view today.

Are you ready to get started?

## **Task 1: Vaccines – 10 minutes**

**_\[Participant is on Landing page\]_**

- Have you ever accessed your Vaccine records in My HealtheVet?
  - \[If yes\] Was there something specific you were looking for?
  - Could you tell me about that?

Thank you for sharing that.

Please keep in mind that we are reviewing a new website today. Some things will look familiar, but this is not going to be like the My HealtheVet you are used to.

- Let's say that you want to confirm that Pat received a flu shot in 2022. Walk me through how you would check for that on this website.

\[_When found_\]

   - What did/did not work for you here?
   - What would make it more helpful? 

_[Probe around any other issues observed or feedback given during this process\]_

[_If none, ask\]_

_\[If they go to detail page, ask\]_

- How can you tell you are looking at the correct vaccination?

\[_Detail page\]_

We are going to pause here so I can get some feedback about this Vaccines experience.

I am going to provide you a rating scale that we will be using throughout today’s session.

On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being very difficult, 2 being difficult, 3 being neither difficult nor easy, 4 being easy and 5 being very easy, please rate the difficulty of finding Pat’s flu vaccine.

- In the middle of the page, it says "signs & symptoms, what do you think that means?
- Where it says "observed or historical”, what do you think it means?
  - This one says ‘observed’ what do you think ‘historical’ means?

We are going to pause here so I can get some feedback about this Allergies experience.

_\[if yes\]_ Which ones? Let’s look at \[mentioned record\] now and see what the options are.

Because this is a prototype, it won’t download or print, but talk to me about which you would choose. Why \[download/print\] rather than \[print/download\]?

_\[If they stay in list view\]_

What if you just wanted to print/download one record _\[point out the one with the live link\]?_

_[Live links]_

- Can the participant differentiate between printing a list versus a page?

## **Screener Interview – Users with CD**

Thank you for taking the time to get through all those tasks with me today and answering all our questions. It has been super helpful.

Our goal in these studies is to make sure we represent the point of view of all Participants. This is why we are committed to recruiting participants with cognitive disabilities so that we are designing an experience that meets their needs.

- In your screener, you answered yes when asked about a cognitive disability. Could you confirm if this is correct information?

_\[if no\]_

We will be sure to make that correction. Thank you.

_\[if yes, continue\]_

We are collecting information on how Participants’ cognitive disabilities may affect their ability to use My HealtheVet. Would you be willing to answer a couple of questions today?

_\[if no\]_

That’s no problem.

_\[if yes\]_

- Would you mind sharing a little about how your cognitive disability affects your use of My HealtheVet or other websites?
- Can you share an example of a time when you struggled with My HealtheVet because of your disability?

## **Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes**

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Participants.

## **Emergency Exit**

\[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.\]

_End meeting for all_
