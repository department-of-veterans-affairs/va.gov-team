## Research Goals

1. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience in accessing their Care Summaries and Notes, Vaccines, Allergies, and Vitals records.
    - Identify what information Veterans expect to see within the detail view.
    - Identify if Veterans understand the information presented in the list and detail views.
2. Identify if Veterans know how to print/download both an individual record and list of records.
3. Identify any barriers that may prevent Veterans who have mild to severe Cognitive Disabilities from completing their Medical Records management goals.
4. Identify any barriers that may prevent Veterans who use Assistive Technologies from completing their Medical Record management goals.

## Research Questions

1. Can Veterans find the information they need to manage their health related to:
    - Care summaries and notes
    - Allergies
    - Vaccines
    - Vitals
2. Can Veterans print/download a list and an individual record?
3. What is Veterans' perception of the new experience in which they can view their records on screen?

## Methodology

We conducted moderated usability testing interviews in which we asked users to navigate the environment, observed their behavior, and asked follow-up prompts.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their ‘Vaccinations’ records to manage their health.

TRUE: All participants found a specific vaccine and most participants found the location where a specific vaccine was administered.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their ‘Allergies & reactions’ records to manage their health.

TRUE: Most participants were able to find a specific allergy in their list.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their “Care Summaries & Notes” to manage their health.

LIKELY TRUE: Most participants were able to find a specific progress note, and most non-AT-dependent participants found a discharge summary, but only few AT-dependent participants were able to locate the discharge summary.

_Hypothesis 4_: Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their “Vitals” to manage their health.

TRUE: All Veterans found information on Vitals.

_Hypothesis 5:_ Most Veterans will find the information presented in their Medical Records adequate for managing their health.

LIKELY TRUE: Most participants rated the ease of use for the domains between “neither difficult nor easy” and “very easy.”

_Hypothesis 6:_ Most Veterans who use assistive technology will be able to easily access and understand the downloaded PDF file of their medical record information.

TRUE: Most participants opened and understood the contents of the Allergies and reactions list PDF.

## Key Findings

1. All participants (25 of 25) found a specific flu shot and most participants (21 of 24) found the facility for a specific flu shot.
    1. Most participants (15 of 26) navigated by date.
2. Most participants (20 of 25) understood where to find allergy information for a vaccine.
3. Most participants (22 of 25) expected to see “reactions” within the ‘Provider notes’ section.
4. Most AT-dependent participants (6 of 7) and all non-AT-dependent participants (13 of 13) found a specific allergy in the list.
    1. All AT-dependent participants who accessed the PDF document for allergies understood and described its purpose.
5. All participants (20 of 20) understood ‘Signs and symptoms,’ most participants (16 of 21) understood ‘Observed,’ and most participants (11 of 21) understood ‘Historical.’
6. All participants (25 of 25) found information on Vitals.
7. Many participants (8 of 25) requested a graph or chart display to review their vitals over time.
8. Most non-AT-dependent participants located records in ‘Care summaries and notes.’
9. Most AT-dependent participants found a specific progress note, but few AT-dependent participants (2 of 11) found a specific discharge summary.
10. Many participants (10 of 25) requested plain language note titles.
11. Most participants (22 of 23) understood how to print/download a list and all participants (21 of 21) understood how to print/download an individual record.
    1. Most participants (17 of 24) would choose to download a PDF if they needed a copy of a list or individual record.
12. Most participants (19 of 24) expressed that they value direct access to their medical records as compared to generating a Blue Button report.
13. Most participants chose the rating “easy” or “very easy” when evaluating Vaccines (22 of 25), Allergies and reactions (19 of 21), Vitals (20 of 25), Print/download(21 of 23).
14. Few AT-dependent participants (3 of 11) chose the rating “easy” or “very easy” when evaluating Care summaries and notes whole most non-AT-dependent participants (12 of 13) chose the rating “easy” or “very easy.”

## Additional Insights

## Recommendations

- Explore the feasibility of providing data visualizations to supplement the numeric data values for vitals over time.
  - _Veterans with cognitive disabilities may struggle to understand the changes of their vitals over time in the current format._
  - _Data visualizations in the form of charts or graphs would enable all Veterans to quickly make sense of their vitals trends over time._
- Update code on Vitals, Vaccines, and Allergies list pages to make ‘Back to top’ button visible. This should include lowering the viewport threshold to 320px so the button also appears on smaller mobile view ports.
  - _Screen reader users who go through pages line-by-line will take a long time to reach the top of a page, especially in long lists._
  - _This will benefit all Veterans by reducing excessive scrolling which is especially important on mobile._
- Explore solutions to increase visibility of pagination to screen reader users.
  - _Screen reader users are missing both the record count and pagination which leads to missing records that are not on the first page._
