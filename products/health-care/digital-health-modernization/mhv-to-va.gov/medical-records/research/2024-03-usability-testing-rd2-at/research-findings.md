## Research Goals

1. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience in accessing their Care Summaries and Notes, Vaccines, Allergies, and Vitals records.
    - Identify what information Veterans expect to see within the detail view.
    - Identify if Veterans understand the information presented in the list and detail views.
2. Identify if Veterans know how to print/download both an individual record and list of records.
3. Identify any barriers that may prevent Veterans who have mild to severe Cognitive Disabilities from completing their Medical Records management goals.
4. Identify any barriers that may prevent Veterans who use Assistive Technologies from completing their Medical Record management goals.

## Research Questions

1. Can Veterans find the information they need to manage their health related to:
    - Care summaries and notes
    - Allergies
    - Vaccines
    - Vitals
2. Can Veterans print/download a list and an individual record?
3. What is Veterans' perception of the new experience in which they can view their records on screen?

## Methodology

We conducted moderated usability testing interviews in which we asked users to navigate the environment, observed their behavior, and asked follow-up prompts.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their ‘Vaccinations’ records to manage their health.

TRUE: All participants found a specific vaccine and most participants found the location where a specific vaccine was administered.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their ‘Allergies & reactions’ records to manage their health.

TRUE: Most participants were able to find a specific allergy in their list.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their “Care Summaries & Notes” to manage their health.

LIKELY TRUE: Most participants were able to find a specific progress note, and most non-AT-dependent participants found a discharge summary, but only few AT-dependent participants were able to locate the discharge summary.

_Hypothesis 4_: Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their “Vitals” to manage their health.

TRUE: All Veterans found information on Vitals.

_Hypothesis 5:_ Most Veterans will find the information presented in their Medical Records adequate for managing their health.

LIKELY TRUE: Most participants rated the ease of use for the domains between “neither difficult nor easy” and “very easy.”

_Hypothesis 6:_ Most Veterans who use assistive technology will be able to easily access and understand the downloaded PDF file of their medical record information.

## Details of Findings

### **Finding 1: All participants found a specific flu shot and most participants found the facility for a specific flu shot.**

25 of 25 participants located a specific flu shot in the list view of Vaccines. 10 participants vacillated among the multiple Influenza, High-Dose Quadrivalent records before ultimately choosing the correct one. This resulted in a time on task of 72 seconds compared to the average of 43.7. Participants on mobile were on par with the overall average while those on desktop averaged only 26.7 seconds. Assistive technology users averaged about 10 seconds slower than the average with screen reader users about twice as long as sighted participants with an average time on task of 85.5 seconds.

21 of 24 participants were able to locate and identify the location where a specific flu shot was administered. Those who failed the task either expected the location to be in Care summaries and notes or Appointments or they didn’t understand the location name.

15 of 25 participants navigated by date once they reached the Vaccines list page from the About page. 7 participants used the side navigation to navigate to Vaccines while 18 participants used the inline action link. 3 of the 5 mobile users who completed the task used the menu rather than the inline link.

### **Finding 2: Most participants understood where to find allergy information for a vaccine.**

20 of 25 participants successfully identified either the ‘Allergies and reactions’ link in the side navigation or the ‘Go to your Allergy records’ link on the Vaccines list page with an even split between the two.

22 of 25 expected to see reactions within the ‘Provider notes’ section of the Vaccine details screen.

_“I would expect to see something from the doctor \[in provider notes\] like ‘no reaction’ or ‘patient received it well’ or something like that.” – Participant 05_

### **Finding 3: Most AT-dependent participants and all non-AT-dependent participants found a specific allergy in the list.**

6 of 7 AT-dependent participants were able to locate ‘Aspirin’ on the Allergies and Reactions list PDF. The participant who did not find it was a JAWS user who did not realize it was on the second page of the document. The task was conducted with a PDF rather than the staging environment because of database compatibility limitations.

13 of 13 participants who don’t rely on AT easily found ‘Penicillin’ on the Allergies and Reactions list in the environment. Most participants found it in under 5 seconds and there was no discernable difference between mobile and desktop users’ average time.

Labels: Accessibility, SFTW: Screenreader, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, PRDT: Medical-records

### **Finding 4: All participants understood ‘Signs and symptoms,’ most participants understood ‘Observed,’ and most participants understood ‘Historical.’**

20 of 20 participants understood the purpose of the ‘Signs and symptoms’ field even if they didn’t know the meaning of “Anaphylaxis,” the field value.

16 of 21 participants could explain ‘Observed’ and 11 of 21 could explain ‘Historical’ when asked about the ‘Observed or historical’ field. The definition for Observed was on the screen when the question was asked which could explain the higher success rate.

### **Finding 5: All participants found information on Vitals.**

25 of 25 participants located Vitals in the environment and 24 of 24 participants easily found the blood pressure record for a specific date. The average time for finding Vitals was 8.2 seconds with participants dependent on AT taking more than 3 times longer than those who were not.

Labels: Accessibility, SFTW: Screenreader, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, PRDT: Medical-records

### **Finding 6: Many participants requested a graph or chart display to review their vitals over time.**

8 of 25 participants expected to review their vitals with a visual aide such as a graph or chart. These participants associated the concept of reviewing results over time with something visual and specifically mentioned bar charts or line graphs in these instances.

7 of the 8 participants who expected a graph had vision while the last participant was a screen reader user. The screen reader user expressed they would not be able to see the graph but still expected it to be present.

_“I got blown up and I got concussions, and I have short term memory problems, especially with numbers. So that's why I like \[graphs\] … Numbers like that are difficult for me to retain even for a short … period of time.” – Participant 13_

### **Finding 7: Most non-AT-dependent participants located records in ‘Care summaries and notes.’**

12 of 14 sighted participants and 6 of 11 AT-dependent participants found a progress note when told to look for the doctor’s note from an appointment in November. The average time to complete this task for sighted participants was 35.3 seconds, while it took AT users an average of 72.8 seconds. Half of the AT users took less than 35 seconds, and the other half took at least 2 minutes.

9 of 12 sighted participants and 2 of 11 AT-dependent participants found a discharge note when asked to look for information from the doctor after a hospital visit. Sighted participants took 38.7 seconds to find the note on average whereas AT-dependent participants took an average of 69 seconds.

Labels: Accessibility, SFTW: Screenreader, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, PRDT: Medical-records

### **Finding 8: Many AT-dependent participants found a specific progress note, but few AT-dependent participants found a specific discharge summary.**

While 6 of 11 AT-dependent participants found a specific progress note, only 2 of 11 AT-dependent participants found a specific discharge summary. It is not clear whether the AT-dependent participants failed to find the discharge summary because of the note title or because it was on page 2 of Care summaries and notes. However, most AT-dependent participants missed the pagination on the screen and thus had no way to get to the discharge summary.

### **Finding 9:** **Many participants requested plain language note titles.**

10 of 25 participants requested note titles that were easier to understand while navigating through Care summaries and notes. 8 of these participants were AT-dependent, including 3 screen reader users.

_“The titles are slightly confusing... I guess you just have to click on it to find out what would make it less confusing.” - Participant 09_

_“I would prefer it be like if you’re putting words up here for someone to look for something. I would prefer \[it\] be self-explanatory.” - AT Participant 08_

Labels: Accessibility, SFTW: Screenreader, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, PRDT: Medical-records

### **Finding 10: Most participants understood how to print/download a list, and all participants understood how to print/download an individual record.**

22 of 23 participants had no trouble understanding how to print/download a list and all participants were able to print/download a record.

17 of 24 participants stated they would choose to download a PDF if they needed a copy of a list or individual record. Among the remaining seven, 3 stated their choice to print or download would depend on the circumstances, 1 AT-dependent participant chose TXT format, and 3 non-AT users chose print.

_“This just depends on if I need a hard copy or if I’m gonna send it, you know, via e-mail.” – Participant 16_

Labels: Accessibility, SFTW: Screenreader, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, PRDT: Medical-records

### **Finding 11:** **Most participants expressed that they value direct access to their medical records as compared to generating a Blue Button report.**

19 of 24 participants prefer accessing their records directly as opposed to through a Blue Button report. The reasons provided ranged from the ease and speed of direct access to their records, to promoting a greener lifestyle, to not wanting to download large files. Those who are AT-dependent cited issues with accessibility with PDFs and having to go through pages of documentation to find a specific record.

_“I would definitely say this format for me is better because I'm going straight to what I need, like just if I want something specific, that's all I care to look at.” – AT Participant 08_

Labels: Accessibility, SFTW: Screenreader, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, PRDT: Medical-records

### **Finding 12: Most participants chose the rating “easy” or “very easy” when evaluating Vaccines, Allergies and reactions, Vitals, Print/download.**

At the end of each set of tasks within a domain, participants were presented with a likert scale that ranged from “very difficult” to “very easy” and were asked to rate the ease of finding records in the specific domain.

22 of 25 participants rated the Vaccines experience as “easy” or “very easy.”

19 of 21 participants rated the Allergies and reactions experience as “easy” or “very easy.”

20 of 25 participants rated the Vitals experience as “easy” or “very easy.”

21 of 23 participants rated the print/download experience as “easy” or “very easy.”

_”It’s easily a 5. That was actually awesome.” – Participant 04_

_“I like this format better 'cause it's a little clearer than anything that is currently being, you know, done… this is a more straightforward in understanding the information and what you need to get.” –AT Participant 10_

Labels: Accessibility, SFTW: Screenreader, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, PRDT: Medical-records

### **Finding 13: Few AT-dependent participants chose the rating “easy” or “very easy” when evaluating Care summaries and notes while most non-AT-dependent participants chose the rating “easy” or “very easy.”**

3 of 11 AT-dependent participants rated Care summaries and notes as “easy” or “very easy” as opposed to 12 of 13 non-AT-dependent participants. This is likely attributed to the data staging issues that resulted in incorrect dates on the list page. Participants were navigating by dates and became confused when they did not match their expectation of chronological order. Additionally, one of the records they were tasked with finding was on page two.

_“I got it, but it wasn't very easy. And then the hospital stay was a 2 just because it was kind of all over the place.” – AT Participant 03_

## Additional Insights

**Additional Finding 1: Some AT-dependent participants indicated a preference for a search or filter feature within Vaccines, Vitals, and Care Summaries and Notes.**

**Additional Finding 2: Some participants struggled with medical terminology such as Vaccine names TDAP and Zoster, the Allergy symptoms anaphylaxis and urticaria.**

**Additional Finding 3: Some non-AT dependent participants expected the most severe allergies to be listed at the top of the list. All of these participants self-identified as having a cognitive disability.**

**Additional Finding 4: Many non-AT dependent participants were unable to immediately identify the sort order on the Allergies and reactions list page.**

**Additional Finding 5: When asked to find a doctor’s note, 5 participants stated they would look in Appointments.**

**Additional Finding 6: Some participants referenced admission notes when asked to find information about post-hospitalization at-home care.**

## Recommendations

- Explore the feasibility of providing data visualizations to supplement the numeric data values for vitals over time.
  - _Veterans with cognitive disabilities may struggle to understand the changes of their vitals over time in the current format._
  - _Data visualizations in the form of charts or graphs would enable all Veterans to quickly make sense of their vitals trends over time._
- Update code on Vitals, Vaccines, and Allergies list pages to make ‘Back to top’ button visible. This should include lowering the viewport threshold to 320px so the button also appears on smaller mobile view ports.
  - _Screen reader users who go through pages line-by-line will take a long time to reach the top of a page, especially in long lists._
  - _This will benefit all Veterans by reducing excessive scrolling which is especially important on mobile._
- Explore solutions to increase visibility of pagination to screen reader users.
  - _Screen reader users are missing both the record count and pagination which leads to missing records that are not on the first page._
