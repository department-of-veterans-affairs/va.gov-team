# **Conversation Guide – AT USERS**

## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\]. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving the VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA.

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call.

Our accessibility specialist is in the waiting room. Before I let them in, I want to let you know that they will be here to help us navigate any accessibility troubles we might have. They will also help us with any screen-reader troubleshooting we may need to do during this time. I’m going to let them into the session and have her introduce herself to you.

(_Let \__in)_

\___\__, do you mind (turning on your camera) and introducing yourself to \[PARTICIPANT\]?

Thank you.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session and help take notes so that we can accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

- _(If yes, let them in. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")_
- _(NOTETAKER & OBSERVERS JOIN)_ We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's \[NAME\] Please turn on your camera and introduce yourself to \[PARTICIPANT\]
- Could the notetaker and observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? _(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")_

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 90 minutes (about 1 and a half hours).** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- I will soon be sharing a link with you to the website we will be looking at today using your screen reader. This is a live site; it will behave as expected when you are on a typical website.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** _Start recording to the cloud._
- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

Have you ever shared your screen on Zoom before?

_(If yes – proceed to share link)_

Our Accessibility specialist will help walk you through how to do this. Do you mind unmuting and walking \[PARTICIPANT\] through this, \[A11Y specialist\]?

### **JAWS Screen Share**

- The first thing you need to do is put focus on the JAWS window – ALT + TAB
- JAWS - ALT + S – Screen share.
- Voiceover and NVDA – Tab to “More meeting controls”, then arrow down to “share screen” and “enter”.
- This puts you on “share sound” dialogue.
- Hit space, then tab over 3 times, then hit enter.

### **Voiceover Screen Share**

- Put focus on the menu, swipe right until you get to “share”
- You cannot always hear Voiceover even when sound is shared.

## **Participant Coaching**

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own. Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can’t see your screen.

_\[for MHV users\]_ This is going to feel slightly familiar, but please remember that this is a new design we are testing and some elements you might expect to be there will not and some you don’t expect will. I would like you to treat this entire website like it were not MHV at all.

Since we are trying to make this experience as realistic as possible, you may notice that at the top right the name Pat. If this were your page, it would be your name, but for today you will notice Pat at the top of your screen. We will approach this from Pat’s point of view today.

Are you ready to get started?

## **Task 1: Vaccination – 10 minutes**

**_\[Participant is on Landing page\]_**

- Have you ever accessed your Vaccine records in My HealtheVet?
  - \[If yes\] Was there something specific you wanted to review?
  - Could you tell me about that?

Thank you for sharing that.

Please keep in mind that we are reviewing a new website today. Some things will seem familiar, but this is not going to be like the My HealtheVet you are used to.

- Let's say that you want to confirm that Pat received a flu shot in 2022. Walk me through how you would check for that on this website.

\[_When found_\]

_\[If they do not find the “Go to your allergy records link\]_

We are going to pause here so I can get some feedback about this Vaccines experience.

I am going to provide you a rating scale that we will be using throughout today’s session.

On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being very difficult, 2 being difficult, 3 being neither difficult nor easy, 4 being easy and 5 being very easy, please rate the difficulty of finding Pat’s flu vaccine.

## **Screener Interview – Users with CD**

Thank you for taking the time to get through all those tasks with me today and answering all our questions. It has been super helpful.

Our goal in these studies is to make sure we represent the point of view of all Veterans. This is why we are committed to recruiting participants with cognitive disabilities so that we can design an experience that meets their needs.

_\[if no\]_

We will be sure to make that correction. Thank you.

_\[if no\]_

That’s no problem. Thank you so much for participating today.

_\[if yes\]_

## **Emergency Exit**
