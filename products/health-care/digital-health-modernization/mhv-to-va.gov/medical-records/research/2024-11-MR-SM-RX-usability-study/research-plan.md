# **Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medical Records & Medications, November 2024**

## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We initially built and tested various iterations of Secure Messages, Medications, and Medical Records in MHV on VA.gov. We conducted usability studies and collected feedback that informed iterations on the website. In this round of usability testing we will assess the new functionality of filters in Medications and Medical Records and the latest iteration of filters in Secure Messages to explore further pain points.

### **OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### **Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging


## **Research Goals**

1. Identify any pain points Veterans may experience in using the filter function to find their messages, medications, and medical records.  
2. Understand how Veterans use filters to find messages, medications, and medical records.
3. Understand Veterans’ needs and expectations for using filters within Secure Messages, Medications, and Medical Records.

## **Outcome**

The results of the study will help us determine if our designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to find their messages, medications, and medical records and help to identify any pain points. This will inform future design iterations.

## **Research questions**

1. Do filters help Veterans find their messages, medications, and medical records?
2. How do Veterans use filters to find their messages, medications, and medical records?
3. What are Veterans’ use cases for filters in Secure Messaging, Medications, and Medical Records?
4. What are Veterans’ expectations for filter functionality in each product?

## **Hypotheses**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will perceive the filters as helpful in all products.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will understand the difference among the filter options in Medications.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will find messages, medications, and medical records using the filters.

_Hypothesis 4:_ Veterans will have varied use cases and thresholds for employing filters.

## **Methodology**

We will conduct moderated usability testing sessions in which we will ask users to navigate both a prototype and a live Codespace environment while we observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

### **Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
