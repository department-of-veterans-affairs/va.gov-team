## Research Goals

1. Identify any pain points Veterans may experience in using the filter function to find their messages, medications, and medical records.
2. Understand how Veterans use filters to find messages, medications, and medical records.
3. Understand Veterans’ needs and expectations for using filters within Secure Messages, Medications, and Medical Records.

## Research Questions

1. Do filters help Veterans find their medications, medical records, and secure messages?
2. How do Veterans use filters to find their medications, medical records, and secure messages?
3. Under what circumstances do Veterans use filters in Medications, Medical Records and Secure Messaging?
4. What are Veterans’ expectations for filter functionality in each product?

## Methodology

We conducted moderated usability testing sessions in which we will ask users to navigate both a prototype and a live Codespace environment while we observed their behavior, and asked follow-up prompts as needed.  

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will understand the difference among the filter options in Medications.

MOSTLY FALSE: Most Veterans expressed confusion about the “Renewal needed before refill” filter option. However, all Veterans understood the meaning of the “Recently requested” filter

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will find messages, medications, and medical records using the filters.

TRUE: Most Veterans used filters to find specific records in all three products

_Hypothesis 3:_ Veterans will have varied circumstances and thresholds for employing filters.

TRUE: Most Veterans used dates to filter their medical records, and most Veterans used the sender or subject to search their messages, while many Veterans also used the custom date filter to narrow down the search

## Key Findings

1. Participants had a mixed understanding of the Medications filter options.

      i. Few participants (2 of 12) successfully located an expired medication without assistance.

      ii. All participants (11 of 11) chose the “Recently requested” filter to find medications ordered within the last week. Most participants (8 of 11) then successfully located recent medication orders without assistance.
3. Most participants (11 of 12) failed the task of clearing the filter in Medications.
4. Many participants (5 of 12) missed the filter button when attempting to use the filter function in Medications.
5. Most participants used the date filter to find various medical records without assistance.

     i. 8 of 12 participants successfully found a vaccine without assistance.

     ii. 8 of 11 participants successfully found a specific height without assistance.

    iii. 10 of 12 participants successfully found a specific primary care note without assistance.

   iv. 6 of 8 participants successfully found a specific test result without assistance.
7. Most participants used filters to find various secure messages without assistance.
8. Participants primarily filtered by message subject and/or doctor name to find specific secure messages.
9. Most participants used a filter when it was clearly visible, the specified record was more than a year old, or if the list of records was especially long.
10. Most participants did not expect filter selections to carry over between domains or products.

      i. 7 of 12 participants stated they did not expect Medications filters to be saved after they leave the product.

     ii. 7 of 9 participants stated they did not expect filtering to carry over from Vaccines into Vitals.
12. Many participants (5 of 12) stated they would like to search, sort, or filter by medication name.
13. Half of participants (6 of 12) stated they would like to search Lab and Test Results by keyword.

## Details of Findings

**Finding 1: Participants had a mixed understanding of the Medications filter options.**

2 of 12 participants successfully used the “Renewal needed before refill” filter to find an expired medication in need of renewal. Participants consistently expressed confusion while looking through the filter options, especially when deciding which option would filter down to expired medications. Both the “Renewal needed before refill” and “Non-active” filter options had descriptions that included expired medications, which was a main contributor to participants’ confusion.

On the other hand, 11 of 11 participants successfully chose the “Recently requested” filter when asked to find medications ordered within the last week. The filter was already open when they were asked to complete this task, whereas the filter accordion started from collapsed when participants were asked to find the expired medication needing renewal.

_"\[Renewal needed\] kind of seems similar to non-active, but maybe if they worded it differently...”_ \- Participant 05

_"I would not have assumed that \[Renewal needed\] would have been the thing I wanted.”_ \- Participant 07

**Finding 2: Most participants failed the task of clearing the filter in Medications.**

11 of 12 participants attempted a variety of invalid methods when they were asked to reset or remove the current Medications filter. 7 of 12 participants closed the filter accordion to collapse the filter, and another 2 of 12 participants selected the “All medications” radio button and then collapsed the accordion without clicking filter first.

The final 2 participants who failed the task thought the filters could be used as checkboxes and tried to uncheck the radio button that was selected.

_"I don’t really see a way that’s intuitive.”_ \- Participant 08

**Finding 3: Many participants missed the filter button when attempting to use the filter function in Medications.**

Throughout the Medications filter tasks, 5 of 12 participants didn’t hit the “Filter” button before scrolling past the accordion to use the filter they had just selected. Those participants expressed confusion when the results list wasn’t filtered in the way they expected. These results suggest that the workflow to implement a filter is not intuitive for all users.

_“I would do the recently requested... so you want me to click it... wait. Oh, I’m sorry the filter didn’t... I didn’t hit the filter. Right?”_ \- Participant 10

**Finding 4: Most participants used the date filter to find various medical records without assistance.**

Task success rates were higher in Medical Records, which came after the Medications filter tasks. 8 of 12 participants filtered by date to successfully find a vaccine from 9 years ago without assistance.

In Vitals, 8 of 11 participants independently used the filter to find a specific height from June of 2018. 10 of 12 participants successfully used the filter and found a specific primary care note without assistance in Care Summaries and Notes.

Participants had to filter to the past 6 months, then navigate to page 3 to find a specified record in Lab and Test Results. 6 of 8 participants were able to find the record without assistance.

_"I would go down to the filter, and with this I would just click on 6 months and then apply the filter.”_ \- Participant 05

_"You could do it by... month, year... but being able to select it and kind of narrow it down rather than having to go through your vitals for the last 7 or 8 years... I could see that being tedious. So that’s good news for us.”_ \- Participant 10

**Finding 5: Most participants used filters to find various secure messages without assistance.**

In the final section of tasks, participants were asked to search for a variety of records within Secure Messages. 10 of 12 participants successfully found a message from their doctor in January about a medication. These 10 of 12 participants chose to start by filtering their messages when looking for that specific message.

8 of 12 participants found a message from another doctor about a bug bite in July of 2022, though all 12 of 12 participants started their search by filtering their messages.

6 of 8 participants found a message from this past spring about the VA’s MOVE program, though again, all 8 of 8 participants started by filtering.

_"It’s pretty easy and I like the fact that you can zero in on it with a multi-tiered search. \[I\] probably could have gotten it even closer... if I put Joelitol in there, or medication in there."_ \- Participant 08

**Finding 6: Participants primarily filtered by message subject and/or doctor name to find specific secure messages.**

Participants used a variety of identifiers when deciding how to filter their secure messages, but the majority relied on the free text search field which allows the Veteran to search messages by to, from, message ID, or subject.

During their search for a message about their medication, 5 participants searched the doctor’s name in the filter by keyword field, while 4 participants searched the medication name. Of those who found the add filters button, only 2 participants used the category filter and 3 used the date filter.

In the second Secure Messages task, participants were asked to search for a message from Dr. Owens that was sent in July of 2022 about a bug bite. 8 participants searched the doctor’s name in the search field, 3 searched “bug bite,” and 4 participants filtered by the general category while 6 filtered by date. 2 additional participants attempted to use the sort feature.

The final Secure Messages task involved finding a message from Dr. Owens about the MOVE Program sent this past spring. To find the message, 2 participants searched the doctor’s name, 5 participants searched “Move” or “Move Program,” and 1 participant filtered by the general category while 2 filtered with the education category. 2 participants also used a custom date filter to find messages from the spring.

Across the tasks, a few participants used the search field as if it were a search engine and searched phrases like “Dr. Owens” or “Dr Owen’s July 2022.” These searches did not produce any results as they didn’t precisely match the messages’ senders or subject lines. This behavior may suggest that the Veterans do not fully understand the limitations of the search field.

_"I go to my inbox first and if I know the doctor’s name, filter by the doctor.”_ \- Participant 03

_"There’s a filter here so hopefully I could go in and filter by the doctor’s name.”_ - Participant 08

**Finding 7: Most participants used a filter if it was clearly visible, if the specified record was more than a year old, or if the list of records was especially long.**

Among Medications, Medical Records, and Secure Messages, participants promptly used the filter when it was already expanded and hard to miss. In Medications, participants often missed the collapsed filter, possibly because it blended in or because they didn’t feel a need for it. In Medical Records, participants may have used the date filter because they were primed with the Medications filter task beforehand, or because filtering by date was more straightforward. Lastly, in Secure Messages, participants readily used the filter as it was more eye-catching than in the other products. As shown in the previous finding, participants were more inclined to filter by keyword than by category or date, which were both hidden behind the “Add filters” accordion.

Participants seemed to have a subjective limit of how many records would be too many to scroll through. Within Medical Records, all participants who used the filter chose the custom date option for 2015, June of 2018, or Halloween of 2023. All participants who used the filter for a prompt asking to find a record from approximately 5 months ago used the 6-month filter.

_"It’s kind of weird that you... filter the messages with information from one of the fields and then you filter the date. I would probably miss the add filter.”_ \- Participant 10

_“You can scroll down to look for hemoglobin A1C, but with that many records... I don’t want to keep scrolling. So I might just filter lab results on this one.”_ \- Participant 03

**Finding 8: Most participants did not expect filter selections to carry over between domains or products.**

7 of 12 participants stated that they did not expect Medications filter selections to be saved if they navigated to a new page then returned to Medications. However, 4 of those 7 stated they would have appreciated it if the filter had been saved.

When posed with a similar question regarding whether a 2015 filter on Vaccines should also carry over to Vitals, 7 of 9 participants stated they did not expect the 2015 filter to automatically apply to other domains.

_"I don’t expect it \[to still be filtered\], but if it was, it would be nice.”_ \- Participant 04

_"I would expect the filter to have cleared when I left it... I just thought that the pages would automatically clear, so that they would be current the next time you did pick them up.”_ - Participant 07

**Finding 9: Many participants stated they would like to search, sort, or filter by medication name.**

5 of 12 participants stated they would like to search the Medications page by medication name. Participants were given a list of approximately 370 medications and were more hesitant to use the filter in this product than they were in the other products.

4 of 12 participants also stated that they would like the medications to be sorted alphabetically by name. Multiple participants expressed confusion regarding the current sort order, and medication statuses did not guide the participant in their search as much as the medication name did.

Lastly, 5 of 12 participants requested a sort/filter feature that would allow them to choose a specific letter of the alphabet and only see medications starting with that letter. A tool such as this could be useful if Veterans are unsure about medication spelling.

_"If I would have had a filter or a search bar for the name, BINGO, it would have popped up immediately.”_ \- Participant 01

_"I guess if it had a little quick box that you just put the first couple of letters in and be able to bring it up.”_ \- Participant 09

**Finding 10: Half of the participants stated they would like to search Lab and Test Results by keyword.**

6 of 12 participants stated that they would like to be able to search results by keyword when searching for a specific record in Lab and Test Results. 3 participants stated that they would like their records to be sorted alphabetically, and 2 participants would like them to be sorted by test type.

_"It would be nice to be able to just search hemoglobin A1C... I would expect that as soon as I start typing ‘hemo,’ it would fill in the rest.”_ - Participant 03

_"It would probably be better if I could put \[hemoglobin\] into a search.”_ - Participant 11

## Additional Insights

**Additional Finding 1: Many participants wanted their active medications to be the default setting.**

7 of 12 participants thought their active medications were most important to see within the Medications product. 4 participants wanted only their active medications displayed by default, and 3 participants preferred to show active and expired medications by default.

The 5 remaining participants did not give an explicit answer of what they would like to see by default.

**Additional Finding 2: Many participants misunderstood medical terminology at some point during the session.**

7 of 12 participants struggled with health literacy content during the session, specifically in the Medical Records product. 5 of 8 participants expressed confusion about where a Hemoglobin A1C result would be found in Lab and Test Results, and 3 participants thought it might be part of a CBC.

Additionally, when asked whether they ever reviewed vitals from their past, 4 of 11 participants conflated labs with vitals and listed out past labs that they have reviewed.

_“I mean, I would just guess… It doesn’t say A1C, so I would just assume that complete blood count is what they’re talking about.”_ – Participant 05

## Recommendations

- Workshop other ideas for the Medications filters.
  - _Participants struggled to understand the meaning of the Medications filters, then were largely unable to reset the filter to show all medications when asked._
