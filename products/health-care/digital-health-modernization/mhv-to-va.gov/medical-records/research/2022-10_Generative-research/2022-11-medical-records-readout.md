### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to gain insight into user needs and goals related to medical records, users' emic understandings of medical records-related terms, and how these needs, goals, and understandings influence their behaviors. This information will inform the redesign of health records on the Health Apartment on VA.gov. 

## Research Questions

1. What terms do Veterans and Caregivers use to describe: medical records, laboratory results, medical test results, medical imaging, radiology, pathology, service-related records from the Department of Defense, admissions & discharge summaries, pre-visit and after-visit summaries, and procedures? 

2. How do Veterans and Caregivers understand the existing medical records-related terminology on MHV and how does that understanding shape their behavior on the website (e.g., where they look for specific information)? 

3. What actions do Veterans and Caregivers need to take with their medical records and for what purposes?

## Methodology 

### Data collection
We conducted remote interviews with Zoom. These interviews included questions about user needs and goals related to medical records, what users expect medical records should include, what terms they use and how they understand existing terms found in the legacy MHV. The interviews also included a moderated card sorting activity. 

### Data analysis
We had three sets of data to analyze: observer notes organized in a [Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1666625596260/90fc2a6158fd66770cd596c2c8c28b5602cee416?invited=true&sender=u7de68ed54bc434b67b630908), results from the open ended card sort in Optimal Workshop, and interview transcripts. We triangulated across these different data types to arrive at findings. 

First, we reviewed the Mural board notes and grouped like items. Next, we reviewed the card sort results and wrote notes about how ideas were categorized. Based on these activities, we drafted hypothesis findings. Next, we reviewed transcripts, constantly comparing comments across and within transcripts to identify recurring patterns and useful or interesting outliers. We wrote notes throughout this constant comparison, confirming, invalidating, and/or hypothesis findings. 

To create the narratives: 
We drew from multiple interviews to create composite narratives around use cases. These narratives are not meant to be all encompassing; their purpose, rather, is to provide a storied context for the use cases. 

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypothesis 1:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will use different terms than those displayed via Blue Button reports for at least some of the medical records-related terms. 

   TRUE: Participants used terms like "Health history," "Health record", "Chart", and "Portal," in addition to "Medical records." Some also used the term "My" in conjunction with other options - e.g., "My Chart," "My Health Record," "My Health History." 

_Hypthesis 2:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will not understand all of the medical records-related terms without support.
   
   TRUE: Terms like "Pathology results" and "Encounter notes" often generated confusion amongst participants. Medical terms found on Blue Button reports were not universally understood by participants. 

_Hypothesis 3:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will not know what Blue Buttona and VA Health Summary include, nor will know where to find specific information across the three options. 
   
   TRUE: Participants consistently misunderstood what was available in Blue Button and VA Health Summary reports. 

_Hypothesis 4:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will want to be able to view and share their medical records, while others will want to identify key information to use for other purposes (e.g., to support a disability claim).

   TRUE: Use cases for medical records can be broadly categorized into wanting to understand one's records, advocate and coordinate care using one's records, and record keep. These use cases will be explained in greater detail in the findings section. 

## Key Findings

1. Participants used a range of terms to refer to medical records, such as "Health history," "Health record", "Chart", and "Portal," in addition to "Medical records." Some also used the term "My" in conjunction with other options - e.g., "My Chart," "My Health Record," "My Health History." 

2. Electronic medical records can be viewed, downloaded, or shared. Participants described wanting to access their medical records to: 
   - Understand their health by reviewing vitals or other health monitorings (by viewing online)
   - Monitoring their needs, particularly appointments or medications and medication refills (by viewing online)
   - Understand an issue by reviewing doctors' notes, labs/tests, images with notes, or past appointments or medications (by viewing online)
   - Advocate for their needs by reviewing what has and hasn't been done (by viewing online)
   - Coordinate care across healthcare providers, particularly with providers outside the VA (by sharing)
   - Keep a local record that they can review or adapt as needed (by downloading)
   - Identify evidence that can be used to obtain benefits, including non-VA benefits (by viewing, downloading, and sharing)

3. The most common categories participants used during the card sort included lab/test results (12 out of 15 participants), and separate categories for "non-body" health issuess - mental health and dental health (10 out of 15 participants). 

4. An "About me/ Personal information" category was often created by participants, though the contents of this category differed. Some included demographic information, ongoing monitoring information like vitals, allergies and immunizations, and a "shapshot" of current health, issues, and treatments. Others contained only some of this information. This category varied the most across interviews and explanations often seemed contradictory and incoherent, however, this category still existed in the majority (n=10) of interviews. 

5. Most participants organized or described expecting medical record information to be accessed in relation to one of three "anchors": by appointments; by the location or type of facility; or by practice area. 

6. Time was a consistent theme across interviews. Participants expected information to be organized in relation to time -  most often with most recent information more easily accessible, particularly if a patient needed to do anything with information (e.g., schedule a follow-up visit, or ask a question for a healthcare provider). In this way, time intersected with urgency, in that some participants described wanting recent information that needed to be acted upon made immediately evident in health records. 

7. Participants had a range of interpretations for some medical terminology, like "pathology results", indicating misunderstanding of some health terms found in current medical records. 

## Details of Findings 

**1. Participants used a range of terms to refer to medical records, such as "Health history," "Health record", "Chart", and "Portal," in addition to "Medical records." Some also used the term "My" in conjunction with other options - e.g., "My Chart," "My Health Record," "My Health History."**

The most common term used was "health record" or "medical record," followed by "health history" and "patient portal." 

Participants consistently argued that the same term should be used for online records as paper-based records.

### Narrative to exemplify "Understand and/or monitor health" purpose for using medical records
_Leah is a former field medic who now assists her stepfather in accessing his VA healthcare. For both herself and him, she likes to regularly view their medical records online to make sure that she understands what happened in a given visit, if labs or tests have revealed problems, and if she has any follow-up questions or tasks to do. Regularly reviewing their records helps Leah to feel on top of their health needs - particularly her stepfather’s, since his needs grow more complicated with age._

### Narrative to exemplify "As reference to communicate with HCPs" purpose for using medical records
_Jerry is currently in remission from cancer but regularly goes in for checkups. He reviews test results and after visit summaries; when he has a question for his doctor, he will take a screenshot to reference and include it in a secure message. He will do that with VA doctors but also with non-VA doctors, whether through email or other patient portals. Jerry’s had a lot of difficulty sharing documents with non-VA providers so he either sends screenshots or prints off documents or burns CDs to bring to appointments._ 

_Once, Jerry needed a visit with a specialist that the VA said he had already had. Jerry combed through his medical records to prove that he had not had this appointment, and eventually secured the help he needed._ 

### Narrative to exemplify "Keep a local record" purpose for using medical records
_Phillip downloaded his medical records onto a thumb drive before leaving the military. He worried he would lose the records while transitioning out and wanted his records secure. Even now, he regularly downloads a copy of his records to his laptop. He also copies his medications list into a Word document and manually updates this list so that his wife can find the information if he one day “clutches his chest” and can’t tell her what medications he is on._

### Narrative to exemplify "Identify evidence that can be used to obtain benefits" purpose for using medical records
_Ramona needed to file a claim for a service-related shoulder injury. She called the VA and had them email her complete medical records. Using all the keywords she could think of, Ramona went through and scrubbed the file for all things related to her shoulder injury, pulling out the relevant sections. She organized these sections and highlighted the magical words she knew were required to get her claim through - “injury most likely due to service”. She then submitted her claim with these sections as proof._

**3. The most common categories participants used during the card sort included lab/test results (12 out of 15 participants), and separate categories for "non-body" health issuess - mental health, vision health, and dental health (10 out of 15 participants).**

Lab/ test results were created by 12 out of 15 participants, representing the most consistent category. They were most often called "labs/tests" or "test results" by participants, and almost always included "Pathology results" (a category that is currently separate from labs/test results in Blue Button reports). Almost half of these participants (5 out of 12) created a separate category for images, which included radiology results and images, MRI results, and ultrasound results. 

   - _"So it looks like there's tests, blood tests, and I think that seems like an easy one to start. So I'm going to pull in blood sugar, blood tests, antibody tests, okay. And then I'm thinking is there anything like a test? SO I would kind of think like ultrasound results would be kinda similar...I guess its different but like tests will have like a result from that. An ultrasound is maybe not a test but they seem similar enough so I maybe kepe it in this box."_ Male Veteran, age 34, MHV account

"Non-body" health issues - i.e., those relating to mental health, dental health, and/or vision health - were commonly placed in separate categories (10 out of 15 participants). Participants who separated these cards either retained them in distinct categories or incorporated them into a general category that represented mental, vision, and dental health-related terms. 

   - _"They are a different section of the VA almost."_ Male Veteran, age 56, MHV account

**4. An "About me/ Personal information" category was often created by participants, though the contents of this category differed.** 

Some versions of this category included demographic information, ongoing monitoring information like vitals, allergies and immunizations, and a "shapshot" of current health, issues, and treatments. Others contained only some of this information. 

<img width="921" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100814257/202789539-f350fbd1-1a4b-482c-81c5-6c23dc70877e.png">

The purpose of this category varied. Some participants framed the category as providing key information to doctors about a patient. 

   - _"[Personal information group is] anything about yourself - age, height, weight. Any information that a doctor needs to know before prescribing medication."_ Female Caregiver, age 39, no MHV account

Others wanted the most pressing or current information to be centrally located - in this way, this category simultaneously functioned similar to a "to do list". 

This category varied the most across interviews and explanations often seemed contradictory and incoherent; however, this category still existed in the majority (n=10) of interviews. It is possible that a different interview guide would have led to participants distinguish more consistently between demographic information, current health status, and most pressing issues. This will be explored in concept testing. 


**5. Most participants organized or described expecting medical record information to be organized in relation to one of three "anchors": by appointments; by the location or type of facility; or by practice area.**

By "anchors," we mean something that participants organized information around or described expecting or wanting to find health record information in relation to. 

### Appointments
For example, approximately half (n=7) of participants described expecting to find notes, lab and test results, medications prescribed connected with the appointment in which these things were produced. 

_"These could be a category called appointments, so individual appointments would be easier to find...lab test results could go under appointment information...whatever notes the doctor has left (about a visit)."_ - Veteran, male, age 70, MHV account

Some distinguished between future and past appointments, expecting these to be separate. 

_"I have appointments, which is just going to be sort of like the future case for things that are coming up."_ - Veteran, Veteran family member, Caregiver, male, age 37, MHV account

<img width="1178" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100814257/203352513-494eba9d-eef4-4b4c-83dd-0d2d37a0aa9a.png">

### Location or Facility type

A second anchor expressed by approximately a third of participants (n=6) related to the location or facility type in which a medical interaction occurs. Most often participants described expecting information to be organized by information produced in outpatient environments (e.g., checkups with a doctor) and those produced in inpatient environments (e.g., surgeries that results in hospital stays). 

_Interviewer: Can you tell me the difference between Hospitalized Treatments and Appointments?_ 

_Participant: So Hospitalized Treatments I would say you are not really making an appointment. I guess you could, but you are not going to see your primary care, you are going admitted to the hospital side of the VA instead of getting a well-check. That is my thought of that._ - Veteran, female, age 40, MHV account

<img width="958" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100814257/203352990-6ab68de3-74cf-4683-a720-43c2bdf75011.png">

### Practice area or diagnosis

This anchor reflects information organization around the HCP practice area or diagnosis participants referred to. For example, participants described organizing information by information produced in interactions with a general practitioner versus by that produced by an orthopedist, podiatrist, or other specialty. 

_"Whatever area the doctor is treating is in, you could go to that specialty care tab and find the images, the doctor notes, the medication, I feel like it could all be in one spot. Maybe different parts of the body could have its own section._ - Veteran, female, age 40, MHV account

Others described wanting to look for information relating to a particular diagnosis they had received, usually by specialists - e.g., a shoulder injury or traumatic brain injury. Because these diagnoses often overlapped with medical specialties, we consider them deviations from the same general category. 

Organizing by HCPs was also cited as an easy way to organize information. However, two participants with greater health burdens and regular interactions with health system argued that this would get confusing quickly, given that HCPs can leave practices or patients could forget the name of HCPs they are less familiar with.

<img width="972" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100814257/203360418-2bfb470a-7f53-4353-b351-6dadef72b540.png">

**6. Time was a consistent theme across interviews.** 

Participants expected time to inform the organization of information -  most often with most recent information more easily accessible. When asked, participants described expecting most recent information to be at the top of a page with less recent information further down. 

Several participants described desiring that information be elevated that required an action on their part - e.g., schedule a follow-up visit or ask a question to a healthcare provider. In this way, time intersected with urgency, in that some participants described wanting recent information that needed to be acted upon made immediately evident in health records.

_"When you're managing someone else's health, if you're waiting for a referral, approval, or something to take me to the next step. I just want to focus on what I have to do with dad. I don't want that information stuck in the middle of the chart - I want to reference it quickly. Like if the most recent visit's discharge summary prompted a referral or appointment. I want to have that."_ - Caregiver, female, age 57, no MHV account

At times, this manifested as explicit requests for reminders or cues to action: 

_"I would say under my account if there was a medical history that would be good, maybe listing them out as up-to-date or over-due. Because I did go to an appointment once, and they said it looks like you are over-due for this and I was like what! So something that categorize what needs to be done, like this shot needs to be done this month. Something like that. That goes into…getting reminders about that. Like text reminders from the VA."_ - Veteran, female, age 40, MHV account

**7. Participants had a range of interpretations for some medical terminology, like "pathology results", indicating misunderstanding of some health terms found in current medical records.** 

_Pathology results:_ Responses were not consistent. Amongst those asked (n=11), most understood to be relating to fluids in the body, such as blood, that were drawn out to search for indicators of an illness, cancer, infection, etc. Two participants stated they did not know what pathology results were, while two others included things like x-rays or toxins like drugs or alcohol in their definitions. 

<img width="401" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100814257/204381386-275ee103-5738-4bf7-bc74-175583fd03b8.png">

_Pre-visit summary or After-visit summary:_ Responses were not consistent, though most participants understood pre-visit to happen before a visit and after-visit to happen after a visit. Participants were unclear or inconsistent on what information those documents included, and some did not understand how they differed from Admission or Discharge summaries. 

<img width="656" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100814257/204380721-771b81ff-67d1-4941-a6c2-72e0d173c6e1.png">

_Admission summary or Discharge summary:_ Only four participants were probed on these terms. Amongst these participants, Admission and Discharge summaries were associated with a hospital, rather than a clinical visit. 

<img width="385" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100814257/204381348-4c98347b-04c8-4de9-a4c2-dd5118e6989c.png">

_Encounter notes:_ The term "encounter notes" elicited the most negative reactions amongst participants (n=7). Four out of the seven associated encounter notes with mental health in ways that alarmed them. One described an encounter as an interaction between a psychiatrist and someone having a PTSD episode.
