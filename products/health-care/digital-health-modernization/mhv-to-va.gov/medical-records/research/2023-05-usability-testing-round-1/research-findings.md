## **Research Goals**

Veterans and their caregivers may need to access their medical records to manage their healthcare from the time they are first starting up in their journey through the end of their lives. This may be especially important for those who experience chronic or major illnesses. Veterans vary in their skills and comfort with technology use as well as their health literacy.

The purpose of this research was to:

1. Understand if Veterans can locate their medical records.
2. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience with accessing different parts of their medical records.
3. Identify what information is helpful to Veterans in finding different parts of their medical records.
4. Evaluate the usability of the print and download functions.

## **Research Questions**

1. Can Veterans find the information they need to manage their health related to:
  - Labs and test results
  - Care summaries and notes
  - Allergies
  - Vaccines
  - Vitals
  - Health conditions
2. Do Veterans know how to access information within the tool that will help them understand their medical records?
3. Do Veterans know how to print/download both an individual record or list as well as their entire medical record?

## **Methodology**

We conducted remote moderated usability testing interviews in which we asked users to navigate the prototype, we observed their behavior, and asked follow-up prompts as needed. We asked participants to perform the following tasks on the prototype:

Task 1: EKG + Radiology

1. Find date of most recent EKG
2. Review 'Lab and test results' page and provide feedback
3. Find ankle x-rays from March 2022

Task 2: Bloodwork + Download

1. Find bloodwork from October 3, 2021
2. Review results and provide feedback
3. Save a copy of the results

Task 3: Health History + Print

1. Identify the link to find consult notes
2. Find discharge papers from April 6 and 7, 2023
3. Find high blood pressure diagnosis date
4. Find blood pressure readings
5. Find date of fall 2022 flu shot
6. Print vaccine list

Task 4: Allergies

1. Find out how to add an allergy to the list
2. Print Penicillin record

Task 5: Share Your Medical Records

1. Print a copy of full medical records
2. Share medical records with new VA provider

## **Hypotheses and Conclusions**

**1. Veterans will be able to find most of the information they need to manage their health.**
   
   LIKELY TRUE: More than half of the participants were able to successfully complete more than 60% of their tasks.
   
**2. Veterans will understand how to print or download their medical records.**
   
   LIKELY TRUE: Most participants were able to download or print records without assistance and understood what the output would be.
   
**3. Some of the H1s will be a barrier to some Veterans' finding their medical records.**
   
   LIKELY TRUE: Many participants misunderstood the connotation of "share" in 'Share your medical records' while others avoided 'Health history' when searching for records. Many participants equated 'Share your medical records' with their   actual medical records, rather than 'Health history.'

**4. Some of the medical terminology and acronyms will be a barrier to some Veterans' understanding and/or interpreting their medical records.**

   TRUE: Most participants did not understand the acronyms on the complete blood count results. Many participants were unsure of or did not understand that hypertension is the clinical name for high blood pressure, and many searched in 'Labs and test results' for a high blood pressure diagnosis date.

## **Details of Findings**

1. **Most participants were able to find health information in more than 60% of the tasks without assistance.**

    **15 of 21 participants successfully completed 60% of the given tasks in each of the six domains without assistance.** Participants were given 10 tasks to complete among the domains. Some tasks were skipped when technical difficulties led to a time shortage, so completion is considered in percent of tasks attempted.

    1. **Most participants were able to find health records in 'Lab and test results**.'

        **17 of 21 found the newest EKG record in 'Lab and test results**.' Two participants looked in 'Care summaries and notes' expecting to find it on an after-visit summary. The average time on task among successful participants was 16 seconds.

        "_[The layout] is nice and clean. I like that, because… some of these things are things I would have looked up for [my Veteran husband] and it does offer details."_

        **13 of 21 identified the EKG as the newest based on the reverse chronological order of the records in 'Lab and test results.'** Six participants struggled to recognize the order, but after the moderator prompted them to return to 'Lab and test results' they eventually did. Five participants automatically assumed or expected the results to be listed from newest to oldest and some requested information that stated that explicitly on the page or an option to sort the results.

        "_What should be on this page is… 'most recent' or 'from most recent to whatever'."_

        **15 of 20 found an x-ray result record from March 2022 in 'Lab and test results.'** When the moderator asked the 5 participants who failed the task to find the record, it was clearly visible on the screen. Three participants left 'Lab and test results' and then returned without finding the record while two searched in 'Care summaries and notes.' The average time on task for successful participants was 8 seconds.

        "_I'd probably stay here in Lab – no, no it would have to be… 'Health history'?"_
  
        **20 of 21 found their 'Complete blood count' results from October 3, 2021 in 'Lab and test results.'** The average time on task for successful participants was 21 seconds with mobile users performing an average of 10 seconds faster than desktop/laptop users.

    1. **Most participants were able to find health records in 'Care summaries and notes.'**

       **11 of 20 found the 'Admission and discharge summary' from a hospital stay on April 6 and 7, 2023.** Amongthose that struggled with or failed the task altogether, 5 searched in 'Share your medical records,' 3 sought help in the 'Questions about this tool,' 2 attempted to click on the 'Go back to medical records on My HealtheVet website' link, and 3 stated they would message their provider. Several of these participants attempted more than one of these methods. The average time on task for successful participants was 53 seconds with mobile users performing an average of 12 seconds faster than desktop/laptop users.

       **18 of 20 stated they would look in 'Health history' for a surgical consult note** when asked to choose between 'Lab and test results,' 'Health history,' and 'Share your medical records.' Among those who chose 'Health history,' 8 stated that they used the process of elimination and 1 participant said they guessed.

    1. **Most participants were able to find health records in the 'Allergies.'**

       **16 of 17 were able to find the 'Allergies' page.** The average time on task for successful participants was 17 seconds with desktop/laptop users performing an average of 6 seconds faster than mobile users.

    1. **All participants were able to find a health record in 'Vaccines.'**

        **20 of 20 were able to find the flu shot (Influenza, Seasonal, Injectable) from October 28, 2022.** The average time on task was 28 seconds with mobile users performing an average of 1 second faster than desktop/laptop users. Most participants immediately found the 'Vaccines' page but needed time to identify the correct vaccine. For desktop/laptop users, the 'Health history' section in the navigation was expanded from the previous task, so participants could see it on the screen. Similarly, the 'Health history' portion of the menu was open on mobile.

        "_I like this… because on the current version of My HealtheVet, when I am trying to find out what immunizations and what vaccinations I've had, sometimes that can be a pain in the neck. This, I like."_

    1. **Most participants were able to find a health record in the 'Vitals.'**

        **14 of 20 found blood pressure readings in 'Vitals.'** Among the participants who struggled with or failed the task, 3 searched in 'Lab tests and results' and 3 searched in 'Care summaries and notes.' The average time on task for successful participants was 15 seconds with desktop/laptop users performing an average of 6 seconds faster than mobile users.

     1. **Many participants were able to find a health record in 'Health conditions.'**

        **9 of 21 found the high blood pressure diagnosis date of September 25, 2001, in 'Health conditions.'** Five of the nine successful participants volunteered in another task that they currently or previously suffered from a chronic or major illness. This likely indicates that they have had experience navigating their medical records. Among the participants who struggled with or failed the task, 6 started their search in 'Labs and test results,' and 4 started their search in 'Vitals.' There were 4 participants who had the record on the screen but did not know that 'hypertension' is the clinical name of high blood pressure while 4 participants made the connection but indicated uncertainty either directly or with their observable behavior. The average time on task for successful participants was 30 seconds with desktop/laptop users performing an average of 6 seconds faster than mobile users. Nine participants exhibited observable behavior that indicated hesitancy, uncertainty, and confusion.

        "_Would it fall under 'Hypertension for [high blood pressure]? I think that's linked with Hypertension."_

        LABELS: DSC: Card, DSC: Sidenav, PRDT: Medical-records, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Most participants did not notice or expand the various informational dropdowns.**
    1. **19 of 21 did not notice or expand the 'What to know about [domain name]' informational dropdowns** within the 7 domains. One participant opened the link in 'Lab and test results' while trying to determine if the EKG record from March 3, 2022 was the most recent. Another participant was searching for how to add an allergy to their list in 'Allergies.' The moderator prompted him with, "Is there anything on here that might help you?" After some scrolling, he found it.
    2. **15 of 20 did not notice or expand the 'Need help understanding your results?' informational dropdown** on the 'Complete blood count' results page. Among the 5 that did notice or expand the link, 3 were prompted by the moderator who asked, "What would you do within this website to try to understand [a result marked 'high']?"

        **12 of 20 participants wanted an explanation of their results and even expected a link with more information** like the informational dropdown that was located above the first result in the 8-card list. Among those twelve, 8 were using mobile devices on which the viewport contained about one and one third cards.

        **7 of 20 participants stated they use Google or other online sources to understand their results.**

       "_I would need to go back to the report that was written by the radiologist so that I could see what it said. Then I would most likely have to Google that to find out what that actually meant to normal people so that I would know what was going on."_

      1. **17 of 20 did not notice or expand the 'What to know about downloading records' informational dropdown** within the 7 domains plus 'Share your medical record.' The 3 participants who did notice or expand the dropdown were tasked with downloading the 'Complete blood count' results in 'Lab and test results.' Among those three, 2 were prompted by the moderator who asked, "What would you do if you were unsure about which to choose?" between PDF and TXT.
      2. **11 of 14 did not notice or expand the 'What your Blue Button report includes' informational dropdown** on the 'Share your medical records page.' Among the 3 who did notice or expand the link, 2 were prompted by the moderator who asked, "What does Blue Button mean to you?" Two of those 3 were not current My Health_e_Vet users. The one My HealtheVet user had stated that they are familiar with Blue Button.
      3. **11 of 19 did not notice or expand the 'What we share through VHIE' informational dropdown and 11 of 18 did not notice or attempt to select the "Learn more about VHIE" link** on the 'Share your medical records page.'
      
         LABELS: DSC: Additional info, PRDT: Medical-records, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Most participants understood how to download or print an individual record, a list, and their entire medical record.**
    1. **18 of 21 successfully downloaded the 'Complete blood count' results without assistance.** All three participants who struggled with or failed the task were in their 70s but attempted to save the results with methods that indicated confidence with technology. Two participants wanted to right-click and choose 'save as,' while the other was looking for the download option available in the browser.

       **19 of 21 chose PDF** as their preferred file format. One participant chose TXT, and one did not answer the question. Two participants stated they prefer to print rather than download.

       Among the reason participants gave for their preference for PDF are that they are easier to read than TXT files, they are universally accessible, they are difficult to alter, and they are more familiar.

    1. **20 of 20 successfully printed the list of vaccines without assistance.** Three participants were delighted with how easy it was with two comparing it to their current EHR.

        "_This is easy! Boy, it's so much better than my own. It's like day and night."_

     1. **16 of 19 successfully printed the Penicillin record on the 'Allergies' page without assistance**. All three participants who struggled with the task thought they had to download the list to get the one record. They were all My HealtheVet users.

        **12 of 17 successfully downloaded the Blue Button report of all medical records on the 'Share your medical record page' without assistance.** The average time on task for successful participants was 31 seconds with desktop/laptop users performing an average of 2 seconds faster than mobile users.

        Participants expressed concern that downloading the Blue Button would take hours and result in a lengthy file.

        **All participants (5 of 5) who****failed the task are current My HealtheVet users.**

         LABELS: DSC: Buttons, DSC: Experimental, PRDT: Medical-records, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Most participants are unfamiliar with the term 'Blue Button.'**

    **12 of 18 indicated their lack of familiarity with 'Blue Button' when asked, "What do you think is meant by 'Blue Button'?** Participants were tasked with downloading all their medical records to take to a community care provider. The moderator asked the question of those whose statements or observed behavior indicated hesitation or lack of familiarity.

    **Most of those participants (8 of 12) who are unfamiliar with Blue Button are frequent MHV users.**

    "_Download Blue Button report… What is that? Is that it? I have no earthly idea what that is."_

    "_I don't understand the Blue Button, to tell you the truth."_

    LABELS: PRDT: Medical-records, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Most participants were unable to find out how to add a new allergy** to their list.

    **12 of 16 were unable to find out how to add a new allergy**** to their list of allergies.** Three of the four participants who successfully completed the task found the information in 'How can I add information to my records?' under 'Questions about this medical records tool' on the 'About VA medical records' page.

    Two participants stated they would have used the link to return to My HealtheVet and three expected a form or an add button within 'Allergies.'

    **9 of 16 expected to be able to share the new allergy with the VA on the 'Share your medical record page.'**

    "_That just sounds like we're sharing something. Share your medical records."_

    "_I'm going to assume that by [Sharing through VHIE] that they're going to share their records with the VA."_

    LABELS: DSC: Additional info, PRDT: Medical-records, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Most participants listed blood pressure as one of the most important vitals.**

    **13 of 21 listed blood pressure as one of the most important vital measures to managing their health.** Participants listed it in combination with other vitals, but it was always mentioned first.

    **6 of 17 listed blood pressure first in their suggested order of Vitals.** Six Participants listed blood pressure first and one listed it second among all who preferred an order aside from alphabetical or the order displayed in the prototype.

    "_I have a lot of high blood pressure in the family, so for me that would probably be number one."_
  
    LABELS: PRDT: Medical-records, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Most participants who successfully found the x-ray results stated access to images is helpful.**

    **10 of 16 who successfully found the x-ray results stated access to images is helpful.** Four participants stated they did not expect to find images within the record and four thought they would have to download or print the images to view them. Three participants were not interested in access to x-ray images because they didn't think they would understand them on their own.

    "_Oh wow!"_

    "_I think it's great because… My HealtheVet when I go onto that, if I want to see what the images look like, I have to request them."_

    LABELS: PRDT: Medical-records, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Most participants accessed the 'Questions about this medical records tool.'**

    **11 of 21 accessed the 'Questions about this medical records tool' to help them complete one of the two tasks with the lowest success rates.** Six participants accessed the questions while searching for a way to add an allergy to their list. Five participants looked in the questions to help them find an 'Admission and discharge summary' from April 6and 7, 2023.

    LABELS: PRDT: Medical-records, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Some participants looked for medical records while in Medical Records.**

    **7 of 21 looked for medical records while in the Medical Records prototype when given a task to perform.** Five of those seven were searching for an 'Admission and summary' report. One participant was looking for a high blood pressure diagnosis date and one was looking for 'Allergies.'

    Three participants looked in 'Share your medical records' and 2 attempted to click on the 'Go back to medical records on My Health_e_Vet website.' The remaining two indicated they were unable to locate medical records.

    _"Discharge records are probably going to be part of your Medical Records so I would probably go with 'Find out how to share your medical records'."_

    _"I don't see an area yet where I could even find the medical records in order to print them out."_

    LABELS: PRDT: Medical-records, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Most participants stated they were concerned with comparing the results to the standard range in 'Complete blood count.'**

    **10 of 12 who were asked what they were trying to learn while viewing the Complete Blood Count results stated they were checking to see if each result was within the standard range.** The previous 9 participants were not asked as this question was added mid-study in response to concerns raised by SMEs.

    "_You want to see if you're in the range, [if it's] out of the range of where a normal person should be."_

    **12 of 21 participants wanted an explanation of the non-standard results.** They were concerned with the implications to their current or future health often citing their own chronic illness or those within their families such as diabetes or heart disease.

    "_I [am concerned with] my A1C. Diabetes runs in my family."_

    **4 of 21 were interested in information on how they could get the out-of-range results back into range.** Some speculated that they may need to have their medications adjusted.

    "_What do we need to do to change this?"_

    LABELS: DSC: Additional information, PRDT: Medical-records, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Most participants stated they wanted the acronyms spelled out in the 'Complete blood count' results.**

    **13 of 21 stated they wanted the acronyms spelled out in the 'Complete blood count' results.** Many participants could identify WBC (white blood cells), RBC (red blood cells), and some knew HGB (hemoglobin), but the other five acronyms were unknown. One of the acronyms, ACK, was a mock result, but no participants realized it was fake.

    "_I'd have to have it interpreted by the doctor or the nurse or someone. I really don't know what some of this stands for."_

## **Additional Insights**

Many participants (8 of 21) requested either color coding or graphics to provide clarity in 'Lab and test results' and 'Vitals.'

Many participants (7 of 21) stated concern about having to download or print a big document to access a single medical record.

Participants made 24 separate statements of unprompted positive feedback on the new design. Nine of those statements were made while in the 'Lab and test results' domain, two were in 'Vitals,' and three were in 'Vaccines' during the list print task. The remaining accolades were about the whole product's ease of use.

Among the six tasks that were not dependent on high health literacy, the successful participants on mobile devices took an average of 16% (3 seconds) longer than those on desktop or laptop computers.

'In this section' is a stumbling block for mobile users' navigation.

Some participants did not know what illness the Zoster vaccine inoculates against, and one participant initially confused the pneumococcal vaccine with the influenza vaccine.

## **Recommendations**

- Add "from newest to oldest" to the end of the pagination bar text in the list pages for all domains.
  - _This will help users quickly understand the sort order of their records so they can find them more quickly and easily._
- Remove the term 'Health history' and flatten the navigation so that all domains are visible on the left on desktop/laptop and in the 'In this section' menu on mobile.
  - _Veterans will be able to employ the principle of 'recognition rather than recall' thus reducing their cognitive load in searching for their medical records._
- Make the 'About VA medical records' a permanent landing page with 'Medical records' as the H1. Include links to all domains with content about what they contain with a layout similar to the Health History page.
  - _Veterans will be able to quickly find their records among the many options and be more likely to explore the new experience._
  - _Removing the term 'Share' from H1 will correct the confusion users may have about the functionality of the experience._
- Change the 'Download Blue Button report' button text to 'Download all records.' Place Blue Button branding in the introductory paragraph.
  - _This will help those who are not familiar with the term understand the button's function without confusing current My HealtheVet users._
- Remove 'What to know about [domain name]' additional information dropdowns from each domain page. Revise the content of the dropdown and placing it (expanded) at the top of the page. Place the general information from the dropdown in the FAQs on the landing page.
  - _Making the domain-specific information more visible at the top of the page will assist Veterans in using each tool._
- Take 'Need help understanding your results' content out of the dropdown and make it a static alert.
  - _Veterans will be more likely to notice the information prior to reviewing their results and may be less likely to become alarmed about out-of-range results._
- Add an info icon next to the 'What to know about downloading records' informational dropdowns.
  - _The addition of the familiar icon will improve visibility._
- Replace 'Share your medical records' with two separate pages called 'Download all your medical records' and 'Medical records settings.'
  - _Separation will relieve any confusion about their functions and displaying all informational text will make it easier for Veterans to understand them._
