## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]?

My name is Anne. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be selectable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_[If yes: ]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_[If no:]_  I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

_[If yes:]_  Thank you! We very much appreciate you talking with us today. 


- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**   We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

- _[If yes: ]_ **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_[Start recording.]_

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

- Do you use My HealtheVet?

_[If yes]_

- How often? 
- Do you use it to access your medical records?

_[If yes]_

How often? 

- What type of device are you using today?

[If on Desktop/Laptop/Tablet:] I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get set up, I will give you instructions on what to do. _[when ready]_ I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen and then you will be able to control my screen. Ready?

_[If on mobile: ]_ Have you shared your screen over Zoom with your phone?

_[If yes: ]_ I dropped the link to the prototype in the chat. Go ahead and pull it up and when you are ready to share, please do so.

_[If no, follow protocol for particular OS (Android/iOS)]_

**Participant Coaching**

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own. Of course, we are here and using a prototype, so to make it as natural as possible, we included a back button at the top left. This is to take the place of the back button you might use on your browser.

Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can't see your screen. Does that make sense?

_[for MHV users]_ This is going to look slightly familiar, but please remember that this is a new design we are testing and some elements you might expect to be there will not and some you don't expect will.

Are you ready to dive in?

## **First Task: Lab and tests: EKG + Radiology – 7-10 minutes**

[About VA medical records]

_Electrocardiogram_

- Can you walk me through how you would find the date of your most recent electrocardiogram(EKG)?

  _[if the participant selects Share your medical record]:_

  - Can you tell me about why Share your medical record was your first choice for this task?
  - What would you do on this page to find the date of your most recent electrocardiogram?

  _[if the participant states they would download/print BB ask]_

  - Could there be another way to find that information without running a report?

  _[help the participant navigate back to About VA medical records if necessary]_

_[when the participant finds the date]:_

- How do you know that this is the most recent electrocardiogram? 

_[if participant is on details screen]:_
Please return to Lab and test results.

- Can you describe to me what is on this page?
- Is this how you would expect the labs and test results to be listed?
  - _[if no]_ What would be more helpful?

_Radiology_

For the next part of this task, there will be x-rays on the screen. This may be triggering for some and we want to be mindful of your comfort. Are you comfortable viewing x-rays?
_[if no]_ Thank you for letting me know. We will skip that part.

- Let's say you had x-rays taken of your ankle in March of 2022 and you wanted to review the results. How would you do that?

_[when report opened]_
- What information do you find helpful here?
- Would you expect the actual x-ray images to be here?
- Is there a place on this page where you can find them?

_[images screen]_

- Is access to images helpful to you? Is there any information it provides that the report does not?

**Things to watch for:**

- Did the participant know to look in lab and test results?
- If the participant clicked on details did they choose the link or the whole card?
- Did the participant notice that EKG's are historical only?
- Did the participant notice that labs and tests are listed in reverse chronological order?

## **Second Task: Lab and test results: Bloodwork + download - 5 minutes**

_[if participant can't find the record in the list ask:]_ 
- Do you notice a pattern in how these results are listed?

_[if the participant finds the record, but doesn't realize they can open it, ask:]_ 
- How could we get more information on this particular result?

_[provide additional help as necessary]_

_[when details page is open]:_

- I would like you to review these results as if they were your own. Please share any thoughts you have while you go through them if any of the parts stand out for you, and let me know when you are done.

_[after the participant states they are done]_
-	Have you ever reviewed the results of your own bloodwork? 
    -	[if yes:] When you were reviewing those results, was there something specific you were interested in learning?
    -	[if no:] When you were reviewing those results, was there something specific you were interested in learning?

- There is a result here called "ACK." We made it up, so it's not a real test. If it were and you came upon this unfamiliar result that happens to be marked as high, what would you do within this website to try to understand it?

_Download:_

- Can you walk me through what you would do if you wanted to save a copy of these complete blood count results?

_[when participant returns to report screen]_

[About VA medical records]

For our first question, I just need you to answer. You don't need to go and find the record.
- Let's say you had a consultation with a surgeon last week and now you want to read the notes from the visit. In which of the three areas under "What you can do with this tool" would you expect to find them? 

- Let's say you spent time in the hospital on April 6th and 7th. You have questions you want to ask your primary care doctor at your upcoming visit, but you don't have the discharge papers the nurse gave you when you left.  Can you walk me through what you would do in this system to get another copy?

  _[if the participant selects Share your medical record]:_

  - Can you tell me about why Share your medical record was your first choice for this task?
  - What would you do on this page to find those discharge papers?

  _[if the participant states they would download/print BB ask]_

  - Could there be another way to print what you need without running a report of your full medical records?

  _[help the participant navigate back to About VA medical records and assist them in finding the record if necessary]_
    
[About VA medical records]

- What if you were filling out some paperwork and needed to include the date you were first diagnosed with high blood pressure? How would you find that?

- You think you have had your blood pressure under control, but you are curious about the past few readings taken during office visits. How might you review those?

Please return to the Vitals page.

  - _[if no]_ What would be more helpful?
- Which of these do you feel is most important for managing your health?
- What other types of information would you expect to find in Vitals?

- How would you find it?

You decide to print out all of your vaccines so you have a record handy in your files.
- What would be the best way to do that?

_[if the participant says they would print each individual record, ask:]_
- Is there a way you could print the whole list as one document?


**Things to watch for:**

- Did the participant know that hypertension is high blood pressure?

## **Fourth Task: Health history: Allergies – 5 minutes**

Please return to About VA medical records.

[About VA medical records]

- What if a Veteran developed a sudden allergy to eggs and were treated at a community hospital. How would they go about getting that allergy added to their list? Is there anything here that might help with that?

I would like to ask you some questions about the print and download options here. The button says, "print or download list."

- What if you wanted to print out just the Penicillin allergy?

The same option to print a list is also available for Vaccines. These are the only 2 sections that allow you to print the whole list while other records, such as the admission and discharge summary we looked at earlier, only allow you to print the page. 

 - Can you think of any other items we have reviewed today that you would need a list printed rather than individual pages?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant understand that they cannot add allergies?
