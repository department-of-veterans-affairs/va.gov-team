# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medical Records, January 2025

## Background

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We initially built and tested a prototype of Medical Records in MHV on VA.gov. We conducted usability studies and collected feedback that informed iterations on the website. In this round of testing within a live environment, we will assess some previously tested and newly developed domains with Veterans who are dependent upon assistive technology.

## OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

## Veteran Journey

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals

1. Identify any usability issues AT-dependent Veterans may experience in understanding their Medical Records Settings, Microbiology, Pathology, and Radiology Results, Vitals, Allergies, and Download your medical record.  
2. Understand AT-dependent Veterans’ needs and expectations within Medical Records.

## Outcome

The results of the usability portion of the study will help us determine if our designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to access their medical records and help to identify any pain points. The results of the generative portion of the study will uncover Veterans’ behaviors and expectations when accessing their Medical Records. Both usability and generative findings will inform future iterations of designs.

## Research questions

1. Can Veterans who use assistive technology find the information they need to manage their healthcare related to:

- Medical Records Settings
- Microbiology, Pathology, and Radiology Results
- Vitals
- Care Summaries and Notes
- Allergies
- Download your medical records

1. What are Veterans’ reactions to the new experience in which they review their records on screen?
2. What are the goals, expectations, and experiences within Medical Records for Veterans who use assistive technologies?

## Hypothesis

_Hypothesis 1:_  Most Veterans who use assistive technology will be able to access and understand information about their medical records to manage their health.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans who use assistive technology will have positive reactions to the new experience in which they access their records on screen.

## Methodology

We will conduct interviews and moderated usability testing sessions in which we will ask users to navigate a live environment while we observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.  

## Location

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
