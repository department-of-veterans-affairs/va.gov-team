# Conversation Guide: MHV on VA.gov, Medical Records Round 4 (AT), January 2025

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you \[first name\]?

My name is \[name\]. I'm a researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

_\[if Mag user:\]_ Which magnification tool are you using today?

_\[if voice command user:\]_ How do you have your voice control set up?

_\[if SR user:\]_ What type of screen reader are you using today?

Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- **This entire session should take about 2 hours.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a live website.** This is a demo tool with health information from a fake Veteran. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_\[If yes: \]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_\[If no:\]_  I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

_\[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves\]_  

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- _\[If yes: \]_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_\[Start recording.\]_

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

We like to share de-identified clips of these sessions with our teammates and stakeholders so they can see how a Veteran who uses \[AT\] uses our website. Do I have your permission, \[name\] to use clips from your session?

&nbsp;

## Screen share/Remote share - 5 minutes

_\[If SR user:\]_ Have you shared your screen over Zoom before?

_\[If no: \]_

I am going to drop a link to a website in the chat then hand it over to our accessibility specialist, Riley, to assist you with sharing your screen.

_\[If yes: \]_

I am going to drop a link to a website in the chat. Go ahead and share your screen then open the link for me.

&nbsp;

**Participant Coaching**  

&nbsp;

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own.

&nbsp;

Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can’t see your screen. Does that make sense?

## First Task: Generative Interview - 5 minutes

_\[Possible Visual Aid\]_

I’d like to start by talking about the current electronic sharing settings of your medical records. Are you aware of these settings?

What do you think these settings mean?

Who do you think has access to your records right now?

_\[Optional prompt\]:_ Let's navigate to "Manage your medical records settings." Click the link in this section for me. 
Take a moment to read through this page. Does this help clarify the electronic sharing settings?

## Second Task: Sharing Settings - 10 minutes

_\[intro to Pat\]_

At the top right of the screen where your name would be, we have the name Pat. Pat is our test user and it is their information that we will see today. I will be referring to Pat as we go through the tasks today.

&nbsp;

_\[Optional prompt\]:_ Let's navigate to "Manage your medical records settings." Click the link in this section for me.

- Tell me how Pat’s records will be shared using their current settings.
- Pat likes to use the CVS Minute Clinic by their house when they can. Since it's a participating non-VA health care partner, they can share their VA records with CVS. In addition, this CVS has a pretty sweet candy section, so Pat's totally fine with a visit. Make the necessary updates so that Pat can share their medical record with CVS.

_\[if SR or VC user\]_

- That popup there is called a modal. How do popups like these typically work for you?

_\[if SR user\]_

- When navigating by the tab-key only, what would you expect the “opt in” button to read out?

_\[once opted in\]_

- Have Pat’s sharing settings been updated? How do you know?
- It now says sharing settings are opted in. What does that mean?
- What kind of health information will be shared from Pat’s electronic medical record?

I am going to provide you with a rating scale that we will be using throughout today’s session.

On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being very difficult, 2 being difficult, 3 being neither difficult nor easy, 4 being easy and 5 being very easy, please rate the difficulty of understanding Pat’s electronic health information sharing settings?

- Would you like me to repeat that?
- \[if _<5\]_ What would make it a 5?

Now let’s check out Pat’s vitals. Take me to that screen.

**Things to watch for:**

- Questions about the meaning of VA partners.
- Hesitation to share records.

## Third Task: Microbiology, Pathology, and Radiology- 10 minutes

_\[Lab & Test Results\]_

Have you ever looked at specialized test results like lipid panels or X-rays before reviewing them with a doctor?

- How regularly do you review your results?
- How often do you see terms that you don’t understand?
  - What do you do with these terms?

Pat wants to spend some time today reviewing their past test results before their next doctor appointment to stay up-to-date. They recently had an E. coli infection. Show me how you would find those results please.

_\[Do not interrupt participant – collecting Time on Task\]_

_\[if SR user\]_

- Are you able to understand Pat’s results with the current details read out by the screen reader?

- Is there anything that feels like it’s missing from the SR dictation?

Please return to Pat’s test results.

Pat had a biopsy of a mole taken on their left finger. Locate the results from their biopsy.

Would anything make it easier to identify these results?

_\[if they open the results\]_

Please return to Pat’s test results.

How has Pat’s blood pressure changed since December of 2022?

_\[if confused\]_

- Is there anything on this page that could help you?

_\[Blood Pressure\]_

Thank you for taking the time to get through all those tasks with me today and answering all our questions. It has been super helpful.  

&nbsp;

Our goal in these studies is to make sure we represent the point of view of all Veterans. This is why we are committed to recruiting participants who rely on assistive technology so that we are designing an experience that meets their needs.  

We are collecting information on how Veterans’ reliance on assistive technology may affect their ability to use My HealtheVet. Would you be willing to answer a couple of questions today?  

\[if no\]  

That’s no problem.

\[if yes\]  

- How long have you been using \[AT\]?
- How does using \[AT\] affect your use of MHV or other websites?
- Can you share an example of time when you struggled with MHV because of your reliance on \[AT\]?

Please feel free to be completely honest and straightforward here. We want to make the best product possible for you so it’s important that we hear your true feedback.

- How does this new version of MHV work for you compared to the old version?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
