## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - It is possible that people will not use it if they do not want to be bothered filling out a form online, or if they need assistance in doing so. 

- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - It is possible that people may not notice the notification amongst all the other options available. 

- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - None noted
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - This keeps us in compliance with policy that mandates giving Veterans access to their health records

### Supporting research
 - This work will not include user research because it is very straightforward and needs to be implemented quickly to give Veterans access to some health data that was previously available on My HealtheVet Classic.  Access to this data is in the process of being restored on VA.gov, but this provides a solution in the interim.

### What're you building?

A notification that will be shown in the Medical Records product (exact location(s) TBD) 
 
> *What have you explicitly decided to **not** include and why?*  We will not include anything beyond the notification that links to the required form and the MHV Messaging application.  This is meant to be a simple contextual notification to let Veterans know that there are other ways to obtain their health information.   There is already information about this in the VA.gov Resources and Support content, and it is not necessary to provide extensive information here.

> *Are you building for the VA Health and Benefits mobile application? Explain why or why not.*
Initially, we will only be placing this on VA.gov, but will eventually add to mobile.  We are not adding this right away because it is time sensitive and the health data that was available on MHV Classic and no longer available on VA.gov was never available on VAHB.

> *How does this solution address your Assumptions & Risks?*


#### Go-to-market 

> *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*
None

> *Which groups/orgs are necessary to make this happen?*
None other than the delivery team, stakeholders, and Governance.
