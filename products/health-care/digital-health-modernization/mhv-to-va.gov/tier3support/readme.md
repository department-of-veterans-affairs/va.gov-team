# MHV Tier 3 Support Product Outline 
This product outline defines the Tier 3 Support framework for My HealtheVet (MHV), the VA's integrated personal health record platform. Tier 3 Support represents the highest level of technical escalation, handling complex issues that require specialized expertise, system-level troubleshooting, and cross-functional coordination.

## Objective
Identify and surface issues that inhibit users from successfully accomplishing the self-service tasks they undertake on MHV on VA.gov, as well as assist internal VA staff with issues preventing successful accomplishment of tasks within internal MHV tools (such as Secure Messaging), to the teams that can address them. 

## Vision
To provide Veterans with seamless, reliable access to their healthcare information by maintaining a robust escalation support system that resolves complex technical issues efficiently and drives continuous platform improvement.

## Problem Statement
Veterans and healthcare providers encounter technical issues with MHV that cannot be resolved through standard help desk support (Tier 1) or technical support (Tier 2). These complex issues require deep technical knowledge, system access, and coordination across multiple VA systems including VistA, CPRS, and integrated third-party applications. Without effective Tier 3 support, these issues result in delayed care access, frustrated users, and diminished trust in digital health services.


### Desirable outcomes
- When issues arise for a user that exceed Tier 2 capabilities, Tier 3 is able to quickly surmise and identify the issue, then notify the operative team so that they can address it in a short time span.
- MHV tool teams understand what is expected of them on Tier 3 issues and are able to efficiently perform diagnosis and communicate resolutions.
### Undesirable outcomes
- Tier 3 issues go unaddressed at the Triage stage and fail to reach relevant tool teams in a timely manner, allowing issues that are possibly systemic to remain, frustrating users.

### Not the express goal of this team
- Keeping the issue backlog low
  - While this shold be a related outcome of Tier 3 operating as desired, it is not the mission. The mission is surfacing problems to those who can address them. 
- Resolving the issues without MHV team support
  - While this may be possible at times, and will certainly be pursued where possible, most legitimate issues that reach Tier 3 should require engineering support.

### User Goals
- Ability to quickly and easily be assisted with issues within MHV on VA.gov website that require escalation to Tier 3 status.


### Business Goals
- Support Veterans and VA Staff with any issues encountered with MHV services that get escalated to Tier 3 status.


## Challenges
- Tier 3 Support generally will not be allowed to contact Veterans directly, so it may take considerable time to address their concerns due to additional exchanges with other services who are able to communicate with them.

### Reporting
- We'll need to be very considerate about what metrics we capture and report on.  We don't want to conflate the performance of this team w/ the performance of MHV.  Certain actions can improve one, the other, or both.

## Questions
- Do Tier 1 and 2 centers know how to engage w/ Tier 3?
- Do they know what should be escalated?


## Ownership
#### In Scope 
- Triange of Tier 3 escalated issues
- Assignment of issues to relevant tool teams

#### Out of Scope
- Any Tier 3 Appointments issues
- Any non-MHV Tier 3 issues
