## The Problem
Veterans and VA Staff will occasionally run into issues when using websites and software provided by MHV.  These may be simple or complex, and if they require engineering to resolve, these items will generally be escalated to Tier 3 so that Support can ensure that these problems get surfaced to those who can help solve them.


### User Goals
- Ability to quickly and easily be assisted with issues on VA.gov's website that get escalated to Tier 3 status.


### Business Goals
- Support Veterans and VA Staff with any issues encountered with VA software services that get escalated to Tier 3 status.


## Challenges
- Tier 3 Support generally will not be allowed to contact Veterans directly, so it may take considerable time to address their concerns due to additional exchanges with other services who are able to communicate with them.

## Questions
- Do Tier 1 and 2 centers know how to engage w/ Tier 3?
- Do they know what should be escalated?


## Requirements
#### In Scope 
- Response to Tier 3 issues
- Assignment of issues to proper tool teams

#### Out of Scope
