# How to work Tier 3 Issues assigned to an MHV team 
The MHV Tier 3 Support team triages issues that are communicated and escalated to Tier 3 via VA's Help desk.  The entire MHV program is responsible for investigating these issues to provide responses, and/or fixes, for issues encountered.  This document is intended to help an MHV team that gets assigned an issue in Github in what is expected from them in addressing these tickets.

## How the ticket gets to the team
* A veteran or VA staff contacts the Help Desk
* The Help Desk works to assist with the concern, escalating it up to Tier 1 or 2 as needed.
* If it's determined to be an issue that requires engineering insight, the ticket gets escalated to MHV Tier 3
* The MHV Tier 3 Support team triages the ticket, evaluating whether it needs MHV team support. If so, it will either be connected to a GH ticket, or added to a GH ticket with similar issues.
* This ticket will then be added to a team's Tier 3 column on their GH project board

## What do teams do with these tickets?
The Product Manager is responsbile for ensuring that the team responds to incoming Tier 3 Support tickets.  They will generally review the ticket, assigning a relevant engineer(s) and sprint label.  Then the ticket should be moved into the Current Sprint. 

## What is the process for addressing a ticket
Issues can take various forms.  The main information should be available in the ticket, but if additional info is needed from the original Tier 3 issue, the Product Manager can access it using the HRC # in the HRC Dynamics queue.  Once sufficient information has been gathered:

* The team should investigate if there is a technical problem
* Report the findings back to the MHV Tier 3 Support team
  * Add the details in a comment on the ticket
  * Send a message to the mhv-tier-3-support Slack channel to let them know the status.
* Close the GH ticket

### What if a technical fix is needed? 
If a technical fix is needed that requires further planning:
* please include the epic link for the new work in the ticket comments
* Add instructions to the Acceptance Criteria to notify Tier 3 upon the completion of the fix
* then continue with the typical process of closing it
   
### What if more info is needed?
If additional information is required, Tier 3 can make this request to Tier 2, who will reach out to the user.  The GH ticket will remain on hold while this process occurs.
* Add comments to the ticket specifying what is needed
* notify the MHV Tier 3 team in the mhv-tier-3-support slack channel
