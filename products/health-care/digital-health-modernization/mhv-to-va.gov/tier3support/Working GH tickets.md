# How to work a Tier 3 Issue assigned to your MHV team 
The MHV Tier 3 Support team triages issues that are communicated and escalated to Tier 3 via VA's Help desk.  The entire MHV program is responsible for investigating these issues to provide responses, and/or fixes, for issues encountered.  
### Scope: 
This document is intended to help an MHV team that gets assigned an issue in Github in what is expected from them in addressing the ticket.

## How the ticket gets to your MHV team
* A veteran or VA staff contacts the Help Desk
* The Help Desk works to assist with the concern, escalating it upward as needed. If it's determined to be an issue that requires engineering insight, the ticket gets escalated to MHV Tier 3
* The MHV Tier 3 Support team triages the ticket, evaluating whether it needs MHV team support. If so, it will either be connected to a Github ticket or added to a GH ticket with similar issues.
* This ticket will then be added to a team's Tier 3 column on their GH project board

## What do MHV teams do with these tickets?
The Product Manager is responsible for ensuring that the team responds to incoming Tier 3 Support tickets.  They will generally select them from the team's Tier 3 Support column, review the ticket, and assign a relevant engineer(s) and sprint label.  Then the ticket should be moved into the Current Sprint. 

## What is the process for addressing a ticket
Issues can take various forms.  The main information should be available in the ticket, but if additional info is needed from the original Tier 3 issue, the Product Manager can access it using the HRC # in the HRC Dynamics queue.  (All information cannot be included in the Github ticket because it can contain PII).  Once sufficient information has been gathered:

* The team should investigate if there is a technical problem
* If it can be addressed quickly, the engineer should move forward with correction of the issue, then report back to the MHV Tier 3 Support team once it is resolved.
  * Add the details in a comment on the Github ticket
  * Tier 3 will receive an email notification of this update and communicate the resolution back to the Help Desk
* Close the GH ticket

### What if a technical fix is needed? 
If a technical fix is needed that requires further planning:
* Please include any details within the ticket for the new work in the ticket.
* Add instructions to the Acceptance Criteria to notify Tier 3 upon the completion of the fix
* Move forward with the necessary work to address the fix, eventually communicating the resolution and closing the ticket as directed above.
   
### What if more info is needed?
If additional information is required before the issue can be understood or addressed:
* Add comments to the ticket specifying what is needed
* Notify the MHV Tier 3 team in the mhv-tier-3-support slack channel
  * If the needed information is sensitive, the team can reach out to you via VA email to maintain security.
* Tier 3 will make this request to Tier 2, who will reach out to the user.  The GH ticket will remain on hold while this process occurs.
