# MHV Tier 3 Support Product Outline 
This product outline defines the Tier 3 Support framework for My HealtheVet (MHV), the VA's integrated personal health record platform. Tier 3 Support represents the highest level of technical escalation, handling complex issues that require specialized expertise, system-level troubleshooting, and cross-functional coordination.

## Product Vision
To provide Veterans with seamless, reliable access to their healthcare information by maintaining a robust escalation support system that resolves complex technical issues efficiently and drives continuous platform improvement.

## Problem Statement
Veterans and healthcare providers encounter technical issues with MHV that cannot be resolved through standard help desk support (Tier 1) or technical support (Tier 2). These complex issues require deep technical knowledge, system access, and coordination across multiple VA systems including VistA, CPRS, and integrated third-party applications. Without effective Tier 3 support, these issues result in delayed care access, frustrated users, and diminished trust in digital health services.

## Objective
Identify and surface issues that inhibit users from successfully accomplishing the self-service tasks they undertake on MHV on VA.gov, as well as assist internal VA staff with issues preventing successful accomplishment of tasks within internal MHV tools (such as Secure Messaging), to the teams that can address them. 


### Desirable outcomes
- When issues arise for a user that exceed Tier 2 capabilities, Tier 3 is able to quickly surmise and identify the issue, then notify the operative team so that they can address it in a short time span.
