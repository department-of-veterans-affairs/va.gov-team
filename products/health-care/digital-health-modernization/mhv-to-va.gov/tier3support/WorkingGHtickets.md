# How to work Tier 3 Issues assigned to an MHV team 
MHV Tier 3 Support team triages issues that are communicated and escalated to Tier 3 via VA's Help desk.  The MHV program is responsible for investigating these issues to provide responses,
and often fixes, for issues encountered.  This document is intended to help an MHV team that is assigned an issue in Github in what is expected from them in addressing these tickets.

## How the ticket gets to the team
To provide Veterans with seamless, reliable access to their healthcare information by maintaining a robust escalation support system that resolves complex technical issues efficiently and drives continuous platform improvement.

## Where will teams find tickets meant for them
Veterans and healthcare providers encounter technical issues with MHV that cannot be resolved through standard help desk support (Tier 1) or technical support (Tier 2). These complex issues require deep technical knowledge, system access, and coordination across multiple VA systems including VistA, CPRS, and integrated third-party applications. Without effective Tier 3 support, these issues result in delayed care access, frustrated users, and diminished trust in digital health services.

## What is the process for addressing a ticket
Identify and surface issues that inhibit users from successfully accomplishing the self-service tasks they undertake on MHV on VA.gov, as well as assist internal VA staff with issues preventing successful accomplishment of tasks within internal MHV tools (such as Secure Messaging), to the teams that can address them.
