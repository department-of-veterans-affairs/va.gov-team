# MHV Web and Mobile - Tier 3
### Standard Operating Procedures


## Overview
The MHV Web and Mobile team is responsible for Tier 3 support for both the Veteran-facing queues and staff-facing queues. It is the expectation that items in these queues are reviewed and triaged every day.
The Unified Appointments Experience team has their own Production Support representative (Brad Johnson) who manages Appointments items. We do not need to triage these.

### Frequency for checking status of incoming tickets
- Team members will check SNOW tickets and HRC tickets at least twice daily, and more frequently as appropriate.
  - Upon logon each morning
  - Again each afternoon
