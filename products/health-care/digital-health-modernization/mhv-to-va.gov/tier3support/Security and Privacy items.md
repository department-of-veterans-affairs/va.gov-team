# Received and Responding to Security / Privacy issues
The team will occassionally receive items identified as Security/Privacy issues.  This guidance addresses how to check for them and respond to them.

## Capturing the issues
The items are esclated to the MHV Tier 3 queue and may arrive with a Security / Privacy label under the Area or Sub-area columns.  Use the [Security / Privacy view](https://dvagov-msp.crm9.dynamics.com/main.aspx?appid=33003bd2-8e16-413e-911f-5bdfa1b016ea&pagetype=entitylist&etn=queueitem&viewid=1f95a802-4cd1-f011-8544-001dd80db51f&viewType=4230) in HRC Dynamics to filter for any new items that have not been worked.
