## Things to note:
1. Secure messages are NOT sent directly to a Provider.  They are sent to your Care Team, who will in turn send your message (unopened) to your Provider.  That is the way the system is designed.
2. Secure messaging has a two-minute time "limit." After two minutes, your message will automatically be saved into your draft folder.
3. If you are worried about it taking you longer than two minutes to type and proofread your secure message, we recommend that you type your message in a Word document first and copy/paste it into the message box.
4. Always add attachments AFTER you have typed or copy/pasted your secure message.
5. Make sure that your attachment file extension is correct.
 -  Correct file name example: FootXray.pdf
 -  Incorrect file name example: FootXray.pdf.jpg or FootXray.pdf.pdf.
