# MHV Web and Mobile - Tier 3 Triage of SNOW issues
### Standard Operating Procedures


## Staff/Clinician (ServiceNow)
Ticket statuses:
* New - 
* In Progress - 
* On Hold - Pending another action
  * Setting a ticket status to On Hold prevents the Enterprise Service Desk (Tier 1) from taking aging ticket actions - at least until the Follow Up Date.
* Resolved - Complete and no further action is required from MHV Tier 3
* Closed - SNOW system will automatically close a Resolved ticket after about 3 days
* Canceled - 

### Resolution Comments
These are common resolution comment text that may be included in the responses.
* MHV Tier 3 Support does not manage SM triage group membership. For assistance, please contact your local MHV Coordinator (COORDINATOR CONTACT). No further assistance is needed by MHV Tier 3 so this ticket will be closed as resolved.
For SCTASKS
* If MHV Tier 3 support is needed in the future, please open as an INC ticket and not SCTASK ticket.


## Creating a Ticket for the Development Team
* For staff/clinician issues, start with a SNOW New Issue
* Make sure to add the correct MHV team project to ensure that the new ticket is visible on their board:
  * MHV-Secure-Messaging
  * MHV-Medical-Records
  * MHV-Medications
  * MHV-Liferay items

The GitHub issue template folder houses all of the files populating the templates when opening a new issue.
* To update the SNOW template, go to this file MHV-Tier-3-SNOW.md
