| 2/28/2023     |Patrick Bateman                   | Landing page rollout won't have a "trusted users" phase; we will start with 5% of users.                        | Would like to follow the same pattern used for other VA.gov apps          |

|------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| 4/10/24 | Cartographers, Patrick | links to Spotlight articles on MHV should open in same tab, with SSOe session intact | the alternative of opening them in a new tab, _without_ SSOe session intact, may make sense at a later point in the transition when MHV Classic is no longer a central part of the health experience |
