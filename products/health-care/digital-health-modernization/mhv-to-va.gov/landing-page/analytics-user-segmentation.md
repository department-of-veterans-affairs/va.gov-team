# Feasibility study of analytics segmentation by user data type

This document shares analytics segmentation ideas for data collection on the MHV on VA.gov landing page, organized by their level of feasibility. This list of ideas should also inform data collection and reporting for a portal-level data dashboard. The document is broken down into three sections that will be updated over time: 
1. Data already being collected
2. Data that is feasible, but not yet being collected
3. Data that we may want to collect in the future, but is not yet feasible

## Data already being collected

### Beneficiary type
* Veterans
* Non-Veterans (future expansion)
  
### Device/ Broswer being used
  * Desktop/laptop
  * Tablet
  * Mobile device

### Type of facility 
   * VA facility
   * Cerner facility
   * Community care facility

### Level of authentication
* **Full**: Users **with** healthcare have full access
* **Partial**: Users **without** healthcare but registered at a facility have partial access (read-only to secure messages, medications, appointments; complete access to medical records; no access to order medical supplies)
* **None**: Unauthenticated. Users without healthcare and facility registration have no access

### Relationship to VA
* VA patient
* Veteran
* Caregiver
* Family member
* Dependent
* Beneficiary
* Surviving spouse, child, or parent
* CHAMP-VA beneficiary (prescription-related functionality)
* VA employee
* Service member
