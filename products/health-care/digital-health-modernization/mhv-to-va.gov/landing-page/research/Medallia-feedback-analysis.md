# My HealtheVet Medallia feedback 
Medallia feedback on My HealtheVet is collected via two distinct surveys: 
* A11 "Intercept" survey - launches a modal window inviting users to take the survey; it intercepts 5% of sessions where the user visits 3 or more pages.
* VFS "Feedback button" survey - used to collect user feedback for specific Veteran Facing Services; it is accessed by a floating feedback button on the right-hand side of specific URLs. Access to this survey is persistent and is more likely to be sought by Veterans who are experiencing a pain point online.

Sitewide Medallia information (more global than healthcare-only responses) can be found on this [Domo dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/825663825). 

Note: _These survey responses are collected on VA.gov, and several clearly comment on features that are a part of MHV on VA.gov. But as of December 2023 we believe many responses reflect Veteran experiences on the My HealtheVet National Portal. It may be unclear for some time which My HealtheVet experience the feedback is reporting on, but we will try to do the best we can to separate the feedback based on detailed qualitative responses from Veterans when possible._

## Details: A11 Intercept survey

* Key c-sat score name: "VA.gov experience"
  * Calculated by combining counts of high scores (4 & 5s) against the total number of responses (i.e. 32 high scores /64 responses = 50% CSAT)
* Delivery: Intercept modal (randomly offered to a small percentage of users; appears in report for URL where modal appeared)
* Customer scoring rubric: respondents score their overall experience on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is high.

Other: 
* For the most part, users who give low scores for their overall experience also gave low scores around their familiarity with VA.gov, their general trust of VA, and experience with the VA writ large. This was true except for the following outliers: one individual gave a score of 1 for customer satisfaction but gave 4, 4, and 5 for the VA.gov understanding, general VA trust, and trust in VA commitment to Veterans respectively; two individuals gave customer satisfaction scores of 3 and gave a 5 for trust in VA commitment to Veterans.
* Users who give high scores for their overall experience also gave higher scores regarding their familiarity with VA.gov, were more trustworthy of the VA, and reported higher scores for their experience with the VA writ large.

**Additional context around problems encountered:**
* **Tech problem** (e.g. couldn’t read a message, something wasn’t working, site down, or latency issues loading content)
  * Site says I don't have appointments
  * Red notification dot for messages doesn't go away
  * Feedback button not working on some pages
* **Login issues** - could also include registration (My HealtheVet National Portal)
* **Findability** - couldn’t find something
  * How to upload a form
* **Issues with travel reimbursement** 
* **Missing context or explanation** for users to interpret/understand their medical information
* **Couldn't get help** from call center or the MHV Helpdesk was unresponsive.

### Fixable(?) problems
* 2 users struggled to figure out how to update their personal info ("mail and records" and "phone numbers")
* 2 users encountered problems and were unable to schedule appts: one was a video consult with provider, and the other was an appointment with audiology.
* **FIX IN PROGRESS - TICKET CREATED 1/24**: 9 users expressed setting up a new Login.gov account to access their My HealtheVet data on VA.gov only to be met with alert messaging that they "do not have access."
* **FIXED**: 1 user tried to clear the notification "red dot" around their new messages, but was unable to do so despite no new messages in the inbox

* 1 user described desire for an information sheet or glossary of terminology around their diagnosis for family members to help them navigate medical appointments

## Joys users expressed
* Learned new things 
* Ease of use and clear navigation 
* Saw correct information
* Feel secure on VA.gov
