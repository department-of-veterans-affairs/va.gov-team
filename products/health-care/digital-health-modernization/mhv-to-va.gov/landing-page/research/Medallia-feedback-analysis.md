# My HealtheVet Medallia feedback 
Medallia feedback on My HealtheVet is collected via two distinct surveys: 
* A11 "Intercept" survey - launches a modal window inviting users to take the survey; it intercepts 5% of sessions where the user visits 3 or more pages.
* VFS "Feedback button" survey - used to collect user feedback for specific Veteran Facing Services; it is accessed by a floating feedback button on the right-hand side of specific URLs. Access to this survey is persistent and is more likely to be sought by Veterans who are experiencing a pain point online.

Sitewide Medallia information (more global than healthcare-only responses) can be found on this [Domo dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/825663825). 

Note: _These survey responses are collected on VA.gov, and several clearly comment on features that are a part of MHV on VA.gov. But as of December 2023 we believe many responses reflect Veteran experiences on the My HealtheVet National Portal. It may be unclear for some time which My HealtheVet experience the feedback is reporting on, but we will try to do the best we can to separate the feedback based on detailed qualitative responses from Veterans when possible._

## Details: A11 Intercept survey

* Key c-sat score name: "VA.gov experience"
  * Calculated by combining counts of high scores (4 & 5s) against the total number of responses (i.e. 32 high scores /64 responses = 50% CSAT)
* Delivery: Intercept modal (randomly offered to a small percentage of users; appears in report for URL where modal appeared)
* Customer scoring rubric: respondents score their overall experience on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is high.

Other: 
* For the most part, users who give low scores for their overall experience also gave low scores around their familiarity with VA.gov, their general trust of VA, and experience with the VA writ large. This was true except for the following outliers: one individual gave a score of 1 for customer satisfaction but gave 4, 4, and 5 for the VA.gov understanding, general VA trust, and trust in VA commitment to Veterans respectively; two individuals gave customer satisfaction scores of 3 and gave a 5 for trust in VA commitment to Veterans.
* Users who give high scores for their overall experience also gave higher scores regarding their familiarity with VA.gov, were more trustworthy of the VA, and reported higher scores for their experience with the VA writ large.
