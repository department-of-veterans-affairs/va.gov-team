# Gap analysis research on the My HealtheVet home landing page
Date: July 2024

## Background and problem statement
On June 17, 2024, the My HealtheVet portal teams launched a large number of features into production that for the first time "integrate" the My HealtheVet experience onto VA.gov. Tools that were previously available, but siloed off as islands, are now more broadly available and can be seamlessly accessed through a secondary navigation bar. The Cartography team has since been working on maturing our analytics monitoring of the transition effort since the launch.

In July 2024, OCTO health leadership prioritized a "stay steady" approach, calling for UX efforts to focus on monitoring the current state and making design iterations only when user-identified pain points emerge in feedback. Alongside the monitoring effort, **our team saw value in conducting desk research to evaluate any potential gaps that may exist between the current state of the landing page, and what we know Veterans want and/or likely expect.**

## <a name="gap"></a>What is a "gap"?<br>
We define a gap as the space between where we are now, and where we need to be in order to meet Veteran and business needs. 

## <a name="gaps-analyzed"></a>Gap areas being analyzed<br>
We posit that some unmet Veteran and/or business needs might be identified by looking into potential gaps between the My HealtheVet home page (current state) and what we see in these other forms of research:  
1. Previously conducted research at the VA
2. Qualitative Medallia feedback that has been captured from Veterans
3. Market research (competitive analysis into other authenticated portals)

### <a name="va-research"></a>1. Previously conducted research at VA<br>
This research looked at previously conducted studies at the VA - some specific to earlier health portal generative research, broader healthcare benefit related research, and also research and artifacts that are adjacent to health work and outcomes. Those studies include:

#### Themes/Trends: 

* Common behaviors and motivations
  * Veterans desire the VA to integrate siloed workflows so that they can more easily obtain, access, and **maximize** their benefits. _(DHM generative research study, 2020)_
  * Caregivers develop workarounds to effectively manage health needs when sharing one MHV account. This causes friction and confusion (namely, providers being unwilling to communicate with caregiver thru messaging) _(DHM generative research study, 2020)_
  * The complexity of VA discourages people from applying for benefits, especially for people with cognitive considerations. _(Generative research on Transitioning Service Members, 2024)_
  * People unfamiliar with community care did not gravitate towards it while those who were familiar were drawn to it. _(My HealtheVet home page user research, 2023)_
  * Most participants had to seek care outside the VA to meet their health needs. Some were referred to community care for speciality services. Others leveraged separate insurance to receive timely and personalized care from providers. _(Review of related user research: VA mobile app personalization, 2022) _

* Asks for personalized / customized experiences
  * When Veterans were asked to design their own home page, they created pages that gave them access to most important tasks in one place, guided them to benefit info and recommendations, minimized content not specific to them, provided them with important updates. _(Authenticated user generative research, 2020)_
  * "Veterans want a page that is focused on current information specific to them, rather than generalized information for all Veterans." _(VA.gov home page user research, 2023)_
  * Veterans would like to see us surface benefit **recommendations** alongside existing benefit management in a single place. _(Generative research on Transitioning Service Members, 2024)_

* Mental model connection between health and disability benefits
  * Navigating to disability claim info from MHV is complicated ; but MHV has valuable features, such as access to medical records for ongoing disability claims. _(DHM generative research study, 2020)_
  * Veterans are concerned with documenting their service connected disabilities for fear of losing access to care. _(DHM generative research study, 2020)_

* Desire for clear financial information in health portal
  * Veterans and their caregivers rely on their outside health insurance providers and hard copy VA medical bills to decipher their VA health finances. _(DHM generative research study, 2020)_
  * Veterans should be able to see financial information in context with their VA health services. _(DHM generative research study, 2020)_

#### Gaps identified: 
* Customize the landing page experience to include things that are highly relevant for them, have tasks in one place.
* Help direct Veterans to new things that they may want to see right away.
* Surface additional benefits that Veterans are eligible to apply for; make this clear and easy for them.
* Notify and/or remind Veterans of time-sensitive information and actions they should take to better manage their care.
* Veterans want to understand financial costs in-context, when they make decisions about their care. 
* Better serve caregivers and understand their unique needs in helping Veterans manage their healthcare.
* Clarify the relationship between disability and health benefits.

### <a name="medallia"></a>2. Qualitative Medallia feedback<br>
We closely evaluated qualitative feedback from two surveys: A11 and Intercept that have been collected since the integration launch date of 6/17/2024. Feedback was sorted based on overall sentiment in these three categories: 
* Positive feedback
* Negative feedback 
* "I want" feedback

#### Gaps identified:
So far, analysis suggests that these features might add value to Veterans on the My HealtheVet home landing page:
* Wants to update address on VA.gov
* Wants to find account number on VA.gov 

### <a name="competitive-analysis"></a>3. Analogous market research / Competitive analysis<br>
Following the rules of Jakob's Law, we assume that Veterans prefer My HealtheVet on VA.gov to work the same way as all the other similar sites they already know. We did competitive analysis research into other authenticated portals across several domains: health, insurance, pharmacy, finance, etc. Images and notes about this analysis are captured [in this MURAL](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1720032090287/45ea8c3a6b9565d9fc9153ef904439297f8e5849?sender=uf94a77a19aaf687331c09367) (also linked under "Resources" at the top of this page). 

We evaluated the design solutions that competitors bring to the same needs that we _currently_ attempt to address on the My HealtheVet home page. Those needs are:
* Navigation / findability
* Education
* Help
* Branding and "sense of place" (did not evaluate as this is a unique problem for My HealtheVet on VA.gov, which is a portal within another website)
* User control
* Personalization
* Change management (did not evaluate as this is a unique problem for My HealtheVet on VA.gov) 

#### Market trends:
* Navigation:
  * Almost all competitors leverage a secondary navigation very similar to the solution we have in place within My HealtheVet today.
  * Competitors do not have redundant, repeat navigation to things listed in the secondary navigation, except to surface direct shortcut links to top tasks (i.e. schedule an appointment, send a new message).
* Education:
  * Most competitors have sections with business value - promoting programs or other services that a user could "learn more" about, "explore" or take advantage of in some way. These sections do not appear to be conditional (are likely the same for all users).
* Help
  * Only some competitors surface help directly on the entry point pages to authenticated portals. When they do, it is typically small real-estate and includes a phone number or cross-link to another more detailed "help and support" or "contact us" page.
  * All competitors use badge indicators and/or card-style notifications to draw the user's attention to new, unread, or time-sensitive information.
* User control
  * Highly visible cross-links to update personal information or manage settings (such as changing notification preferences, updating password, etc.)
  * Some dismissible notifications
* Personalization
  * Many competitors make the user feel known right away: including a welcome message, including their name, and fronting information about the user immediately. 
  * All competitors highly personalize the page to clearly communicate information unique to the user. Personalized components (notification cards or sections with specific content) are almost always given primary hierarchy placement on the page, but some features are prioritized as secondary (i.e. notification badges that are less visually "loud" or prominent).
  * Some competitors have 2-3 sections where current information about the user is directly surfaced on the page alongside relevant CTAs.
  * One health competitor exposes a care team on the page; the other includes names of physicians in messaging about those appointments or related care.
  * Competitors have reminders (appointments, time sensitive tasks, follow-up needed, etc.)


#### Gaps identified:
We also noted differences in how competitors address these needs. Any new ideas not included on our landing page today are considered potential product "gaps" between the current state of our product and what we predict that users expect from it, and what we may need to start addressing in a future state of this page:
