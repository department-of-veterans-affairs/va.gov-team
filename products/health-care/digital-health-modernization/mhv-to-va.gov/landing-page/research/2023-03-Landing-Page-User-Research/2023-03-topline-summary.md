This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

_Add ~5-10 top of mind findings. Include quotes if they are available or particularly noteworthy. [Example top line summary.](https://portigal.com/reading-ahead-topline-summary/)_

**Research Question #1:** What are users' reactions to and expectations from the new landing page? What do they understand this new landing page to be and how do they understand it in relation to VA.gov and the current version of MyHealtheVet?

**Finding #1**Participants understood the landing page to be **a place to manage their health** and at first glance recognized how the landing page could be used to **accomplish broad health tasks.** 


> “... when I come onto this website…I’m looking at how to refill prescriptions, or see when appointments are…**I like the fact that stuff is right on top**. ” - P6

>“It’s an informational page that lets people know where they could go to manage their care and it also shows exactly what you can manage…” - P3 

>“...the type is bigger, that is good for a person my age....There’s a lot of worthwhile information on this page, and **it’s much larger, it’s much easier to read**.” - P9

**Finding #2** Overall, participants - the majority of them current users of My HealtheVet Classic - see the new landing page as an updated My HealtheVet Classic, which they conflate with VA.gov.  Therefore, they interpret the new landing page as an update of their known experience [My HealtheVet Classic] rather than a new, separate experience.

- Note for future: this is why it is so important to have more non-MHV  in future studies to incorporate users who do NOT have that brand recognition
- Notes/question for DHM team: Jonathan and Cara are still fleshing this insight out further.

**Additional question:** How do participants understand "Download medical records (Blue Button)"  vs. "Health History"? 

**Finding #3** Participants did not clearly distinguish between Download medical records (Blue Button) and Health history as mutually exclusive of each other. 
- Participants often perceived Health History as a “snapshot” of their health
- Download medical records (Blue Button) as having their complete medical records [test results, x-rays, notes from doctors, etc]

>“Expect [Medical records] to have the entire medical record downloaded. That's how it reads to me. That would be a whole heck of a lot of medical records.” - P12

>“I thought that would've been the same thing. Or, maybe bullet points, with Blue Button being all the data.” - P4

>“[Health] History would be a chronological overview of health issues and diagnoses.” - P28

**Research Question #2:** Are users able to navigate to the new landing page from an unauthenticated state, navigate and use the tools available there, and ultimately achieve their goals using the current wayfinding tactics?


**Finding #4** Starting from the unauthenticated state, participants expected that they would **need to log in** in order to send a message to their doctor and the **majority were able to recognize and articulate how they would start that process**.

>“I couldn’t send a message without signing in…” - P19

>“And I’m not signed in so it’s not going to recognize me as wanting to talk to a particular doctor…” - P28

>“I would sign first, then go to My Healthevet or I forgot the exact name...then send a secure message… I do that quite a bit actually.” - P22

- Study participants ran into multiple errors logging in - roughly 1 in 4 participants - had to be sent the CodePen prototype.  Potential feature flag issue. 

**Finding #5** Participants relied on familiar terminology and design standards when completing certain tasks (i.e., submit for travel reimbursement, send a message) but did not readily understand VA bespoke terms (i.e., Community Care).

- Participants were confident in how to submit for travel reimbursement, but skeptical based on past experience with the VA.

>“Ooooh ‘file a claim for travel reimbursement’ I like that being there!...The VA owes me a lot of money because I keep getting denied [but] cannot talk to anyone …. so I’ve stopped submitting" - Participant 26

- Participants associated certain terms related to messaging a doctor, which helped them locate the secure messaging functionality

>[scanning new landing page] “...normally it would be at the top [of the page] but let’s see here… I would go to healthcare… schedule an appointment… I would click on the box where it says Healthcare where it says ‘send a secure message” - P19 
 
- Participants who already knew what Community Care is were drawn to it, while those who were not already familiar with the service Community Care - the majority of participants - did not recognize the term and instead sought another way to communicate with the VA team.

>“Maybe, uh, compose a message?” [Interviewer: So you would ask your doctor?] Yeah - P25

>"I would probably go here under My VA health benefits… maybe Community Care or My HealtheVet community…I think I would find resources here [bottom of screen]." - P10

**Research question #3:** How do users expect to update their health-specific preferences in the new experience? 

**Finding #6** Participants attempted to update their health-specific “preferences” under the Appointments or Medications sections of the landing page. 

- 10 out of the 15 participants tasked with setting up appointment reminders looked under the Appointment section of the landing page. 

>“You'd go under schedule and manage your appointments.” - P19 

>“In my experience, if you're in their system, supplied with email address, you just get automatic notification once a VA scheduled appt has been made.” - P18

- All 10 participants asked to track their prescription refills navigated to the Medications section of the landing page. 

>“Would click on ‘Track prescription delivery’...Huh, that's nice” [regarding locating tracking number]. - P12 

**Note:** not all participants were asked. Unclear if this was a result of the wording of the question, nesting
