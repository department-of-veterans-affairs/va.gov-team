1. **What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)*** 

smartphone
P uses reading glasses, uses bolder text on his phone (its a phone setting)


2. ***(If using assistive technology:)* How would you rate your level of experience with using [specific assistive technology, such as a screen reader]--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?**

uses bolder text on his phone 

  
- *(If using assistive technology:)* **How long have you been using [specific assistive technology]?**




3. **What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA?**

really just healthcare 



## Usability testing - 40-50 minutes

4. _Starting from [new home page](https://www.va.gov/new-home-page/):_ **Using VA.gov, if you wanted to send a message to your doctor to follow up about a question you had in a previous appointment, how would you go about doing that?**
	- _Nudge and probe as appropriate. If get totally lost, help them out. Ultimately, need them to sign in._

First described a process on another website, redirected by R
P: probably healthcare?
Usually logs in using IDme, P has been using myhealthevet for a long time 
Logged in, P scrolled and could not see where to send message
R hinted to P to go to profile 


- _Optional alternative approach:_ **There is a new section where you can find all of your personal health information, like your messages with your doctor and your personal health records.** _(If person is MHV user, let them know that we are moving MHV onto VA.gov.)_ 

- **Starting from this home page, how would you find this new page with all your personal health information?**





5. _Once the person arrives at landing page:_ **Why don't you spend a little time getting to know this page.**
 	- _After they've moseyed about:_ **What do you think this space is?**

Clicked on what's coming up to see what's coming up 
Sometimes it will say missed appointment when it's actually it's canceled/resched and P finds that annoying bc it's not true
P likes that the lines and spread out and it's not cramped 
Has never scheduled online has always called because when tried online didn't have the option to sched with his regular practicioners -- "I haven't been on here in a long time bc I find it odd that I can't schedule an appt with my regular care provider" when I called they said people complaing




6. **What do you believe you are supposed to be able to do here?**

Refill prescriptions 
Sometimes I'll go just to see hours esp if I'm doing labs or MRIs 
Never use the track prescriptions just wait for notifications on phone or email
See my test results including from outside providers

"I didn't know you could submit for travel" I used to submit for reimbursement but all my claims got denied so I just stopped using it even though it was within 30 days 

Now that I know it's here I'll give it a try again




7. **What would you expect to be able to do or find if you clicked on the link "Download my medical record (Blue Button)?** _(Read Health Records section options aloud for participants using screenreaders to save them having to find the section.)_

Expect to be able to select from a date or all of my files from the VA from the VA or files that have been uploaded by me
Have done this before 




8. **What about "Health history" - what do you think you would find if you clicked on that link?**

I should be able to find like a problem summary list
probe - really conditions that I have, like my CPAP use
probe - difference btwn history and download?
"history is like a snapshot of problems that I have, while history is like the notes of my visits and labs"
to find vaccines 
expect to find dr notes in medical records 





9. **If you needed to get paid back by the VA for having to drive a long distance to a VA medical center for an appointment, where would you go to submit the receipts to be paid back?**






10. **If you needed to see a healthcare provider outside of the VA and you wanted to see if that would still be covered by your VA benefits, how would you figure that out?**
	- **What do you think the My VA health enefits section includes? What is this section "about"?**


I used it a long time 
Last time I went to the VA but they couldn't see me in time so they referred me out to someone else for physical therapy 
I can see the list of authorized providers based on my address -- not sure if thats on the VA 
probe: can you see if you can do it?
G clicks on community care - figures its care in the community.  looking at the page, didn't know this was there. Have never used this site.

R directs G to the "My VA Health Benefits" section 
Would expect it to be general, everything in here pertains to everyone 
If G was to rename it would rename it 


11. _For users who are familiar with MHV:_ **How is this site different than MHV?**






12. _For users who receive other benefits from the VA:_ **Where do you currently go to access and manage your benefits?** (_If user does not use the VA.gov website to access and manage their benefits:_ **If you were to access and manage your benefits on VA.gov, where would you go?)**
	- **Would you expect to access your other benefits from this page or somewhere else on the VA.gov website?**
	
  G currently recieves disability benefits 
  Would not expect to manage health and disability benefits here (in one place) bc in the past it's always been seperate - but he likes that 
  G spends most of his time on MHV 
  G subscribes to MHV updates so knows stuff is going on but didn't know that 
  
  
	- _For users who do not receive other benefits from the VA:_ **If you had benefits, would you expect to access those benefits from this page or somewhere else on the VA.gov website?**

no bc always seperate in the past 




13. **What information would you expect to see on this landing page but don't?**

can't think of anything I've always been happy with MHV it's always been nice not to have to call 
for example sprained ankle bad and they called me up and were able to order some basic xrays before even seeing me and it saved me a trip and the dr had the xrays when I saw them it was really nice 
longest have waited for a response from them is 48 hours 

No, nothing else would expect to see except maybe my labs --- like my wife has Quest labs so she can look at her labs but she can also see trends over the years and its a lot easier to see bc its a graph 

labs is the only thing its not crazy difficult but when I could see what she was doing it seemed a lot easier she could see a graph 

I can't think of anything that is missing I've always like MHV 


14. **Many of these links take you elsewhere, like back to MHV. Is that what you expected? How do you feel about that?** 
	- **Would you have expected to be told if a link took you out of this area?**

Seemed natural 
It def took extra steps to get to there -- I might give it a try "Welcome to BTSS!"
Were you expecting it to take you to a different site? No, was not 
Would you have like a popup saying you are leaving the site? Yes, would have been nice to know 
G trying to get back from new BTSS site using the back button run into issues with the authorization button



15. _Optional question:_ **What do you want to be able to do on this page? How would you go about trying to do that?**






16. **If you wanted to be reminded that you have an appointment, that would require setting that up as a "preference." How would you go about doing that?**
	- _Probe for whether this should be in Profile or somewhere health-specific._ 

G has never done that I've always relied on the postcards from the VA but that's neat bc I like reminders I mean I like to put things on my phone and my cal 

G scrolling can't see figure out where to go to set up a reminder 
G: That's a great feature! I'd do it today!

R directs G to name profile - menu - notification settings and shows him where it is 

G I know I'm not the only one that would like that that 
Multiple methods of notification always work 





17. **What about if you wanted to sign up for the MHV newsletter - where would you go to do that?**
	- _Probe for whether this should be in Profile or somewhere health-specific._ 






18. **Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?**

I like that - going to one site instead of one 
what would be nice we do this at work we do these presentations/videos on features 

I know some vets older than me and tech scares them and I help them navigate 

G I live with a lot of senior citizens and somethimes I'll guide them to youtube bcc it's upsetting that they can't get to something simple 

G hates going to multiple sites with multiple passwords
