# My HealtheVet Landing Page Post-Secondary Navigation Medallia feedback 

This document is intended to analyze user feedback (Medallia) and track trends post secondary navigation launch/integration on 6/17/25. We seek to better understand how Veterans are responding to the portal and identify areas that are successful or need improvement. 

The Cartographer Team will request landing page responses (/my-health/) as tool teams will also be pulling responses daily. 
- Medallia qualitative feedback is to be analyzed daily and will be stored [in Excel on the network](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kVkl26CNXrcqPu3G3gQrzpIVVDH_aYkEXJ1kvrD9Rgs/edit?usp=drive_link) 
- C-SAT will be calculated biweekly 

Medallia feedback on My HealtheVet is collected via two distinct surveys: 

* A11 "Intercept" survey - launches a modal window inviting users to take the survey; it intercepts 5% of sessions where the user visits 3 or more pages.
* VFS "Feedback button" survey - used to collect user feedback for specific Veteran Facing Services; it is accessed by a floating feedback button on the right-hand side of specific URLs. Access to this survey is persistent and is more likely to be sought by Veterans who are experiencing a pain point online.
