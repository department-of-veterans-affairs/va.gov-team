# My HealtheVet Landing Page Post-Secondary Navigation Medallia feedback 

This document is intended to analyze user feedback (Medallia) and track trends post secondary navigation launch/integration on 6/17/24. We seek to better understand how Veterans are responding to the portal and identify areas that are successful or need improvement. 

The Cartographer Team will request landing page responses (/my-health/) as tool teams will also be pulling responses daily. 
- Medallia qualitative feedback is to be analyzed daily and will be stored in [Sharepoint Excel](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/oitmhvonvagovcartographyteam/EVY2_fiGl7dMpbL1nhDRDjQBbvhwxRsKc611SDKas9oa7A?e=G5mtdl) 
- C-SAT will be calculated biweekly 

Medallia feedback on My HealtheVet is collected via two distinct surveys: 

* A11 "Intercept" survey - launches a modal window inviting users to take the survey; it intercepts 5% of sessions where the user visits 3 or more pages.
* VFS "Feedback button" survey - used to collect user feedback for specific Veteran Facing Services; it is accessed by a floating feedback button on the right-hand side of specific URLs. Access to this survey is persistent and is more likely to be sought by Veterans who are experiencing a pain point online.
