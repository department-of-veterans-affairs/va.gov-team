# **Participant 10, August 22, 2025 and 10AM EST**


## **Instructions**

We will be able to get ok transcripts from EnjoyHQ, so focus notes on observations, clearly defined interpretations, and impactful utterances.


* Focus on observations of user behavior.
    * Example of observation: “Participants clicks on My VA tab, hovers over X header, then back buttons to landing page.”
    * Example of observation: “Participant says ‘this is annoying, that makes no sense.’ when looking to login to BTSSS.”
* Be clear where notetaker is interpreting or making inferences of what participant is thinking/feeling
    * Example of interpretation: “Based on facial expressions, participant seems to be confused. Going back and forth between X and Y pages seems like they are looking for something.”
    * Example of interpretation: “Participant easily found link no frustration.”

### **Start on: “Add a contact email address” page**


### ***First impressions***

-
2. Do they know why asked?
3. What do they think they can do?
4. What questions do they have?
5. What info would they add and why?
6. Do they understand the consequences of not adding info?
7. Do they understand/accurately id how to enter and advance?
8.  "Skip this for now" first impressions

Sigin
Participant would go up to the sign in thing because she already uses it
Signs in with ID me

What they notice first 
Contact email address (starts reading screen) 
Notices the save and skip for now button/link

-They want to be able to communicate by email, but I if I don’t wanna do it, I could skip it
Notices the note at the bottom of the screen and what’s changing and starts reading it

make sure I give them the right email address. And if I entered it in my healthy vet, I might want to enter it again.
I’m pretty sure they have my email address but I would enter it again. I would rather enter it twice than zero.


Moderator: What would happen if you skipped

I don’t think anything would happen. I mean it would take me to va.gov. But how would they contact me? Whatever is in my profile right now.

Moderator: why would the VA asked this question? 
I’ve seen something around the scuttle bug of loggin changes, etc. talks about my healtheVet sign in going away 
(Seemed not surprised to see a message like this) - But was not able to articulate that the user’s email was missing in this situation -  probably because she was putting herself in those shoes. 

On My VA page 
 Starts going through the page reading headings - claims and appeals, appointments, etc..
Scrolled past the yellow rectangle
when prompted by the moderator to look at yellow rectangle 
The yellow rectangle is asking the same thing as the previous page.
If she saw it on this page and already entered the email, would click on it and make sure the VA got it
I would ignore it if I wanted to skip it. The participant restates the prompt, I would go to medicaidons, etc 
Notices it’s a link in the yellow box because of the  underline 

Prototype is not clicking past the confirm your contact email address

Moderator asked what they think would come next. 

Contact email: an email that the VA will use to contact you

_What are notifications? 

notifications if I have an upcoming appointments or I have a prescription. I get surveys if I get something new or flagged.


Overall, how easy or difficult would you say this process was? 

for me, it’s not that hard. I have the phone in my hand half the time. So it wasn’t that hard but for my roommate, he’s practically illiterate. It seems like he would have a great deal difficulty on this.
If you want somebody to update their contact information. That’s the only thing that should be on the screen. People get distracted very easily.
Isolating it on the page on the screen
And then give them one choice. Confirm your email or you’re not going further.

_Note: this was the end the session due to technical difficulties and time._
