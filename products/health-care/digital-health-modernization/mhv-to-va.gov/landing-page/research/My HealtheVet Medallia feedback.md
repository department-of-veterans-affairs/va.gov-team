_“Tried to link My HealtheVet.com account to the Login.gov account and was advised that I don’t have a HealtheVet account”_ 01/13/2024 Desktop user

_“I need to schedule a physical and try to make an appointment. Called VA clinic and suggested to get a MyHealtheVet credential for a premium account. After registering for a credential, unable to upgrade the premium account even after verifying my identity via ID.me. I Tried to login to myHealtheVet account but failed. It would be more efficient and user-friendly if there were no “basic” or “premium” accounts”_ 01/11/24 Desktop user
### Takeway:

- Many users were confused and had difficulty logging into MyHealtheVet by using VA.gov and ID.me credentials before 1/23/24
- The user’s goal was trying to log into myHealtheVet in order to access tool pages (RX refill, Appt, etc) There were also some missing appointments info due to the LOA. 
- No specific LOA issue was mentioned after the LOA1 alert available from Jan 23

A new qualitative data **[Qualitative Data Request #75895 (02/01/24-02/12/24)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/75895)** is requested on 2/12/2024 to validate the success after 01/23/24
