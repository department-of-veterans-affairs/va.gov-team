## The Problem
To get the health care they need, Veterans must find, register for, and learn to use a number of different websites and software products. Our generative research from 2018, repeated in late 2020, shows that Veterans find it extremely difficult to navigate commonplace interactions with VA health care. The VA ecosystem is so complex that Veterans feel discouraged to apply for, manage, and maximize their benefits.

Consider booking a doctor’s appointment: One system locates nearby facilities. Another schedules appointments. Another handles follow-ups like messages and prescriptions. And another reimburses travel expenses. That’s a lot for Veterans to learn. It’s also difficult for VA staff to support so many siloed systems.


### User Goals
- Ability to easily and quickly navigate to information about qualifying and signing up for health benefits
- Ability to easily register for a qualified authentication account in order to access MyHealtheVet tools and content
- Ability to sign on one time when moving from VA.gov to MyHealtheVet tools, or from MyHealtheVet to VA.gov, regardless of whether a tool is still housed on MyHealteVet or has been integrated into VA.gov moving from MyHealtheVet to tools that have been integrated into VA.gov
