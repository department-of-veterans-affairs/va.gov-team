# MHV on VA.gov Landing Page - Phase 1+ IA Considerations

## Routing users based on the location / facility type where they receive care:
In this Slack thread, the Cartography team was exploring how we will continue (or not continue to) gate user access to the landing page based on Secure Messaging entering Phase 1. While some discussion around upping thevisibility to 100% has taken place, we need to determine whether this means:
* True 100% visibility to all users
* 100% visibility only to users that meet particular conditional criteria

## Potential Solutions
* "Choose your own adventure page" pop-up on landing page
  * Cons: all the products/tools already do this at the tool-level. [See latest Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/iqjkZx2EbrZu6leL6YfN45/Cerner-Handoff?type=design&node-id=1631-22883&mode=design&t=SYJ9RoVPwucZzOES-0) for hi-fi wireframes of this routing.
  * This solution will not work for Appointments
    * All users use Appointments tool to schedule or request appointments, but may not necessarily be able to manage details about those appointments on VA.gov - still, they need all users to be able to get to their page without the landing page pre-gating them. There is an alternate route for users to get to the Appointments page outside of our landing page (through the health-care hub on Va.gov) but we should opt for consistency across site.
