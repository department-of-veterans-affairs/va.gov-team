# Copay Notifications
* At this point, the only notification that exists is a "new copay" notification that is sent to Veterans; now, when Veterans have a new copay statement, they receive both an email and a statement in the mail
* Denise Coveyduc told me, "We have a few future submission notifications planned to confirm receipt of certain Veteran submissions but that is a ways out. So short answer, we are not currently planning any new notifications in the short term."
* The notification Denise mentioned would likely not fit into the type of notifications we would want to show on the landing page (it's a confirmation, so it does not fit the principle included in [Notification Definitions and UX Principles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/landing-page/notifications/notification_definitions_and_ux_principles.md), which states, "Notifications tell the user about events that happen to the user (as opposed to events that the user completes), for example: a notification is generated when a user has a new secure message, but not when a user successfully sends a secure message."

## State of Copay Homepage
* Megan Gayle, designer let me know that copay statements on this page will be sorted from most recent bill to least recent bill
* Although the newest copay won't be marked with any special indicator, it will be at the top of hte list, which might be enough for users to understand that this is the new thing the dot on the landing page was indicating (user testing will be needed to confirm)
* Given this information, the new copay notification is a good candidate to follow the dot pattern
