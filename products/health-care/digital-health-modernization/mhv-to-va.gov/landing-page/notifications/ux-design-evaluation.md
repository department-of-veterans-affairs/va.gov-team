August 2023

## Appointment Reminder Notifications with Dot design vs. Card design
- Dot design next to text within product grids
- Card design right underneath the hero image/ on product pages

## Design challenges
Dot Notifications
- Pro: Relying on dots to signify users to click and redirect to product pages brings clean, unified experience
- Con: Dot may not be the best one-fit-all for some actionable/ cautionary notifications such as Appointment Cancellations by doctor

Card Notifications
- Pro: Card design can easily catch user's attention on the landing page, or cards located at Appointments page 
- Con: Landing page with multiple notifications (Up to 3 per VA) could be too busy, and notifications within the product grids could throw the grids out of proportion

## Questions
- Based on the user research, some users could receive up to 15 notifications from different channels (texts, emails, phone calls, etc).
How do we ensure that no duplications is shown on VA/ MHV landing?
- What is the level of complexity if card notifications are available on every types on products other than on the landing page?
- Is it feasible to have the dot notification and some actionable/ cautionary notifications on the same landing page?
