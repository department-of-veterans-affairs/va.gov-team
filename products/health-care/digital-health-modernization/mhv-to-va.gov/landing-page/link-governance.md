# Link governance | MHV on VA.gov health portal landing page

# Current state (10/26/2023)

* Health tools (boxes on landing page)
  * Link text updates can come from one of two directions:
    * The teams request link text updates from the cartography team
    * The cartography team solicits feedback / reaches out to identify if any changes should be made as tools progress into further phases.
   * **Change frequency**: as needed; most likely at the time the tools independently move into a new phase
* Additional links (3 columns at bottom of page)
  *  My VA health benefits
     * This is primarily static content pointing to community care resources and benefits that don't fall require or fall under healthcare coverage explicitly (i.e. Mental health, Dental care)
     * **Change frequency**: almost never
  * More resources and support
    * _Unsure of history of these links or likelihood of change to this list_
    * **Change frequency**: unknown
  * Spotlight links
    * These links are populated via an engineer or technical-minded person editing mhv/landing-page/utilities/data/index.js, where the landing page links are defined. Back in March 2023, there was no identified method to gather these automatically (the content is not created via RSS), hence the manual update process.
    * Right now, update requests to our spotlight links on the VA.gov health portal landing page come via email request to PO Patrick Bateman and are pushed into the team's backlog as tech debt from there.
    * **Change frequency**: seems to happen on quarterly basis
