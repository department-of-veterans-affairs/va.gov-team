# MHV Phase 0: Notifications user flows for unread secure message
## Overview
Currently, 25% of Veterans who meet certain criteria can see the MHV landing page live in production. An even smaller subset of those Veterans have early access to the new secure messaging tool on VA.gov during Phase 0 of the tool's launch.

Veterans who can see landing page (but can't see the new secure messaging tool) are routed to the MHV Classic Secure Messaging. All user scenarios will see notifications for new unread secure messages indicated by a "dot" in either My VA, My HealtheVet landing page, or both. 

## Key
* Dotted line: User path does not display the lightweight dot notification to user
* Solid line: User path displays the lightweight dot notification to user
