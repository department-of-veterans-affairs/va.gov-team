# Call with Patty Henry
June 21, 2023

Attendees: Patty and Florence McCafferty

## Am I correct that this field is primarily for the purpose of aiding helpdesk staff in addressing user issues?
- No, this field is a "display preference," which will impact what a Veteran sees in blue button report (as just one example).
- Patty believes the field is not crucial to helpdesk staff because they have access to JLV (Joint Legacy Viewer), which providers also have access to. JLV shows where a Veteran received treatment, and a user could look up the Veteran's most recent visits to determine their primary facility.

To answer more in-depth about whether or not helpdesk staff rely on this field for addressing user problems, we need to schedule another call with Patty and Nicole Ortego (Nicole is Brenda Torres-Hill's temporary replacement).

# Call with Carnetta Scruggs
June 14, 2023

Attendees: Carnetta and Florence McCafferty

## Knowns
- This field is user-defined ONLY
- The dropdown options given to the user are created through a call to the IM System Office, which tracks for each Veteran the VAMC(s) with the Veteran's medical record

## Is the data from this field used elsewhere in MHV?
Yes, in one place: the helpdesk. 

If this field were to disappear and no longer be available from VA.gov My Health, this would limit the helpdesk's ability to identify the correct VAMC for the Veteran calling (according to Carnetta, identifying the correct VAMC is a significant bottleneck for helpdesk calls) 

When helpdesk has a call with a Veteran, the data in this field enables helpdesk employee to transfer Veteran to the exact person in the exact VAMC they need to talk to (which allows Veteran caller to avoid making another call to get an answer)
