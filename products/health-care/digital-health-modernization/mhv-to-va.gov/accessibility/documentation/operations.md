Processes to follow for engaging with the accessibility team and actioning accessibility issues.

### Requesting accessibility team support

- Use the @mhvaccessibility Slack user group to request support, for example, for staging reviews.

### Reporting accessibility issues

- Use the [MHV Accessibility Issue template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=mhv-a11y-issue.yaml).
- Confirm that the ticket has the “accessibility” label.
- Add the “MHV - Shared Support” project to the ticket .
- Set the status to “Inbox”.
  
### Collaborating on addressing accessibility issues
