## Engaging with the accessibility team
Processes to follow for engaging with the accessibility team and actioning accessibility issues.

### Requesting accessibility team support

- Use the @mhvaccessibility Slack user group to request support, for example, for staging reviews.
- Attend our weekly office hours, Mondays from 10:30 to 11:00am ET on Zoom (see the [#mhv-shared-portal-support channel on Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C096KNK21SB) for meeting details).

### Reporting accessibility issues

- Use the [MHV Accessibility Issue template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=mhv-a11y-issue.yaml).
- Confirm that the ticket has the “accessibility” label.
- Add the “MHV - Shared Support” project to the ticket .
- Set the status to “Inbox”.
  
### Collaborating on addressing accessibility issues
  
- Monitor status of tickets assigned to the accessibility team on the [MHV Shared Support Accessibility project board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1748/views/15).
- Include the accessibility team in any standups or ceremonies that may include accessibility-related tickets.

### Creating the backlog

- **Catch accessibility issues:** Review recent [MHV accessibility issues not on the Shared Support board](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aaccessibility%20%22mhv%22%20-project%3Adepartment-of-veterans-affairs%2F1748) and add "MHV - Shared Support" project and leave status as "No status".
- **Add to Accessibility project board:** Review issues in "No status" and set correct status for Accessibility board. Clear "No status" column weekly.
- **Add to corresponding Product board:** Add corresponding Product project board to issue (e.g., MHV - Medications) and set status to "Inbox" (or "Icebox" or "No status").
