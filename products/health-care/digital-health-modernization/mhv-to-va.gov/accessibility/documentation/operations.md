## Addressing accessibility issues
How the MHV Accessibility team addresses accessibility-related issues in MHV products.

### Creating the backlog

- **Catch accessibility issues:** Review recent [MHV accessibility issues not on the MHV - Accessibility board](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aaccessibility%20%22mhv%22%20-project%3Adepartment-of-veterans-affairs%2F1898) and add "MHV - Accessibility" project and leave status as "No status".
- **Add to Accessibility project board:** Review issues in "No status" and set correct status for Accessibility board. Clear "No status" column weekly.
- **Add to corresponding Product board:** Add corresponding Product project board to issue (e.g., MHV - Medications) and set status to "Inbox" (or "Icebox" or "No status").
