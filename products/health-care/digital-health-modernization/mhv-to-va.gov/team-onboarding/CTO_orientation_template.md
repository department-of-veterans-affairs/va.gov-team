### Background history 

- _Early 1970s_ - the National Center for Health Services Research and Development, a component of the U.S. Public Health Service, began planning for development of what would become Electronic Health Records (EHR). 
- _1977_ - VA Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System (MUMPS), a precursor to VistA, was developed by the Computer Assisted System Staff (CASS) Team
- _Early 1980s_ -  VA made its software available without restriction in the public domain to other government and private sector organizations, in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act. VA recognized this opportunity to support widespread EHR adoption and offered use of VistA as the standard-bearer for EHR implementation around the world
- _June 1981_ - VA MUMPS was renamed the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP), and VA Administrator Robert Nimmo joined Rep. G.V. "Sonny" Montgomery to establish DHCP as VA's Medical Information System Development Program to formalize its organization and management.
- _December 1981_ - Congressman Sonny Montgomery arranges for the DHCP to be written into law as VA's medical-information systems development program. VA Administrator Robert P. Nimmo followed up on February 18, 1982 with an Executive Order describing how the DHCP was to be organized and managed within VA's Department of Medicine and Surgery.
- _1990_ - VistA, VA's first image management system, provided VA physicians with immediate access to patient medical images, regardless of location. VistA first became operational at the Washington, D.C. VA Medical Center (VAMC) to manage radiologic, pathology, gastroenterology, and laparoscopic images, as well as electrocardiograms.
- _1994_ - VA's Under Secretary for Health, Kenneth W. Kizer, M.D., renames DHCP as VistA, the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture.
- _2003_ - VA launches My HealtheVet nationwide on Veterans Day 2003. The personal health record portal now has over 2.5 million registered users.
- _2015_ - DOD awards a $3.4 billion contract to Cerner Corporation for new electronic health record system.
- _2017_ - VA decides to acquire the same Cerner system as DOD
- _April 2018_ - the Department of Veterans Affairs introduces the VA Digital Modernization Strategy, which includes a plan for updating VA.gov, shared credentials across all VA services, personalization, mobile access, self-service tool standardization, and API consolidation.
- _May 2018_ - VA awards a contract to Cerner for an Electronic Health Record System
- October 1, 2020 - VA announces plan to launch Cerner's patient portal alongside My HealtheVet
- _October 24, 2020_ - After several delays related to the Covid-19 pandemic and infrastructure problems, Cerner's EHR is partially deployed at the Spokane Washington VA Medical Center (VAMC)
- October 2020 - April 2020 - It becomes evident that having two disparate systems running in parallel during the Cerner rollout is a poor experience for Veterans.  Veterans who have received care at sites where Cerner has been integrated must access Cerner's _My Healthy Life_ patient portal (referred to as _My VA Health_ when accessed through My HealtheVet) for Cerner data, and continue using My HealtheVet for information related to other facilities.
- _April - July 2021_ - A series of OCTO-OCC Digital Health Modernization Workshops is held, and the concept of bringing My HealtheVet into VA.gov, previously referred to as _Health Home_ becomes the _Health Apartment_, in reference to a metaphor describing it as an apartment within the larger "building" of VA.gov.
- _December 2021_ - President Biden signs an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/) stating that, in part, The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall "provide digital services through a single, integrated, and equitable digital platform on VA.gov and the VA mobile app". 
- _March 2022_ - The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted two inspections and identified deficiencies in data migration, medication orders, and medication reconciliation.
- _Mar - Jun 2022_ - Cerner's EHR and patient portal deployed at four more VAMCs (Walla Walla, WA; Columbus, OH; Roseburg, OR; White City, OR) 
- _Oct 2022_ - VA announced it would delay upcoming deployments of its new EHR until June 2023 to address challenges with the system and make sure it is functioning optimally for Veterans and VA health care personnel
- _Nov 2022_ - a memorandum was signed by Donald Remy, Deputy Secretary of the VA, that officially gave approval for My HealtheVet to be integrated into VA.gov as an untethered patient portal versus using Cerner's patient portal.

### Team Dynamics
We are working very closely with the same Office of Connected Care (OCC) stakeholders who were instrumental in designing and building "classic" My HealtheVet in 2003.  Their product teams have been responsible for maintaining and enhancing it over the last 20 years and have a very close working relationship with OCC. OCC and their product teams are all extremely knowledgeable in their respective areas, understand the dependencies between their teams and products, and like us, are thoroughly vested in doing what's best for our Veterans.

Throughout this endeavor, it will be crucial that we collaborate closely with our OCC partners and maintain a professional, mutually respectful rapport. In years past, a different team external to OCC came in and said they were going to take over and shut down MHV.  Understandably, that approach generated a great deal of angst and eroded trust between OCC stakeholders and external organizations.  With that history in mind, it is important that our team be aware of those sensitivities in our daily interactions.

We should use every interaction with our business partners as an opportunity to demonstrate our expertise and commitment to helping them succeed in getting this work across the finish line.  We want to earn their trust by reinforcing that we are on the same team, and are partnering _with_ them, versus actively trying to replace them.  At the end of this initiative, the expectation is that OCC and their respective product teams will continue to own and maintain their products long-term.
