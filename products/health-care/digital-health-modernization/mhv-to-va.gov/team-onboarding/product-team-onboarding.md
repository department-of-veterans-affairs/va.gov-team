# MHV to VA.gov Product Onboarding Quick Start Guide
Last Update: November 10, 2022

This guide touches the highlights in the overall [VA.gov onboarding process](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/), but is not a substitute for that document.  Always defer to the VA Platform documentation for the most complete and current information.  

## Admin Info
Before you get started with onboarding, you will need a few key pieces of information:
1. Name of your Program Manager
2. Name of your OCTO-DE Product Owner
3. Name of your VA Business Owner
4. All team members will need a GitHub account/handle (see GitHub section below)
5. Name of the contract you're on
6. Name of the COR (Contracting Officer's Representative) on your contract and their email address
7. Name of the VOR (Vendor Onboarding Representative) on your contract and their email address
8. Team name -  If this is a brand-new team, you and/or your Product Owner should decide on a name, and will need to create a [new VFS Team Request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=governance-team%2C+analytics-insights&template=new-vfs-team.md&title=New+VFS+Team+%5BInsert+team+name+here%5D)
9. Team members' start dates - Each team member will need to know their employment start date for their orientation request
10. Team slack channel - please work with your Product Owner, who may already have created a channel, or create one for your team if needed.

## Communication
Most day-to-day communications between VA.gov product team members happens in Slack.  Questions and feedback on specific GitHub requests is frequently done within the comments of the GitHub issue itself. In general, email is used infrequently and largely for communicating with VA personnel or outside vendors.

## GitHub
GitHub is used to track all work relating to VA.gov processes and embedded teams as well as pull requests.  Most repositories are public facing, please remember to not share sensitive information
- [Platform GitHub Repo Guidelines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/repo-guidelines.md) (privacy info, folder and file naming conventions, etc.)

1. Users will first need to create an account within GitHub (https://github.com/join).  *You don't need a VA.gov email address assigned to create the account, but once you have your VA email, add it to your GitHub account ASAP so you won't be removed from the repo* 
2. GitHub Handle - After creating a GitHub account, make note of your GitHub handle (user name).  You will need to provide this in your orientation request.
3. Once you have access to GitHub, create a [ZenHub account](https://www.zenhub.com/) and then connect your GitHub account to it. (https://www.zenhub.com/).  ZenHub runs in the browser on top of GitHub, or you can install a plug in on Chrome or Firefox. To link the accounts, access the ZenHub site, click Log In and enter your GitHub credentials.

### Slack Recommendations
There are over 400 channels in the DSVA workspace, so take advantage of the channel browser or search to look for channels relevant to your work. Here are some broader recommendations:
1. A team channel will need to be created by a user with access to the DSVA workspace
2. Additional users will then need to be invited within Slack to the workspace/channels

## VA Platform Website
The [VA Platform website](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/) is a valuable resource that contains the most current information about onboarding to the VA.gov platform, as well as recommended Slack channels, processes, documentation, and instructions for getting access to the tools and systems you will need.

### Platform Orientation
**All team members** working on a VA.gov project must complete an orientation request and should attend general and practice-specific orientation sessions. Orientation session descriptions will recommend team members for which the session is pertinent.

- [Platform Orientation Request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=governance-team%2C+analytics-insights%2C+analytics-request&template=orientation-epic.md&title=Platform+Orientation+Template+%5BYour+name+here%5D) - This request kicks off processes for granting you access to the VA GitHub repos. Be sure to complete all fields in the request and *be on the lookout for an email from an admin via GitHub. If you don't respond within a few days, your request will be archived.*
  - [VA Platform Getting Started](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/)
    - [Welcome](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/welcome)
    - [Orientation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/platform-orientation)
  - [Orientation Sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/calendly-orientation-sessions) - Schedule your own orientation sessions using Calendly.  Each session suggests team members who will benefit most.

### Getting Access to Tools
- The VA Platform site has detailed instructions on the [tools you will need](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/platform-tools) and [how to request access to each](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/request-access-to-tools).

### VA Platform Collaboration Cycle
As products and new features are developed for VA.gov, they go through a process called the Collaboration Cycle, where teams get feedback and guidance on their work to ensure it meets VA.gov experience standards.  Each member of the team should become familiar with the process and understand their responsbilities, Platform expectations, and the timing and required artifacts at each touchpoint.

If they have already left, their HR manager, Product Manager, Product Owner, or Program Director can submit one on their behalf.
