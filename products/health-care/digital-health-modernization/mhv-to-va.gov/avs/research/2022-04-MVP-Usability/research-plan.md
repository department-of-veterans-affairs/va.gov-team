# Research Plan for AVS on VA.gov MVP, April 2023

## Background
After Visit Summaries (AVS) serve many purposes*, including:
-	Promote patient-centered, outpatient care
-	Summarize medications, appointments, tests, patient education material and other instructions
-	Enhance communication
-	Engage patients in their care
-	Improve recall of medical instructions
-	Meet electronic health record Meaningful Use criteria

Within VA today, Veterans at certain clinics are handed a printed AVS when leaving their appointment, providers can review an AVS with them during their appointment from CPRS, and select Veterans can view a PDF version of AVS on My HealtheVet. Now, we want to create an AVS experience on VA.gov. 

Past user research on [the existing PDF AVS]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/avs/research/AVS%20UT%20presentation%20%209-15-16%20final.pdf), helpdesk feedback on MHV legacy’s AVS, health apartment discovery studies that included AVS, and medical journal articles were reviewed to understand:
-	Veteran expectations on what constitutes an AVS
-	AVS’s value to a Veteran

*Purposes copied from [AVS User Guide]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/0eebafe247417bf1249b8b1917a69d180ccf69fe/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/assets/After-Visit-Summary-User%20Guide-1.2.pdf)

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 
1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans and caregivers on the After Visit Summary MVP about ease of use and how well it met expectations. 
 
Additionally, we want to know if:
- if Veteran/caregivers understand the information displayed within the AVS
- what notifications Veterans expect to get about AVS

### Outcome
We will apply insights from this research to improve and iterate on the VA.gov AVS experience.

### Research questions
- Can Veterans/caregivers easily find the AVS within the Appointments section?
- Can Veterans/caregivers easily find the AVS within the Care Summaries and Notes section?
- Are any sections or terms displayed within the AVS confusing to Veterans/caregivers?
- Is there any information missing that Veterans/caregivers expect to see in an AVS?
- What notifications about AVS are helpful to Veterans?
  - How much information do Veterans expect in different notification types?
  - Do Veterans expect on-site notifications within MyVA, My HealtheVet landing page, and/or within the appointments section?
  - Do Veterans expect text/email notifications?

### Hypotheses
_Hypothesis 1:_ Veterans and caregivers will be able to locate the AVS within the Appointments section.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Veterans and caregivers will be able to distinguish AVS from the other health summaries listed in the Care Summaries and Notes section. 

_Hypothesis 3:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will use different terms than those displayed in the AVS for at least some of the medical terms. 

_Hypothesis 4:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will not understand all of the medical terms without support. 

_Hypothesis 5:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will have clear insights into what notifications and information within each notification would be beneficial to them.

## Method

### Interviews
This research will be conducted as a remote moderated user research study that utilizes a prototype (TBD on details of the prototype type) built for mobile devices (and desktop?). Participants will be asked to complete specific tasks for usability testing and asked follow-up questions to gain understanding of expectations and satisfaction.

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom. 

### Research materials
