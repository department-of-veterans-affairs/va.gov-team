## **Moderator logistics**


### 2-3 days before the session:



* Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Checklist.1958773011.html#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions).
* Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study


### Day of the session:



* Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
* Mute your Slack notifications.
* Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).


### Starting the session:



* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
* In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
* Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
* When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:


### When the participant joins:

Validate the participant uses the VA Health and Benefits website and get permission for observers to join.



* Thanks so much for joining today. My name is Melissa, very nice to meet you. Today we're going to talk about the website appointments part of VA.gov. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the site for Veterans in the future. 
* Before we begin: I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. If it’s ok with you, I’ll have them join. 

_(If the participant agrees, let observers join. Each observer should come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off.)_


## **Introduction (5 minutes)**



* There are a few things I'd like to mention:
    * There are no right or wrong answers, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the mobile website and make it work better for everyone.
    * There’s no expectation to provide any personal information. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
    * This entire session will take no more than 60 minutes. I will keep an eye on the time and try to keep us moving along so that we don’t go over. 
    * The format of the session is that we’ll talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where I’ll ask you to login to your VA.gov account and share your screen. 
    * Finally, is it ok if I record the screen and the audio during our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to to make sure our notes are accurate. The recordings will be destroyed after we do this. 
    * **While we are so very grateful to have you here and get your feedback, the number one priority is making sure you feel comfortable in this session so if for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**
* Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?
* Great! Any questions before we continue?
* Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. 

_Start recording._



* Is it ok if we record this session?


## **Section 1: Warm-Up Questions (5 minutes)**

Before we look at the site, I have a few questions first, as it would be great to learn more about you and how you use the VA for health and benefits.



* What type of device are you joining us on today? 
* What VA services do you currently use?
    * How do you typically access those services? Website, phone call, something else?
* Are there any interactions with the VA that stand out to you (either positive or negative) that they could share?
* How do you usually schedule and manage your VA appointments?


## **Section 2: Login and Screen share (5 minutes)**



* During our session today, I am going to have you imagine a series of Appointment related scenarios using VA.gov. To do this I will neeed you to share your screen. I can walk you through how to start the screen share. \
_[Help participant share screen] \
_[iOS: Zoom screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share) \
[Android: Zoom screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share)
* Great, I’m seeing your screen. 
* Now, imagine you want to review your appointments on va.gov, show me where you go to login and go ahead and do it. (you can turn recording off if it shows the PW)


### Section 3: Usability tasks (45 min)


#### Task 0: First impressions (5 minutes)



* I want to direct your attention to the website now. What are your first impressions when you first click on the appointments tool and are directed to the appointment page.
    * Please describe this first screen. 
    * What stands out to you <span style="text-decoration:underline;">first</span> when you opened this website?
* Now, I am going to give you a series of tasks for you to do on the website. Please talk aloud as you go, so I better understand what steps you are taking and why. If you find anything frustrating or confusing as part of this process, please feel free to share that feedback too. 



#### Task 1: Facility/clinic selection for direct scheduling(10 minutes)



* PROMPT: You would like to schedule an appointment at a VA facility near you. Without activating anything, where do you think you’d find that? You can look/swipe around the screen, just don’t activate anything.
* Go ahead and use the website to complete the task. Once you’re there, stop and wait for the next instruction.
    * _If not successful: Help them navigate to where they need to go. Note where they have trouble._


#### Task 2: Provider selection for CC (10 minutes)



* PROMPT: You need to make a community care appointment. How do you go about making a community care appointment with your provider? Without activating anything, where do you think you’d find that? You can look/swipe around the screen, just don’t activate anything.
* Go ahead and use the website to complete the task. Once you’re there, stop and wait for the next instruction.
    * _If not successful: Help them navigate to where they need to go. Note where they have trouble._


#### Task 3: Breadcrumb and URL updates/ Descriptive back (10 minutes)


* PROMPT: You are curious the last time you visited your provider, where would you go to find out the date of your last appointment?  Without activating anything, where do you think you’d find that? You can look/swipe around the screen, just don’t activate anything.
* Go ahead and use the website to complete the task. Once you’re there, stop and wait for the next instruction.
Once they navigate to past appointments ask them to expand one of them. Now ask "how would you go back to your list of upcoming appointments?
Observe as they navigate. Are the breadcrumbs accurate? Are they using the descriptive back button? Do they mentions using it as they think out loud?"

#### Task 4: Print appointment details (10 minutes)



* PROMPT: Imagine you want to print the details for an upcming appointment. Without activating anything, where do you think you’d find that?
* TASK 1: Go ahead and use the website to complete the task but don't actually print it. 
     *_If not successful: Help them navigate to where they need to go. Note where they have trouble._
* TASK 2: Navigate to a past appointment to do the same thing but again, you do not have to print anything.
* TASK 2: If you have a pending appointment, go ahead and do the same thing. 

#### Task 5: After visit summary (10 minutes)

* PROMPT: Can you show me how you would get to an after-visit summary of a VA appointment you had with your provider?
* TASK 1: Go ahead and use the website to navigate to view an appointment’s after-visit summary.
   * _If not successful: help them navigate. Note if the information is displayed as intended and whether user comments on anything that is confusing without prompting. Also, ask them to click on links.

   * _If not successful: help them navigate. Note if the information is displayed as intended and whether user comments on anything that is confusing without prompting. Also, ask them to click on links.
