# Research Plan for UAT AVS MVP on VA.gov 2024-01

<br/>

## Research Goals 	
The purpose of this UAT research is to validate if the AVS MVP feature is working as intended and whether participants can easily navigate to the AVS MVP. Are there any areas of difficulty? Are the navigation changes displaying correctly?
Are participants able to complete each of the tasks given to them? If not, what went wrong?

## Background
Within VA today, Veterans at certain clinics are handed a printed AVS when leaving their appointment, providers can review an AVS with them during their appointment from CPRS, and select Veterans can view a PDF version of AVS on My HealtheVet. Now, we want to create an AVS experience on VA.gov. 
After Visit Summaries (AVS) serve many purposes*, including:
-Promote patient-centered, outpatient care
-Summarize medications, appointments, tests, patient education material and other instructions
-Enhance communication
-Engage patients in their care
-Improve recall of medical instructions
-Meet electronic health record Meaningful Use criteria

### Outcome
We will use the findings to:
 
- Validate the After-visit summary MVP is populating with user data as intended.
- Validate the After-visit summary MVP’s interactive elements are behaving as intended.
- Validate the After-visit summary MVP is accessible for screen reader and low vision users.
- Validate breadcrumb and URL updates.
- Validate the changes to the navigation descriptive back link.


### Research questions
1.	Are participants able to navigate through the “past” appointment feature to view an existing AVS from a past appointment? Are there any areas of difficulty? Are the navigation changes displaying correctly?
2.	Do users mention that the information within the AVS is confusing when unprompted? 
3.	Does each interactive element of the AVS MVP behave as intended? 
4.	Is the information in the AVS MVP displayed as intended?
5.	Can users navigate back to another AVS with the “back to” link.
6.	Are participants able to complete each of the tasks given to them? If not, what went wrong?
7.	Can screen reader and low vision users access and easily navigate the AVS MVP? 

## Method

### Interviews
This research will be conducted as a remote moderated user research study that utilizes a [staging]() built for mobile devices. Participants will be asked to complete specific tasks for UAT and asked follow-up questions to determine if the AVS MVP is behaving as intended.

This test will include 2 versions of the AVS MVP:
Mobile
Desktop

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom.
