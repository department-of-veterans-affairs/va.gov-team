# Template for Research Plan for VAOS Appointments and After-visit Summary Usability 


## Background

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

The VA Online Scheduling team has worked to evaluate the usability of the existing appointment list. A redesign of the appointment list was created based on the [feedback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/2022-appts-list-usability/research-findings.md) during Veteran research sessions. The usability of the redesign was then tested with Veterans and the findings were incorporated in updated designs. The VA Online scheduling team now seeks feedback from Veterans using screenreaders to validate the changes made to the appointment list for low and non-sighted Veterans.

Futhermore, Within VA today, Veterans at certain clinics are handed a printed AVS when leaving their appointment, providers can review an AVS with them during their appointment from CPRS, and select Veterans can view a PDF version of AVS on My HealtheVet. We created a new AVS MVP experience on VA.gov.

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase üìà

-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an after visit summary, a print functionality on the appointment list page, and ease of navigation with updated breadcrums.

Decrease üìâ

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it.

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

-   MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

-   MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
-   MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

-   Maintaining my emotional health
-   Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

-   MTM: Taking care of my health
-   MTM: Managing my declining health

Research goals
--------------

The goal of this research is to twofold: verify that logged in Veterans are able to utilize recently added features, the After-visit summary MVP, (UAT) and also to understand their mental models as they navigate through Appointments with the updated navigation and UI chanages (Usability). 

Goal 1: (UAT) Verify that logged in Veterans are able to utilize recently added features and data is populating as expected.

Goal 2: (Usability) Understand their mental models as they navigate through Appointments and the After-visit summary MVP with the updated navigation and UI chanages. 

### Research questions

1. Are participants able to navigate through the appointments feature? Are there any areas of difficulty? Are the navigation changes displaying correctly?
2.	Are participants able to navigate through the after-visit summary feature? Do users mention any information within the AVS as confusing when unprompted? 
3.	Does each interactive element of the AVS behave as intended? 
4.	Is all AVS information displayed as intended?
5.	Can users navigate back to another AVS with the ‚Äúback to‚Äù link.
6.	Are participants able to complete each of the tasks given to them? If not, what went wrong?
7.	Can screen reader and low vision users access and easily navigate the AVS? 


### Outcome

We will use the findings to:

- Validate breadcrumb and URL updates.
- Validate the changes to the navigation descriptive back link.
- To validate the print button design or make iterations based on feedback.
- To understand and validate assumptions around the current facility/clinic selection process for direct scheduling.
- To understand and validate assumptions around the current provider selection for Community Care appointments. 
- Validate the After-visit summary is populating with user data as expected.
- Validate the After-visit summary's interactive elements are behaving as intended.
- Validate the After-visit summary is accessaible for screen reader and low vision users.

### Hypotheses

When logged in Veterans are in the appointments feature on VA.gov:

-   They will be able to navigate their appointments as expected.
-   They will be able to navigate to a past appointment's after-visit summary as expected.
-   They will be able to print a list of their (upcoming, pending, past) appointments. 
-   They will be able to find the information they need to attend/join their appointments.
-   They will be able to find and review their after-visit summary.


Method
------

We'll run a moderated usability test on the appointments list redesign and the newly added after-visit summary MVP feature.

This test will include 2 versions of the appointments list:
-   Mobile
-   Desktop

### Location

Remote, over Zoom.

Recruitment
-----------

### Recruitment approach

Perigean will recruit 16 total participants for this study. We will ask Perigean to treat each of three groups as a separate recruitment effort: mobile and desktop.

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria**

Desktop users:
-  8 participants who primarily use a desktop/laptop computer.
-  All participants must be able to attend sessions on their desktop/laptop computer.
-  All participants must use va.gov for appointments and have upcoming appointments.

Mobile users:
-  8 participants who primarily use a tablet or other mobile device.
-  All participants must be able to attend sessions on a mobile device.
-  All participants must use va.gov for appointments and have upcoming appointments.


**Secondary criteria:**

- At least 4 veterans with a cognitive disabilty
- At least 2 Screenreader users
- At least 2 screen magnification users
- At least 1 LGBTQ+ Veteran
- At least 1 Native Veteran
- At least 1 who lives in a rural area


### Screener Questions:

1.	Do you have any upcoming appointments listed when you login to VA.gov?
2.	Do you have a My HealtheVet account?
3.	Have you recently received a printed after-visit summary of your appointment at a VA healthcare facility?
4.	Have you had any VA facility healthcare appointment between the dates of TBD and TBD?
- If yes to all questions, then recruit.
- If no **to any one question**, then **do not** recruit.
