## How this research maps to the Veteran journey
- Taking care of myself
- Putting down roots
- Retiring
- Aging
   <br> 
 <br> 

## OCTO DE goals that this research supports
- Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov.
- Veterans can manage their health services online.
- VFS teams can build and deploy high quality products for Veterans on the Platform.
- Usage of digital, self-service tools.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 
## Research goals
The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans and caregivers on the after visit summary AVS MVP for My Healthe Vet on VA.gov about the ease of use and how well the AVS meets expectations on the following criteria:
- if Veteran/caregivers understand the information displayed within the AVS.
- what notifications Veterans expect to get about AVS.
 <br> 
 <br> 

 ##  Research questions
- What are Veterans’/caregivers’ past experience with an AVS in either paper form or online?
- Can Veterans/caregivers easily find the AVS within the Appointments section and/or the Care Summaries
Notes section for a particular appointment?
- How do they navigate to an AVS; is it via Appointments or Care summaries and notes?
- Are any sections or terms displayed within the AVS confusing to Veterans/caregivers?
- Is there any information missing that Veterans/caregivers expect to see in an AVS? Or information
displayed that Veterans/caregivers weren't expecting to see?
- Is the information and layout displayed consistent with Veterans’/caregivers’ mental models?
- Do Veterans/caregivers prefer one notification for each AVS or one notification for all appointments in
one day?
- What information do Veterans/caregivers expect in an AVS notification?
 <br> 
 <br> 

 ## Method
- This research was conducted as a remote moderated study on the Zoom platform. Each session was 1
hour in length, where each participant was asked to interact with a Figma prototype built for mobile devices.

- When time allowed, most participants were asked to complete 7 tasks interacting with the prototype, while the
moderator asked them questions to gain understanding of expectations and satisfaction.

 ##  Key findings 
 
### Past AVS Experience

**1. When asked if they review their health information, appointments, tests, or doctor’s orders, all participants mentioned they routinely access this data, but they do so through different means.**

- My HealtheVet: 7
- VA AVS paper printout: 4
- Non-VA AVS: 2
- Lab specific paper reports: 2
- VA AVS (unknown if digital or paper printout): 1
- Printout of upcoming appointments: 1

**Recommendation:** Spread awareness via the changebmanagement process that a digital AVS is available on VA.gov.
 <br> 
 <br> 

**2. The information in the AVS MVP matches the data that participants routinely review after their appointment.** 

- Labs: 6
- Medications: 4
- Provider notes/what provider documented: 3
- Appointments: 2
- Instructions before an upcoming procedures, radiology, and tests: 2
- Results from a procedure and radiology: 2
- Blue button: 1
- Vitals: 1
- Terminology: 1
- Medical tasks that need to be completed: 1

**Note:** Participants had not reviewed the prototype yet when they shared this information.
  <br> 
 <br>     

**3.The nomenclature "After-visit summary" is consistent with Veteran/caregiver mental models.**

- After appointment confirmation or Post OP: 1
- After-visit summary: 2
- Summary report: 1
- Appointment review: 1
- Lab print-out: 1
- An overview or summary: 1
- A review of medical records: 1
- Doctor’s notes: 1
- A visit summary: 1
- Lab results or radiology results: 1
- A summary of visit: 1
- Prior-office visit information: 1

**Recommendation:** Keep referring to this experience as the "After After-visit summary."
 <br> 
 <br> 
  
### Information Architecture
<br>

**1. Veterans/caregivers expected to find the after-visit summary within either “appointments” or “care summaries and notes".**


**Recommendation:** Keep the current Information architecture plan.
<br>
<br>

**2. When they reached the AVS page, 6 participants mistakenly thought they needed to click on the "Details" link to get to the AVS.**
<br>
<br>
**Example**
- Participants were instructed to navigate to the June 6th, 2023 at 9:50 a.m. with Dr. Nutt AVS.
- Once they successful reached the AVS, many participants didn't scroll down the page, and instead, they proceeded to click on the "Details" link, expecting to find 9:50 a.m. AVS with Dr. Nutt.
 
 **Recommendation:** Remove the "Details" link.


**3. When asked to find either the doctor's instructions or their lab results, 7 participants thought they needed to click on the "Details" link to access that information.**

> It's not allowing me to click on details…It will actually show me the summary notes of the visit, and then, when I click on the lab work well, I don't know if that lab work is part of the 9:50 appointment, or not, because it has a 11:30 a.m. time. I wouldn’t know if that's the next procedure that the doctor wants me to have done.

 **Recommendation:** Remove the "Details" link.
<br>
<br>

**4. 10 participants easily navigated from one AVS to another AVS using the back breadcrumb.**

**Some of the other locations the 3 participants tried to click on to navigate were:**
- Collapsing the AVS accordions.
- Scrolling to the bottom of the page.
- Clicking the Hector profile icon.

**Recommendation: The navigational structure (back buttons) can remain the same.**
<br>
<br>

**5. 3 out of 6 participants, who navigated to the AVS via “appointments” section, expected the "pending" list to include referrals, recall, follow-up, or imaging appointments that still need to be scheduled.**

**All participants correctly assumed this list did not display confirmed appointments.**

> I would expect to see the...ones that...I've either requested myself...or another provider has put into the system, but they haven't been confirmed yet, either by me or the other person.

**Recommendation: Conduct further research when adding referrals and recalls to the appointment list.**
<br>
<br>

### AVS Content

**1. Overall, most participants had very positive responses to the after-visit summary and found it very valuable.**

> It looks pretty thorough, and I like the way it's sectioned out…I think it kind of gets more to the summary of everything without having to read through a whole couple of paragraphs to figure out what was going on. 


 > It looks like it will give me quicker access to the information that I'm looking for.
<br>
<br>

**2. Even though 50% of participants stated the instructions within the "Your treatment plan from this appointment" section were useful, many requested additional instructions.**

**Examples of information requested:**
- What to do for upcoming tests (or knowing that they don't have to do anything).
- Phone numbers and addresses of imaging facilities and pharmacies.
- Deadlines and turn-around times for lab work before certain procedures or appointments.
- Whether tests can be done on a walk-in basis or if an appointment is required.

**Recommendation:** Additional research is needed to assesses technical implications and determine Veteran value.
<br>
<br>

**3. 8 participants didn't know what a “recall appointment” meant.**

> Recall appointments are appointments that someone has to come in multiple times for something; maybe they need to come in weekly for their blood pressure… they need to have their blood drawn every 2 weeks to check or something like that, just to kind of remind people because life gets busy. 

> I don't know, because VA doesn't do walk-ins to see your primary care. I'm not sure what a recall appointment is.

**Recommendation:** Eliminate the term "recall" and devise a more intuitive and accurate label.
<br>
<br>

**4. 4 participants incorrectly defined the "You were diagnosed with" section.**

- They defined "You were diagnosed with" as all new diagnoses from this appointment and past diagnoses from other appointments instead of the diagnoses from this appointment only.
- When asked about the alternative section title, "Health conditions you discussed," participants defined that section as concerns and conditions discussed with their provider at this appointment, which may or may not be official diagnoses.
- Participants commented that both "You were diagnosed with" and "Health conditions you discussed" were valuable to review within the After-visit summary.

**Recommendation:** Explore an alternate title to the "You were diagnosed with" section.
<br>
<br>

**5. 7 participants understood correctly that the “Problem list” showed all their diagnoses, past and present; however, some participants were confused, or found it redundant, with the "You were diagnosed with" section.**

> I guess these are the things that you tested me for and these are the problems that you saw.

> I feel like, if you are going to keep the problem list...then you can just take away the ["You were diagnosed with"] section.

**Recommendation:** Explore ways to remove confusion between the "You were diagnosed with" and "Problems list" sections.
<br>
<br>

**6. At least 6 participants were unfamiliar with certain medical terms, and they requested additional resources to help them understand.**

> Respirations...what does that mean?

> I would probably have to look up some of this. [Hypertension]…I don’t know what that is. Could they put a link, what does this mean? Like a glossary similar to the medication section. That way that I don’t have to get on Google and diagnosis myself that I’m dying …like we all do.

> The PO… that is unclear…Oh. Yeah, that [means] Post Office.

**Recommendation:** Complete a content review of medical terminology, ensure clinicians enter patient-friendly descriptions, and expand links to patient education articles.
<br>
<br>

**7. 6 participants would like their vitals to be displayed in Imperial/U.S. standard measurements instead of the metric system.**

> The temperature in Celsius is not helpful for me...I got to go get a converter for that.

> The height and weight I prefer to have in inches and pounds if I'm the one using it. Obviously, the medical people probably want it [in metric].

> I don't know what the temperature is…instead of Fahrenheit. What is 36.4 C?


**Recommendation:** Ensure that the default configuration is set to Imperial/U.S. standard, which the VA AVS system already provides.
<br>
<br>

### Medications

**1. 8 participants incorrectly interpreted the "Medications administered at the clinic" section.**

**Participants assumed the medication:**
- Would be received during a later visit.
- Was given at the clinic, but also required them to take more later at home after picking up a prescription.
- Would either be administered during the procedure or mailed to them to take before arriving to an appointment.

> That's what's being used during the procedure…so, they ordered it…and said… you… [are] going to get this in the mail; you need to make sure you take this and it's going to be telling you how to take it. And you take it before you come in for the procedure.

> It says, give…[not] given…[it should] say the time…and a date…It doesn't say if it's given or not…so I'm thinking…It's saying that he hasn't taken it yet.

**Recommendation:** Change the section title and label to be more intuitive.
<br>
<br>

**2. The "My medications" section met the expectations of most participants; many were satisfied with the depth and breadth of the information displayed.**

> This is much more informative, I like this layout, or I like the amount of [information]...If I forgot how much to take, I could refer to information relayed here. I guess the other was just a summary, this is more like a full history.
<br>
<br>

**3. Approximately half of the participants were either confused about the difference between the three medication sections, or they wanted all three sections combined into one.**

> You’ve got multiple places to get what you’re looking for. Again, that this goes back to the redundancy…If I'm looking the prescription information, I shouldn't have to go to 3 different spots and find prescription information.

**Recommendation:** Explore labels to clarify the differences across the three medication sections or combine all three into one section.
<br>
<br>

**4. Some participants asked for additional instructions for their medications.**

**They requested:**
- What condition they are taking the medication for.
- Instructions on when to take it.
- Why they stopped taking a medication and what the adverse reactions were.

> I want to know what I was taking Tylenol for.

**Recommendation:** Display the existing indication field and continue to research the other requests.
<br>
<br>

### Notifications

**1. All participants wanted a notification (email, text, etc.) that their AVS was ready to view.**

**Modality preferences:** 
- 3 Text only
- 2 Email only
- 7 Either text or email 

**Recommendation:** Create after-visit summary notification for each modality and an associated notification preference for personal customization.
<br>
<br>

**2. Participants were equally divided between receiving one notification for each AVS or receiving all AVSs for a given day together in one notification.**

> I would prefer all in one; because then that way,...I'm not waiting to see that each one comes…and I'm counting 3 separate ones. I count one notification, I click into that, and I can find anything that happened during that day.

> I would like one for each visit, because what if the first doctor I saw…sent…the after-care summary. But then my third doctor of the day well, he didn’t…send that in;...then I don't have to keep reminding myself to check back and look for it.

**Recommendation:** For the MVP, separate notifications for each AVS. In later phases, expand to displaying one notification for each day.
<br>
<br>

### Secondary findings

**1. 2 out of 6 participants were confused by the label "Schedule and manage appointments.**

> My first thought would be to schedule and manage appointments, but I already had [the appointment]. So, it's not really scheduling it, but I don't see anything else that would be relevant.


**Recommendation:** Add this as a research finding to the content brief. If evidence continues to suggest Veteran/caregiver confusion, then make changes to the label.
<br>
<br>

**2. 4 participants saw value in sharing their after-visit summary with non-VA providers.**

> I could print it out…my dad… also uses the VA, we can go onto his site, and I can see what he is allergic to and help his providers…So, it'd be easy… a nice thing to print out.

> If I were to see a provider outside the VA that would need my medication list, this is a great reference for me to pull and either print-out.


**Recommendation:** Ensure the AVS product has a good print stylesheet and an accessible, downable PDF.
<br>
<br>

**3. 2 participants mentioned it would be helpful having additional phone number information or features.**

**1 participant was asked if the information in the recall appointments was helpful:**
> Again…there’s no phone number to call.

**1 participant suggested having live phone links:**
> If you made the phone number a link, so if…I’m looking at it on my phone,…If we just hit the phone number and it calls.

**Recommendation:** Add phone numbers within the “appointments” section and make them clickable.
<br>
<br>

**4. 2 participants didn't understand the clinic name.**

> The clinic with the colors might be confusing if you're not aware that you're assigned…by color. You're like, I don't know what that means. I don't have any idea what color I am.

> I don't know what Red 4C is; if they're really telling you, what floor to go to…[I would like to see] just a room number… with conventional room numbers.

**Recommendation:** Make clinic names more user-friendly or display a combination of other appointment information, such as floor and room number.
<br>
<br>

**5. Over 30% of participants mentioned the after-visit summary is a good resource to verify whether their provider correctly understood their concerns during their visit.**

> I review that so that I can see how the doctor, or whoever I saw, interpreted what I was saying; if they heard what I intended to convey.


**Recommendation:** Explore ways to connect/crosslink AVS summaries and notes, so a complete story of what the provider understood can be shared with the Veteran/caregiver.
<br>
<br>

**6. 3 participants difficulty interpreting their lab results; they didn't know how they would use this information to help them manage their health.**

> I don't know how to read the lab results, so I don't know what that means.

> I know it gives a reference range, but I never know….if it's good or bad…I always look at the results and I never know how to interpret them, and I always have to call the Doc back.

**Recommendation:** Share this information with the medical records team working on VA.gov lab results.
<br>
<br>

**7. 7 Veterans mentioned that they sometimes don’t receive appointment summaries or lab results until 48-72 hours following the appointment.**

> In-person notes are loaded, usually 2 to 3 days after the initial visit, and so sometimes, they make people have to wait for the after-visit summary; so I request my husband to bring them to me, so that I know what transpired. -Caregiver participant

**Recommendation:** Within the AVS, add content to inform Veteran/caregiver that lab results are still in-progress and send the AVS notification as soon as it is available.
<br>
<br>

## Recommendations

### Recommendations to complete with MVP release

- Spread awareness via the change management process that a digital AVS is available on VA.gov.
- Keep referring to this experience as the "After-visit summary."
- Don't change the current information architecture plan to include AVS within appointments and care summaries and notes.
- Remove the "Details" link from the design.
- The navigational structure (back buttons) can remain the same.
- Ensure that the default configuration is set to Imperial/U.S. standard, which the VA AVS system already provides.
- Ensure that if clinicians entered patient-friendly descriptions, then display them within the AVS. 
- Display the existing medication indication field.
- Make phone numbers clickable.
- Share lab results feedback with the medical records team that is working on VA.gov lab results.
<br>
<br>

### Recommendations to consider for a Phase 2 release

- Review past appointment research into this label and add this as a research question to future studies. If evidence continues to suggest Veteran/caregiver confusion, then make changes to the label.
- Ensure that the AVS product has a good print stylesheet and an accessible, downable PDF.
- Conduct further research when adding referrals and recalls to the appointment list.
- Eliminate the term "recall" for these appointment types. Provide a more accurate and descriptive name for these type of appointments.
- Explore an alternate title to the "You were diagnosed with" section.
- Explore how to remove confusion between the "You were diagnosed with" and "Problems list" sections.
- Change the "Medications administered at the clinic" section title and label to something more plain language and understandable.
- Complete a content review of medical terminology within the AVS to identify areas for more plain language. Ensure that if clinicians entered patient-friendly descriptions, then display them within the AVS. In addition, expand patient education articles linking within the AVS.
<br>
<br>

### Recommendations to complete in a later iteration by the AVS team

- Explore ways to connect/crosslink AVS and other care summaries and notes, such as progress notes, so a complete story of what the provider understood can be shared with the Veteran/caregiver.
- Complete additional research to understand the technical and Veteran value of the additional information requests to the "Your treatment plan from this appointment" section.
- Expand patient education articles linking within the AVS. For example, make hypertension a link to an article describing the condition.
- Explore clearer labels to eliminate confusion across the different medication sections. Explore a combined medication sections.
- Research additional medication instruction needs further.
- Add phone number within the appointments section.
<br>
<br>


### Recommendations for later iterations and will require other teams:

- Within the AVS, add content to inform Veteran/caregiver that lab results are still in-progress and send the AVS notification as soon as it is available. Review past appointment research into this "Schedule and manage appointments" label and add this as a research question to future studies. If evidence continues to suggest Veteran/caregiver confusion, then make changes to the label. (Appointments and AVS teams).
- Explore ways to connect/crosslink AVS and other care summaries and notes, such as progress notes, so a complete story of what the provider understood can be shared with the Veteran/caregiver. (Medical records and AVS teams).
- Make clinic names more user-friendly or display a combination of other appointment information, such as floor and room number. (Appointments backend team)
Conduct further research when adding referrals and recalls to the appointment list. (Appointments team).
- Create AVS notification for each modality, such as email, text, push, or in-app notification. Also, create an associated notification preference. (VeText, VA Notify, Authenticated Experience, and AVS teams)
- Start with separate notification for each AVS. Then, explore expanding to one notification for each day in the future as another option. (VeText, VA Notify, Authenticated Experience, and AVS teams)
- Within the AVS, add content to inform Veteran/caregiver that lab results are still in-progress and send the AVS notification as soon as it is available.

**Note:**Hypothesis of teams needed for each item are included in the paratheses.
