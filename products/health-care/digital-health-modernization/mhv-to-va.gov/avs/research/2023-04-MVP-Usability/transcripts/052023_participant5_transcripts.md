00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Great. Now we'll do some more about. I'd like to start by learning more about your experience reviewing information about what was discussed during your medical appointment.
Do you recall we ever receiving paperwork as you left your appointment or reviewing information online that provided an overview of what occurred during your medical appointment?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Yes, yes, sir.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Okay. And why did you review that paperwork or online content?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Why did I reviewed basically, I guess it depends on what the appointment was for my most recent appointments were for the Burn Pitt Registry...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And so, I just wanted to see if there were any other actions that I needed to take, or any other resources that I was being directed to look into on the paperwork that I was given when I left that appointment.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Okay, and that it was paperwork that you both reviewed everything online.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Yeah, I mean, sometimes I'll follow up on different links that I've been given, usually what I'll review online after appointments are when I have my annual labs, I'll go on. I'll look at my labs, and then anytime I have any radiology stuff. I'll look at the Radiology report once that's available as well.

Oh, okay, but nothing that looks similar to that paperwork that you receive.

Exactly like it. No, but if there was a link on there on the paperwork that I thought I needed to look at, or was interested in, I would I'd log in and kind of explore. What else is out there related to whatever the appointment was for?

Notetaker: 
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now you gave an example about how you looked at this after you went to the Burn Pit appointment. But is there any particular appointment, type, or procedure that you routinely take a closer look at that paperwork?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:39.000
No, just like my labs like I mentioned, but I usually don't get any paperwork when I leave from my annual appointments.  Regarding my lab stuff, things that I'll get might be to if I want to do like an advanced directives,  things like that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Okay. And what would you call, or what name would you give to that paperwork that you receive after an appointment?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I don't know that I give it a normal name. I guess it'd just be, maybe. Like lab results, or if I get a printed-out report from radiology, it'd be test results or radiology results. MRI, or X-ray.


Task 1: Initial Reactions to the AVS Interface

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Next, we're going to take a look at the prototype. Then I'm going to send you a link in zoom chat. Have you ever used zoom chat before? Okay, hold on.


00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I have!


00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Let me copy the link. Okay, I just done it. And in chat, if you can access that and load it.

00:03:42.000 -->00:07:29.000
Redacted due to technical issues.


00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Okay, right? So now, I'm going to have you pretend that today's June sixth and your Hector, you can see Hector at the top. He just sent an appointment this morning at 9 50. It was Dr. Knutt, your primary care physician at the Puget Sound VA. Facility. So a few hours has passed since your appointment, and you forgot what your doctor's instructions for use.


00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Okay.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Use this prototype to find out what Dr. Knutt and you discussed at your appointment. So, you can direct me on. How would you do that? And I'll click for you. And is there any thought along the way from what you're seeing?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Okay, so I want to scroll down on the screen. Let's see medications. I keep going down health record.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Let's see, health history, health, history may be. Where I would go without knowing what else is behind. Okay? Care summaries. Yeah. 

I think I would click that. And we would. Yeah, so there it is, right there, there's today's (appointment) and then, I would click on the details.


00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Okay. Now that you're here, I'm going to have you again. You can tell me where to scroll, and we're going to review this whole page and talk a lot as you're reviewing it.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Okay. So with the appointment was at, it's looking like I had 2 appointments. Okay. The second one was a lab appointment. It looks like. So he probably ordered labs for me afterward, but I want to see what he talked about at the appointment with him. I would click the details. That's under the 9:50. The one that's above it. Yeah. Okay, to see the details of what we talked about.

Notetaker: Participant went to Health History, then Care Summaries, June 6th  at 9:50 and clicked on Details.


00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Okay, this is just because of the prototype that's not actually clickable.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
That's good to understand what you would expect if you clicked on details.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:40.000

Yeah. And then I think the other details. One would be details about what test that he ordered for the labs. And then maybe later on, once those lab results are back, they might be available there.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:10:00.000
But I think there's other places. I would go as well for those lab results like I do, for right now, when I use My HealtheVet.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So, and then I would go down. Okay, yeah. So that shows the vital that he took while was there. Yeah, looks like it's anything that.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:31.000
He’s going to order for me procedure for an ultrasound, medication, and then Treatment Plan.
I would click on that. I think that would have some additional. If you go up a little bit like you don't have to change the screen. But yeah, there you go. Yeah, it looks like that's a pretty good synopsis of the stuff that was discussed. And I would scroll down just to see if there's any other information.


00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000
That talks about the labs. Any order? Communications, that he renewed. Come back for blood pressure check. In October. Okay, tells me some stuff that I'm due for.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:40.000
My health information as of this appointment. I'm not sure what would be in that.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Okay, just tell us, who my team is, and my upcoming appointments. There a lot of recall appointment, we're seeing that before.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Wait! We'll stop you there. What? How would you define a recall appointment?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Recall appointment?  To me, I guess, would be like a follow-up. At least that's what I would think that it would refer to. I wouldn't think it would be recall like a product, recall, or anything, mostly. Yeah. And I think it would be follow-up, if there were any follow-up appointments to be made.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And how helpful or not helpful is this information to you? And why?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I think it's very helpful, because, basically is it served as a reminder to me for things that are a little bit in the future. I'm not be looking that far ahead, I know a lot of times, that’s when appointments are made.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I actually used to be [Redacted PII]. For a little while. So when we make appointments, I worked in  [Redacted PII].

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So, when the initial appointment was made, we printed out the letter that we would mail to the patient, and then, as it got closer, there's something in the system that generates the small cards that come in the mail like a week Or prior to an appointment, but in the app in between, that would allow me to go in here and look in case I need to do anything like plan ahead for putting in for time off from work for appointments.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
No, I'll have you. We'll keep going, and I can hear your feedback on the rest.


00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Yeah, and that a lot of this looks like it's just pretty much informational problem list kind of shots. When I was first diagnosed with certain things, immunizations.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So actually, it's a good shot record. I probably isn't going to have everything that's on there. But it'll have some of the important stuff. 

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Now, what would you define as important stuff?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Like the recurring stuff things that well, couple of things, one is going to be recurring like flu shots, the other would be possibly shots that are one time only, or that are recommended based on a certain age. So like it's got the pneumonia on their other ones, might be shingle shots and anything else that's kind of dependent on age.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Allergies, of course, are important. I know what my allergies are, but that's more important, I think, for anybody that's treating me just so they can kind of to avoid.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:14.000

Yeah, my results are right there. And I would anticipate every time I got different labs done that the new lab results would populate in here. I don't know if it would be necessary for history to be there.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Now, what would be your definition of new lab results?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Like, so based on the scenario. It says that I saw a doctor not this morning, and then he ordered some lab results, or some lab tests for me. So once those results became available, I would anticipate that I could find them here. The next time that I clicked into this particular program. And then I know, from using my healthy event, I can go historically and look at previous lab results as well. But that would be way too cumbersome to have all your lab results from every single year on, just on here. I wouldn't expect to see that I probably wouldn't really want to see that either.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Radiology probably would be my most recent Radiology report. I know how to pull those from the blue button. Reports also on what they're called, and my healthy vet, and then what medication is my current medications?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
How to take them when they're good for when they let's see.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Does it say in there when they are most recently filled? Yeah, so.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:54.000
That's good, and then the supplies. I would think it'd be things like, yeah, like, I can see for the glucose test trips and stuff like that.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Yeah, if you've got a Cpap, for instance, last time you got supplies, or if there's any orders that are in there for new supplies, things like that.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And then medications. I'm sorry. Could you scroll just a little bit down so I'm sorry the other way are not taking no longer too okay. And then I would anticipate that would tell me.
That may be. The order was discontinued, or, like this one says, I'm not taking it, but the status is active, so I hope I would know why I'm not taking something that says that it's up.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:46.000
But if I see that and I'm not aware of it, I would discuss that with my doctor.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Okay? And so you would really expect this to be a different status displaying here. 

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Yeah, unless just a recent change potentially. But even so that there they usually hit quickly.
Yeah. They both say, active. So, I guess we would have to find out. Yeah, I'd have to know why. And if I don't know why, that I would discuss with my doctor to either determine whether I need to be taking it or change that status to like an active or you know, close the order out or whatever the case, would be.

Notetaker: Participant didn’t understand what the “Active” status meant in the medications section.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Hmm!

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And then , the date that I'm actually looking at it at the bottom.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
So now that you reviewed most of the agent Summary did.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Did he want you to complete or do anything following your appointment.

Notetaker: Participant did understand what Dr. Nutt’s after appointment instructions were about at first.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Just the labs that I saw, and then there was something where we're talking about, like the future appointments on there as well.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
And I can scroll anywhere to. If you want me to scroll.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Yeah, I for that. I would really just, you know, go back to the top and look again.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:16.000
What I need to do. I know that I know that I had that appointment 1130 that day.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
I see new orders. Yeah, new orders from this appointment.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:28.000
So let's see, consultation. I'll be contacted for rheumatology. Console.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:44.000
I'll have be contacted by imaging. So I know to be expecting those those calls as well. And then, if there's anything else below there.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Yeah. Laptops was on their medications order. That was for the section only lists.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
I'm looking at the medications and supplies only list changes.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
So, okay. So then there's the stuff that he renewed.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:09.000
So I know that I should be either picking that up from the lab or getting it mailed to me, I mean the pharmacy for getting it.


00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Depending on how I get my meds, and then other orders.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Yep, blood pressure check. So that's like a reminder that I need to come back in and just get a blood pressure check on that date.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Now, I'm actually gonna we're gonna scroll up to this top section.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Yeah.

Task 2: Your Appointment on June 6th, 2023
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
So there was a couple of main. This accordion right? We're just gonna review this first accordion.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Okay.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
So I know you reviewed it in a lot of detail. Can you provide an example of how you might utilize the information within this section?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
And I'll scroll through again, so you can take a look.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:21:05.000
How I might utilize it. Well, hmm, yeah, I mean, there's a number of different things that I can do if I'm checking my way regularly, I can compare it to you know what what my weight was during this particular appointment. You know as he told me, I need to lose weight or anything like that.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I would. If you can scroll down a little bit, please.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Blood, pressure. So like every once in a while, when I go to Walmart, for instance, they have the low blood pressure thing there, and I know it's not a hundred percent accurate. But and then some gyms will have blood pressure things at them as well like.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:54.000
If I go to any of the ones that are on the basis here in San Antonio, a lot of them will have the blood pressure machine where I can kind of take it after I'm done working out as well, or when I get there, however, I want to do it.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
No!

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Temperature I think, you know, unless I felt like I was sick, I probably wouldn't take my temperature on my own it's just kind of like a baseline. What today looks like, and then use that for any directions that my doctor gave me.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Are there any terms that seem unfamiliar or confusing with in this section?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Not nothing I've seen yet. No, I know what all that stuff means, but I mean I'm I'd like do mine do my annual appointments and stuff like that, and then, plus my wife's [Redacted PII].



00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
So that, you know, and I've worked in healthcare. After I retired for a little bit, so I know what some of the stuff is. Maybe I wouldn't have known otherwise. Yeah.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
I'm gonna have you focus on this that you are diagnosed with.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Oh, hypertension! I'm not sure.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Section. How, how would you yeah, how would you define what's actually not like?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
What hypertension is, but what is included with this section.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:11.000
What's included in the section. So if it's based on lab results based on vital, some of it's based on self reported things as well. And then the Ptsd would be diagnose, most likely by a behavioral health specialist.So this is kind of like a a snapshot of all the conditions that I have.
Whether they were diagnosed by somebody else or self reported.Yeah, like tobacco users. Not a condition, but it's a but it's something that's important for physician in know, in order to properly treat any conditions that I have, because they need to know if there's any potential conflicts with any medications that they might prescribed to me, based on what my lifestyle is.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Now, what if the section, the title of this section was Health conditions you discussed?
How would you define that? Then?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000
How would I define health conditions? I discussed? I think, yeah.
It would be, you know, for the hyperlipidemia and the vitamin d deficiency.

Notetaker: Participant didn’t understand that  ”health conditions discussed” was what was discussed during the appointment. Participant focused on the definitions.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:42.000
That would be from lab results, hypertension Review from the vitals that were taken that day.


00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Okay.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Would you basically be kind of a recap of what's already known and then, if there's any new conditions that were diagnosed, or that I wanted to report self report like chronic pain, you know, I'm having a lot of pain on my knee, for instance, yeah, well, okay, well, what level, are

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:59.000
you at, so that would be really, these are things that like it says are discussed between the 2 of us.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Now!

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Based based on known things. And then questions that I'm asked.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And how valuable or not valuable do you find this section to you?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:17.000
To me it's valuable because it gives a snapshot of overall. Health like in bullet form, and as somebody who would want to try to eliminate, or at least reduce some of these things here, it shows, hey? You know you've got these, the 7 conditions and.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Yeah, I would already know how some of them are being addressed, and I would know that some of them I would have to address with lifestyle changes or other ways that maybe would not require medication. For instance.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Now I'm going to scroll down to this section where it says medications ordered for administration in the clinic.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Okay.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
So what does the information under this section? We mean to you?




00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:13.000
To me. That means that was a medication that I was it was a onetime medication. That I was given during my appointment. Right? And it's not something that I'm going to be precise. No I'm going to going have to take it again. We're going to go to the next section.

Notetaker: Participant was correct to assume that the medication was administered during the clinic, but he also assumes that the medication is a “one-time” only medication and he wont have to take it further, which may not be the case.


Task 3: Your Treatment Plan from this Appointment

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:35.000
So your treatment plan from this appointment I'll scroll through again to give you a reminder of what's included in here.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Okay.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:43.000
And then my question should be to you would be, how would you utilize the information in this section?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Well, it's kind of the way forward, so to speak, where I know what. Like, based on the  Rheumatology, console the imaging appointments. So I'm going to have lab test stuff like that.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:18.000
I know that that information is going to be used for potential treatment is or add, or yeah, whatever is appropriate, based on the findings of those tests in those appointments.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Is there anything displayed here that you are unfamiliar with?Or you find confusing.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 No, although I just read for the first time yesterday one of the things it says there about the patients, all are need to faster. Most lab draws. I just saw that. Yeah. The first time that was new to me. So I would expect that either my doctor or the lab would let me know ahead of time if I did need to do a fasting.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
This is the first time you saw this here recently.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
I went. Hey, that I get like some Va emails and stuff like that.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000
And that was the first time I'd ever seen that.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Okay.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
So I was happy to see it.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Now, how would you describe this medication supply section? How would you define that?

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Well, it's bolded, only list changes. So that would, you know. I know that some of it says renewed. So I'm not.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
I don't know. That would be changes. Necessarily. It's just. I wouldn't think I would see renewed under changes. But maybe if I was being prescribed anything new, there might be another section that says new prescriptions, or something like that, and it says what it is, and with the dosages and things like that.

Notetaker: Participant was confused what the medications were under “Medications and supplies” section.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
No!

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
stuff…..

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Now, how valuable or not valuable do you find this particular medication section?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I find it pretty valuable. But I would expect that I'm going see that information again below in my ongoing care section. But it's going to capture everything that I'm taking. So I would know that yeah, today that those were renewed. But everything, thinking I'm going to find late farther down the list.

Notetaker: Participant expected to see they same information in another section so he felt it was redundant.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
No, we're going to go down here to your health information. As of this appointment and review this section now. So again I will scroll.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Okay.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Okay.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
This is this one pretty long, but I'll scroll through to remind you of what was in here, and same question is what I've asked for the other section. Can you provide an example of how you might use the information within this section?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Well, I like, I know, because, for instance, I have high cholesterol, so I would.
Utilize some of this as a reference point to you know between what my last labs were, what the most recent ones are, and then my next labs as well, I would.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
I'm I'm trying to catch everything on here is just roll.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000
So yeah, the scheduled, though. I'll.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
What I can go faster or slower, too.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Yeah, no, it's fine. How I would utilize this really also would be if I were to see a provider outside the Va.That would need my medication list this, this is a great reference for me to pull and either print out, or I can just copy down, depending on how much I want to share.

Notetaker: Participant would like a printer friendly option for this page so he can download and bring to his Non-VA provider.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
You know it's got the upcoming appointments on here. I would anticipate that. Know who my primary care, at least physician, is. I don't know that the nurse and things like that would be. I guess there'd be a reason I'd need to know. And like, if I'm doing certain things with nurse triage via telephone, or anything like that, am I talking to my nurse, or am I talking to a nurse of a specialty clinic for instance, depending on what their reason?

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Is, and I'm on the phone with them. Of course.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Got my appointments on there as well, I mean, just as somebody who.
I use my healthy vet. In fact, I was in there this morning contacting one of my providers because I had to reschedule an appointment I was supposed to have earlier today as a conflict.
So I would go in there. And if there was something that that I forgot, or that I need to know for any reason, I didn't have it right off the top of my head, I would refer to this this website.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Now, is there anything unfamiliar or confusing with this section?

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Nothing I've seen yet.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:55.000
And I'm just as I'm looking. Yeah, no, nothing so far. That's.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Okay. If you do see anything, as a community scroll, let me know.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Okay.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
But we'll stop on this problem list first. How would you define what you see in this section under problem with this?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Problem was to me would be, it would have the date on which I was first diagnosed with, you know, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc. So what? Show how long something has been going on, and then? I don't know if II can't say specifically why I would need to know those exact dates other than if I were asked by another provider that I was being seen by.

Notetaker: Participant didn’t understand that the Problems list is what was discussed with this appointment.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
But it is useful information. For that reason.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.000
You answer my next question, which was, how useful or not useful do you find this information we'll go on to the next one.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Okay.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:01.000
I'm gonna scroll down. I'll go slow in case you do find anything that you don't quite understand, or is confusing.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:13.000
I did see in there that if this was my record, that the my flu shot, my last one was in 2016, so I'm sure I would be asked why I'm not getting the flu shot.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
And that means are.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Okay, yeah, that's all lab stuff for analogies.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
We're going to stop here on medication. So let me scowl that.
How would you define this medication section?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
It's well, yeah, like, it's got right there.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Active prescription, status active. So I would think that the first section would be any active medications that I have, and then, if there's anything like a medication history stuff that I no longer take, that I would probably find that further on down the list.


00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:10.000
But I would my active stuff should be the most important stuff, and it should be the top of the medication lists. Anything that I'm currently prescribed in taking.


00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
So we showed a couple of different medication sections. The one was the Medications administered in the clinic. The next one was the medication changes during the appointment.
And then there's this. How would you describe the difference between all those and how the different?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
How would you utilize or not utilize those 3 sections?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
And since they all 3 exist in the document.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
For the medication that was administered in clinic.
If it was just a one time. Thing maybe it would be on this list further down under my medications.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:36:00.000
I'm not really sure the renewal one that you talked about the medication changes.
Yeah, that just tells me what's different now versus historically. And then this this section that we're looking at right now should have all the menu currently prescribed.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:20.000
And then, like I said, that I would anticipate any old medications would be further down this list.
So. How I would use this, I guess, would be to make sure that I'm that I have everything on hand that I'm supposed to have on hand. The like, the medications I get from the Va. Right now.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
It will tell me when it was last. It'll tell me this stuff about. You know the quantity? How many refills I have remains! Stuff like that is on the label as I get them in the mail. So I should have this info already. But if for some reason I'm on multiple medications, I'm not really good at tracking them.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:17.000
This is a good reference for me to make sure that I have everything on hand that I'm supposed to have, and then probably discuss with my doctor finds out that I'm not taking something that's on this list.

Notetaker: Participant didn’t understand the difference between “My Medications” and “Medications and supplies”


00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000
There probably be a discussion about what the reason is for that.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
No, I'm actually gonna we're gonna review this.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
What do these medications terms mean? So I'm going to click on this.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Okay.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:40.000
And then can you review this and provide your like initial impressions of this section?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Yeah.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Okay, yeah, so active is what I get from the Va non, Va, is gonna be anything that I either.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000
And prescribed over the counter. Stuff anything that I self report that I get from another source like I'm more retired.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:14.000
So I have tried care also, and if I'm getting anything from tri-care, I need to let my Va Doc know, and vice versa.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
I see my Tricare Doc. Also, I need to get both a full medication list. So that just basically says, where it's where, who's providing it to me?
Active. I know I'm getting from the Va. And then, non-BA, I should know where that's coming from, because I'm the one that reported that I have these Meds.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Now, how useful or not useful do you find this section of these medication terms?

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
I think it's useful. I think it's probably really more useful like I said. If I'm seeing docs both on the Va.Side and on the outside, whether it's Tricare or if it's community, care anything.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:14.000
But it's perfect, more important to them to know what I'm taking than it is to know where it's coming from.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:29.000
But for me, and it's just a reference.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Okay.



Task 5: More Information

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Now we're going to go down and review the last section which I don't think we've opened up yet so I'm going to click on this.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Okay.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Have you review what's in here? And then please talk aloud and share your thoughts as you review the section.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Okay, so yeah, I would anticipate that I would see these on here. Because this said my problem was at Ptsd. On it.So I would be seeing behavioral health for that cardiology, I'd be most likely saying, for my high blood pressure, and possibly for the high cholesterol as well, depending on if we've had any actual heart issues that were attributed to that.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:21.000
So those are other clinics that I. Routinely see, or at least occasionally see, on an ongoing basis based on the problem. With that that was toward the top of this, and then the more help and information, let me take a look at that real quick.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:47.000
This just gives me some additional links to go on like, if I want to refill my prescriptions online instead of doing it by phone, for instance, tells me what to go to do that.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.000
And yeah, I know I can pull up my appointments so my healthy vet also, I know about secure messaging cause. I use that this morning. So, yeah, this is helpful. In case I forget, like, how to get to a specific thing, or if I'm going to use this like secure messaging for the first time.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Is there anything you would add or take away from this more information? Section?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:47.000
I would, if my preference is to pick up my prescriptions at a pharmacy, I would maybe add the pharmacy contact in there info in there. But otherwise, I mean I, the stuff that I get from Va. I get mailed to me so I wouldn't need that.
But if that were the case, I would maybe want that in there, just in the event that.
I need to know their phone number for some reason, and this this would be a place that I know. I could go to get that info.

Notetaker: Participant would like to see the pharmacy list of location and address of where he can pick up his medications. Even though he, get his medications mailed to him, he’d like that information incase he’d like to pick up for some reason.

Task 6: Navigating to Another AVS

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Now you've officially reviewed the after visit summary, we're going to pretend now that you had another appointment in the past, and you're like Oh, I forget what we talked about there. Let's view the information from another appointment you had in the past. So how would you go about doing that? And I'll roll wherever you tell me to.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Well, I think I'd have to go all the way, probably to the top first and see what's up there. See after the summary. I'm thinking, if you hit that expand all with, like all of the stuff that is expanded right now, is that correct? Yeah, okay, okay, so back to summary and notes.And there should be the historical ones in there. I would think. So, yeah, so I would just go to if my previous one was in April.

Notetaker: He used the Back button to navigate back to Care Summaries. He didn’t have trouble finding another AVS.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
That primary care, progress. If that's so, you know any of these, really, that I'm looking for it.
Just, it depends what it is specifically that I'm trying to find you know, there's my mental health, one for behavioral health, for Ptsd. On the consult for any of the stuff that was send out to the community.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:51.000
I would guess submission, discharge it. Summary I know that would be if  I was in the hospital for any reason Podiatry, that wasn't discussed on this on the stuff we looked at previously.
So it looks like there's no and I didn't see any reference to a dietary on that stuff from the from today's visit. So I would guess that my, that I don't have a need to go back to that Podiatry.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of historical stuff that's gone back several years now.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
So!

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Cause. But if I was looking for a specific thing, and I knew roughly when it took place, I should be able to find it under the section.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
On a scale from one to 5, one being very easy in size, being very difficult. How easy or difficult was it to navigate to another state.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
I think it was very easy. I would say one.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Okay. Now, this next part, we don't need the prototype for. So I'm going to stop sharing.
And we will talk about notifications, notifications that you might want to receive about your after visits in summaries. So I'm going to have you pretend that you received the following message, the subject is new. After visit summary and the contents are a summary of your recent appointment is now available on my healthy vet login to review the summer.
Do you find this notification helpful or not helpful?

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
I find it helpful.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
And why?       

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Because I, because the kind of person I am, I always kind of want to go in and just make sure that I didn't forget anything that was discussed. Or anything important that needs to be in there, and my wife always asked me, How did your appointment go? You know. How are your labs? All that kind of stuff? So I can refer to those reports and kind of go over.

Notetaker: Participant really like the idea of getting a notification that an after-visit summary is ready to be viewed. He wants to ensure that he didn’t forget anything important and wants to go over his labs.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Okay.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
How would you prefer to receive this notification?

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Email or text would be fine, cause I know I'd have to go into my healthy vet to pull it up anyway.
So as long as I, as I got word that it was available, I know where I would need to go to find it.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
And if you had multiple appointments in one day, would you want one after visit? Summary notification for each appointment? Or would you want all the appointments combined into one message?

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Hmm! I would probably want to be notified as they became available. Yeah, and I think I'd want them separate by type of appointment or provider. What clinic I saw, or whatever the case is.

Notetaker: Participant doesn’t care whether notifications are email or text-has no preference over one or the other. He prefers separate notifications for each AVS and would like to receive them as soon as they become available. 

Notetaker: Would like the appointment separated either by appointment or by provider and what clinic or facility it was in.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Just a few more questions almost at the end. If you can change one thing about the after, is it summary? What would it be?

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
I didn't really see anything. That was a problem in there.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:54.000
So II don't know. I think it was pretty useful.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.000
I don't know that there's anything really that was missing from it. I think I don't have any suggestions.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Do you have any other final feedback about anything related afterwards?

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
And anything else that you haven't already shared.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:23.000
No, and fact. Now, the next time I go into my healthy event I'll probably go in there and look and see how it looks right now versus that cause you said, that's a prototype. Correct.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
This is a prototype. Yes, this is not built yet.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Yeah, I like that particular one as long as it would be printer friendly in the event that I need to print it and take it with me to another appointment Or if I wanted to print it off, and just keep like a copy a paper copy for myself for any reason. Okay. So you would want definitely want the ability to print on as well.

Notetaker: Likes the AVS Prototype but would like it to be printer friendly so he can take it to other doctor’s appointments.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Do you have any questions for me?

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
I don't.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Okay, great. So thank you so much. We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
So before you go, I do. Just wanna be clearly. Yes, this was the prototype.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
So we didn't do anything real. You haven't actually accessed your va.gov account, and pair gn will be sending you a thank you.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:25.000
You may know, so that they can have a chance to participate in feature research sessions just like what we did today.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
So thank you so much, and enjoy the rest of your day.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
You, too. Thank you.
