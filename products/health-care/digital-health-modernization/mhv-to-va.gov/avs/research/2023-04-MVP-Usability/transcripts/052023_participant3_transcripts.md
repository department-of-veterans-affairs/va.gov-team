00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let me hit record.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Okay. Now that I have the recording started, can I have you confirm on the record that you're comfortable?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I am absolutely comfortable with that. In fact, I think that's a great idea.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Okay. Now I am going to have you.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Ask a few warm up questions, particularly about your experiencing your experience, reviewing information about what was discussed during your medical appointment.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Oh, okay.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's my husband's medical appointment, and so I.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Sure. How was like, I think you froze again. I don't know if going off of video might help with bandwidth.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If you can hear me. I was like you froze again, so I don't know. Turning it. Sometimes turning off video helps with bandwidth. I'll be able to hear you.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Okay.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Really, Jenny and Nina, did she freeze for you?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Yes.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Yeah, there, you go. Okay.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Okay, we'll see if that helps. So this is for this is your speaking as somebody who assist, maybe your husband. It's your husband's appointment.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And I like some, but II don't think that I think all the notes are always half shirt.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm sorry I couldn't. Your audio broke up, too. If you can repeat that.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The email.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Right now. If you're still talking, II can't hear.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Hey, guys are frozen. I guess I'm probably frozen to.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Okay. I was like, you guys are frozen. I'm frozen.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Oh, there! I can hear you now. Finally.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I don't know where you guys left off from hearing me.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So I was just complaining that telemedicine medicine notes are usually uploaded the same day, whereas in person notes are loaded, usually 2 to 3 days after the initial visit, and so sometimes, I still have a question, and the physical question, my husband's head, I can kind of pick his main and then look at the notes, what the doctor said, and compare them if they're uploaded. Sooner. Usually brings home a copy of the paperwork. Okay, hey? So he normally would walk out of the appointment with a paper copy of what you're saying. Because I ask, yes, I mean I don't.

Notetaker: Participants likes to see after visit notes when husband visit doctor but they are usually load 2-3 days later.
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Okay.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:04.000
They make people have to wait for the after visit. Summary, I request my husband to bring them to me, so that I know what transpired, or at least I have an idea of what transpires.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Okay.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So besides that overview of that, is there any other particular sections or information in a document that you find valuable? Or you're really looking at.
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Usually I look at kind of what the brief, I guess it's the discussion right before the after visit summary. It's like in the middle of the page after the prescription, so it does the name and stuff. And then what you're being seen for, and then it kind of gives.
Notetaker: Participant like to read her husband brief .

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Like. I think he froze again.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Okay.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Brief discussion of how the nurse or the doctor.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It's.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Oh, like you're kind of your audio is coming in and out of a little bit again.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So I heard that you were looking at it, and you were the looking at the discussion of.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Waking up for once I get home. I'm sorry. I'm like 5 min to my house, and then the connection should be a lot better.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Okay.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Okay, great. Then we will continue on. And so you are really interested.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Okay.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Let me just recap what I did here. You were interested in what the doctor and the nurse actually that one section of the AVS.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Of what they talked about? And is that correct?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Yeah. Right after visit. Summary, I like to see what their interpretation of the issue is. So you know how the patient will say, this is what I'm coming to see you for, and so they'll then the nurse or the doctor, after they've done the initial interview, and buy those they mark what they think kind of the issue is, or what they're seeing as the symptoms, and how they're analyzing the issue.
Notetaker: Participant like to read the AVS to ensure the providers are interpreting correctly what husband is telling them.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Does that make sense? That's where I like. Okay, cause I'm like, how's interpreted? What's what are we saying, and what are they hearing?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Okay? And is there any particular type of appointment or procedure that you find that paperwork or reviewing in online, more important or valuable compared to other appointments or procedures?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
No, he typically goes for blood work. And then the typical other stuff. So there is. There is some. I guess the telemedicine with psychiatry is important for changes in medication. I really like to track the changes and why? There's changes, but they don't always notate. Why. Because it's they've had their discussion of whatever, and then they'll make the recommendation in the change as a medicine. I like to follow the changes. I like to know what the medicine is actively taking, and not taking and the websites don't always update, as in real time, with the medication. So sometimes, when they've discontinued a medication, it'll still be on his record as he's taking it, and he's not. So I do follow those ones pretty closely, and I like to keep accurate records on that.
Notetaker: Participant likes to pay close attention to the medication changes the providers made for her husband.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Now, when you say you go online, where in particular are you looking for that?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
My healthyeVet his visits, because they don't. There's that one section on my healthy vet where you can update the records. And then there's my visits where there's a what they upload is the visit summaries and whatnot.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Okay.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
But it'll just show the appointments, and then you try to click the blue records, which is the ones that they upload.But those take time to get there.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Okay.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Yeah. The yeah. Okay. Then, next, I'm actually going to send you a link to the prototype.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Okay.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And we're gonna go through that I'm gonna send it in the chat.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I don't know. Have you ever used chat in zoom before?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I have just not on my mobile, so I'm sure I can figure it out.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Okay, I just sent the link.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Okay. I'm opening it.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Okay. And once you actually have it open, if you can screen share, if you've done that before, to.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Otherwise I can try and direct you how to screen, share that way.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
We'll be able to see you interact with the prototype, and I can ask you questions.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Just gotta close the chat, and I am trying to find a share.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
It should be closed in the same menu of where you found Chat.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Start broadcast.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Yes.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It looks like it's low. Okay? So it's everything on your screen, including that will be recorded.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But to still hold my personal notifications against it that works.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I was like you. Can. You can take time and close anything if you need.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
If you need to do that.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Oh, I'm not going. I have like 52 tabs open, and I'm not going to close them.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Okay.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I understand.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I'm one of those people that keep everything like finished them so it might take a minute for.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
You guys seeing anything yet?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I am seeing it's starting to. It's a Nope actually, myself.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
There we go! We are there!

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Okay. Cool.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Okay. Now.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I'm going to give you a scenario. We're going to play pretend.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Okay.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So pretend today is June sixth, and we'll say, this is  your husband. His name is Hector for today, and he had an appointment this morning at 9 50, with Dr.Nutt, which is his primary care physician at the so a few hours have passed since the appointment, and you both forgot what your doctor's instructions were. So use this prototype to find out what Dr. Nutt Had discussed during the appointment. Definitely. As you're going to find this thing, talk about and share your thoughts.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Manage my equipment because it's going to. What appointments, and since, or see what happened, I'm going to go into the manage reference. Then I'm going to scroll to you. August.See, I upcoming appointments, and then I see in my past claim I'm trying to hit the past It's loading. You guys see the screen right? So I tried to.

 Notetaker: Participant accessed AVS via Appointments p.10.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
You can't. There's an interesting delay, cause I can still see on the main page. There we go.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Okay, yeah, it's taking a minute. I just got home. So hopefully the connectivity will get better. I don't know. Not promising anything.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
You got that? Do you want?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Yes.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I know.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Yeah, I see a loading indicator.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Yeah, I'm a blade. The government computers on that one, not mine.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Yeah, this is part of the thing that I have a problem with.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Va dot cov is. It does take a long time, and then when I log in to va.gov, I use the my healthy, that login, and there's like a automated key, but sometimes it'll bump me out login and there's like automated key but sometimes it'll bump me out when I switch screens or the menu and then I have to keep signing back in.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And so that's obnoxious when you're trying to get information, and it takes forever to load like.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Now, do you want me to refresh it?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Yeah, yeah, try to reload. I was like, this is just a prototype.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Yeah.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So this isn't even va.gov. But yes, II hear that about login.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I'm hitting past again. Let's see if it lets me.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
There it goes. We said it was June sixth at the Puget Sound.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000
There's Doctor Knutt. Then I'm going to go to details, and then I see appointment that occurred in the past. view after visit. Summary. I want to hear that I click that, and then it gives me.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Okay. Now, yeah. Now that you're on this page, please take time to review everything and share just initial impressions and talk a lot of your reviews.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So it the you were diagnosed with. That's the section that I was talking about. I like seeing that part, because I'm like seeing that part Okay, I know what they're talking about. But after this is after the vitals, I mean, I like watching the vitals and reading it because it's just kind of fun to see the trends. But II don't really care about them unless my husband went in like shortness of breath, and I was wondering if he's having a heart attack or something. Otherwise, I don't really care about the vitals. I guess I guess it helps the doctors and the nurses, but it doesn't really help me.
Notetaker: Participants doesn’t find the vital are useful unless something serious was happening,12:
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Okay.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
when I'm looking at this, the procedures, how did they diagnose it? The medications that were ordered there's your treatment plan, your health information as of this appointment. I think this is where I was talking about, where the primary team makes these, please know that the recall appointments are not confirmed. Appointment.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I think it's a within these appointment notes here that I find most. Yeah. It's the point that notes when. So he said he was coming in for hypertension, or that's what whoever took the call to make the appointment decided. And then they do the diagnosis. But it's the appointment notes that usually help me decide how they decided. Whatever they're diagnosing him with. And I like that for me, and the hypertension hyperlipemia, smoking status.
Notetaker: Participants is just interested in seeing the appointment notes.p.13:

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And so that's where I usually go. And then, of course, you wanted me to see what we're supposed to do. I don't care about these lab results, so I would close this. This is your treatment consultation. So we have, imaging that, and you will be contacted. So we don't have to make the appointment. I like knowing that whether I'm calling work therapy to call us, or how we play tag, or if we'll just get a notice in the they usually just send us postcards of when the appointment is, or telling us the contact. Them once they have the reference.
Notetaker: Participants like knowing if provider will call them to make an appoinmetp.13.
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Okay.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:44.000
What's typical. I think. Check your chronic diabetes flu shot, which doesn't have much to do with the hypertension. That's the place I would look first is, I don't care about the lab results.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I mean I don't know how to read the lab results, so I don't know what that means. I mean, it's cool to know, I guess, but it doesn't really tell me anything. I like to read them.
Notetaker: Participants doesn’t know how to interpret the lab results.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:18.000
My medications listed below were reviewed with you, or by your provider, and I like to make sure this is accurate, and sometimes it is, and sometimes it's not updated on the main screen.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Okay, if it's not accurate, what do you do?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Oh, II let my husband know to tell the nurse the next time he talks to them, or I'll send a email to the nurse sometimes.
Notetaker: Participants likes to ensure medications are accurate, if they are not she’ll tell her husband to remind providers.
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But they I don't think they're the ones that are updating that record. I think they push it forward to whoever the customer care team is, or whoever the paper pusher is in the organization, they're like, Hey, this needs to be updated. Delete it from the list. You know they usually do.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
The supplies. Okay medications that you are not taking. Oh, see! And that's helpful. See, II like to see that the medications that you aren't taking, but you have been prescribed before, like when it's moved to the right section.
Notetaker: Participants likes the Medications that you are not taking, she finds it helpful.p14
And then, yeah.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Now, why do you like to see that?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Because we when you can't recall necessarily it tells you when the meditations well, I like to see when they a date range of when those were tried, or how long they were prescribed for, because then you can kind of recall the scenarios or how the reaction of the person that's being medicated is, I mean, the doctor should have the notes, but it's good in the summary for people that are trying to communicate, or if I can't remember, exact timeframe. I'm like no. When he was taking that sleep medication it didn't help his Ptsd. He was still screaming in the middle of the night like that helps me with date ranges, and saying, No, we've tried that one.
Notetaker: Participants likes the history of the medication not taking sow she can have record of what worked and what didn’t.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000
It worked, or it didn't work. This is what my notes are.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Okay.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Yeah, that seems pretty thorough.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And now I'm going to have you go out all the way up to the top, and we're going to talk about the first section that says your appointment on June sixth and I'll ask them more specific questions about that section.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Okay.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.000
So just with this accordion or that section? Are there any terms that are unfamiliar with confusing to you?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000
30 days, 60.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
No! So the appointment was like almost 2 h long.bThat's what it looks like hypertension, and the vitals.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Blood pressure pulse ox symmetry, respirations, temperature, height. Okay.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
No, nothing seems confusing. It seems very straightforward.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Now the section that you have already commented on I'll have you scroll up to the you are diagnosed with section. Could you provide a definition of for what you see there? How would you define that?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Well, he's a smoker. He needs to upgrade his vitamin d. He has hypertension, so he needs to watch his salt hyperlap medium. I don't know what that is, but and then Ptsd, I'm familiar with, but I would be like. Oh, okay, so he does have hypertension, and that's causing whatever issues he came in for.So they're gonna provide us with something to help with that.
Notetaker: Participant didn’t understand that “the you are diagnosed with” section were the things that were discussed during the June 6th appointment. P.16:

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Now, what if the title of this section was called Health Condition? You discussed? What are your thoughts on? How you would define that?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And your thoughts on how that be. The section again, health conditions you discussed.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Well, okay, I think health conditions that you discussed one. Take the label of diagnose.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Once people are told that they're diagnosed with something it's pretty detrimental to how they start trying to fix or correct a health condition.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
A condition is changeable, so I kind of like that wording.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I think it's sounds nicer and a little bit more fluid for the psychological perspective of the person that's receiving that information like, Oh, it's not something that you're going to be stuck with for the rest of your life.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
But a diagnosis is also saying, Hey, this is kind of what we found. This is definitive. I think either one communicates the same idea, I think the health condition would be a little bit more universal, and probably not so like per minute.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Okay.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I guess is how I would interpret.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Now, would you say there's a difference in the value? Between those 2 different descriptions of the section.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
No, I don't. I think it would be the same kind of thing. It, the value would be equivalent. Oh, well, no, II think health conditions would be a little bit more valuable, just because again, I think there's that psychological perspective there that might be like, oh, this is something that I can change or can be corrected.And maybe some conditions can't like chronic conditions, or whatever.But I think it sounds more hopeful.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Now, have you scroll down and go to the section that says medication ordered for administration in clinic. How, how would you define this section?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
That's what's being used during the procedure. And so they ordered it. It should be ready to go. It should be ready for his procedure, whether he took it right at the beginning before they started the procedure. But he doesn't need to worry about taking anything before he gets there.Or either, that they ordered it, and said, Hey, you know were going to get this in the mail.You need to make sure you take this and it's going to be telling you how to take it. And you take it before you come in for the procedure. And now I'm going to have you actually click on where it says, what do these medication terms?
Notetaker: Participant thought that the “medication ordered for administration in clinic” could be either administered during a procedure or mail to the patient to take before he/she arrives to the appointment.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Now, can you tell me your opinions or your feedback on this section?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
So active, prescription, status, and active a prescription that can be filled at the local Va pharmacy. If you have refills, you may request a refill this prescription for your VA.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Probably I've had issues with Va. Pharmacy, too.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Okay.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
If you want me to pipe in there, but a medication that came from the please other.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Oh, I just clicked it on, and it closed.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Sorry. So I like that. It shows active and non va, because then you can be like, Oh, okay.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Well, this says that. Well, actually, now that I see this, it says active.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And then, Non va, but it just says that the Tylenol or us, the minophine was ordered for the procedure, but I still don't know if he's actively to take it or order it from the pharmacy, or if it was sent to him, or if it's

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000
over the Va. And he'll just get it when he gets there from the nurse, and it'll be administered there.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Good.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:16.000
But I do like that. They distinguish if it's coming from the pharmacy, or if it's non va, and it was filled over the counter. I guess it could be confusing, too, because my husband gets everything sent to him.
Notetaker: Participant likes that they list Active coming from VA. But she finds it confusing because husband gets meds via mailp,.19.
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000
I know not. All vets do. So we use the pharmacy, but it's usually the mail order stuff. So if his doctor prescribes him anything, it's automatically sent to us in the mail.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Okay, so what I'm hearing is these description provide some clarity, but also alright. Surface questions as well.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
So now I'm going to have you go down to the next section. Then your treatment plan for this appointment I'll ask you questions.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Okay.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
So how would you utilize the information within this section?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
II like that. It spells out in the consultation. Hey? You're going to be contacted by mail or telephone. And usually it's you get the postcard in the mail, which is great, and then they'll tell you who to call or who your local rheumatology console is great, and then they'll tell you who to call or who your local rheumatology consult is on that postcard and that's how you get the referral. But if you don't know if you're calling them, or expecting a call, you don't know how to follow up, so I usually I would like to see, not only hey, you're going to be contacted in the mail or by phone, but an expected by date.Because some my husband's waited 6 months one time, and I was like you are supposed to get a full of like within 30 days. I'm sure.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:55.000
But there's confusion sometimes, and then people forget and if they don't have an urgency, that the person that has the appointment doesn't have an urgency to necessarily go, and I think quite a few men and vets in particular don't always have this urgency like oh. this really needs to be looked at now before it becomes very problematic, and I can't move. They wait until the last minute, and they're basically done And so I prefer to have like, Hey, we need a follow-up. Let's flag this. Let's set a reminder, and if nothing happens, at least we can follow up and say, Hey, what happens to that referral?
Notetaker: Participant likes that under “consultations” you will be contacted because sometimes her husband waited 6 months before he got an appointment.
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Or where's this going from here? So I do like that so that it's saying how it's going to happen imaging for Ct. And MRI scans. You'll be contacted by the imaging service for your appointment for X-rays and Ultrasounds. Please report to imaging service during normal working hours to complete your Exam.Okay. So they'll say they'll contact you, I think, having the extra information about the X-rays and ultrasounds that you have to report to the imaging services. I think that's extra information until they contact you. If they're gonna contact you and make the appointment at that time, they would tell you that, hey. You need to report to imaging services for the Exam.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000
The technologies will inform you, handwrite to view bilateral exam left hand to view.And it tells you exactly what's been ordered. I like that, so you know what to expect when you go in, and you make those imaging requests, or when they make the appointments.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:26.000
You know what images you're getting lab test patients no longer need to fast for most lab draws check with your provider whether fasting is required. Please report to the lab for the following blood tests on the date, yeah, I'm used to him getting blood tests.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:46.000
I you know one thing that I wouldn't mentioned some places have it, and I don't know if you can make it so that it's for whichever facility that that is, I guess, is their station or their assigned facility. But some of the places don't have the. You have to do the lab work by a certain time in the day for it to get sent up to the hospital because they don't have the.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
They can draw the blood, but they don't have the testing. There, and they have to send it up somewhere else. And if you put those times like, Hey, you can do the black blood work at this facility, and these are the times.But you have to report by this time. If you need the blood work by tomorrow, I mean, that would be helpful. Okay, yeah, no, no more of the hours and the implications based on the facility. Okay?
Notetaker: Participant would like the time listed when he should have the lab done by a certain time, p 21:
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:31.000
And then medication, because we've had that happen a few times with the blood drop, you would order the blood, and then we would go and get the. He would want it, that the doctor wanted it the same day, but we didn't know the cutoff was like 9 A. M.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
At the local place, and he went in at like 9, 30, and so then it didn't get in until the next day. But it was the weekend, and so then we didn't get the results or the medication checked and adjusted until that following week, and it was a long weekend, so it was one of those situations where something could have been done the same day if it would have if we would have known

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:15.000
about when the blood would have been shipped over to get examined or we could have gone and made it a an extra trip or a longer trip, and gone up to the hospital directly versus the facility medications and supplies.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
This section only lists, changes to your medication regime.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Yeah, this is what I said, that I like the changes, the medication changes, because that's how I kind of track like, oh, okay, this one's changed. We dropped this off or this amount changed, but pressure.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
No, I'll stop you there, though, on the medication part. So there was a medication section in the earlier part, which was a medication's ordered for administration in the clinic. So how? How would you describe the difference between these? And then also the how valuable or not valuable are the 2 different sections of comparing the medications across both section?

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Well, I think it's super important, for the farmers to actually be looking at both of these, because a lot of the daytime are that in the top medication sent, it is for a specific procedure or things that were handled. That day these are your actual ongoing medications or things that you have been prescribed throughout. At least this is how I understand it, and what I've been watching from what I know, what they've been prescribed in are currently taking. But sometimes they aren't paying attention and are currently taking.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:36.000
But sometimes they aren't paying attention to what's listed, and I say they, during the day appointments or the one-time procedure appointments, and they'll prescribe something that can counteract and it's not healthy and that can cause problems like even with those risk brand

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:46.000
notification like they're not always alert. And so you have all these eyes and people that are involved, and sometimes things are overlooked and things are prescribed that probably shouldn't be prescribed or taken by the that.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:54.000
And so that's what I like to watch, because I know the medications that I'm supposed to watch for.And I'm like, Hey, Nope! He can't take this one.He's taking this and this so let's find something different.So it is super helpful, and I think maybe clarifying. These are ongoing medications. These are ones that they take daily, or this is for this per she perceived specific. Make sure that just the reminder of Hey, double check, if you aren't sure double check and ask your doctor. Ask your pharmacist, ask, ask your nurse, make sure that these are okay together.
Notetaker: Participant would like it clarified what the meds mean; are they ongoing ect.p23:
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Okay, and then I'll let you review the rest of the section. Now.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Okay. And it's the same thing there. Other orders, blood pressure. Don't. They usually do the blood pressure automatically without ordering it? When they do the blood draw. I think they do.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I think this is more. They want you to come back and have the nurse do it.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Oh, okay. October thirteenth. Okay, yeah. I was like, wait, isn't that usually okay?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Is your health reminders, prevention care, your chronic conditions, like your primary care and provider team.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
See this lists in the computer and should discuss them what they are.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Post deployment screen instructions. Call Doctor Smith when you return from yeah.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000
So is was there anything confusing or unfamiliar with this section?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
No, we're like the upcoming kind of the health reminders, you know. Some people, I think if you had the option to turn off some of the health reminders like not all the time, but just say, like the flu. Well, some of the vets take on some of them. Don't. My husband hates them, and when I get the reminder I just kind of roll my eyes because it's been due and it's overdue all the time. But if you could just say Hey, I've noticed that I saw this notification. Ignore. Don't turn back on, or just if there's a post comment like if I'm not going to take it this time, because I don't feel good, remind me in 2 weeks.
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
To set this appointment, and then we could set the appointment later. But to have that sort of toggle, or that option, but not to turn them off all the way.I think the notifications do need to be there.
Notetaker: Participant wants an option to toggle off and on certain reminders.p.24
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:10.000
And I'm going to have you go to the next section which says your health information as of this appointment.You're right there. Talk through that. I know you already scroll through this, but you can scroll through again, and how might you use this section?And similarly, also, if you comment on anything that's unfamiliar, confusing.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Okay, your health information as of this appointment in summary of February 15. Go to my health. Healthy website for your current medical record and see. So it tells you to go to the my healthy vet for your current medical records. They’re not always updated. So if you're like, it takes a couple of weeks for that to get updated. And I don't know if there's a way to make it in real time, like I don't know if you could see like a transcribed copy. Do you guys have the virtual transcribe? Now, I haven't seen it, but I mean some places do, since Covid happened.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Some of.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Of what actually the of the appointment, the transcription of the okay.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Yeah, and I mean, that would just be helpful, even if the records are updated.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Just a link to the transcribed copy, or the transcription that was generated, even if it's not corrected, would give us a more real-time update of what's going on, because it takes days for it to update.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
So I make my husband print, get the printed summary. But what I don't understand is, how do they print that summary? If it's not automatically uploaded into his into his file. Does that make sense? I'm like, Okay, generated this vet summary from your account, and it has all of your information on it. But why is it not showing up here yet like, how did they print it? Why don't I have a copy of it? The primary care provider like that?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Yeah, prior care team. I do find that sometimes the primary care team I mean, it says it's the registered nurse in the license.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
The Lpn. It. Who do you contact, and when so, I do like the option.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
When you are in the my healthy vet, and you have a question.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
It just sends a blast email to the whole team, and then someone from the team will get back to you. But, my question is  is, and maybe you guys can help define it or put it all the definitions for which role these people play and I don't know if it differs from each facility.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Okay.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
But defining when you would contact. These people are kind of when, if there's a direct question about one of his, his diet, and he's not feeling well, what would I contact the doctor or what I contact the register nurse, or who I should contact and when otherwise I just blast the whole team, and I make everybody reads it, and then someone gets back to me, or they're like, Oh, we need to make an appointment for this one.
Notetaker: Participant would like more guidance on who to contact and when.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Oh, okay. Great.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
So you want more guidance on who to contact for what? Okay?

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Umhm. Yeah. Upcoming appointments. 13 months.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Permit. Here we call appointments.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
And I'm gonna stop you on the recall appointment.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Yeah, go ahead and say what you're saying about recall, and then I'll ask my question.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Oh, I was just going to I don't know what a recall appointment is .I'm guessing a missed appointment. So I was just going to have to read that I'm not familiar with that.
Notetaker: Participant doesn’t know what a “recall appointment is” p,27.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Yeah, go ahead and read it, and then see what your definition.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.000
These know that recall appointments are not confirmed, appointments you will receive a reminder, approximate the 3 weeks before the recall date to call and request the appointment.When you call you will be assigned a confirmed appointment date in time.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Hmm! High surgery. Huh?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
So what do you think that is now?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:48.000
It sounds like it's kind of a tentative kind of appointment where you have this thing coming up and it's scheduled. But it's not permanent or identified yet, like they haven't made their arrangement.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:08.000
It looks like it's eye surgery, so they probably have to make a couple more coordinated effort to make sure that all the different offices like prep before surgery and the surgery rooms all gonna be able to align up and so you don't know what time you're gonna report necessarily that day. And so you'll get a more exact time and date depending on if you've passed Kovat tests or whatnot before your surgery.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:24.000
But it's not super clear and I don't know why you would have to call approximately 3 weeks before the  date. Why wouldn't that just be assigned in? They call you and tell you when you're but I mean Hmm!

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Okay, so how helpful or not helpful is this information to you on this page?

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
I think it's helpful, because you know that you're like, okay, my recall appointment is tentatively August fourth.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:52.000
I can make plans for August fourth. I don't have a exact date or time, and a 3 weeks before I should call and make sure.
Notetaker: Participant likes it helpful because she can make plans around the appointment. p,28.
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
This is when we're going to do the appointment.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
I'll get my exact time that I'm supposed to report.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Okay.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
So I mean it's helpful again. There's a couple of things I'm like.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
It could be better. But appointment notes take blood pressure 3 times per week, recording your journal.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Bring your journal with you to the next appointment. It would be helpful not only to have a journal, but an online entry, where you could just actually toggle to this part and put in your log, or have a reminder sent to your phone or to the application to the healthy vet you get reminders and texts about your appointments. Why can't you get a reminder like, Hey, you're supposed to put your journal entry in today?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Have you done that today? Or you could set it for a certain time each day, so that they are recording it?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Okay.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
And in case they lose that journey or forget, get to bring it, because I don't know how many times we've gotten somewhere, and then he's like, Oh, I forgot this.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
I'm like you go in check in. I'll be right back.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
I'll go get it, and then we'll go to your appointment. There.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
But not all vets have someone that's with them most of the time.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Down, just saying.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000
And first oh, I like the adverse reactions area. And signs and symptoms or allergies Just notifications. This is somewhere where they could put some of those medications that don't go.That might cause problems interacting with other medications, not just allergies and adverse drugs, because people are going to look at the allergies.But if they see that there's a sensitive medication that they take that interacts with other common medications, I think this would be a place to highlight that also.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Okay.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Yeah. And then if they're outside the normal again, I mean the lab results are kind of fun to look and watch .But I think they cause like the Abnormal High It's a flag like if you don't know what you're reading and why you're reading it.It could be kind of scary to see and if you know glucose you're like, oh, no, I'm diabetic now, or oh, no, I'm above range. What should I be doing I mean, the flag is important, but I think it's more important to get a diagnosis back from the doctor are saying, hey, it is abnormal, high, but you're good.
Notetaker: Participant believes the “Flag” does not give enough information to truly understand what it means, p.30:
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
You don't need to worry about this. This has been stable for you.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Okay, I understand that. Yeah. So the flag doesn't give enough of to truly understand what that means, particularly to it was like, okay.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Or like the abnormal. Oh, he's going in for hypertension, but your sodium's abnormal low, you know.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Like, how does that affect me? Why is it abnormal, low?

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Is it from the medication? You know there's a lot of questions again, if you don't, if you aren't familiar, you're not a doctor, you don't know how to read those results in all.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
I think it can cause some anxiety, but I don't know how many people are actually reading through their notes.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
I'm just super extra because it's my husband and he doesn't watch his stuff.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
So then I follow his stuff like, Hey, this is what this means. What are you doing?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Why are you not paying attention? He's like they'll call me if it's a concern.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Now, I'm going to actually have you stop on the medication section right there that you have on the screen, too, and how would you define this Section.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000
My notifications listed below or reviewed by your provider, it's updated with some vacation. Just crappy seas, you know. Otherwise, please continue. Yeah. So yeah, this is kinda like that middle section where it's the ongoing everything that you've kind of been prescribed.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000
And this, I think, is the list where I'm like, hey, this doesn't always check out no.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Yeah.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Now, how would you compare this to the other medication section in the list?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
This one?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
And compare its value compared to the other section.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
This one's definitely more comprehensive. It has all the details.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
It. It tells you how many refills you have when it's due.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Next, who to contact where you're getting it from this?

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
This is perfect. It tells you what it should be, looking like.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
It looks like there's a place to make notes, and what the Rx.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:04.000
The prescription number would be if you were to just call and do the mail by pharmacy, and the I think this one's much better than the middle section.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
And actually, it would be redundant. I kind of think it's redundant compared to the middle section
This should just replace that middle section altogether. In my opinion, they would.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Okay. Now, where you said notes, and you said you can make notes.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Is that you making notes, or would it? Do you think that would be your notes or notes from the doctor?

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Oh, I would think from the pharmacist!

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Oh, so probably the doctor!

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000
And then you can continue on and let me know your thoughts.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
As you're reviewing the rest of the section.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Yeah.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
And then the not taking. Yeah, I like that. I still what the not taking and how it says it's still active. They can take it, the I would like in the not taking is the dates, like I mentioned before, like Hey, when was this prescribed? How long was it prescribed for it? Because it's still saying it's prescribed, but they're not taking it why did they stop taking it? I think there should be able to be notes, either by the doctor or by the patient, or by both notating, hey? We stopped using this one in favor of this other one to try this other one.
For this reason, and that would help you track and kind of find the ultimate kind of cocktail for each person, that because everyone's so different, which medications do work which ones don't, and for what symptoms they're helping with and which ones they're exasperating.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Okay, now, this is a very long page. A lot of information. So I'm going to ask you, is there a particular with everything you've seen that is available on this page? Would you want to reorder any of this or see anything more in the beginning compared to the current display?

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Oh, let me see!

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
I'm going to collapse them all sorry. So I'm going to collapse them to kind of get a kind of comprehensive look at it.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
That's a little bit more user friendly. Instead of all the scrolling.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
I do like the of scrolling, expanding, and hmm shrinking them back down this I typically it because we're doing this this way.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
I typically would have collapsed them as I was done that area unless there was a particular item.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:29.000
I was looking at in that section.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
The appointment up top makes sense. I think that should be up top.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
I go to your health information, as I think it was.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Maybe it wasn't your treatment plan. I don't remember.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.000
I have to kinda scroll. Yeah, no, I would keep them in the same order.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Okay.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
I don't. Yeah.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:04.000
And how does this overall compared to the paper copy that you received like when you walk out of the appointment? And you review that.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.000
I think it's pretty similar. I don't think I'm trying to think of where I put one of them. I don't have one in front of me right now. I think they're pretty similar. I kind of like what I did here like being able to scroll through. I just flipped through main topics that I like to look at.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:35.000
I pick out the pieces of information that are important to me, and then I make sure I understand what's going on, and then I file them away.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Does that make sense?

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Okay. Okay. Now, I'm going to have you actually pretend that you finished reviewing this.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
And now there's another appointment in the past.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
You're like, Oh, I want to remember what we talked about in that appointment.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Can you try to find a summary for another appointment?
Notetaker: Participant used the back button to navigate to another AVS.
00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Yeah, and what? What summary are we looking for? How far past this?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
You can just check one.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Okay, I wanna see what we're doing with our.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Mental health with Jacob in the primary care we wanna see on this was Wednesday February ninth.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
So we are after. Is it very nice?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Okay, no. On a scale from one to 5, with one being very easy and 5 being very difficult.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:30.000
How easy or difficult was it to navigate to another summary.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:48.000
5, I looking for something specific. If there was like a control search function, or whatever where you could say, Hey, I'm looking for, because I think most people tend to have quite a few appointments, not just 3, I know this is a test.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
But if I could search by specific who I'm looking for?

00:43:51.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Was it a mental health type of thing? Or if I could filter it some way like Oh, it was sometime in summer, or it was sometime, instead of just scrolling through all the appointments, because I know my husband's appointments are a little bit longer than this.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Okay. So it would be 5 very difficult, because you would have a very long list to navigate through.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Yeah, I would I do a lot of scrolling and be like, Oh, was it this appointment?

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Was it disappointment? So if I could filter either by the location or the type of appointment, or if I could filter by a keyword like a custom filter that would be helpful.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Okay.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
No, that you're on this page. I'm gonna ask about.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Can you describe, and generally like what you? What do you expect to see under the path link?

00:44:45.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Well what I would expect are dates and times of appointments, and if there was attendance, if it was missed, or if it wasn't, if it wasn't, if it was attended to, what type of appointments so like these are in person or video, and phone calls so those are important, I think it covers, pretty

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
much everything. Maybe if it had a little synopsis of what the appointment, like.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.000
What were you seeing for what was the first thing just like when you click into the appointment?

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
It said, What are you being seen for hypertension?

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
But then you see the diagnosis if you could just have a brief like, oh, this is the hypertension.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Oh, this was cold! This was Ptsdo. This was your sleeping.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:37.000
This was your mental health the I mean mental health is stated in there, and primary care stated in there, but just a little kind of just one word, even just to kind of classify what the appointment was.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000
This was down dumb, calling in, or this was a annual visit type of thing.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Okay.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
And I'm gonna ask the bottomcoming appointment link.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Now, that's next to Pat. Don't click on it.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Oh!

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Oh, you get! It's fine! What would you expect to see?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Under here.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Upcoming appointments. I just, you know, date time and expectations.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
If it's a video, am I calling? Are they calling me?

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
If it's in person, should I report 10 min early?

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
What time do I report? What time is? So what time is check in, and what time is the actual appointment?

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:21.000
I think sometimes that's missed in the details. And so sometimes the appointment will be set for 80'clock.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
But that's the actual appointment time. And sometimes it's set for 80'clock.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
But that's the check in time, and then you wait 20 min to see the doctor.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:33.000
It's just for the vets time and the and I know clinicians do this all differently.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
But if you spell it out like, Hey, check in is this time in this range?

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
This is when your actual appointment is, if you don't make this check-in time, you're not gonna have your appointment.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
I think that would be helpful. I know that recently they've changed our clinic, and I don't know if that's a Va.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Wide, where they are given a check-in time of. And there's multiple people given the check-in time of 10 Am.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
And it's the order in which they arrive in which they're seeing.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Okay.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
And that's cut back on them, wasting a lot of time, and between appointments, and it saved the doctor sometimes.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:15.000
But it's also taken up more of the vet's time, because now they're all checking in at 100'clock, and there's like 4 appointments for 100'clock, and they're given 10 to 15 min a piece.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:22.000
So you're the last one to check in. You're the last one to leave also so I don't know if that's helpful or not.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.000
But knowing when to check in versus when your actual appointment is is helpful.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
No I'm gonna ask about pending appointments.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
No, don't click on that. But what do you expect to see?

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
If you were to click on the pending link.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
I would want to see if it's confirmed.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:47.000
If there's a option to check in early, if there's I wanna know the date time, how I'm supposed to appear. Who's calling?

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Who am I calling you? You calling me? Am I supposed to hit a link?

00:47:51.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Should I expect it in an email or not? Again, most clinics are a little bit different, but if you can spell out those differences, who's calling, who you dial this number at 9, or I will call your number at 9, make sure that is ready.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:12.000
How do you report? If your phone numbers changed, or if you're not going to be available at that phone to update your information, your contact information, or vice versa.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
And also a way to cancel or reschedule.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Okay. Now, what do you see? As a difference between upcoming and pending?

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Pending is ones that haven't been confirmed. There. They're kind of tentative appointments that are going. It kind of like that? Recall like, Hey, we have this appointment. It’s kind of out there, but we haven't confirmed it. 


00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Upcoming, these are confirmed, these are established, and these are going to be on the schedule.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
The pending is not on the schedule yet.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:00.000
It's just kind of penciled in there, and we're gonna work out the details in between.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Oh!

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Thank you. Okay. Now, we're gonna move on from this prototype onto note notification.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Okay.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:13.000
So you can either close it or we can leave it up as we talk a little bit more so we're gonna talk about notifications that you might wanna receive about your after visit.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Okay.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Summary. For your husband's after visit Summary. So I'm gonna have you pretend that you received the following message, the subject is new after visit summary and the contents are accelerate of your recent appointment is now available on my house and set login to review the summary

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000
so would you find this notification helpful or not helpful?

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:44.000
pHelpful, because it's reminding you to go and log in, and then you can look at your notification summary. So I think it's helpful.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
How would you prefer to receive this notification?

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Text, message.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000
And if he had multiple appointments in one day, would you want one notification for each appointment for the appointment? Summary? Or would you want all of the appointments combined into one notification?

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
I would prefer all in one.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Is there any reason for that?
             
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Yeah, because then that way, I can. I'm not waiting to see that each one comes across and I'm counting 3 separate ones. I count one notification. I click into that, and I can find anything that happened during that day.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000
I just have a few more questions, and then we're getting towards the end.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000
If you could change one thing about the after visits. Summary, what would that be?

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
The one that I showed you today.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Hmm!

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Oh, I don't know.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
I guess that's kind of a hard question. I guess it.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:01.000
I mean, it's pretty good. It gives information. I just I guess the timeliness of the uploading of it is the main thing for me that I've but I know that's probably changing, and it'll probably be in real time.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:15.000
I'm assuming. That's what we're working on trying to get to that space.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Yeah.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
That's a very good point. Yeah. You want it to appear as soon after the appointment as possible, and instantaneously, okay.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Yeah, I mean, that's the main complaint that I have.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
I think the after visit summaries are pretty comprehensive.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:41.000
I, moving the more detailed medication lists into that middle of the screen, and not being as redundant and having it at the end also, and then just highlighting any possible I mean, I don't know how, easy that would be to do.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
But when medications are when there's the I know that's the pharmacy straw.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:52:00.000
However, if you can build it into the app in any way, shape or form, that alerts kind of like this is a allergy, or this is a possible high risk per scription, that, like that this person has, and it it doesn't go well with a lot of other common medications.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:08.000
And just so it's that extra alert effort there!

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Okay. Yeah, it sounds like both on the position side, and also the better.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
And seeing that information for both. Is that what you're saying?

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Okay. Great, is there anything that we haven't talked about?

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Related to after visit Summary, that you would want to share with me.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Not that I can think of. No, that was pretty comprehensive, like you guys did a really good job covering everything.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Do you have any questions for me?

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Okay. That was all the questions that I have for this test.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000
I know you said you had some comments about the mobile app. Do you?

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Wanna share some of the highlights related to that. We we don't have much time left in our session.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000
But go ahead.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Yeah, I would go into detail, but one of them was the Login issue.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Like, if I'm navigating from one site to the next.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000
I get logged off constantly, so I'm having to do this constant resign on with the either Id.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Me or the my healthy vet login, and they're not universal.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:19.000
And so you have like 6 different choices, to log into the Va Gov app, but depending on what section you're going into, it makes you re log in almost every single time.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:25.000
So like the other day I was trying to get the Coe because I wanted to see the certificate of eligibility, but that's in benefits, and it wasn't from my healthy Vet.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:32.000
But I was navigating through Va. Gov. And then I kept getting logged off.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.000
But then, when I went to finally get the certificate of eligibility, it told me I couldn't even download it on my mobile app, so I know again.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000
This isn't the same section, or anything like that, but it.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000
My relative was like, Hey, can you get me that certificate of eligibility?

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
I was like, yeah, but I'm always on my phone.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:53.000
I don't have time to go to the computer. I don't know if it'll download on the computer or not, and I have all my passwords saved in my phone.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000
So the ease of using it on my phone would be easy if it actually worked.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:05.000
But having to log in multiple times. So when I went to the benefits section, then I had to go to another section.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.000
I went to 3 different sections. I think I had to log in 3 different times in order to get to that certificate of eligibility screen.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000
But then, when I got there, it told me that it wasn't available for download, or maybe it was the mobile view wasn't available.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Haven't tried on a laptop or computer yet.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:25.000
I might. I don't know but it was. It was cumbersome, and I was like, Hey, why can't this should be easy?

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
They say that I can get it, and I can just click here.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:35.000
But yet here we are, logging in for the third time, and I still don't have it, and then I'll like Oh, well, let me check on your appointment.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
And then I went back to my healthy vet, and then I had to log in again, and I was like, Oh, my gosh!

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.000
I'm signed in like 5 times within the last 20 min, and each time they have to send you the well, I have the 2 factor. Authentication.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.000
So then they go through and you do that multiple times. It takes up a lot of time and it ends up being like, okay, why am I wasting all this time doing this? I don't care that much.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Never!

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Yeah, that sounds frustrating. Thank you for sharing that story. I was like, we can definitely take that back to the teams working on login.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Okay. Awesome.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Yeah.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Okay.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000
So we really appreciate you. Taking the time to talk and share your thoughts.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Today your feedback will help us as we continue to work on the site and make sure that it really works for veterans.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Understood.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
So before you go, I wanted to make sure. It's clear that everything we did today wasn't real with the prototype and you haven't really accessed.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Va. Gov. And paired gene will be sending you a Thank you.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to us.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
You may know caregivers and veterans, and they can help participate.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
In feature, research studies.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Oh, awesome. Yeah. I'll let a couple of them know I have a couple of friends that are that they're my husband's friends, and they're all the total disabled forever type of guys, too.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:52.000
So I'm like, Yeah, you guys need to be.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000
But they're probably gonna respond the same way. My husband responded, and ignore the call and ignore the requests.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:12.000
And so getting the feedback from the people that are actually logging in and using these so it has to be a lot easier and maybe not broken down into so many segments like very basic information for vets to want to use it truthfully.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Okay.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Honest, I mean, that's my husband's like I log in.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
I don't even know what to think about it, and I was like, well, you know where to find your appointments.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Like, yeah, but everything else I don't care about like.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
But you need to. So and I think that's kind of the general idea behind the guys.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000
They're like my doctor will tell me, I was like, Yeah, but you have okay.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Never mind, I won't even try to explain why this is important for you.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Guys to be able to access. And to navigate on your own.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
So!

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:45.000
I was like. Thank you for joining us feedback, and we run these sessions on a wide variety of topics, and across the Va.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.000
So thank you very much.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Oh, okay. Uhhuh, not a problem. Thank you.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Yeah. Enjoy the rest of your day.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Alright, takeBye.
