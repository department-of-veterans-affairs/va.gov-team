Participant 12 (Kristenâ€™s)
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Okay, [Redacted PII] . So do I have your permission to record the screen and audio.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You do?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You're welcome.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Okay. So I'd like to start learning more about your experience. Go into the doctor's office, and reviewing some paperwork after the visit, and this paperwork usually contains notes that the doctor made after your visit. It's something that you and your doctor discussed. Do you ever recall receiving some type of paper like this?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I have!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Yeah.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Yes, okay. And.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Why, oh, why did you review this paperwork?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I reviewed it just they had, like your future appointments on there as well. What you've discussed, well, actually, I'll start in the beginning, so it'll tell you like what you came here for, what's best. If you have any future appointments like, follow ups, and then, as well as your other appointments, and then sometimes they'll also have your medication list on there. That's yeah. That's pretty much the information on there.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Is there any specific information that you really played? Excuse me, pay close attention to on that on that paperwork.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
For me. Personally, I look at what was discussed today, just to make sure because I'm a no keeper. So if I see anything missing, I'm like, hey? By the way, or I'll call back like if I leave already and I'm like Crap, I can't, you know, go back to the clinic. So I just review that and and same thing with any future appointments, as well. If maybe there's like a consult that I'm missing. So for me, it just keeps me up to date, and just making sure that I also am accountable for what if I'm missing anything, or what I have coming up in the future?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Excellent. Do you ever go online to review this information?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Sometimes I'd use online more. So for just sitting messages.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And if you were to name that paperwork that you get from your doctor, what would you name? It?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Anything that makes sense to you.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I probably call like a summary report.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Summary for it. Okay, pretty right. So now I'm gonna send you a link to the prototype in the chat.So let me know if you have any issues with that.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Okay.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So can you find your chat right now?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Uhhuh.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Okay.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Okay.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Alright [Redacted PII] Did you receive it?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I did. Let's see.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Okay, okay, it's loaded.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Okay. And so you wanna make sure that you're back in the zoom in the zoom.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Okay. Oh!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Screen? Are you back in Zoom?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Yes, okay. I'm back now.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Okay, so once you're in zoom, I'm gonna ask you to share your screen.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And it should, what phone are you using? Are you using an apple or an android?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I'm on my Macbook.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Hmm!

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Oh, you're on your macbook. Okay?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Alright, so can you. Just so. How can you share your screen with us at this point?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Let me see. No, there's an option on here.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It should be a green.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Oh, here we go right in front of my face. Okay, share.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Okay.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Sorry, sir, just asking me to. I'll let you do it.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
May not be able to record the contents of your screen until it is quits.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Oh, I guess it's quit and reopened.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So? Are they asking you if I should stop my recording?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Is that what they're saying?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Okay.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Hey! I said, Zoom may not be able to record the contents of your screen until it is quit quick, and I'll put later. I'll put later.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Maybe that might work. Okay. Now let's see if it'll go through.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Okay, I think I got it.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Okay.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So if you can bring up the prototype.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Excellent!

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Okay, great. So now I'm going to get your opinion.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So this is a prototype of that will be that we're planning to for the Va dot.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Gov website. And so, like, as I mentioned before, this may not work as you expected to.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So now I'm gonna have you pretend that today is June sixth and your name is Hector.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And you had an appointment this morning at 9 50 A.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
M. With Dr. Knock your primary care. Physician.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:09.000
At the Puget sound va facility. If you hours have passed since your appointment ain't got what your doctor's instructions were. Please use this prototype to find out what Dr.Naught and you discussed during your appointment. Okay? And also, Chris, I'm gonna ask you to think out loud as you are trying to find this information.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So where would you go next to find information on what you and doctor not discussed this morning on June sixth. So I would click on schedule and manage appointments. Oh, oops! Sorry I didn't even scroll all the way down.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Okay. Let me see.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Location.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Okay. So actually, I would go to compose message.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Okay.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So if you okay, so that's where you would go.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And can you tell me why? Go ahead and click on and tell me why?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Okay.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Oh, is it? Oh, okay, well, I guess I was right, because the blue is going to the schedule and manage appointment.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I'm just curious as to why you would click compose message.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So I would start there. I mean, I would use both, but I would start there.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Uhhuh.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
That's why I changed it just like I know, for this. Va.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
In particular, they're very heavy on secure messaging, and they're pretty quick about responding.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Okay.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So I was a message and just ask like, Oh, I'm sorry.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I forgot exactly what we discussed at the appointment.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
If you could, please, just pretty much. Give me a synopsis, and then leave it at that.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Yeah, cause that's like I said, I could.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Okay. So is that what you typically do? Is that what you typically do? [Redacted PII] ?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
If you have a question about what transpired during your appointment.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Umhm cause for me, I'm just a visual person. So at least, if I have it written down, then I'm like, Okay, I've got it.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Okay. Alright. So I'll let you move on to see if you can find the information with Doctor.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Not. Oh, let you continue! Please.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Okay. And so so with that part, that's what I would do and just be done.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:54.000
But then so clicking on the schedule and manage appointments, and then you said it was on June sixth, right?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Yes, June sixth, at 9 50.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Okay. So I would go to the path or click on past.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Okay.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And then June sixth. Okay? So then I see the Primary Point management with Roger Nutt at 9 50. So I would click on details. There.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Oh, okay. And then I see option here, for this appointment occurred in the past, and view after visit. Summary.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Okay, so please review this page and share your all impressions.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
If you can think out loud, please.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Okay, let's see the appointments.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Provider! Oh, nice. Okay. Hypertension. Okay? So it's pretty detailed.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I like that. It has all the information, and especially where it says you share these details about your concern, hypertension. So, yeah, so sorry. I'm still, I need my coffee. So. Yeah, so at least it shows you like, hey, you did discuss these issues with that provider I'm so I'll give you a head start pretty much.And then hopefully, the after visit summary is pretty detailed about it.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Okay, so so are any of the terms. Oh, any or information confusing for you on that page.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
For me personally. No, it's pretty straightforward.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Okay. Can I ask you, did Doctor not ask you to do anything in particular after the appointment?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Did he direct you to do anything?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So I would click on the after visit Summary, and see what's all in here.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Okay, you can go ahead and do that.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Okay, let's see. So it looks like the lab and the appointment have details.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Okay. Diagnosed your vitals.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Let's see, here, we go. Okay. Your treatment plan from this appointment.

So I'll expand that.
Okay. New orders. Machine.L abs.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Wow. This is very detailed. Okay?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Here we go. Okay, heath reminders. Got it.
 
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Okay, wow, yeah. So all of this, I do really, yeah, this is great.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
What is it that you like about it?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So it's pretty much sorry. Been down for a second.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:32.000
So let me scroll back down to.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Medications. Okay? So I know for a lot of veterans, medications we're given a lot.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
So it's nice to know, Mike, what medications were ordered, and for what?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So this is nice to say oh, and my hypertension appointment!

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I was given this medication, and then also, and I had mentioned consults earlier.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And so it's really helpful, just for to have that communication where it says, here you will be contacted by mail or telephone, so pretty much to wait.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Instead of saying that you need to keep calling them to schedule the appointment.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And then same thing here, like with the imaging, just letting them know that, hey?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000
They're gonna contact you with these. So you can put that on your radar.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Okay.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And then and then same here like report during business or sorry during normal working hours.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Complete your exam, and then let's see for lab draws. Yeah.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And then here, to, instead of reporting to the lab, it's saying, to check with your provider whether you need fasting labs.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So I feel like any questions. I mean, this is laid out very like straightforward.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So, judging by the information here in up higher scrolling up higher, do you get a good sense of what Dr.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Knight directed you to.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Oh, absolutely!

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Okay, so now, I'd like to for you to focus on your appointment.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000
On June sixth. So if you can scroll back up on that section.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Okay.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
So, you know, after looking through this section, how would you utilize this information?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Can you provide an example on how you would use this?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So I would like when actually come on. I'm gonna click on okay.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.000
So let me click on that. So I would use this like going forward.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
So back down to the sorry, trying to scroll down.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So back, down to the the consultations, and then same thing with the labs, just having that written down and and like the like, the phone numbers and everything else.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And then I do remember, on the first screen it did have that clinics phone number to call like, if you wanted to call your provider just in case there was any confusion or any questions that you had.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Okay, so are there any terms that are unfamiliar or confusing?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
For you, or anything you'd like to change on this particular in this section.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Your appointment on June sixth.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Here, let me scroll back up!

00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Okay.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000
So if you can go up to your diagnose with section.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Hmm! Oh, here we go. Uhhuh!

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000
How would how would you define that information?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
So I would say other than the hypertension that was discussed I'd say that the rest would be past or sorry.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Past appointments.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Okay, so so you're saying that that signals to is that not only was one thing discussed, but things were discussed from from other appointments.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Is that what you're saying? I'm sorry. Can you?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Elaborate on that a little bit.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Oh, sorry about that, so I would say it looks like it's set for the umment itself.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:48.000
It says reason is hypertension, so I'm just assuming.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Okay.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Possibly that that you would have been diagnosed with the rest of these other than hypertension in the past, and that was just kinda like populated into the into the summary.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Okay. What if the section was titled health conditions you discussed?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
How, how would that change your perception of that section?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Would it matter?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I don't think so only because it says reason for appointment would be hypertension. So I feel like that would be the main focus.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Okay, so how valuable or not valuable do you find this section?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I? Well, honestly, I don't really see a need for it.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Why is that? Can I get your opinion on that?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I feel like it can be a little bit confusing.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000
I mean, I know it, says reason for appointment is hypertension, and then you have all these other diagnoses here so I feel like the after visit.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Summary should just focus on that one like whatever was discussed at that one appointment.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Okay? And you find the other information confusing. Right?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Okay.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
I wouldn't say confusing. Just not needed. Yeah.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Cause I feel like it can, so I don't think so, but I could see, maybe, like an older patient.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Okay.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Possibly being confused by it. Oh, or someone who's not really, I guess.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Savvy with with technology? Possibly. So, yeah, I think if it focuses, if each after visit focuses just on that one or few issues that we're discussed, it would more, I guess, be more streamlined.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Okay, and you're saying that information is really not needed for this particular appointment.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Yes.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Okay, great. Thank you. [Redacted PII] . So I'm gonna ask you to slowly scroll down to medications ordered for administration and clinic.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:09.000
And under that could you tell me, you know? Go ahead and read what that is, and just tell me what that means to you.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Medications ordered for administration during your visit to a Va.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Clinic or emergency department, and then it's got the dots underneath.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
What are these medication terms mean? Oh, awesome. Okay.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:29.000
You can click on that so active. Let's see. Alright. Okay.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
So prescription that can be filled at the Va.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
And the other one is non va, okay, that's that's very helpful.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
A medication that came from some place other than the Va Pharmacy.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
It can be oh, Preview or the providers that was filled outside the BA, okay.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So any of those words, unfamiliar or confusing at all.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
No, no!

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Okay? And so what does medications ordered for administration in the clinic mean to you?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:18.000
So I mean sorry. Oh, let me scroll back up during your visit to the Va.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Okay, so it sounds like it was given while the patient was at the clinic.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And then I would say, for Non va, if they had, like a community care appointment.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Then they were, get whatever medication was given to them then, but then I don't know.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Has its medication been ordered to to be given?

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Like will, it says, Give this once so like, what's the word I'm thinking of?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:01.000
So what's his medication? Only given at the clinic, or is it going to be mailed like, is it like, Hey?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
One a day for 30 days, or you know.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Yeah, so, so are you saying it's not clear there for you entirely.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Umhm, yeah, it's not.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
So. Would you like it more? Would you like more details about that on there?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Yeah, I would put more information, maybe underneath where it says, like, give and status, or maybe even where it says medications ordered for administration in the clinic.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Just I would put maybe something saying like it won't like this.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Medication is not to be sent to the patient, or this.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Okay.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
This was only given in the clinic will not be just something to make it more clear, or even section below it.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:04.000
That'll say tablets, or this has been sent to the patient. And then, if it was just putting like 60 day supply of this medication.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Okay, so we you just like a like, a very short but detailed explanation.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Just the the context of how that medication was taking, and essentially right.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
And if there's further the meditation should be further followed or not, because the way it is here, it's not clear.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Is that correct? Okay.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
No, no, no, you're doing great. Thank you so much.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
It's awesome. Thank you, Chris.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
So so what do you find this useful the way it is now?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Yeah, sorry. I'm like my words are coming, but.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Good Betty's order administration in clinic.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Do you find that you'll use that, that you can use that the way it is now?

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Yes.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Okay, alright. So we're gonna move on to your treatment plan.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:11.000
From this appointment. So please review that section slowly and scrolling.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Well, in talking while you're scrolling, please.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Just so I can hear what you're thinking.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Okay, so new orders from the appointment. So consultations has that listed, and then it's showing that the clinic will call by mail or telephone, and then, under imaging it's says that you'll be contacted by imaging service for

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000
your appointment, and then it lets you know where to report to for your X-rays and ultrasound.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Oh, and then it also lists what you need like, which X-rays that you need.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Oh, let's see, in a lab test check in with your provider whether fasting's required before completing your lab draws to the for the following blood tests on the date listed.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Okay. And oh, so we're on there. So it's detailed.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:27.000
But I don't see the address on here. I'm not sure if it is the same address as where this clinic, what or sorry what this appointment was.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Okay, so to you, it's not clear that it's the.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
It's from the same appointment is that is that what you're referring to?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Christo.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
So it does say, that's the same appointment.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:50.000
But I'm not sure like where, like, what's the phone number?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Okay.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
And address for these, for, like the imaging and the lab that would be helpful.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Okay? So you'd like more information on where to go for these imagings and labs.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Umhm, and then a phone number to, just in case it has been some time that they haven't contacted the patient.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Okay, how would you overall? How would you utilize this information?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I would!

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:30.000
I mean, I would have it for future reference, and probably call like a week or so after the summary, to follow up.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Okay.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
So can we go down to mitigation and supplies?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Yes.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
So. Could you tell me?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:58.000
How does this section medication supplies differ from the medications ordered for administration in the clinic?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Okay. So it says, this section only lists, changes to your medication regimen.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Please see your complete medication list under my ongoing care below.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Okay, what are these medication terms mean? Oh, okay, so same as before.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:28.000
So active and non, va nude. Okay, okay.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
So it looks like the. So that goes to my question earlier.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:38.000
So it looks like these are. So. That section was just what was given in the clinic itself.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:47.000
And this section looks like it is for 80 new medica, or renewed, or new medications which are listed here.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:54.000
How do you find? What do you think of the way they're organized in section down?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000
So I think that this should be underneath the medications that were given in the clinic.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Why is that?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Cause. I think it's easier that way.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:16.000
You have, like just the medications all in one section. Yeah, just cause it's all the way down here. I don't.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Yeah. So II just think it just makes more sense to have just medications all in 1 one section.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Okay.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
But overall how valuable or not valuable.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Do you find this section? The medications and supplies?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I think it's valuable.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000
What would you like? What's in there, or what's not in there that you'd like in there?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Let's see renewed!

00:28:49.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Other orders, nurse blood pressure check, thirteenth.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Only changes. Okay? So if I would say, if there could be underneath the renewed section, if they could put any cancels or expired meds.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
And under which section would you think that's more suitable?

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:30.000
I would put so where it says, renewed with those medications, I'd say, maybe underneath expired slash or cancel slash expired.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Medications.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Okay.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
So the medications and supplies. So let's go back to that.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
So!

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:55.000
When do you think these were ordered? And if you can just give me a feedback of what you think like when they were ordered, and why? And.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:09.000
So I, okay. So since it's underneath this specific after visit Summary, I would think that it was renewed that day.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Okay.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000
So, which ones?

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Yeah.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
But there's no date on there. The medications underneath the renewed section.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Okay, so those particular medications were from that appointment.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Is that what you're here saying, or, okay? Alright!

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Yeah, it will.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Great. Thank you so much for that. So we're gonna move on to your health information as of this appointment.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:46.000
If you can scroll down to that, please. Yeah, right there.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Okay.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
And if you can slowly scroll and look over that setup.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Okay, reminders, health checks for pension care conditions like diabetes. We'll see.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:12.000
This list in the computer to discuss them with you. They do last occurred blue shot date to January third.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
So it looks like they're not their paths due on their flu shot.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Okay, so how would you if you can scroll down a little bit more?

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
And really the entire section.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Okay. Oh, so let's see. Sorry. Call Doctor Smith when you return.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Oh, from Seattle area. This health information is summary.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
From February 13.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Oh, hmm! So it says February. But the the appointment was in June.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Yes, we I think that's our mistake. My apologies.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Oh, okay. I was like, Oh, okay, so that's not it.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
So so in the next 13 months.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Okay, so, maybe.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Calling cause. I know they had the number in the front, but it looks like they're not in the area.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
So!

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Hmm! I don't really know.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000
So just so, [Redacted PII] . How would you use this information?

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Well, if there not up to date with their what's it called? There's shots. I would call the clinic, and see if they need to come in sooner than their next scheduled appointment.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And are any words unfamiliar and confusing on this section?

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
The do every 99 years. Once.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Where it says, Do now.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Yeah.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
That's pretty confusing!

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
What would you have like it to say instead?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
If it's due, let's see. Do. Now do every yeah.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.000
I'm not sure if the 99 years once is correct.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
So just some clarity on that.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Okay, okay. So I'm gonna ask you to scroll down and look for recall appointments. Please.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Oh, there we go. Okay.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Okay.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:53.000
So if you can read that, and just give me an I, and tell me your understanding of what that means.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Okay, so please know that recall appointments are not confirmed.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Appointments you will receive a reminder approximately 3 weeks before the recall date, to call and request the appointment.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
When you call you'll be assigned a confirmed appointment, date and time.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Okay, so let's see.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:27.000
So. August fourth for surgery.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Okay, yeah, I mean, it's pretty pretty straightforward.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
So what could you tell me what it means to you? Please?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:50.000
So for me. It looks like you have that. Or you're due around that time to be scheduled.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:01.000
So August fourth of that year, and then looks like 3 weeks before August fourth, they receive a letter to call to schedule.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Is that confusing or not confusing?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
No, I don't think it's confusing.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000
So it's pretty straightforward. Okay, is this helpful or not helpful for you?

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:22.000
It is. It's helpful.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Okay, so we're gonna scroll down a little further.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:38.000
And we're gonna look at problems list. And I'm gonna ask you, what does that mean to you?

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Okay, let's see problems list, what you've been diagnosed with.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Okay.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Overall.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:59.000
The way that the information is laid out there? Does it make sense, or is it confusing?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Let's see, it makes sense it. There are the date that you've been diagnosed with those issues.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Are there so?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Okay. And do you find this useful or not useful?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Uhhuh.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
I find it so. No, because I feel like there was other things listed up on the very beginning of the list. And then we have 2 things here.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Okay.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:46.000
So if I feel like, if you're gonna keep the problem list, then all of those should be also listed down here, and then you can just take away that section and just leave the hypertension there.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Okay. So so your opinion, would you still leave this section in there if you had a choice?

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I mean, I don't see the need for it, but it wouldn't hurt either.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
So!

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
So you don't see the need for it because of.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Because a hypertension is the main focus for this visit. Summary.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Okay.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
So it does to me, doesn't really make sense to have everything else listed on here.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Okay, great. Thank thank you. So I'm gonna ask you to go down to my medications.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Please.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Okay.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:47.000
If you can read what's there, and let me know if anything is confusing there at all.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Okay, so medications listed below were reviewed with you by your provider and is provided to you as an updated list of medications.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Please remember to inform your provider of any medication, changes or discrepancies that you note.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Otherwise. Please continue these medications as provided. Okay? And then.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Oh, same thing. I don't know why keep thinking that's gonna be different.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Okay, so no notes.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.000
So so this section, my medications in this section, how is this different from the medication and supplies in this section?

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Before this.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Christina, do I still have you there?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Hello! Christo!

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:18.000
I can't hear your audio.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Do? They usually?

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.000
They can get back on right. Kristin.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:42.000
And the back end, or admit them to the room.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Okay.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:40:13.000
If they don't join in another minute, so we can.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Do I have to tell them their name? Kristen? Oh, oh, she's back on okay.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
I'm sorry. I think that was my wi-fi. Can you hear me?

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Yes, I can thank you so much. Sorry about that. That was great that you can get back on.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
No worries.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Yeah, sorry. So, medication is. So, okay, so this.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:55.000
So going. So going back, [Redacted PII] , are you able to get back on the prototype that we sent you?

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Okay.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Yes, I'm looking at it right now. So me try to go back to zoom.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Make sure that. Okay. All right, all as well. So I'm gonna go back to the prototype.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Okay. So I'm seeing. So there's 4 renewed medications for the medications and supplies.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Uhhuh.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000
So now I'm gonna scroll down to the medications.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
My medication. Okay?

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
So looks like.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Might be.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Okay, are renewed by you, so doesn't.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:53.000
So it's only 2 listed here. There was 4 other medications underneath the the medication and supplies.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
This is.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:02.000
So what does that tell you? Is it clear why those medications are in that section instead of the other one?

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:11.000
No. No. Yeah, cause it's saying, here it's oh, so me go back.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
I'm sorry.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:20.000
We're reviewed. You buy your provider, but it says, Okay, so it says, these are reviewed by your provider.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
But then the other ones were as well. That were renewed.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
So, yeah, it's pretty confusing.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Okay. So you have no idea why they're there.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Right.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Okay, alright great. So we're gonna move on to the next task.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Okay.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:52.000
So right now we're going to. I'm gonna ask you to move to.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Another after visit, summary from another day. How would you go about?

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Okay.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Oh, oh, I'm sorry! Can you please share your screen again?

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
That's one thing I forgot to do. My apologies.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Oh, yes, oh, it's okay. Let me get back to you.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:21.000
I see.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:31.000
It's great, so now let's say you wanted you'd like to check in after visit Summary for another appointment that you had.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
How would you go about doing it from this page?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
I will click on the back to past appointments.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Okay.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Did it. Oh, here we go, okay, and then and then back to appointment details.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Okay.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Click on it. Okay? And then past appointments.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Okay and on a scale of one to 5, from one being very easy to 5, being very difficult.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:17.000
How would you? How difficult was this to get back to another appointment? Abs!

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
I see 4.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000
So it'd be very difficult. Wait. Oh, I'm sorry.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Oh, other way. Sorry it was easy, so I said I'd say it was pretty easy, so I'd say one.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Oh, one. Okay. Great. So I'm gonna ask you if you can tell me if you see that upcoming link up there.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Could you check with that clicking on it? Just tell me, what do you assume is behind the upcoming link?

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
I would say any upcoming appointments that you have.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Okay, and how about the pending link?

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
I think pending would be the shoot.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Was it the referral, the one that had the 3, or recall?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Sorry, any recall, appointments.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Okay. See? Alright. So that's where you are expected to find the recall appointments.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Anything else.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Are any consults, or any appointment, or even with the the X rays.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000
That was on the after, or what was upcoming in that that summary from the one that we just looked at.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Okay, great. So now you can stop sharing your screen.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
I have some questions to ask you. Just, general. A general question.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000
So so we're gonna talk about notifications.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Do you typically receive notifications from the Va. Regarding your appointments?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
I do?

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Okay. So I'd like you to pretend the following.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000
So let's say that you're we're going.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:16.000
You were gonna receive it, and you, after visit Summary and this subject, the contents of a new after visit.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Summary, says, each summary of your recent appointments is now available on my healthy vet.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Lock, interview the sign. Would you find this notification helpful or not helpful?

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Oh, you said, for your past appointments!

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Yes, it's it's for your it's to review your after  visit. Summary. So they're notifying you that you received a notification that you can review your after-sis summary.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
I think that's helpful.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Okay. And why would that be?

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:05.000
That way. It's all in 1 one place, and so you have access to at any time.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Okay.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Possibly. Haven't I call the clinic and speak to someone, or are waiting for a while to get in touch with someone?

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Okay, so how would you prefer to receive these notifications?

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Either email, text message or a phone call.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
I would say, text, message or phone call.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Okay? And it doesn't very on how you, this appointment matter on whether you'd like a text message or a phone call.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Yes.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Are you asking like a specific appointment? No, I think every appointment.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Okay, so, if let's say you had multiple appointments in one day, and you want and they're gonna send you an after visit, summary notification, they can either send it to you for each individual appointment, or they can send it to you in one notification with all the appoinment in that

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
notification. Which would you prefer?

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Individual.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Individual. And may I ask, why, please?

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
I think it can be a bit overwhelming, depending on either.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000
That would be depending on how many, even in that day, that you've had it.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Yeah, I think it just be too confusing for one.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Okay.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:43.000
And just a lot of information, all in one report. So if usual would be, you can focus more and more concise.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Okay, okay, excellent.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
So, and lastly, I just have a few more questions for you.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:49:06.000
If you could change anything. Just one thing about the after visits. Summary, what would that be if you was initially had a you know, if you had a magic one, what would you change about it?

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Yes.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
For the one that we did today. Definitely, the medication, the medication that's for me.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:15.000
I was like. So I would say, okay.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Could you? Could you elaborate that on that again, please, [Redacted PII]?

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Sure thing. Yeah. So I would say, if there's a way to have like a renewed section.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:49.000
So actually, so if there's like a whatever was prescribed or renewed in that one visit, and then you could have a section of all of your medications engine, because I felt like the medication and supply, maybe not even have supplies, and medications, in the same section just havethat separate as well, yeah. So let me see if I okay. So renewed medications. All your medications in one section, and then any cancel or expired medications in another section.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Okay, so would you like like the would they? So when you say another section, would you like it in it?

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Within the same section, but just marked off or like like when you say you like.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000
The expired in Canada. In another section. How are you?

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Referring to that like in.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
No, no, no!

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Sorry, probably confusing, so it'll it'll still be under like medications will be like the big bold letters.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Yeah.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:44.000
But it'll have it to where, like he wouldn't have a medication and supply section.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Yeah.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
And then at the bottom there was another medication section say, like you don't have.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
I don't like you were here for hypertension.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Here are your medications, and then all of the medication information in that section, and then supplies, and then everything else, but not to have 2 separate medication sections like one at the very beginning, then the other one was at the very bottom.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Okay, yeah, you find that just too confusing. Right?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Yeah, absolutely for me, anyway. Yeah.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Okay, thank you. And lastly, [Redacted PII] , do you have any questions for me?

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
No no questions.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Great, thank you. And I just wanna thank you for your participation.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:39.000

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:51.000
It was very helpful before you go. I do wanna make sure that it's clear to you that everything we did today wasn't real, and that we didn't access your Va.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Account also, Perry, Jean will be sending you a thank you.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:06.000

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000
And again, I'd like to thank you very much for your time today.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
