00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The recordings are destroyed after we finish analysis, and none of the comments will be attended to you directly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Right now that I actually hit record, can I have you confirm?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Are you comfortable if I record my screen audio as we talk today?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Yes.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Great hey? Now we'll get to the actual question on the topic we're gonna discuss.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'd like to start by learning more about your experience reviewing information about what was discussed during your medical plan. So do you recall receiving paperwork as you left your appointment or reviewing information online that provided an overview of what occurred during your medical appointment, or procedure. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Okay, which appointment are we talking about?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Anyone. Have you ever walked out of an appointment with some papers, or then signed online and reviewed?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Okay.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I have gone online to review the notes, but I've never been handed the notes.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Okay. So when you went online to review the notes, what like? Why did you do that? And what information did you review?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Okay. So I went on my healthy Vet to the blue button reports, and I looked at my lab reports to specifically check my cholesterol and vitamin d levels, and then just saw also what the doctor's notes were.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Okay.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Now was that for a particular appointment? So you've mentioned a lab? Was that for a particular appointment type, or is there a particular provider that you always tend to look at these?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I was just thinking back to my last VA appointment, which was my just, my yearly appointment, and it was Labs and meeting My new primary care. Doctor Dr. [Redacted PII].

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Okay. Now, if you saw something that was an overview of everything discussed in your medical appointment, what would you call her name that thing.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Doctors notes. I guess I don't know.

Notetaker: Participant does not recall ever receiving after-visit paperwork after a meeting with her VA provider.  She usually goes to  my HealtheVet to the blue button reports to view her labs; she would refer to that paperwork or online information as Doctor’s notes, p.2:

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Sure. No, there's no wrong answer. Again.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now we're actually going to get to the part where we review prototype.

00:02:40.000  --> 00:08:13.000
Redacted for tech issues with Zoom Screen Share.


00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Okay, can you see something? This is my healthy bed at the top?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Yes, I can.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Yes, you can. Great. Okay. So now we're going to play.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Pretend they're going to present that today is June sixth, and you are Hector. So you can see Hector at the top here, and you had an appointment this morning at 9:50, with Dr. Nutt and Dr. Net, your primary care physician. So. A few hours has passed since your appointment, and you forgot what your doctor's instructions for so use this prototype to find out what Doctor Knutt on you discussed at your appointment, and as like direct me and I'll click on anything and talk aloud and share your thoughts as you're reviewing the prototype.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Okay.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Alright. Well, first try Hector the Dropdown for Hector. Okay. Scroll down! Scroll down!
Stop! Okay, well, let me see lab and test results and see if there's any notes under that.
Health history.


00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
That is not hooked up in in this prototype.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It's not.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
No, I haven't tested that.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Okay, alright. So go back up.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
We'll close that.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And check menu. The Hamburger menu.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:20.000
It does that is not hooked up in the prototype either those like. I'll scroll up and down and see if there's anything else that you would find.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Okay.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:42.000
A overview of what you discussed.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Go down to health history, I guess.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Okay, yeah. Review your care. Summary and notes.

Notetaker: Participant tried to find the June 6th AVS through trial and error. She clicked on Hector’s dropdown, then proceeded to click on “Labs and test results”, and since that was not active in the prototype she scrolled up and clicked on the hamburger “Menu”, and that wasn’t hooked up either. Then she chose “Health History” and finally chose “Review your Care summaries and notes” took her 2 minutes to find Care summaries and notes , p. 3.


00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Okay, yeah, there it is. Primary care after visit, summary details.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:30.000
We brought up the after the summary page. I'm going to have you review this whole page and again share your thoughts as your renewing, and I can scroll anywhere up and down that you tell me.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Okay. So click on details for the 9:50 A. M. Appointment.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Now that's not hooked up. But what would you expect to see if you did if that did open?


00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So it would discuss. What we talked about during the appointments, what the doctors recommendations were. If there were any new prescriptions, those would be listed, and if there's a would be a follow-up appointment, maybe that would be listed as need follow up whatever many days. If there was a referral, if it lists that they were referring me to somebody. That's it.

Notetaker: When reaching the June 6th AVS Screen participant didn’t scroll down to look further she chose the Details link on the 9:50 am appointment. She expected to see doctors recommendations and follow-ups and referrals, p.4:


00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Okay. Now, I'll ask that you can continue to review this page and then provide feedback.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Okay. You can tell me to stop on a particular section, or if you have any thoughts on anything you're seeing.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I mean, it looks pretty thorough. Okay, I like it. The procedures where it says, ultrasound.
So I assume that means the ultrasound was conducted already. I'm not sure. I you know, if it was my appointment I would already know.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
So, would you expect this to be something that's already conducted already?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I guess I would. Yes.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So reviewing this page, what taking this first glance, would you user not use this page? And why?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Yeah, I would use that. And. It looks pretty thorough, and it's I like the way it's sectioned out.
I think it kind of gets more to the summary of everything without having to read through a whole couple of paragraphs to figure out what was going on.

Notetaker: Participant thought that the first accordion “Your appointment on June 6th was a summary of transpired during the appointment and she would use it, p. 5:

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Now, did Dr. Nutt want you to complete or do anything following your appointment? I can scroll around to.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Yeah, yeah, I need to scroll because I can't see. Well, you need to expand “your treatment plan”. Okay. So there was a referral, then to rheumatology. And just wait for them to call for the Ct. And MRI scans.

Notetaker: Participant opened “your treatment plan” to discover whether Doctor Nutt instructed her to do after the appointment, p. 5:

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Now, I'm actually going to go up and we're just going to talk about this first accordion, this first, you know, great box so where it says your appointment on June 6.
Th. I know we already reviewed this, but I'm going to scroll through again, and you can tell me you can tell me how fast to scroll, where to go. But as we're doing this section, I want you to think about two things. Can you provide an example of how you might utilize the information in this section and then stop me if there's any terms that seem unfamiliar or confusing?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:38.000
The clinic lab red for CI don't know if that's just the way they tell you where to go, and Puget sound. I don't know what Red 4C is.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So what would you want to see here?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
If they're really telling you, what floor to go to, and all that. Alright. Just a room number like the with conventional room numbers like, if it's the fourth floor that starts with the 4.

Notetaker: Participant commented on Red 4C and said that she doesn’t know if that mean the 4th floor or room number; she would want that info more clear, p. 6:

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Okay, so.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And it would continue reviewing with section.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000
What? What was your first question? I know you said let you know if there's something I would do differently or like to see different.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
But one question.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
If, how would you utilize the information in this section?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Okay. I mean, I like that the diagnoses are right up front. Just very, very well, and succinctly pointed out.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:01.000
And then, is there anything unfamiliar? No, I'm actually gonna ask you a question about this actually, since you brought it up.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Okay.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:11.000
How do you? Just define! Now? I'm not asking how you would define like hypertension, but what this overall section is showing how do you like if you could reward that? Well, how would you define it?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
I mean I. I like it the way it is.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Okay.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
What if the title of the section was health condition? You discussed? What were your? What were your thoughts? Be on that section?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Well, then, that means something completely different. Because if I said, Hey, Doc, I think that I have lupus, you know. Okay. You discussed it, but you weren't diagnosed with it because you're probably wrong. Because you self-diagnosed, you know.


00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Now, how do you? How valuable or not valuable!

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Do you find the section with the title that's currently on the screen? You are diagnosed with.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I find it very valuable.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And why?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Because I like to know what my How my health is. You know what diseases and afflictions that that I have, that have been verified by a doctor.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Now how valuable or not valuable would you find the section called Health Conditions?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000
It would just be moderately valuable. I mean you did.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:58.000
I mean health conditions. We discussed it. It might remind me, oh, yeah, we did talk about that. But. I'm kind of more of a to the point. Person like a tell me what my condition is, what we need to do about it from here on what the next step is.

Notetaker: Participant believes that there’s a big distinction between “you were diagnosed with” and “health conditions you discussed”, p. 7-8 :

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Now I have let me keep scrolling, and we'll go back to those first questions that I asked you before I stopped you on that section of how would you utilize this? And is there anything confusing?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Well!

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:47.000
The height and weight. I prefer to have in inches and pounds. If I'm the one using it. Obviously, the medical people probably want it in the way it's for.
After body mass index. You could put the recommended, you know, healthy range.
So I would know if that was high or low.

Notetaker: Participant would like height and weight in US equivalents and would like a definition of the ranges for the body mass index, P. 8:

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Okay.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Alright! Let's be realistic. How high it's it, how high it really is!

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Okay. You can scroll down.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
I'm going to actually stop and ask about this medication section. So how would you define Or what does the information under this section looks like to you?

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000
It looks like it's medications that you have to go in to be administered. You can't so administer these medications yourself.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Okay. So this is something you need to do. You need to go into. Have that medication. You still need to go. Do it.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000
It's yeah, it sounds like it. Yeah.

Notetaker: Participant understood the “Medications administered at the clinic” to be medications that need to taken while at the clinic. She did not interpret that as meciations that were given to her during her June 6th appointment; she thought she has to go to clinic and take the meds, p. 9: 

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
No, I'm actually going to click on this. What do these medication terms mean? If you can review that and share your thoughts.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
It makes sense to me.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Okay, how useful or not useful. Do you find the information within this dropdown?
The medication term.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Yeah, that that's useful, because that's often my question. Is this a VA med or another med. So, yeah, that I find that very useful.

Notetaker: Participant found the VA and Non-VA med info to be very useful because she often times has a question where her meds are from, p.9: 

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Okay. Now, we're going to go down to the next section. So we finished the first one we're going to go to your treatment plan from this appointment. And we're going to do this same thing we did above. I'm going to add, review fully review this section and ask the same to quote, how would you utilize this information? And is there anything unfamiliar or confusing?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.000
I'm going to point out that it says you will be contract in.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Thank you. That is sorry. That's just cool. It's a prototype.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
It should be, you will be contacted. But yeah, it was just distracting me.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Okay. I see.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Alright! It's good. Tell me I need to go to the rheumatology, consult. And then I need to be wait, be contacted for that. I've had a little bit of medical classes, backgrounds, so I'm able to. I understand what they mean by those scans. There! So that's not confusing to me personally. Let's see. The word gold in that is, I don't know what that refers to, unless it's like my Va.
Has a gold team that's doing it. I don't know. Yeah, that's confusing.

Notetaker: Participant found the word “gold” confusing, she didn’t know what that was referring to, p.10:


00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
No, particularly. I'll ask in this medication section, since I think that's where I have a couple of questions here.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Okay.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:05.000
How would you describe the information under this medication and supply sections? How would you define it?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Okay, I would define. It looks like it's changes to your current “medications or supplies”.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Now we saw the another medication section earlier on the page, which was medications administered within the clinic.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:37.000
So how, if you could compare the 2 sections and compare how valuable or not valuable you find both of those. Could you do that?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
I would, well, first of all, I would put them closer to one another. If you're talking about medications, it should all kind of be more together than they are. I think the changes one is probably more I don't know more important, but. This section where you have that they have to be administered at the clinic. You could almost just list that in parentheses, after the medication itself administered only in clinic, or something like that.


Notetaker: Participant correctly understood that the three medications sections are different, she suggested that they should be closer together without having separate sections, p. 11:


00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
So now I'm going to continue on, and you can provide feedback on the rest of this section. Okay. 

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:55.000
You can scroll down a little bit more. Yeah. There. The post deployment screening I mean, I don't know how useful that is to the patient to know that that was done. I mean, I just kind of think that that is something for the provider. To track. I don't know. I don't know how you either. They screen or you don't. I don't know that it's something that I would track myself.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Okay. So you really wouldn't want that to display here.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
I mean it's not necessary that I know of, but. kind of like the they do the mental health screening thing, because I've seen that in some storm form before. And yeah, it seems like they got a screen every time you come in for something. You know what your home environments like and all that. And I mean, if they didn't list that on my healthy bit screen, that's alright with me, I don't really need to see that they mark that they did it or not.

Notetaker: Participant didn’t find the post-deployment screening useful, she thinks its something for the provider to be aware of, she couldn’t think of why she would need to know that information, p. 11:

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Okay, now, that you review this whole entire. “Your treatment plan section”, How would you utilize this information? What would you do with this after you reviewed it?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I would mark on my calendar when my next appointment was, or like that, you know, when I'm due for the flu shot, mark when that was, do I would call the pharmacy about the prescriptions. See if they're available to pick up yet. And wait for the wait for those calls from the clinics that I'm do for my what was it, MRI? And something else? Yeah, there were a couple under radiology.

Notetaker: Participant would use the info in “Your treatment plan” section as next step to do, p.12:

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Now we're going to go down to the next section and review this similar to what we're done in the other two So for “your health information as of this appointment”, I ask you to review it and make. How would you use the information? And if there's anything confusing?

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Okay. This first time I've heard of a recall appointment. So I'm not quite sure. Looks like.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
How would you? Yeah, how would you define that?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
It looks like the reason they're calling it recall is because you have to wait. You can't call now, but you have to wait until 3 weeks before. I guess. 3 weeks before the appointment they want you to make somewhere in there. You will receive reminder approximately 3 weeks before the recall date, to call and request the appointment.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:45.000
So. How helpful or not helpful is this information to you?

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Well, it's helpful,  knowing that I can't call and make the appointment yet.

Notetaker: Participant never heard of a “recall appointment’ but correctly defined what it was after reading it. She thought it was helpful info because she now knows that she can call to make the appointment, p. 12:

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Yeah, and we'll continue to scroll down. Okay. Let's see, yeah. The.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:15.000
The other. The appointments that are already scheduled, obviously very helpful have to know those where they are. That's good. Okay. Appointment notes. Take blood pressure 3 times per week. Okay, and bring the journal with you. Yup. Good stuff.



00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:42.000
I'm actually going to ask you about, “Problem List” how would you again define this section? Another way to think about it is what does this information tell you?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:00.000
I mean. It tells me I have high blood pressure, and the my lipids are high.
And the date that that was first determined. It looks like.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000
So how useful or not useful to you. Do you find this information?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
It's useful to know, like how long I've been dealing with the issue. That's good to know.
Let's see. Not talking about immunizations, yet right?


00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.000
You can. Yeah, if you want to, we can keep going, and you can provide feedback as we scroll through the rest of them.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Okay, yeah. The immunizations. I think it's very important to know. Cause. Personally, I forgot if I got my that second shingles vaccination a while ago, and I was able to look and find out.
Yes, I actually did that. So yeah, when you're last Immunizations were.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Now? What how far back of the immunization would you expect? To actually display in this document.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Well, for the one timers. It needs to go back just as far as possible. But like for the flu shot, you only need the most recent, shot, so I so I guess in that case it really it is. It would be the most recent for any shot is all you really need to know. But you would also need to know if it was a series, whether it was the first or second in the series that you received.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Anything else on immunization?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Let's see.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Well, it wouldn't hurt to put a due date the next immunization, if it's a required one.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Let's see.

Notetaker: Participant found the information on the “Problems list” useful because it serves as a reminder how long the issues have been going on for, She also like the reminders of immunizations she has taken and would like to know when she is due for certain ones, p13-14:

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
And then we can continue and review the rest of this. The section again, pointing out, if it's confusing, or if how would you utilize the information?

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Okay, I'd say, yes, it's very useful, especially. For anyone helping to treat me. They wouldn't use things that I'm allergic to.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Now, if this document is for you, though, does that change?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:11.000
I could. I mean I could print it out if I'm. Well, let's say, let's say we're talking about my dad, who's also a veteran And also uses the VA, We can go onto his site, and I can see what he's allergic to and help his providers because he's in a nursing home. Help them know that. Yeah, he's allergic to all these things. So it's it'd be easy to a nice thing to print out. That section for them.

Notetaker: As also being a caregiver of a Veteran, participant believed the allergies list is useful, cause she can print it out and show it to the her Veteran’s (Father) providers.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Okay, I like how this is set up for people who aren't used to looking at lab results because it with the with the flag It, we'll tell you abnormally low. That's good.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:31.000
I'm going to ask, this is recent live results. What would be your definition of recent like, what would you want to show up here? How would you define resent?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Recent would to me. I would just be putting the very last ones that you had done, and I just know that. They commonly do them no. Well what they want them done once a year at least.
So no more than a year out.

Notetaker: Participant didn’t realize that “recent Lab results” were as of this appointment, p.14:
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
I like the radiology reports just very quick, and to the point. You're not trying to have to figure out radiology and figure out what they mean when they're going through a whole steady okay?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Okay.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:03.000
How would you define this “My medication” section?

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Can you scroll up just a little bit?

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:26.000
So it's updated listed medications. So these should all be current. Well, II like it tells you how to take it, and it's got the prescription number right there, for when you have to do reorders, and what pharmacy it is as well as the phone is right there. So all of that. It's great.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:56.000
How does this my medication information in this section differ from the medication in that we're further up on the page. So the medication and supply section, and then the ones that were administered to clinic.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Again. I think that all should be together, and, like I said you could put in parentheses to be administered in clinic. So for this particular list, this my medication section.


How would you utilize or not utilize this information?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:44.000
I would use it to call the pharmacy for reorders, and to verify how I'm supposed to be taking it.

Notetaker: Participant understood that “my medications” are her ongoing and current medications but doesn’t like that the medications are Listed in different sections, p. 15:

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:52.000
I'm going to scroll through the medications, and then we can continue what we were doing before just reviewing the rest of the section of is anything confusing? And how would you utilize it?

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Okay, that's pretty much the same as. I suppose there's a way you could actually, since it's a non-VA prescription. I don't know if you have access to information, and where it's actually from, that would be super helpful.To go ahead and list the pharmacy there as well.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Okay, is there any other information you wrote in this section? Besides, just the pharmacy thing?

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Oh, there is one comment there receives from CVS See?
Well, you know, it wouldn't hurt to say for what condition it's treating.

Notetaker: Participant didn’t realize that the Medication section “medications you are no longer taking” is different from the other sections; she would like to see info on what condition the medication is for, p. 16:

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Then we will, and there's more comments on the section.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
We'll go down to :more information”, So what would you expect to find under this more information Section?

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Are we still, I see. Can you scroll all the way the top in the bottom again, so I can see exactly what we're talking about in this whole page.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:18.000
It's a very long page. So yeah.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:27.000
The information. Maybe more detailed information like, if you really wanted to look at your labs.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
I'm going to scroll quickly back down. I'm actually going to open it up and then ask for it. Feedback on that.Unless you have another idea of information that you would want in this section.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Okay.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000
So what do you think about the information that's shown here?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:17.000
So that's good that there, they're specifically pointing out Places, that you've been referred to, or that you might need to go to that. Those are the ones they're highlighting. Yeah, I love that. The phone numbers right up front and hours. That's good.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:57.000
No, that you've seen this. Is there anything you would add or take away?

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Okay, I'm being picky again. I would be consistent on your fourth floor and your second floor just using the same format for second and fourth. If there was a link. If you made the phone number a link. So if you had a if I'm looking at it on my phone, I don't know if that's possible.
If we just hit the phone number and it calls.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Is there anything that's unclear or confusing in this section?

Notetaker: Participant suggested that there should be a live phone link to the facilities under the more information and suggest that the floors “second and 4th should have the same format, p.17:


00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
No!

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
And now we're going to pretend that. So we reviewed this one after visit, Summary.
But maybe this brought up some other questions from a even further back appointment.
We're going to pretend that. Now you want to view information from another appointment. You had in the past. So how would you do that?

Notetaker: Participant had difficult navigating to another AVS. At first she scrolled to top, then tried to collapse “Your appointment on June 6th” accordion a few times. Then scrolled all the way to the bottom of the screen then back up to top. Finally she hit the back to care summaries button and was able to find another AVS. When asked how difficult it was she replied a “2”, p. 17-18.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Okay, so close out the.
The June sixth one. Close that out. That's the one we just looked at right.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Okay.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Hey? Let's see.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Hey! Expand all! Let me see that!

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
No, that was it. That was okay. Flaps that again.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Scroll down!

00:47:49.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Hey? We're gonna have to go back, I guess. Okay, top back to summary notes.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Okay. Scroll down.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:15.000
There's one. Okay, hey? An earlier one to get details.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Okay. So now that we found this page and you would click here, how?
On a scale from one to 5, one being very easy and 5 being very difficult.
How easy or difficult was it to navigate to another summary. From another day.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
2.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Now I'm going to stop sharing. I still have more questions. But we don't need the prototype anymore.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Okay.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Now we're going to talk about notifications and notifications that you might want to receive about your after visit Summary, so pretend that you receive the following message, a subject line would be new after visit, summary, and the Content could be a summary of your recent appointment is now available on My HealtheVet login to review the summary. So do you find this notification helpful or not helpful?

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
I find it helpful. Yeah.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
And why?

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Well, I'd rather read it, and. Have it available in that form as opposed to just getting notes.
Summaries that I could probably lose. You know, physical notes.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:39.000
How is you prefer to receive this notification?

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
A text would be good.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
And if you had multiple appointments in one day, would you want one after visit?
Summary notification for each appointment? Or would you want all the appointments for the day combined into one message?

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:07.000
All of them combined cause. Otherwise I might miss one of them, thinking I'd already read it, or something.

Notetaker: Participant found having a AVS notification to be useful; she would like to have the notification via Text and in one Notification because she’s afraid that she wouldn’t remember to read all of them if they were all separate, p.19:

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Now I just have a few more questions, and then we're done for today. If you could change one thing about the after visit summer experience that you thought today, what would that be?

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Hmm!

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000
I don't know. I can't think of anything.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Is there anything about, after visited summaries that you wanted to share with me, that we already haven't covered?

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
No!

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Do you have any questions for me?

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
No, I don't.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Hmm! Great, that's all the questions I have for you today.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Alright!

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us, your feedback will definitely help us as we continue to work on the site and really make sure it works for veteran.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:13.000
I just wanna make sure that it's clear that today we everything we did wasn't real.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Right.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
You haven't really accessed your via that account just to prototype, and then Perjean will be sending you a thank you.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:26.000
You may know that that would allow them to provide a chance to participate in future recession.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Okay.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
So thank you so much for your time, and enjoy the rest of your day.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Alright! Thanks. Bye.
