00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Let me hit the button.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Got it?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now that they hit record. Can I have you confirm on the record? Are you comfortable if I record my screen or audio as you talk today?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now I like to start learning more about your experience, reviewing information about what was discussed during your medical appointment. So, do you recall receiving paperwork as you left?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You keep going in and out? Can you hear me?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Oh, I apologize! Let me see, I can hear you.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Yeah.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Okay. Okay. Nope.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Okay, let me know if my audio starts to get weird again.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Okay.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Do you recall receiving paperwork as you left your appointment, or reviewing online information that provides an overview of what occurred during your appointment or procedure?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Okay. I heard the first part about asking if I recall receiving paperwork when I left my appointment.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Yeah.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Yes, I requested a summary of my visit.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Okay? And so you all have, out of your appointment with paper.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Redacted due to technical issues.


00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Sometimes that helps with connection. Okay, let me resume the recording.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Okay. And my very first question, I'll say, Oh, say it again.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Do you recall receiving paperwork as you left your appointment or reviewing information online that provided an overview of what occurred during your medical appointment or procedure?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Yes, two things. One. I got the summary notes before leaving on one appointment with pain management, and then the other, when I went online to see what the notes were a few days later.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Okay, so you've done both online. And you've gotten paper copy.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Yes.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And this is where this was this, at a VA facility or Non- VA facility.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
This was at a VA. The pain management was VA.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Okay? And then online, was that VA,  was that a another provider?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Yeah, that that was VA, now, I have recently been to a non-VA facility where they gave me a printout. That was a physical therapy appointment.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And why did you review this paperwork or online content?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I just wanted to make sure that what the doctor told me was actually inside of my record.
Just a verify what he told me. Was there.

Notetaker: Participant did receive a printout and he called it a “summary of the visit” after his pain management appointment, and he also checked online to ensure that what he and his doctor discussed during the appointment was in his records. He didn’t particularly focus on anyone section of the visit summary, p. 2-3:


00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Was there any particular information section that you really took time to review?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:02.000
No, I just read. It was only like 3 pages, you know. The first half of it was all my information in the and then the other half and 2 pages was basically the summary of the visit.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Was there any difference between the VA Examples that you saw and the non-VA, that you would want to call out. Something was more helpful, or you tend to look at it more. Whatever the difference would be.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
No, I think the only difference is when you go out there to that blue button,
And try to pull down the progress notes of the recent visit making sure that you put the correct information in just to get that from the online.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So, accessing the Blue Button report and getting the exact specifics report is, so you're talking about okay?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Right, yeah.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And is that the blue button that you're accessing online for the summaries?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Yes.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Okay. What would you call, Or what do you name something like this. So this review of your discussion with your provider.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
You mean the progress notes?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Yeah, if you have. Well, yeah, I was like, if you give it a title, what would it be that? Would it be? Progress notes? What would you want to name this thing?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Oh, if I had to name it, I would just say “summary of visit”, Doctor's Visit.

Notetaker: Participant said there’s no real difference e between the paperwork received from doctor and the online blue button information. If she had to name it would be “Summary of Visit”, p. 3-4:


00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Okay. Next, we're going to get to the prototype.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So, going to go into zoom, chat, and put the link.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Okay.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Okay, I just sent it. If you I can help guide if you've never been in zoom chat before.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Otherwise, if you can bring that up, and then also share your screen so that way, I'll be able to follow along with you're clicking through the print.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Redacted due to technical issues with Zoom Screen Share.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Okay. Now, we're going to play for pretend. So, pretend to be is June sixth in your Hector.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
You're right.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So you can see Hector is the top of the prototype, and you had an appointment this morning at 9:50, with Dr. Nutt, Who is your primary care Physician At the Puget Sound via facility. So a few hours has passed since your appointment, and you forgot what your doctor's instructions were. So use this prototype to find out what doctor Nutt and you discussed at your appointment. Think aloud, so like as you're reviewing share what you're seeing.
If anything's confusing, talk a lot as you try to complete that task.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Okay. So you're asking me, I just had an appointment. It's been a few hours, and now I'm wanting to, I forgot what we discussed, so I need to go back to see. What he wants me to do. Right? Okay?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Yeah. And just ….an appointment on June sixth. It was with Dr. Nutt at 9:50.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Okay. So what I am looking for is my Health History is where I need to go, since it was June sixth. Let's see. So I'm clicking on health history. Oh, but I don't! I'm looking for right here. Some reason, notes, is what I'm looking for. So I'm going to click on review your camera summary and notes. And then the primary care after visit. Summary is here. So, I click on details.

Notetaker: Participant chose Health history, care summaries and clicked on the details on primary care AVS June 6th, p. 5. Participant navigated to the AVS very easily.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Hey! Now that you're on this page, I'm going to have you again talk a lot as you're reviewing it.
But take time, and review the whole page, and share your thoughts and overall impressions.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Okay, after. Okay. So I'm only talking about the 9:50 appointment correct?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
What will? What do you think about what's actually shown here?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
It's listing. The details of hold on! I'm going to click on it.
And then there's lab work. So, hold on! It's not allowing me to click on details.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Yeah, so that's part of the prototype. Not everything's applicable. If what would you expect to be like if you click on details?What do you think that would show you?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:55.000
It will actually show me the summary notes of the visit, and then, when I click on the lab work well, I don't know if that lab work is part of the 9:50 appointment or not, because it has a 11:30 Am. Time.

Notetaker: Once she arrived on the AVS screen, participant thought she had to click on the details of the 9:50 am ET to get to that AVS; she didn’t realize that the screen she was on was the AVS, p. 6:

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So, this is your after visit. Summary, would you want the lab to show up here or not. Like that. You had a lab appointment after.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Well, if I had a lab appointment after I wouldn't mind that It's showing up all under the same date. Instead of trying to find it somewhere else on it, in a different area of the app. I wouldn't mind it. Everything that I done on June sixth would be under June sixth.

Notetaker: Participant wouldn’t mind if other appointments on June 6th would be listed in the same AVS, p.6: 

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Keep scrolling, and then share your thoughts again.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Okay, so let's see. So, I went to see the doctor for Hypertension. And this is what now it says. You were diagnosed with. Is this, what they're listing, What I was diagnosed with on this appointment Or is this historical information? It doesn't really say.


00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I'm going to put that back to you. Which one do you think it is? And then, secondly, which one would you prefer?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I'm going to make an assumption that this is what's I was diagnosed with on this appointment.
Oh, no, I'm sorry what I was diagnosed with in historically, in the past, and for this appointment I'm only being seen for hypertension.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Okay. Now, the other thing that you brought up. So this is what you are diagnosed with for this appointment, or you know, during this appointment, what are your thoughts on the value of that compared to a historical?Would you rather see a list of things you're just diagnosed with this appointment?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I would prefer, since I'm only dealing with this appointment, I would prefer to only be dealing with diagnosis from this appointment, not historically in the past.

Notetaker: Participant was confused with the “you were diagnosed with” she was unclear whether the information was a former diagnosis or that she was diagnosed with those things during this specific appointment. She prefers the information to contain a diagnosis specifically for this appointment not what she was diagnosed with from the past, p. 6-7:

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Okay, what if this section was actually called, “Health conditions you discussed”,
as an alternate title. What do you think? What do you think about that?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Oh, then, that's fine! Then that's fine! What we discussed during is, visit. Yeah, I prefer to have everything with this visit. Be all in this one area. Yes, that's fine.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Okay, then you can keep on reviewing the page.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Okay. So it gives me my vitals Okay? And then procedure. Is this the upcoming procedure, the ultrasound? Or is this something that happened on the sixth?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Which one do you think it is? And then which again, which one would you prefer to show right here?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Ultrasound. I know I'll make an assumption that this is something that the doctor wants me to do. But I don't know. Well, maybe I'm analyzing this way too much. But why? I'm going. I'm seeing a doctor for hypertension. But why would? He'd be wanting me to do an ultrasound.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Definitely, don't worry about over analyzing this. This is exactly what like this is exactly why we're talking to veterans.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Okay, so, but I mean. I would if that's the next procedure that the doctor wants me to have done, then. Yeah, I guess I would want to see it there. But b that doesn't have anything to do with hypertension. Unless something. This hypertension is affecting something. We're an auto sound is needed.

Notetaker: Participant picked-up on what her doctor wanted her to do next, p.8:

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Okay, let's see medications ordered for administration and clinic. So, okay, so active for Tylenol, I guess, or whatever it is, that's the active ingredient in. So I guess that's for pain or something.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Okay, let me see, in my treatment plan from this appointment. A new order from this appointment consultation. Let's see, then, then, you're doing imaging on.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Well going back, It looks like all of these different issues that was diagnosed with. We’re dealing with this all under this one visit, under hypertension. Okay, alright. So.
So, I got to go to, and they have a CT and a MRI, so they're going to be contacting me. And this is what they're going to be doing. Right hand view left hand view and alright, then lab test.
Okay, please, for the following blood test. Okay. So going to the lab to get some blood work done. Okay. So my doctor renewed some medications. And the other order was to have my blood pressure check with like.In 6 months, or more than 6 months. No, 4 months.
Okay, I like the health reminders of when my flu shot is due. Again.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Is there any particular reason you like that?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Oh, cause sometimes I don't remember the last time I had a shot. I had the shot, so this would be a great place to see that and get it done.

Notetaker: Participant liked having the flu shot reminder there because she sometimes forgets to get it, p.8: 
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Okay, so overall with what you.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
What is the post? Oh, oh, go ahead! I'm sorry. I was just looking at. Why is the post deployment screen on here? There's it, says Iraq and Afghan post-point screen, due date. What is that?

Notetaker: Participant was confused what the Post Deployment Screen is and why is it listed in this section and she didn’t pick up on the fact that she needs to do it, p. 9: 

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Okay, that's another. Every so often. So do every. Oh, okay, so all this is under there. Okay, this is just one of them. I guess you just do it once. If you haven't done that, this is, if a there's a whole series of things like this like flu shot and other political reminders, and that's just one that this heck he hector needs to do.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Okay, got it?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So with what you've reviewed so far.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
How? What do you use or not use this page in line?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Oh, I would use this page it gives me. It looks like it will give me quicker access to the information that I'm looking for.

Notetaker: Participant found the info under “your appointment on June 6th” very useful,p.9:

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:37.000
And then did not want you to complete or do anything following your appointment.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:54.000
I got to have an ultrasound, and there is a a console out for rheumatology. And it looks like there's some. Some images that needs to be done.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Okay. Now, I'm actually having you scroll back up to the top. And we're just going to talk about. So you look at a couple of sections that I'm calling like sections of the gray area, so that first one where it's the your appointment on June 6, just the stuff that's in this box can you write an example of how you might utilize the information within this section.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
In this section, under the appointment of June sixth.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Yes, everything under that grey header!

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Oh, this gives mw me, Well, one, if anyways ask me who my doctor's already this definitely gives me the information their name and all that stuff. My providers. I do like that, so I have to be searching. Who the heck is that doctor? And also. I like the fact that it does list my diagnosis. What I was diagnosed with. So when I'm filling out other medical forms that other doctor's office or visits, whether it's Va or other places where they actually put a history, your family history or your history of these ailments, their ailments, these they're listed here. So I like that.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Are there any terms or anything shared in this section that seem unfamiliar, confusing?

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
No, no, I'm scrolling again. I'm sorry. I was just scrolling again to make sure I understood everything. No!

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Okay. Then I'll have you scroll. There was a section called Medication, Ordered for Administration in clinic. You just pass it. It's up a little higher. There we go.


00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Okay, hold on, okay, medications ordered for administration, including, okay.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Yes. So I'm we're just going to talk about that one medication section. How would you define what is shown here?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:39.000
What I'm looking at here is, it's telling me there's an active prescription for this medication medications ordered for administration during a visit to a VA emergency Department.
To me. It just gives me a list of current medications from a visit.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Okay. What if I told you the section displays medications that you took or that were administered while you were actually at your appointment? What do you think about reviewing that?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Oh! So that's what this section is. They gave me this section. They gave me medication at the clinic. The VA

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Yeah, what do you think about that?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
I guess it's okay. I mean, I was confused. I thought it was something they prescribed me. I guess that was a confusing part. I thought, Yeah, I thought it was something that they prescribed me. Currently during is visit. And that's why I's showing active. Not that I had received it while I was at in the visit.

Notetaker: Participant believed that the “medications administered in the clinic” was something that was prescribed to her during the visit, p.11:



00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Now I'm going to have you go down to the next grade box that says your treatment plan from this point and we're going to do that.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Okay.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:10.000
So review this section again. And can you talk about how you would utilize the information within this section?

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Okay, on this section. This would just be me following up to make sure if I haven't received the call from these. The order. My doctor put in the system. I would go back to this section to follow up on each of the consults that are here.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Okay. And are there any words or terms that seem unfamiliar or confusing to you?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
No!

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
I'm going to have you actually scroll down to that medication supply section. So you're viewed medications earlier up and like here's another medication section. So how would you describe the information shown here?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Medication. This section only list changes. Oh, this is the medication that current that are currently taking, that the doctor renewed.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:28.000
And how does this differ to the medication section above? It's called Medication Ordered for Administration and Clinic.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:51.000
That is too wordy up here, but that fee right here is too wordy.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
But apparently this section up here Medication Order for administration in clinic is what I was given while I was in the clinic during my doctor's visit the medication listed below down here is what I'm currently taking that the doctor just refilled based or renewed my prescription for.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:04.000
How valuable or not valuable do you find the section to be, and why?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
I think it just gives you a snapshot of what you're taking. And the changes, and like, I said, in the changes.

Notetaker: Participant correctly identified the difference between the “Medications & Supplies” section and the “Medications Ordered for Administration in Clinic”; she didn’t comment on how valuable or not it is, p. 12.
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Now I'm going to have you scroll down to the next great section, which I don't. Yeah, you haven't opened yet. Yeah. What was without clicking on it. Yeah.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Your health information is okay. You let me do that. Okay.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Well, what do you think will be in there? What type of information will display when you open that up?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Your health information as of this appointment. I guess anything that occurred prior to this appointment prior to the June sixth appointment.

Notetaker: Participant understood “Your health information as of this appointment” to contain past information prior to this appointment, P13:

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Okay, scroll up and then review this section and again, think of an example of how you might utilize information in this section.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Okay, so this is prior to yeah. February. Okay? And like that, should. This is just information from a previous appointment.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Well like that actually should not say February. I said, say June sixth, apology, that is something that is wrong. With just the prototype. So this information is summary from June sixth same day as deployment.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Oh, oh, okay.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:05.000
So this is June 6th information. Okay? So, it's telling me I haven't upcoming appointment in the next 13 months. It's telling me to take my blood pressure. Pressure is built wrong 3 times per week. Okay, so I need to do, take my blood pressure 3 times a week and bring the journal of such readings. Okay. So it's just listing. My smoking status and my immunization, and then, if there's any, and then what? I'll okay. And then my covid vaccine. And then any allergies, adverse drug reactions. Okay? And my recent, blood work. Okay?

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Is there anything here that seems unfamiliar?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
No, everything is fine.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Then I have you scroll up a little bit to somebody else called “recall appointments: that we just passed in this section. Oh, there you go. Okay. What is your understanding of recall appointment.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
I have no idea.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Well, what would be your guess? How would you define it?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
I've never experienced a recall appointment so honestly. I can't say I don't. I've never.
What are they doing? It's not a confirmed appointment, so I don't know what it. I don't really know what a recall appointment are. 

Notetaker: Participant confused by what a “recall appointment” is p.14:

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Okay, sounds like we could provide some clarity around that.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Then we'll.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Yeah, I have no idea what that is.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Then scroll down and look at problem list. What does this information tell you? How would you define this section?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Looking at this, it tells me the issues, the issues that I'm having. Hypertension in looks like how you pronounce it hyperlipidemia So those are my ailments.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:11.000
How, how useful, how useful or not useful, do you find this information, and why?

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Well! It's useful cause. It's listing out what my issues are, what I'm being seeing. Why I'm being seen by a doctor. So it's good to me.

Notetaker: Participant thought the ‘problems list” useful, p. 14:

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
I now have you scroll down to hit “my medication”.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Okay. My medications. Umhm.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.000
There you go! Now review this. You've already seen medications a couple of times earlier in the document. So how would you define this section compared to the other section you've seen?

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Okay, so this is. For me. This is the current, the medication I'm currently taking. That I went over with my doctor, during my visit.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
And then how does this differ to the medication supplies above?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:41.000
This one gives you gives more information as far as the expiration date of the of the prescription, and their number of refills that are left. And who you can call to request, Refill.

Notetaker: Participant correctly identified the difference between “medication & supplies” vs. ‘my medications”, p.15:

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
I'm going to have these troll all the way to the very last gray section. It's called more information. Don't click on it.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
I'm not okay.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000
So before you do before you click on it, What would you expect to find under” more information”?

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Hmm!

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Anything that's not related to what's up above.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Okay.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
So more information.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Go ahead and click on it and review that. Then please share aloud your initial impression.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Oh, so more information! It lists. Another VA. Clinic behavior, health and the colleges more help and information. Okay.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Is there anything you would add or take away from this section?

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
No, I think that's okay.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Okay. So now you've reviewed a full after-visit summary. But maybe there's something in here that made you realize, oh, I want to refer back to another appointment and the after-visit summary there. How would you go about doing that? Can you share your thoughts as you try to complete that task?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Okay, so I'm done reviewing this. But then I thought of something else that I need to refer back to.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Yeah, for another appointment review what was discussed in another month.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Okay, so.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
I will go back to care summary and notes. So I'm clicking on that and then I will scroll until I find what I'm looking for.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:46.000
So! There’s a missions and discharge summary, so we could take a look at that if you wanted to.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Okay, on a scale from one to 5, with one being very easy and 5 being very difficult.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
How easy or difficult was it to navigate to another summary. From another day.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
It was easy.

Notetaker: Participant easily navigated to another AVS using the back button breadcrumb and found another AVS, p, 16.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
And now the next part is, we don't need to prototype anymore. So you can stop sharing your screen, and we can leave it up.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Okay, that's fine.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
The next thing we're talking about is notification. So we're going to have notifications that you might want to receive about your after visit. Summary, so pretend you receive the following message, the subject is new, after the summary and the contents are a summary of your recent. Do you find this notification helpful or not helpful?

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
I find it very helpful.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.000
And why?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Cause. It's letting me know that the summary is available. And it's taking me directly it's taken. Oh, I'm hoping there's a link that's going to take me directly to it within the body of the email.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
How would you prefer to receive this notification?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Email or text messages fine. Either one is fine.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
If you had multiple appointments in one day, would you want one after a visit Summary notification for each appointment that day? Or would you want all the appointments combined into like one email sent to you?

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:32.000
My preference would be if I have multiple appointments on one day, that it all be one email for that. But I'm not sure how the VA Is going to be able to make that happen.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Okay, it's good to know what you would prefer.

Notetaker: Participant finds the AVS notification very useful and would prefer either a email or text message with a link to her AVS; She would prefer one notification for multiple appoints that are on the same day, p. 17:

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Yeah.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000
That that helps us as we're planning things. If you could change one thing about afterwards in summary, what would it be?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:57.000
I can change one thing. Nothing right now.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Okay, how does this compare? Since you've gotten some printed copies and you walked out of your appointment with the printed copy. How does this compare to that?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Less paper is that paper I have to deal with.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:20.000
No, no, no difference in like the information, or like how valuable you think it would be to you, or how you would use it?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
No, I'd be using it the same way.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Is there any?

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
No difference.

Notetaker: Participant finds no difference between a printed AVS vs an Online version, p.18:

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Is there anything that you wanted to share with me today? But after the summary that I didn't already ask you about?

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
No, I think we're good.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Great, then do you have any questions for me? Any other questions?

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Nope!

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Then we really appreciate you taking the time out of your day to share your thoughts with us, your feedback will definitely help us as we continue to work through the site and make sure it really works for veteran before you go.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
I want to make sure that it's clear that everything we did today wasn't real.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
You haven't really accessed the. And then Perigean will be sending you a little.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
You may know, to provide them a chance to participate in future research sessions, just like what we did today.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Okay.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
So thank you so much for your time, and enjoy the rest of your day.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Alright, thenBye.
