00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
No, I actually started the recording. I have you confirm on record that you are comfortable.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If I record my screen and audio is a top today.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Great. No, I think my guess is, are you on a desktop this morning?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That's up. Okay, what? You're actually reviewing is something that is meant for your phone.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I can switch if you want.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Those like when we just you can. If you want to, or we can continue to.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But I was like, just take that into account. This is supposed to be an experience that's on your phone.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Okay.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So I have a couple warm up questions and we're going to that are really about your experience.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Reviewing information about what was discussed during your medical appointment. So first, do you recall receiving paperwork as you have left your appointment or reviewing information online that provide an overview of what occurred during your medical appointment or procedure?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I remember getting it online.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Okay?, why did you review that online?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Usually I'll bring you things, I guess, before an appointment like if I have lab on, or X-rays, or whatever for testing, to see what it actually says.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Alright, and then? Okay, so you're really interested. It sounds like, mostly like the lab results in the different tests.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
If it was an annual I don’t really review, unless I receive lab results. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
No! So I think you've already answered this one you said for annuals.
You don't review it, but for other things you do.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And usually after, like a regular annual. I don't.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Is there a particular appointment, type, or procedure out of all of them that makes you review this paperwork closer compared to other type?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
If I give me a prescription, I'll read that and see side effects.

Notetaker: Participant does not recall getting paperwork after a visit but she typical go online to review before lab work or x-rays. She likes to review the online notes especially after prescribed prescriptions and then likes to look up the side effects of the meds. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Okay? And what would you call her name? This paperwork, or this online thing that you review?


00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I can’t think of a name for it; just an appointment review.

Notetaker: Participant call an AVS an Appointment Review.p, 2:

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Okay.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Next we're I'm actually in show you a prototype of a section of the VA.gov
website so I'm going to send you the link to this perfect.
I'm gonna send it in chat. I don't know if you use chat in zoom before.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Yup!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So I just sent it. If you can load up the prototype and then also screen share, and I can help, if need be, directing you a screen share. Hey? Great! I see your screen. That's what I can follow along as you use the prototype.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So now I'm going to give you a scenario.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We're going to play pretend. So today is June sixth, and you are Hector for this prototype.
So you can see Hector at the top of the screen and you had an appointment this morning at 9 50, with Dr.Nutt, who is your primary care? Physician? It was at the Puget Sound, VA facility. So a few hours to pass since your appointment, and you now forgot what your doctor's instructions were. Can you use the prototype to find out what Dr. Nutt and you discussed at your appointment, and as you are trying to find that, can you talk aloud and share your thoughts?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Or anything, as you're going on.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
My first thought would be to schedule, manage appointments, but already had it.
So it's not really scheduling it, but I don't see anything else that would be relevant.

Notetaker: Participant was confused by scheduled and manages appointments since she already had but she chose Appointments anyways since she didn’t scroll far enough down to see other options such as care and summaries, She was slightly confused but she chose the past link to find June 6th appointment p,3:

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Is this like? I don't know. Are we going by what today's date is?
Or is this up moving? Oh, there we go, press!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Again. We're yeah. We're looking for June 6, with Dr. Nutt.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Okay. Now that you've gotten here, can I ask you to take your time and review this whole page and then share your overall impressions again? Talk a lot as you're reviewing.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Well, that. And it's I mean, I guess. I feel like there’s two appointments at two different clinics. Sometimes I look at these things like the after appointment reviews ha, I don’t remember them saying that.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:06:00.000
We're also. Sometimes you look at it, and they've not necessarily updated things like medication. The temperature in Celsius is not helpful for me.

Notetaker: Participant mentioned that metric system is not helpful, p. 4:


00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Oh, your audio all of a sudden. It's a little hard to understand.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Okay, I was saying that the metric system things I've been like, oh, I got to go get a converter for that.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Yes, it is currently displaying a metric.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Whatever my doctor said I'd seen my head details here.
There's like a message part of the prototype that's not hooked up right now.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So what do you use or not use this page? And why?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Okay, wide a few weeks. It seems like it took quite a few clicks to get here to get here. I feel like if it was just a I just had an appointment, and I'm login. I feel like it should be more accessible like, Oh, you're just logging up appointment, you just want to get your last appointment information. Versus having to go click, click, click,  oh here it is.
You're more likely to say. Never mind, it's just whatever not deal with it. Especially like if it's one day it could be like, I can't find this. Yes, I feel like. So it was easier to find, and it was, and those are linked to this page.

Notetaker: When asked if she would use the AVS, participant thought it was too much clicking to get to review information on an appointment she just had. She thought she won’t bother unless it was easier to get to.


00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Would you use this like the information on this page? Do you find useful or not? Useful.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Yes. And what? Like, I said, when you get to your stats. Maybe you didn't remember what your weight is, and whatever that is, I think I didn't. I think the treatment on this on this would be helpful, because you're saying what's your follow-up? Maybe you're going to get a phone call for an appointment. And you don’t know what it is  you’re like I don’t know what you talking about. Why are you calling me so? This to be like, Oh, yeah, we talked about this issue.

Notetaker: Participant thought the information was useful to serves as a reminder if she forgot what was discussed during the appointment, p5:

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Now, what have you scroll back up to the top? That first accordion that you were first looking at I'm gonna ask some specific questions in there. Now for just this, where it says your appointment on June 6. Everything in there can you provide an example of how you might utilize the information just within this section?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
You know your appointment I assume you’ve met your primary care doctor. We have been. Roughly, I don't know that we're and frequently. 

And then, are there any terms that seem unfamiliar or confusing to you within the section?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Oh, I feel like that! The clinic with the colors might be confusing if you're not aware that you're assigned like a by color. You're like. I don't know what that means. I don't have any idea what color I am. That one.

Notetaker: Participant was confused by the clinic color terminology used (Clinic: Purple),p.5:

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Now, I'm gonna have you focus particularly on the you are diagnosed with section.
Can you provide a definition of what you think is included within this?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Like what it means in regular people’s terms?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Yeah, what does that mean to you when you're reviewing this? How do you interpret that?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Like what it means like hypertension is high blood pressure, I believe,  Hyperlipidemia, that sounds like something with the fat,  too much fat, that I don't know, and the rest of it I'd be tobacco. Use it would be helpful if there was a link to what these mean.That would be helpful.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Okay. Now, what if the title of this whole section was called Health Conditions you discussed?
how would you define what you expect to the section that's called that versus what you're seeing here.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I think that sounds more proactive. Because then it sounds like you've actually talked about it now, just like, you know, I haven't thought yet. You’ve got a it's like it's conditions we talked about, because it's something we can do about it versus Just you have this.


00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Now, how valuable or not valuable do you find the section? And why?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:46.000
As it is like, I said, just a list of conditions the next time you go to Docker you say, Yup, I'll doesn't really give you any. I mean, like pointers product name depending on where you can even do about the pain to make it better. And the same thing if I'm in. D, okay, I didn't see that I get a vitamin D supplement.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Now, what if it was health condition you discussed how valuable or not valuable would you find that section?


00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Well, what can I be doing to get more ready? I guess I think the action items to me, anyway, would be helpful. And again, what does this mean? Or maybe the doctor won't have any idea what they said be able to say, oh, yeah, that's the bye, high blood pressure. What are the actual step to lower that , if you’re here already, Maybe you'd want to learn how to manage your issues.

Notetaker: Participant didn’t understand that the “you were diagnosed with” sections was the issues that were discussed during the June 6th appointment she expected to get actions items in this section on how to manage your issues, p6: 

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Okay. Can you scroll down to section now? It says medications ordered for administration and click.There you go. Okay, what's the information under this section mean to you?How would you define it?

Notetaker: Participant was confused by what PO means. She thought that the Rx was to be given only once.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Well, so you got Tylenol essentially on like once, so like I would take it once. I don't know what means II would say something oral. Okay. Maybe I don't know, but I don't know what the PO means. Per day? Me looking at that prescription makes not know what that means.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Now, what if I told you this section displays medications that you actually took while you were at your appointment? What do you think of reviewing that information?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
That would make sense. That it says once.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Okay, now, I'm going to have you actually click on where it says, what do these medication terms mean? And then can you share your thoughts or comments on what you're seeing here?
And how useful or not useful. Do you find the information within this dropdown?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I know from experience that you can get a non-VA prescription turned into a VA prescription.
So I think that would be helpful. No insurance or outside insurance if we need to cover it.
Unfortunately for that, that would maybe be helpful to make some thing. Would you like to transfer your subscription to VA. then How? And then it also helps make your VA file more complete, because then they're aware of what else you are  taking.

Notetaker: Participant understood what active prescriptions meant, p. 7:


00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Now we're gonna go to the next accordion section, that where it says your treatment plan from this appointment, so can you like take some time and review that whole entire section and talk aloud again.I know you reviewed it a little bit earlier, but take a detailed look and let us know what you think of this section.And how would you utilize the information in this section?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I think again what might be helpful is what is Rheumatology, I don’t know what that is and who’s that for?I don't know if that is, or look at. And so am I getting imaging? First one says by now, with telephone imaging, it's just this contact. If I'm not fasting, And renewed, but you don’t know why you’re taking it.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Okay. So you would want a description of what diagnosis that actually treats or is. Not necessarily like the generic, like, boilerplate 3 page thing. but your doctor described this because of whatever but you know what it's related to, and even maybe like, what are the contraindications? I don't take it in the Morning. Take it at night. Don't take it when you're driving like basic information about it.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Okay, so this is, you would want a lot more detail, really, into your medications then what we're showing it.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And even those most medications are generic. And then there's the problem name, and I'm like, Oh, I remember on the other. But I don't know.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Now, what are your thoughts on the difference of what is shown in this medication? Section versus the one that we talked about it. Further up on the page.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Well, this one's one of these medication terms, mean. Okay. Okay, that's the same thing. So I was thinking, the medication what they are. Just.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So how valuable or not valuable do you find this medication section to be?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Unless somebody is asking for a list of of your medications is, I don’t find this pertinent.

Notetaker: Participant didn’t understand the difference between the first two medications section and thus didn’t find it useful p. 8:


00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Okay.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I've got multiple issues.



00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Now I'm gonna ask you to continue to scroll down the rest of the section and talk aloud is review the rest of the information.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
1 Second I got a call coming in.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Oh, I think your audio again. It's starting to.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Okay.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Yeah, yeah, if you can review the rest of this section and talk aloud and share your thoughts.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Well, it's not, and if you want to.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:57.000
That but me. Looking at this, I don't. Call dr Smith when return from Seattle are, but there no phone number to call.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Your audio is a little choppy right now. I don't know.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I'm sure. Probably a phone number. Can you hear me?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
It's still.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Hmm!

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Better, now.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Yeah.




00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Okay. Next I'll have you go to the your health information as of this appointment section.And open that up, and we'll do the similar thing that we've done in the other section to those heavy review. Everything under that accordion and talk aloud as you're reviewing.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I don’t know what Pre White Teamlet means, Yes, these are all the people that are signed under my doctor, which I may or may not actually see.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:15.000
And I'll stop you on this section. How would you define what a recall point in it?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Sounds like standby cancellation point like I wanna get in.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:39.000
And how helpful or not helpful is this information just related to the recall appointment?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Again… there’s no Phone number to call.

Notetaker: Participant understands recall appointment to be a standby appoinemnt for when she wants to get in, but doesn’t find that section helpful because there is no number for her to call.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I'm going to ask you to continue going down and reviewing. And now I'm gonna stop you on the you can review appointment and stuff, and then I'll stop you on the problem with and ask about that, too.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:14.000
One question again, knowing that's one question, very. I'm saying we should be taking it at the same time.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Okay, do you want a little more detail? Now we're into the problem with, how would you?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Okay, so.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:54.000
How would you define what is found within the problem list?

Unable to discern what Participant said due to audio issues.
00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
And how useful or not useful. Do you find the information in the section of line?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:12.000
You got it so I don't see it.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And now I'm gonna have you again keep scrolling down and commenting on what you need to.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Hmm! Okay. Even like the smoking status. I mean, maybe because obviously they don't want you to smoke. Maybe we have a little link there to no cessation classes or how to quit? Or would you like to quit?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:22.000
If we have a drug reaction? Nothing, what reality? The actual causes?No severity in the reaction.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Awesome experience that you can get lab results before you see your doctor cause you're like, I don't know what this means.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Yes.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Yeah, so it's hard to interpret how this actually impacts you is what what I'm hearing is that isn't staying in tie.

Notetaker: Participant finds it difficult to interpret whats the Problems list is for,p11.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
What does that actually mean to you?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Like is that we need to. I'm happy so that we know.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:28.000
As I didn't fast.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
I mean sometimes, like most sodium. That's normally low.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Or maybe they might. They're no.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
And for the medication section here I'm going to stop you and ask you particularly, just for this.
And what's displayed? My medication? How would you?
Define this section. What 1 min are shown here, and versus we show medication tire up on the page, too. So how does this differ to the other section?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
I feel like. That's why is medication license?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:51.000
That medication was, is redundant it should be the medications list.

Notetaker: Participant does distinguish the difference between my medications in the problems’ list and the other medication list, she feels it is redundant,p. 12:

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
It's more like the pharmacy. Again. If you've got one thing listed, we have.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:17.000
I don't know where to find this information, and more like me again, just like whatever.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Maybe this one says.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
But it doesn't give me. That's the.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.000
That's just yeah. That's as part of the prototype. There would be an actual number.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000
The same lines. What am I taking this for?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:58.000
So with what is currently displayed. How would you utilize or not utilize this section?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
You guys have the description of it, which, again may be.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Foxy things to take every day so that's what this one is.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000
So that's the only reason I'll remember anymore.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:46.000
No. Have you continue on and review the rest of the information? That's actually we can talk a lot.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
And what would you expect to just show in here?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:31.000
No longer take, why would it be an active status if I'm not taking it while I have it.Since it is non-VA.

Notetaker: Participant is confused as to why the status says active if she is no longer taking the medicine , p.13:

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And then next we're going to go to the last section where it says more information.
If you can open that up and review it, and share your thoughts as you review.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Oh, is that I didn't quite hear that part.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Or is this my follow up appointment? What would you want to show up here?
Again. I don't like having to. I feel like it should be worn.All of this information should be, we at the top, where we were at upcoming appointments.

Notetaker: Participant is confused why her follow-up appointment is under More information,p.13: 

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Okay.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I'm not going to I don't know what my point is, I've got an appointment on, you know. Tuesday. At this point we're that clinic.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
So this, in your opinion, the relate to where you were for this appointment, and it should be up top.


00:29:46.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Yes, if I've got a number over here, then it should say that upcoming appointments.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Is there anything that seems unclear or confusing in this section? Besides the fact that do you think that what you've already commented on that the location should be moved?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Have phone numbers. But the phone numbers the same. I'm betting there's an extension that's not again.I don't want to. Of things and realized I clicked on Button. And now I got to get back all over and figure out how to actually reach maybe route.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:45.000
The extension.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Is there anything you would add or take away from this more information? Section?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
And again. I don't want theoretical thing. Okay, when I get to the second floor, is it gonna be clear? What behavior is it the entire second floor, or am I going to have to walk around? And you know, for indefinitely?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Okay.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:26.000
So like a hospital, 30 offices up there, or is it outpatient living by the fourth floor you've got cardiology.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Whatever. And it's 2 options.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
The more clear instructions on exactly where to go.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Okay.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
No, I'm actually going to have you pretend. So you reviewed one full after visit  summary.
But now it's pretend that you want to go. You had a question about another appointment that you had. And you want to review your after visits summary for that appointment. So how would you go find another after this?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:26.000
My first thought of just hit the back button.

Notetaker: Participant used the back button on the bread crumbs to navigatge to another AVS, p. 15.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Actually keeps that like to. You can pick any appointment.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Okay? Are they skill from one to 5, one being very easy and 5 being very difficult. How easy! Or difficult was it to navigate to another summary from another day?

Notetaker: Participant said it was a 1, very easy to navigate to another AVS.
 

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Now I'm going to have you go back to the list.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
It looked like with all the appointments that page, with all of them.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Okay on this. How would you describe what you're seeing under the past link?

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
And what like don't actually click on this when I ask the question.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:28.000
But what do you expect to see if you click on the “upcoming” link?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Appointments already Scheduled.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000
And then again, don't click on it. But what would you expect to see if you clicked on the pending link?

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Yeah.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:00.000
So you're going to call back to confirm,-that might be under pending.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Pending Appointments.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Now we're going to move on. We're done with actual prototype.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:12.000
So even close that, or you can leave that up either way.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And we're going to talk about notification, which is you brought that up earlier on about you would want to link just to see get you directly into the after visit summer. So we're going to talk about that. I'm going to have you pretend that you received the following message, so the subject would be new after visit Summary and the contents would be a summary of your recent appointment is now available on my healthy bed login to view the summary.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Do you find this notification helpful or not helpful? And why?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:53.000
I think I'll focus again if you're looking at a question.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:02.000
How would you prefer to receive the notification?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Okay.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.000
And then if you had multiple appointments in one day, would you want one notification for each of appointment that day, or would you want all the appointments? Combined into one after visit. Summary notification.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:32.000
I think it would depend on if they were multiple, like, example multiple doctors in …., or if I also had, lab work or imaging done. 

So what can you tell me what you would want me to the scenarios then? 

I think I'd want to like a regular like talk to doctor Visit notification. But if I had labs or imaging, I'd have a separate one.

Notetaker: Participant said that the amount of notifications received depended on whether it’s a doctors appointment or whether were labs or imaging, p. 16:

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Now, if you can change one thing about what you saw today for the after visits. Summary. What would it be?

Notetaker: Transcripts were unable to pick-up what Participant said about changing 1 thing on AVS because it wasn’t audible, p.17.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
And overall, with everything you've seen today related after AVS summary. Could you?
Share your like basic. What is your overview, or like your overall thoughts on what you saw?

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
There was a lot of information,  but felt like, Get all of what you're looking for,
You’vevgot multiple place to get what you’re looking for. again that this goes back to the redundancy. I shouldn't have to go. If I'm looking the prescription information, I shouldn't have to go to 3 different spots and find prescription information.

Notetaker: Participant belived that the medication sections were redundant and she shouldn’t have to go to three different sections to find a list of all her prescriptions’, p17:

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.000
And my very last question. Do you have any questions for me?

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Thank you for joining us today and taking the time to share your thoughts.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Your feedback will definitely help us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Before you go. I definitely wanted to just reiterate that everything we did today wasn't real, and you haven't really accessed the ad, which is the prototype and Perry Jane will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:11.000
To other veterans. You may know, to provide them the chance to participate in these feature research studies.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:20.000
So thank you so much, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
