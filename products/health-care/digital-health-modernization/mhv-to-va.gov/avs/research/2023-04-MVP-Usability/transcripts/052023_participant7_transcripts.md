00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let me hit the button. Then.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay. Now, the recording started. Can I have you confirm on the recording that?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Is we talk tonight.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yes.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now we'll get so we'll start by trying to learn more about your experience.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Reviewing information about what was discussing during your medical appointment.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So first, do you every recall receiving paperwork as you've left an appointment or reviewing information online, that kind of provided an overview of what occurred during that appointment or procedure.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Yes, if I ask.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Okay. Now, what particular information or content in that paperwork that you reviewed?
What did you review? So when you're looking at that paper? What type of content was there? 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Oh, yeah, I always get a copy after my annual of my lab results. I like to look over my lab results, and I like to have a copy of it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Is there any other appointment type that you found reviewing this information valuable?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
When they do, when I, when they outside, outsource me to a community care provider. I like to keep that information.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now? What if you haven't given name to that paperwork? What would you call it?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What the community care provider?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Well, no. t=The overview of what occurred during your medical appointment. What would you? What name would you give that?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
A review of medical records.

Notetaker: Participant receives paperwork of her lab results during her annual visit, she like to review those lab results. She pays special attention to the paperwork when she sees a community care provider. She would call that paperwork “a review or medical records”,p. 2.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now, I'm actually going to have you. We're going to get into the prototype part. So first I'm going to ask if yeah, it's possible if you can share your screen, and then I will send you a link to the prototype that way.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We could watch you actually interact with it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Great. Okay, hold on now. I will send in the zoom chat. I'll send you the link, so let me bring up Chat.

00:02:22.000 -->00:06:52.000
Redacted due to participant having technical issues with Zoom Screen Share.


00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Use these instructions…use this prototype to find out what does Dr. Nutt, and you discussed at your appointment. Now, as you're doing this talk aloud, share your thoughts.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So if, my doctor, so you're asking me. So my doctor gave me some instructions that I forgot, and what would I do to find out what he said? II would call the clinic and ask them, and if she probably couldn't speak to me, then. But have a nurse call me back, and she could tell me.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Okay. Now. If I you do, you use my healthy vet, currently.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I do. But for something like that I would probably just call the nurse so I could send a message.

Notetaker: Participant does use My HealtheVet, but if she forgot what her provider instructed her to do after the appointment, she would call the office to get the information, p.3:

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Okay. Now, you are looking at my healthy, but trying to see if you could find this on my healthy Vet, too.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Find What?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
The summary of what you talk to your doctor about. So where? Just navigate through here? Where would you think it would show up?And see if you can find it.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Probably in my health history.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.000
You can click on that and see where it takes you.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Okay. And so, what am I supposed to do?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Keep looking.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
For what? I don't understand don’t understand what I’m supposed to do

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
The summary of the discussion with you and your doctor.

Notetaker: Participant navigated to Health history and chose the review your care summaries and notes and chose June 6th, p. 3.


00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Oh, all over here. Location? Well, I don't know what location this is, what location.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Alright! I'll give you a for the scenario.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
June sixth, hey, was 9:50, with Dr. Nutt. Okay. Now that you're here, I'm actually going to have you. If you could scroll through this page and take a look and share as you're reviewing again, talk aloud and share your overall impressions of what you're seeing here.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Hmm! Well, it seems to have.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So did I have two appointments with Dr. Nutt. I had a 9:50, and an 11:30? Oh, that's a lab.
Okay. I had a plan. I had a lab. It tells me his name, his credentials. Oh, boy, I don't like these diagnoses. But yeah, these are my diagnoses. But this is just a hypothetical person. Correct.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
This is a hypothetical person. This is not your information at all.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Yeah, this person has a lot going on. Awesome. I know so, but it tells you kind of what's going on, which is always good to know if you know that way, you can start taking measures. Oh, tell me! My blood pressure, pulse. Probably my heart rate, respiration. Oh, height. Wait. Okay, in kilograms. I should probably put weight in pounds.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Yeah, yeah. Height and weight I know medically, science is all metric, they usual do both metric and US. So the height and weight should be in US, because some people may not know even.
Though always good. Oh, your body mass fat, okay, and what’s my pain threshold was today. What procedures they did on me! Okay, it's very comprehensive. Medical all medications ordered. Okay, and administered. Okay, so these are the medications. So this is just this one medication. Okay? Treatment, plan. Consultation. So he's referring me to a Rheumatologist.
And for some procedures and imaging procedures. I'm guessing. These are like MRIs, some additional lab testing. Medication is supplies. Okay, healthy reminders. Let's check with that also. This is when I had a flu shot. This person had their flu shot.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Is that what you think it is? Is that your interpretation of what you're saying?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
You know I don't know, because this is not a me.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
What they'll ask. What would you want to `see?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So I'm just kind of over gloss in this stuff. So since this is what was when, when was the appointment?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
June sixth.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Oh, June sixth. So this is okay. Yeah. When I have my flu shot, or, yeah.
So it's probably going to list shots, vaccines, things like that prior  medications for issues for prior illnesses. Yeah, what is this?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Deployment screen. Okay? Other instructions. Call Doctor Smith, and you return.
From the Seattle area. Some sort of follow up as of this a disappointment. Okay?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So unless the team, unless the schedule appointment appointments in the next 13 months, August 23, Recall appointments. Problem list, so problem list are things that should be high on the radar to try to get it on a control or eliminate. So it doesn't exacerbate into something more serious.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So the hypertension and hyperlipemia. What is this hypo but academia? I'm not even sure what that is. What is that? What is this? I don't know what this is.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:10.000
That is Hi. I want to say.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So it, you know I'm a to back.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Actually let's go back. Let me stop you on ”problem list” did you  and comment on that?
How, with how you define what's actually in that section, how useful or not useful. Do you find this information?


00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Well, I'm not that, you know, and this thing tobacco users so.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Oh, I would find it very useful, because I would understand this. Of course, if this was me, I would know kind of what's going on, I would hope, and if somebody, doesn't, if somebody just has no idea what's going on with their body, if they can read, and I'm sure they can. This will explain a lot, and you know, like, I don't know what this is, but if someone tell me you have hypo, I would Google this because I don't really know what that is.

Notetaker: Participant found the “problems’ list” for very useful to reference what is going on, p. 6:

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Okay.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So I would have asked my doctor if they saw you. Have. What is hyper? Lipidemia sounds like fat, you know, but II would get clarification on that cause.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I'm not sure what it is. So if that's a problem, what is the problem?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So I know hypertension but that is how that's a problem.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Smoking status. Yeah, that's a problem if you smoke cigarettes, immunizations.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Yeah.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Okay, yeah, I find this very useful. What immunizations you have?
Because, yeah, they keep those records. Anyway, the some travel, some jobs just nowadays. They want you to be vaccinated for certain things.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Allergies and average drugs. That's very good in case you end up in a hospital or a case I don't know they do something. It's good to know what they know you're allergic to, so they don't give you something. Give you that will give you something that will work well with whatever that is. Yeah, I think this is very helpful. Recent lab results’, this is very helpful.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Great. So my next question is, Oh, go ahead!

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:19.000
This is this, this is a new phone app or?


00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
This is something. If this is not built yet on Va, this is something we're getting feedback on first, before we actually would release it.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.000
But if this for me, if you're going to put it on the phone, I probably would not use it on the phone, because I just don't put a lot of stuff on my phone. I mean, there's enough on my phone already. I go through my healthy Vet and things like that.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.000
But if this was an app I can pull up on my desktop. Then, yeah, I would look at this, but on my phone. No, I no.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Okay, so this was part of the web experience on my help, you bet.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Then you would use it. Okay?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Yes, yes, I would only use it on my phone if for some reason I'm somewhere on vacation, and somebody, you know, needs to know something medically about me. Then I may pull this app up, or I don't remember something about the doctor's office, but to keep it on my phone 24.
So I, personally would not do it, but I know a lot of people do use things like this on their phone, not just me.

Notetaker: Participant like the information in the June 6th sections but she stressed that she would not use this on her phone unless she was traveling and needed to refer to it otherwise she prefers to use this on a desktop, p.7:

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
My Va supplies. Okay? Huh? So this app will have everything which is good.
Medications you are not taking. So why would you have medications I am not taking cause. That could be an extensive list.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Well, why, I'll turn the question back to you.


00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Well! Can you think of any scenarios that you might want to see this, or it would be useful to you?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Well, if someone has hypertension, it's several I know it's several I don't know how many may even be dozens of different medications someone can take to help control hypertension. Their blood pressure, so they may be on one and not the other, so I don't. I don't understand why this would be here unless somebody has. Oh, let me see, if I could think of something.
If someone has some disease, and I'm just going to make a hypothetical situation. Say, if somebody has some sort of blood disease, and there's a medication that they could take that may help them with their blood disease. But for whatever reasons they don't want to take it, maybe put that on there. Maybe but then it gets to wire. Why are they not taking it?
Does it make them sick? Do they just not want to build a lot of pills? Is it a new drug? They want to learn more about? I mean?

Notetaker: Participant didn’t understand the purpose of the “medications your are not taking” she finds no purpose in that, p. 8.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:02.000
So II don't know how. I don't know the benefit of medications.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Bye!

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
You are not taking. I just I don't understand that.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Yeah.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
I'll share a scenario and get your feedback on it.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
I don't know if you also see, I'll look at the thing.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
I don't know if you also see doctors outside of the Va.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
So maybe right. Your Va. Medical appointment, and you decided not to take this medication anymore.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000
If I don't know if you would need to share that with your non va doctors.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
What are your thoughts on that?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Hmm! Well  [Redacted for PII] Bloomington, are you in Indiana? Are you someplace? Else?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I am not in Indiana. Nope.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Okay. So the main one is Indianapolis. But Bloomington has a clinic. But the Indianapolis is the big umbrella, but they outsource to different medical providers. In the Bloomington area for convenience, and because I think some doctors, some of the some types of doctors. They do not have in the Indiana clinic or singularly down in Bloomington. So when I go se e, my providers here, at least in this area, it's [Redacted for PII]. That's the hospital here. So it's like, since I've been through. VA, at least for me. All of my records kind of go together, because when the VA outsources me to a primary care when I was working, I had VA as my primary
As my Primary care here, but  I would tell my doctor, and it would be, and then sometimes, if you're in a hospital, if you're sick, maybe you can't tell them. Cause you're not able to, but it was. It would be in the record already, at least for me.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Okay.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:58.000
I'm really up on my healthcare. Perhaps I think this could maybe be good for someone that is not as proactive in their healthcare, for whatever reasons. Maybe they're not mentally cognizant to be up on everything, or they just don't want to do it, or whatever.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:18.000
So for someone like that, I could maybe see if someone has high blood pressure, and they're not taking anything to help.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Olivier their high blood pressure. Then I guess it may be noting the client has high blood pressure and is not taking any high blood pressure medicine, but I don't know how you could list all those medications because it's several many.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Now that you kind of taking a first pass and glance at this page, I'm gonna ask you, did Dr.
Nutt, if you can remember, there's a lot of information here. Did the doctor not want you to complete or do anything following your appointment.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:00.000
I remember he wanted me to see somebody when I get to Seattle, go back to Seattle. I think Doctor Smith and Mr. Smith, I remember that. I'm guessing that do you want me to do some other things? I just don't remember.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Okay, I will have you scroll to the top again, and we'll actually go through section by section.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:18.000
We'll go up to that first accordion where it's gray, and it's says your appointment. On June sixth.
So just the information in this first section. If you can take another path at it and as you're reviewing it, let me know 2 things. If you can provide an example, how you might utilize the information in this section, and then 2. Stop if there's anything unfamiliar, confusing, and let me know about that.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Well, I will put in my calendar when the appointment is in my lab, but I will also check to see if that's a fasting run, not fasting lab, because that makes a difference. And it tells me who it's with Dr. Nutt and his nurse. they all have a nurse, and the reason for my appointment.
Hypertension. So that's the main reason. But everything kind of goes together anyway.
So during this appointment with Dr. Knutt, he diagnosed me with these issues.

Notetaker: Participant understood that on the June6th section that Dr. Knutt Diagnosed her with the information contained there, p.10.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Okay.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Okay. So that's how you would find. So that section right? There is everything he diagnosed you with that appointment. Is that? Is that correct? Is that what you just said? So?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
If you could define it. Is that how you would define that section?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.000
`Yes, and some of this stuff. I was. Probably this person was probably already diagnosed with like, I'm guessing they were smoking before, so they were probably still smoking. But you know they do this health history on you when you go to your appointments. So you're diagnosed with hypertension hypothesis, chronic pain.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Yeah, these are the issues that he found today. Some of them might have been there prior. But just to kind of integrate.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Now, what if we named the section health condition you discussed? Is that clear or less clear? Then what you're seeing here?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Well, how's this? Health conditions you discussed. That's a little different than what you're diagnosed with diagnosis kind of like you have this. So health conditions you discussed, you could say a health condition would be, breath is bad and teeth are yellow because you smoke. But that's that's not a diagnosis smoking as a smoker. Do you know what I mean?
Those sounds like 2 that sounds like 2 different sections to me.

Notetaker: Participant thinks that “health conditions that you discussed” is different from “ you were diagnosed with, p.11:

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
No! How would you compare the value of those 2 sections?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Is one more valuable, 1 one less valuable. And why?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Well for me, I would say them that valuable because I'm doing everything I can to correct my health and to get healthier.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
So the more information, the better. That's me. II don't know if other people think that.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
That's why we're talking to a whole bunch of people.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:15.000
You can continue to scroll through this section again, provided any stop on anything that cans confusing, and talk aloud, and share how you might use the.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
So I love it, that you know I always ask, because that comes on my lab reports my blood pressure.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Are you? I'll ask them to write it down My blood pressure, my pulse, and all that stuff temperature that's good. But see once again, I think temperature hiding weight should be ought to be metric in the US System as well cause, then I have to convert 30 36.4 degrees. Celsius. Okay, what does that relate to in Fahrenheit, you know? Body, mass. I think body mass is good, but I think body mass, cause I don't really remember those numbers.
I think you should have somewhere on here, cause there's you know, you have all these, you know, whatever for body mass. I think you should list those. So people say, Oh, okay, I'm 28.5 6, and I fall into such a wage because I don't remember the ranges.

Notetaker: Participant wants the definition of what the ranges of body mass means, p.12:

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Okay.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Pain. I think that I think that's self explanatory, because it's usually out of 10.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Usually, at least. Yeah, procedures. This is what they did it. Ultrasound.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Okay. Medications ordered for administration and clinic. So this is the medication they gave me in the clinic which I'm guessing.This is what I had. But if for some reason I didn't have anything, would just say not or Na!

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:48.000
So particularly related to this medication section. What do you think about reviewing that information?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Like, I said. For me it's good cause I was, you know. I always wanted to know what pill I'm taking. What are you sticking me with? What are you rubbing on me? And if I were to forget like, wait a minute. They gave me a shot. Would they give me a shot for it? I could go back and look.
Notetaker: Participant understood that the medications administered in the clinic was the med taken during the visit and she finds that useful because she wants to know what was given to her during the visit.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Okay.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
So II would find that but once again I would use a computer.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
I would not use a telephone.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Now I'm actually going to have you click on where it says within that medication section there's a link. What do you use medication terms mean? You can click on that and open it up and review that and provide your thought. Okay. Active. But it doesn't tell me what this medication is.


00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Okay.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:04.000
It just tells me, active and not active, which I think that's good. But I think also, if you're gonna put that whatever medications that someone was given, yeah at the clinic. This?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
You would want more education on what that medicine actually is.


00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
And what is yeah? And what is geared for.

Notetaker: Participant wants to know what the mediation is and what is it for, and had no opinion on active or inactive, p13:


00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:23.000
So why did they give it to me? We gave Paste in a shock to help alleviate pain and die, or to reduce a headache, or whatever you know, to lower the blood pressure to get the urine flowing, or something? Yeah, I think it would be good if you listed what the medication is.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
So if we had that educational materials, in addition to these terms, how useful are useful?
Would you find this the Glossary?

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
The active and not active, I find kind of useful to me. It could go away. It's okay. It's good.
It's okay that it's there. But if it's not there, II don't see that as an issue, at least for me.
But I would like to have a definition of the medication.I was prescribed. Why, what it's for. Yeah.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:16.000
No worries. Grey section. So your treatment plan from this appointment I know you already reviewed this as well.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
But have you take a look? One more time again letting me know the George.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Down here. I'm sorry. Where am I going?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Oh!

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Okay.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Your treatment. Plan. There you go right there. So that section under there review it and let me know again. How would you utilize the information? And then, if you see anything confusing, they can stop and let me know too.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:53.000
No, this is good. He's putting in a rheumatology consultation, letting me know that I'm going to be contacted, you know, by phone for an appointment if they don't reach me, then they sent out a letter. Imaging no orders. Okay. So I'm going to be consultation for Rheumatology and imaging I'm going to have cat scan and MRI. And then they're going to tell me. What they're going to do. Okay? Alright, I think that's good.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Okay. You keep going. Keep scrolling and reviewing.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Lab tests. Okay, that's good to know. No longer need to fast before most labs.
These reports. So these are labs that I'm going to be set up with as well correct. Are they? I think it would help if you say blood and or urine lab.
Notetaker: Participant wants a distinction between a blood or urine lab. And prefers to see the info on fasting, p. 14;

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Okay.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:13.000
And where are they? Gonna let you know if it's fasting, cause it says patient no longer needs to fast, for most laps I guess it depends on the test, though.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
They'll let you know like this particular test. You do need to fast.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
That you would prefer what I'm hearing is you refer that information in here.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
If we could provide it.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
If they're going to set me up for lapse, and they already know we're going to see you.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
We're going to check for this. We're going to check for A, BCD.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:50.000
It's gonna be blood on urine, and you don't have to fast, or it is a fasting lab, because one of the Abcd blood tests is a fasting way. I think that would kind be helpful because then I think most people for fasting labs like to have them. In the morning.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Hmm!

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
So they don't have to stay hungry throughout the day.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Now, I'm actually going to stop you on the medications which is up next. If you could provide a definition of what you see here in this medication section, how would you define? Define them.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Only list changes. The medication. Okay?

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Now we saw another medication list earlier on which were ones that were administered in the clinic. How to share your thoughts on the existence of both of these medication sections.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Well to me if this administered in a clinic is just a one time thing, or maybe to get you going.
So maybe I don't know. Maybe you have a fever and they're going to give me something to bring your fever down. You know, need that all the time. So to me, a medication in a clinic is a one time thing, or maybe to get you going if you're going to start something. That's how I see it.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Now for this section, though how valuable or not valuable do you find the information?

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Alright! We'll have that right.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
What do these medication terms mean? I don't…. So is this what the what? My medication has been changed to? II don't really understand that. So.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
What would you want this to show?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Well, if it okay. The so the question is, only list changes to your medication.
Yeah. So, if I'm on a medication and they're increasing or decreasing the dosage, I think that should go here or if I've been on a medication for a while, and then they're saying you can stop taking this medication. You no longer need to take it. I think that would be helpful for a while, or if they've changed it, say what you want medication for this issue. But we're going to just take you off a medication. And now put you on the medication cause, you may have better results. Something like that.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Okay, so there's 3 different types of changes. Thank you.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Yeah, yeah, I think in these to be more specific, I don't really understand what this is saying.
I don't. Yeah. And it yeah, and the milligrams, or whatever that's good, you know.
Yeah, changes. You know, 230 milligrams. Hi, SA tablet, or whatever yeah, or change could be, instead of once a day, twice a day, or 2, or twice a day, once a day.

Notetaker: Participant would like it clearly specified what the changed medication was for and why was it changed, p. 16:


00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
You? Yeah. So you can continue on to review the rest of the section.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
So other orders. Nurse blood pressure check. Okay, so I'm sort of go back in. Have the nurse check my blood pressure. Health reminders. So these are health reminders that they just kind of send out like they sent out the flu shot. The pneumonia shot, just to make you aware.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Yeah, what? What do you think about what's shown here?And sharing that information in this summary.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Well, health reminders. Is that just general information? Your health reminders, health check. They are specific to you, and you are the ones that you morning. They're in the list of things that you can do. That's good. So if I'm up for my attendees shot, it's been 10 years. I think that would be nice.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
That I'll have you actually. Now get to the next gray section. Your health information as in this appointment. I know you again. You took a peek at this, but we're going to go into more detail, and I'll ask them questions. So start to scroll and again talk aloud, and the same thing to the other section. How might you utilize this information, and then is anything unfamiliar or confusing?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Help information from? Okay, give me the date.
Tells me who I saw the whole team. Okay, my next upcoming. Appointment, the date with who my primary care, where? Okay. Recall appointments. 9. Confirmed appointments.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000
So. Yes, what does that mean to you? What is the recall appointment?

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
I don't know, it's kind of confusing to me. They're not confirmed. I will receive a reminder three weeks before the recall day, to call and request the appointment so that's like appointments coming up. So say, if I go, you have to go every 4 months. Say you have your blood pressure checked. Would that be like a recall appointment?

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Would that if that's what this was. Would that be of interest to you to see?

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Yeah, I think, recall appointments are appointments that someone has to come in multiple times for something. Maybe they need to come in weekly for their blood pressure. Maybe they're very obese in their own. Some, you know, diet medication, and they need to come in every 2 weeks to be weighed, or they have some blood issue, or you know, they need to have their blood drawn every 2 weeks to check or something like that just to kind of remind people because life gets busy. I think it should be just. Yeah. The date appointment. Notes, hey, blood pressure 3 times per week, and right in journal, brain journal with you. That's good. Problem, list, okay?
Notetaker: Participant believes that recall appointments are regularly scheduled interval appointments that one has to come in for a blood pressure check, a weight check-in, or bloodwork, ect. She said she’d like to have a section that reminds her of such appointments, p.18:


00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Yeah, no. We already talked about that earlier. Okay, so problem lists, things that you really need to problems. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding! You know your hypertension hyper, smoking status. No, that's just so. It's only two problems. Okay, I would think smoking would be in the problem list. Also, since they know smoking, it's just like excessive drinking, or somebody, you know. You can tell whether they drink a lot. I think something like that should be, yeah.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:31.000
I also think in the problem list, If someone has like obvious, or they have like emotional or anxiety issues that causes a lot of physical things they say, Oh, I'm so stressed. I'm some stress. I'm so stressed, whatever that can. I think that's.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Okay, you want to see mental diagnoses visible.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Well, that's I don't. It's not so much a diagnosis, it’s a problem like hypertension is a problem.
If somebody has a lot of anxiety, that's a problem. I think smoking status is good, but I also think smoking should go on the he problem. I think. Obese should go on the problem list, because just being obese causes a lot of problems. That's a problem. Yeah, if someone is honest and says, you know, yeah, I drink 10 beers a day. That's a problem, you know, like this should go on the problem list, because how long is your liver and the rest of your body going to hold out?
Yeah, no, thank you for sharing of how you define problem with. Let me shut my other off right quick ones!

Notetaker: Participant understood “problems list” to be different then a “diagnosis”; she believes that problems like stress and anxiety should be listed there since it an ongoing problem, p. 18:


00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:45.000
That's very insightful. Okay.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Okay, I have something that.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
I'm going to have you actually scroll down to where it says “my medications” within this section. So, keep going until you see “my medications”. There you go! We've seen medications in a couple of other places in this document already. So we saw the ones that were “administered in clinic”, and then we saw the “medical change”: So can you review this section and tell me, how would you define this and compare it to the other section?

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:28.000
So well, I'm hoping for my medications, this is all the medications that I'm currently on correct. For my medication. Since you have all these, I can't have medications in in the clinic which I'm guessing is just a one-time thing. But if to me my medications are medications that I take daily, and some people take stuff daily forever. Some people take stuff daily for next appointment, you know. Couple of months. So to me, that's what we should be. What am I on long term? Okay? And why I'm taking it. Yeah, take one tablet by mouth every day for blood pressure.
Okay, so that's tells you what it is. Has it a Rx number.  It should say oh, it does say 5 milligrams.
Okay, also says, needs to tell you what type. Okay, that's good. That's good. Yeah.

00:41:20.000
And how would you utilize or not utilize this section?

00:41:23.000
Well, I go to my HealtheVet and look at my prescription to see my medications, but I mean something like this. I could also go there and look at it too.

Notetaker: Participant understood that the “my medications” section is the list of current and ongoing medications, and she distinguished that the “medications administered in clinic” are  “one-time” meds that are taken during that specific appointment only, p.19.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Okay. Now I'm actually going to have you. We're going to pretend another scenario, so we'll say you reviewed this after visit Summary. And now you realize oh, this reminds me. I forget what we talked about in this other appointment. So, I want you to go and try to find another appointment. You've had in the past and find another after visit. Summary. So how would you do that?

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
In this app, here?

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Yes.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000
It's only giving me one date. I would think, After-visit, Summary. I will go ahead. If I wanted to. Yeah, it's taking me too long to find it. Hmm. Seems like it should be where I could go back, or should be up here for dates, or whatever and I should be able to click on it and see other appointments, or like maybe do it by the year visits, for you know 2023 visits for 2022. Yeah.


00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Now, I will direct your attention right above where it's after visit. Summary the one that says back to care some reason notes if you can click on that.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Here. Oh, okay, care summaries.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:58.000
There you go. Now review this page and let me know what your thoughts on this.

Notetaker: When trying to navigate to another AVS, participant scrolled back to the top and tried to close the “Your appointment on June 6, 2023” accordion several times and scrolled back down to end of page and back up to the top again, and she still wasn’t able to figure out how to navigate to another AVS from June 6, 2023 AVS page. She believed that should she be able to see another appointments’ after-visit summary listed on the same page in another accordion. Moderator has to direct participant to the top bread crumb button, which brought Participant back to “Care summaries and notes” screen.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Yeah, look for this being a prototype, not everything will be clickable.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
So what are your thoughts of what is displayed on?

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000
So how far back, how far back? Is, that.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Let's go. Let's scroll down.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
I see it goes to 2015, but.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Yeah. How far back would you expect this page to go?

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.000
I would, you know I would say a page like this, probably. This page right here, maybe. 2 years, the current year, and the year prior, and then maybe go in increments. Oh, so! If we were to go like 23 to 22 (2023 to 2022) But if somebody says Oh, well, what did I do in in 2020, maybe have it in increments of 2 to 3 years if that makes sense. So that they can click like if you were to say, or maybe for the past 2 years, because, you know, when you start a New Year the last year is still so prevalent. So even if you went, say, from appointments or care, from 2021 to current, and if somebody says, Well, what happened? What did I do in 2020, and then maybe have something?


00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
2017 to 2020, or something like that, you know, or maybe or you might have to do it just by each year, because some people may have a lot of appointments, but II don't think everything needs to come up because some people are going to have like scrolls and schools they might have been coming to the VA Since the seventies.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
So show a year or 2, as you said, and then give them the option to go further back. They want.	

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Yeah, right, right, yeah. And then I think, yeah, maybe each year. Because, yeah, cause people have a lot of appointments. And you don't want to mix up year. So they say, well, what did I do? And you know, 2020. They could click on 2020. Yeah.

Notetaker: Participant would like to see the appointments by the year, so maybe filters by the year would be the best option, because then she wouldn’t have to scroll a long way to get to the appointment she was looking for, p, 21:

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.000
On scale from one to five, one being very easy, and five being very difficult. How easy or difficult was it to navigate to another summary.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Oh, I'll say, four, so it's not bad. Some of the stuff was a little confusing, but it's not bad.

Notetaker: Participant found navigating to another AVS from the June 6th AVS, somewhat difficult, she gave it a four, p.21:

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Now we are actually done with the prototype. I still have another question, but we won't be using the prototype anymore.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Okay.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000
We're going to talk about notifications next, and notifications that you might want to receive about your actors in summary. So I am going to have you pretend again, pretend that you receive the following message, the subject would be new after visit summary, and the contents would be a summary of your recent appointment is now available on the healthy that log in to review the summary. So do you find this notification helpful or not helpful?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
I like getting notifications.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Okay? Why?

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
I'm very interested in proactive about my health.
So yeah, that's just me.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
And how would you prefer to receive this notification?

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
I get them in an email. It comes to my email. And I get, you know, I can check my email on my phone or check my email on my computer. And then I'll go on my HealtheVet. I have gone on my healthy bet on my phone, but just very rarely. I don't have the app there, I just maybe have to download it, for you know something. But yeah, I prefer doing stuff like that on my desktop.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Okay, if you had multiple appointments in one day, would you want one after visit?
Summary notification for each appointment? Or would you want all the equipment combined into one method?

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:04.000
I want them all in one message. If it's the same day, and they can just say, You know, Hi, Mary, care, you know, podiatry, dietitian, you know, whatever’re, but I'd like to same day.

Notetaker: Participant likes getting notifications because she is very proactive about her health. She prefers email, and would like all notification on AVS from the same day in one message, p.22:

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
I did have a few more questions towards the end of my question.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Hmm!

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.000
If you could change one thing about the after visit Summary or the experience you reviewed today, what would it be?

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Like, I said, put, you know, weight and height in metric and in US equivalents.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.000
And is there anything about an after visit? Summary that I have not asked you today that you would want to share After visit, Summary.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000
May put something in there about goals. What goals this patient, you know. Goals, patient has.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Can you eloborate into a little bit more, and give me an example?

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Well, that would also depend upon the doctor, the medical provider, asking me what goals do you want to have? So if you go see a Podiatrist, for example, because you have ethics foot, the goal would be to, you know not. Have ethics for to get rid of athletics footing tonight, getting anymore. That'll be a goal. So then, in order to achieve that goal, you'd have to kind of be maybe bit more proactive, keeping your feet clean and dry. Not walking barefoot at this public pool, you know just things like that, because I think if you have goals a lot of if you kind of know where you're going, then you can alleviate lots of times where you don't want to go.

Notetaker: Participant would like to see height, weight ,etc., in US equivalents s in addition to metric system in the AVS. And she would like a section on health goals discussed with the provider and plan for achieving those goals ,p.23:

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
And my last question is, do you have any questions for me about anything that we covered today?

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
So this is just hypothetical. Are you all looking to set this up this?

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
And is it only going to be a phone app, or you're not sure yet.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:57.000
We are right now. We're just at this stage of gathering veteran feedback, and then we'll take that and make decisions.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:04.000
And if we need to make any changes or anything. But we are working toward looking into building this.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Now is this gonna be a phone also for the tab for a tablet as well.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Okay.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
This would be part of va.gov, so va.com you can use on your phone or your.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Well, I mean I could see it being very useful, because, you know, no one really carries it.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000
A desktop around or a laptop, or on the time.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Everybody nowadays carries a phone so I could see it being useful.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
That's all the questions that I have for you today.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
So I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Okay. Where are you located? You say you're not in Indiana.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Thank you. Are you feedback? I'm I am in Pennsylvania.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Pennsylvania. Okay.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Yeah.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:54.000
So thank you again. I do. Want to just reiterate that everything we did today wasn't real, so this is a prototype.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
You didn't actually access Va, dot cov and Para Gene will be sending you a thank you.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Note with a little blurb, that you can pass on to other veterans.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.000
You may know, to provide them the chance to participate in the future research study just like what you did today.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
So thank you.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Okay, how are we compensated? How do you compensate us?

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:21.000
They will. That'll be part of the when they get in contact with you, too. We'll discuss that after this session.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Now let me, are you doing the the survey about how to for your disability, application, and all that stuff is that you as well?

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000
There is that is, part of the same group that I'm on.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000
I'm focused on health stuff. But yes, they are part.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:45.000
If you sign up for other research studies, the disability claims group is part of this, too.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
So you could sign up and potentially be called to do another study.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Related to that.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Yes, that's what I that's the one I was very much interested in, cause.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000
I have some specific questions issues, and maybe they could get asked.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Can I get on that study about the a disability?

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000
They will. I will talk to Perijian, but they send out.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:14.000
You'll get like, just like how you got an email saying, Hey, you wanna sign up for this.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Okay.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
It could, another one could come through that it was the disability, too, so like keep a lookout for the communication.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Okay. Alrighty.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Yeah, thank you very, very much. Enjoy the rest of your day.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Thank you, you too.
