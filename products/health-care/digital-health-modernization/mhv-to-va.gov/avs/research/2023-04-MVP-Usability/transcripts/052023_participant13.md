Participant 13 (Kristenâ€™s)

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So, [Redacted PII] are you okay that we record this video and audio.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Great. Thank you so much, so I'd like to start off by just asking you a few questions regarding your doctor visits, and whether you receive any paperwork on information that occurred during your if this, after your appointment, so for example, once you're done with the appointment, you're walking

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
out, does anyone hand you any paperwork?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If my husband had labs done, on occasion he'll handle this like the printout of the lab. Report.
But that's really it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Okay? And so do you, or does he review the lab? Report?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I do?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You do? Okay? So what in particular, do you find very important?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
On on those reports.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Just all the readings, and you know, if it's notated that it's high or it's slow.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Okay.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And of course the doctor would have already gone over it with this, and I mostly use that for my record.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
S. So I can, you know. Do it? Have a comparison if I need to compare.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Okay. And so, is there any particular appointments or procedures that you look at this?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This information more closely.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Yeah, if my husband has had a point with another doctor in their, you know, asking about a certain level, or they're saying, Oh, we need to. We got to go do some labs. Well, I can just take this out and be like, well, okay, so here's how you can compare, because I've got like 10 years worth. And we don't need new labs because he just got poked and got labs a couple, you know, weeks ago, or whatever.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Okay. So you mentioned you take it out. Do you actually bring them with you to the doctor's appointments?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If I am not, if I am going to a doctor outside of the Va. Yes, I do.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Okay. But if you're seeing someone within the VA. Organization thing. You don't carry this this paperwork with you.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
No cause. I assume that they've got it. It's their testing.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Okay, great, thank you, [Redacted PII] . If you had to give it a name, what would you call this paperwork?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Just a print out of his labs.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Okay.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So would it be just like, or , does it discuss other information in this printout?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Just lapse that all that's on their labs.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Oh, so you never get like any notes that pertain to the condition that they discussed that day.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Nope, never get any notes.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Okay. Okay. Great. Alright. Great. So I'm gonna go ahead and send you a prototype link in the chat.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So I'll copy it right now. And so once you receive it I'm gonna ask you to click on it.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Once you're in the zoom app again, click on it and share your screen.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
If you're able to.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Okay.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Did you receive it, [Redacted PII] ?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Okay, yes, let me click on. So I clicked on the link.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Okay. So I did that. And then I need to go back to the zoom app to share the screen.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Yes, yes, exactly.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Okay.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
But I don't know where it went.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Oh, hang on!

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Share screen.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Okay.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And then you'll probably have to toggle back to the the screen.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Yes, perfect. You got it.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Okay, let's see here. Oh, there! Can you see that good?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Excellent. Yes, thank you very much. Is there a way you can just slightly move my photo so it won't interfere with your screen.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Oh, I hope!

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Sorry. Sorry that was me.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
No, that's okay.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Okay, there you go. Is that better?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Yeah. Great. Thank you. Yes, perfect.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Okay, so now, I'm I'm gonna ask you to pretend that it's June sixth and your name is Hector.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So you have an appointment. You had an appointment with Doctor not this morning at 9 50 A.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
M. And he's your primary care, for he's a primary care physician.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So if you look, few hours, have passed since your appointment and you forgot what the doctor's instructions were. So please use this prototype to find out what Dr.
Knott discussed at your appointment. So how would you get to where you want to find information? On what you and the doctor discussed during the appointment.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I'm gonna go to help history.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Okay.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Care summaries.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Okay, here we are.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Okay. Great.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I think that's what I'm looking for right there.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Yes, exactly.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Okay.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Okay, just give me, if you can just read through and give me your overall impressions of what you see here.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Okay.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So if you can think aloud, so I can hear what you're thinking.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Okay. So I went there for hypertension. But while I was there he named all these other things that were wrong with me.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Took my vitals.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Okay.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Hmm! The temperatures in Celsius. I really wish that was in Fahrenheit, because I don't know Celsius I'd have to translate it.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Same thing with my height. Centimeters. We use feet.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Okay.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Wait kilograms. That's not applicable, really, in the Us.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000 
Too much. They did a ultrasound on me.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But I can't remember what part of my body they did that to.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Okay, is there anything else that you find confusing on that page?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I'm working.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:08:13.000
See, I can be in my treatment plan.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
What again?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So here's like more information.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Doctor knock. I'm so sorry, I interrupted. You go ahead.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Oh, I'm just searching for anything that might be confusing, like.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Here's a whole. Another thing looks like lab reports and stuff.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Okay? And what do you find confusing about the lab reports?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Well!

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I'm just kind of wondering why it's not altogether.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
What?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
It like this with the notes of what went on during the appointment.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Like, I'm guessing that we went over the lab.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So why went the lab report, be up there with what I was diagnosed with? And then you know, all those elements and what they did to me.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Okay.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So!

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Did doctor not instruct you to do anything after this appointment?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Let me go back up and read through. Sorry. I'm just.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Oh, treatment plan. Looks like I'm gonna have to.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Okay, well, a, it looks like he's telling me to take some.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Highland, all type product, and I can't say that word with a.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I'm guessing. That's what that's for.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And then I've gotta wait for the roomumatology consultant to contact me.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Okay.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I mean, I don't see where it tells me. Hey, you've got a rest. He can't go to work.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Where would you expect to see that?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I would expect to see that up here at this first section where it talks about my reason for my appointment.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Okay.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
What I was diagnosed with.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Like after care notes, and like this, that.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Medicine. What the a word here! I'm not quite sure.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Am I supposed to take it for Mike? New condition? And is this something?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I'm currently already on.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Not quite sure about that.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Okay. Can you read to me what the says?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
The Medication.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Yes, like the headings, like. What does it say?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Okay.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Oh, procedures ultrasound! And then medications ordered for administrative administration in clinic medications order for administration during your visit to the Va.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Clinic are merged, department.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
What does that mean to you, [Redacted PII] ?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
It means they prescribed it to me while I was there.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
But.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
So when you say subscribe, can you be a little bit more detailed?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
In what way did they prescribe it?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I'm assuming the doctor saying, Hey, you need to take this medication for your condition.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So I'm gonna write a script and you can pick it up across the hall with the pharmacy in about 30 min.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Okay. Alright, great. So could could you look at those?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Can you open up the glossary for me? There, do you see that it says Medication term?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Oh, sure!

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Can you read that to me and let me know if anything is confusing in there?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:41.000
The.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:56.000
No, this makes total sense to me, because my husband has stuff that the Va Doc prescribes, and then he's got stuff that his civilian Doc prescribes. But the Va.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Fills it for us.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Okay. So when you see that status there, that's that's pretty.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Is that familiar to you?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
It's tell me the Va. Dot prescribed it to me.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Okay, great. Thank you. So I'm gonna move on to.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
If we can scroll down to your appointment on June sixth, I think it might be up.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.000
It might be up one again. Let's see if that's yeah.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Okay.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So overall. How would you use this information?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Okay.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I would use it as a reminder about my appointment in case I were forgetful.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I could show this to my civilian, Doc in case I needed to go there and say, Hey, this is what he.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I went, there for, and this is what he said, where all I had, and this is what he gave me.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:13.000
The medication, and these were my vitals. While I was there.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Cause. Maybe I had an emergency, and I don't have time to run all the way into town to the Va.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And I've got to go someplace else.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Okay, the information under your diagnosed with, could you?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
How we could find that information.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Very general, so I would probably have to look up some some of this hypertension.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I may not know that it equates to probably high blood pressure.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
The next one. I have no clue. What that is, I'd have to look that one up.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Chronic pain, chronic pain, and what my arm, my leg, my!

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
It's just. Everything is very general.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So when you say that, do you prefer something more specific?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
If they could.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Just put a link. What does this mean? Like a glossary like the other section kinda had that way, I wouldn't have to just get on Google and self diagnose myself.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Then I'm dying.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Okay.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Like we all do the chronic pain. If it's how to dash leg, arm, stomach.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Because maybe I go there a lot. And he prescribed me with chronic pain.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
But it's a different area in my body every time.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I you know it'd be handy to know.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Okay. So by listing these conditions like, how does that relate to that? For me?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
With the rest of the information on this page.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Well, the hypertension. You can see the blood pressure reading is raised.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:24.000
The rest of it. I'm guessing the medication is for the pain, maybe, and I have to look at.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
I think that's like a all medication.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Okay. What if I told you that you were diagnosed with with something like titled something else, like as health conditions that you discuss?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Is that a parent for you?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Like the hypertension. The reason I went there.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Yeah, so when it's where it says you were diagnosed with.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
It's yeah. It says, hybrid.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And I mentioned that health conditions you discussed.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:07.000
If I said that was another term or another title for the same section, would it still make sense?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Yeah.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Or do you feel like there are 2 different things.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Oh, no! I think that makes sense.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
That makes sense. Okay.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:27.000
So were you aware that those were all the things that you discussed in the appointment?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I'm hoping that the doctor discussed all this with me.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Okay.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000
So how valuable in valuable were the was this information!

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I. It's valuable. It's good. It's good information, although it could be.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Perhaps expanded upon.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Okay. How would you use it, [Redacted PII] ?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Yes.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:20.000
The information to remind myself what I was diagnosed with.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Okay.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Look up some of this diagnosis, since I'm not familiar with a couple of these words.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:35.000
You know. Just look at the blood pressure, because maybe next time I'm at the grocery store I jump on the free blood pressure machine and kind of see where it is, and I can compare notes.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Okay.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Yeah.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Alright. You can scroll down a little bit, go down.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Just tell me when.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Okay.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Okay, so let's go to your treatment plan for this appointment.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Okay.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And so.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Again. I like you to scroll through this and think aloud on what you're seeing.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And any comments on anything that's confusing, and that doesn't make sense to you. Please.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Okay. So let's see, they're gonna call me or send me a letter for this rheumatology.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Consultant.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And he's ordering some imaging. I'm assuming those.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Oh, for my hand and my brain!

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
In my brain. He wants it both ways, with and without contrast.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Okay.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:08.000
The lab test. Good to know. I don't have to pass anymore before going.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Is your port to the lab for the following blood test on the date listed.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Okay. So II need to pop over to the lab and cause he wants to check these 3 levels on me medications.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
The section only list changes to your medication regime.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Please see your complete medication list under my ongoing.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Here below. Okay. So he renewed these medications. Nice to know the string, but it doesn't say the dosage guess I could look on my bottle.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I need to come back on the thirteenth, so the nerve can check my blood pressure.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Here are my health reminders. Let's just help reminders checks, chronic condition like diabetes.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Okay, we'll set this up so it tells me when I need to go get my flu shot when that's due.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Oh! Now on Iraq, I. Afghanistan post deployment screen.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I better pop over to that office while I'm here?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
And he the I need to call the Doc when I get back from Seattle.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Okay, great. Can we go back up to the medications and supplies?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Okay.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Oh, so how does this section differ from the other section up top, where the medications were administered in the clinic?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
How did the 2 differ?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Well that medication is not listed here, so.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:23.000
You know. Maybe they gave me a shot of that medication, but I'm guessing it was a they said, Hey, you need to go to the pharmacy and pick it up because you need to start taking it for your condition.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
That's what it get confusing, specially if it.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
You know we're a year down the road, and I didn't quite remember.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Yeah. Can you scroll back up to that section again, please?

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Okay. Alright!

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Yes, a little bit of more. Yes, right there.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:50.000
So. What if I told you that was the medication that was given to you at the visit?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
It wasn't clear to you, was it? At that time?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:08.000
No, it's not well. When I read the active thing it tells me to go to the that I've got to get it from the pharmacy, but still it's a little confusing cause.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Right.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
They could have very well gave me a shot. Maybe I was like in terrible pain, and maybe it wasn't a script for me to pick up.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Okay. So the it's so wasn't clear that they gave you the there while you were there. Right?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
It's not super clear. No!

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:39.000
What would you have wish? They would have added to that? To make that more clear for you?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Maybe another section. How given shot in the left arm pickup at the pharmacy.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:59.000
So the Po, once that is that unclear for you what that means.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Oh, the O, one. Yeah. Post office. Sorry. Ping, dong!

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
But it didn't sound that to me.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Okay, that's great. So can you tell me the difference between this section and the bottom one that we're just at medications and supplies?

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
If you could compare them.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:36.000
So apparently we're gonna send the see? The medicine to me via the Po, which is the mail which they should just really say the mail, because you may not.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
I mean it didn't correlate with me. Po and mail the same thing.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:52.000
These other medications down here. It does not say.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
If there!

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Gonna be mailed, you know, Meld, and you know how long.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000
They're renewed, for you know, 3 refills, one refill one time.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Pick up at the pharmacy, since it has that po up here, I would say, and it tells me it's they're gonna mail it to me one time, I would say, needs to be consistent.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:36.000
And these medications down here mean to notate how, how I'm getting them, and how many times how many refills I've got.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Okay. What if I told you that these medications here are the medications that were added or changed during this specific appointment?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Was, is that clear or unclear? From this information?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:04.000
It's unarar, because the title of the section is renewed and that's telling me that it's something that I'm already on, and he's just renewing my script for.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Another 6 months or a year, whatever the case may be.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Okay, so, but it doesn't pertain specifically to this appointment.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
No!

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
You wouldn't think of it that way. What would you have liked for it to say to clearly denote that it was done during that appointment?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
What would you have like to see?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
That these medications were prescribed during the appointment.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Like. So are you saying different verbs,[Redacted PII] , like different verbiage.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
You'd like to like, or plain language. Is that what it is?

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Yeah, and it just needs to be very plain.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Okay, what would you have? What would you have titled it?

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Medications Renewed during Visit.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Okay.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Or refilled, you know.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Okay. Anything else that you'd like that seems confusing about this page that you'd like to change.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Again. How I get the medications, and how many times they're renewed for so I pick them up.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Okay.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Do I get them in the mail 3 times one time, 10 years!

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Alright. So let's say that you know they did have a very clear.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Title that tells you that these medications were added or changed.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:57.000
During this specific appointment. How useful are not useful with this information be for you!

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
It would be useful, because I would know that they were he.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:17.000
That he renewed them. So then, when I'm running low on one of them, they've been renewed so I can jump over to my farms, and they should appear over there, and I can just, you know, click on it when I need my little refill and I don't have to send a

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
message over to him.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Okay, is there anything else that you could be doing with that information?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
I can't really think of one.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Okay. Now that's you've been great.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Thank you, [Redacted PII] . So I'm gonna move on over to your health information as of this appointment.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Okay.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
And, I think slowly scroll down, and again.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Just read everything and comment on anything that seems confusing.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Or declare?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Okay, so I went to the doctor on February the thirteenth, and so Dr.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Nut hopefully. He wasn't quick.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:32.000
In the primary care team. Good to know. It tells me my appointments that I have in the next 13 months.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
That's good so I can go ahead and plug that in my calendar.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:49.000
So on Thursday the third, I have an appointment, and I know what building, but I don't know what time.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
That's may have to. I'll send a note over to Dr.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Nutt, and ask them what time that appointments that appointment is.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Recall appointments. Please know that all recall appointments are not confirmed, appointments.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:14.000
You will receive a reminder approximately 3 weeks before the recall date to call and request the appointment.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
What is?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
When you call you Luli, do what?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Yeah, what? After your death? I'm sorry, interrupted you.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
After you're done, just let me know what your understanding is of recall. Acquaintance.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Okay, can you? Okay? So sounds like, I also need to call.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:50.000
3 weeks prior to August fourth, because I gotta set this appointment.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
So I need to do another calendar reminder.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:01.000
It would be handy if it would tell me.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Okay.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
What date I need to call so. August fourth, okay, I probably need a call like July fifteenth.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
So I can make that appointment for August fourth.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Hey? So you'd like a date that you should call.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Yeah, even if it had a a button to add it to my calendar, that'd be great.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
A button to add it to your calendar. Can you elaborate on that?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:34.000
To add to my calendar on my phone that way.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
So you know we have I'm just gonna make up a date.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
I don't know. 15 days. Friday, July the fifteenth.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Call for appointment.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Make, recall, appointment for Friday, August fourth.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:00.000
And if it had a little button, add to your calendar, so it would add it to my calendar on my phone or my laptop.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
To remind me. I've got a call and make that appointment.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.000
So you'd like a reminder for the recall appointments.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Okay.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Otherwise I might forget when I need a call.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Yeah. So having this here, the recall clearance is that helpful or not helpful information for you?

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000
It is helpful. The then I can kind of plan what I've got coming up.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
I know in August, around the Fourth, hopefully, I'll have an appointment.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
So I can't schedule that month. Long vacation, because I need to go.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:46.000
To the doctor cause this is, needs to be taken care of.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
So other than a reminder. Would you add anything else to this?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Recall appointment section anything that would be helpful for you.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Maybe some.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Notes of, or just a brief description. What this appointment may be for cause I don't know what ll is surgery, and looks like I'm they want me to have surgery.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Maybe on my eye, but I don't know.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
DM, or tell, is it gonna be? Can I do this by telephone?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.000
But then I see Img, maybe imaging it's just a lot of guesswork right there.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
So you prefer them writing everything out instead of short handing everything.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Yes, because I'm not familiar with Va. Shorthand.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Okay.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Yeah, okay, let's go down to problems list. And if you can tell me after you read it, what this information means to you.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Okay, so appointment notes, do you need to start their problem list?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Problems, please.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Okay. So it tells us, when I was first diagnosed with hypertension and hyper, or whatever that is, I'm a smoker, and it tells me when I had these immunizations, although it does not tell me it tells me where I had the pneumonia.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:38.000
One. It was at the Puget Sound, Cl. But I can't remember when I got the flu and the covid vaccine.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
That would be helpful. Then a which clinic goodbye got it.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Several of them.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Okay. So you'd like to know the clinic for each Fax machine.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Yes.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:03.000
May I ask? Why, [Redacted PII] , how would that be useful for?

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
In case I were asked by Fba. Doctor. Maybe they don't have that information.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
If I don't see it, maybe they don't have it.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Maybe I'm going on a trip, and I've got a proof to them where I had my covid shot or my flew shot.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Or maybe the civilian doctor's asking me. I just I like lots of details.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Okay.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:50.000
So, after reviewing your I think I can, we scroll down a little more, I wonder if there's a little bit more down there?

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Yeah.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Okay? So my allergies, hey? Drug reaction. So adhesive tape.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:10.000
I'm allergic to that, so they know not to put that on me.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.000
This other one with the P.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:30.000
It doesn't say what my reaction is if they accidentally put give me that zosin, whatever it's called.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Would you like to know what the reaction is?

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Yes, that way, I know. If all of a sudden my lips swell up, I could be like oh, that nurse didn't read the notes, and I think they probably gave me this that way.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
I would have a reference.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Okay.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Can continue. Please.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Okay, all my recent lab results.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Okay, so chemicalobin, there's nothing under flag.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
But I see that there is on sodium down below it. So hmm!

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:43.000
I'm wondering why they didn't do that, so I don't know if I'm I'm guessing I'm okay, because I see the range there. Okay.But it would just be nice for it to be all consistent. Yeah, here's potassium, chloride. Some of them don't have anything under that flag. So you would like. So if there's that might be just the title of that. So you'd like them to say like normal? If so, if there's no flag, what is it that you want them to say? There! If it's normal, maybe it doesn't say FLag. It just says normal.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Okay. So the flag having the flag there confuses you or no.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:35.000
The fly is telling me, if I if there's words there, that it's lower, I guess if it were high.
That would be nice if, even if it were within normal range instead of flag.
To say normal range, because I've got to look at that. You know the number.
Then I gotta look at the range. And I'm like, Okay, guess I'm okay.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Okay.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
So what's your overall impression of this section?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:22.000
What is your understanding of this section? How does that pertain to this appointment?

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
There's something going. My, A one C. There's something going on with that.
But I don't know if that relates to my hypertension or not.
This other glucose one. Okay, so that's high, too.But again, this, that play into the hypertension or the other elements, I'm not quite sure.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:40:00.000
So what if I told you that this whole section it's are the conditions that you have discussed with your doctor during this appointment?

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Okay, well, so.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Does that make sense, or is it confusing?

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
That makes sense, but it should have a different title.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
What should it be?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Lab results. Recent lab results discussed during this appointment.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Okay. So the title is your health information, as of this appointment.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
So you'd like something more clear.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Oh, well, but maybe I don't scroll back up there, and I didn't remember the heading of it.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Yeah.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000
If I'm way down here on the page, you know.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.000
So what would make it easier for you to digest all this information?

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:57.000
The title that notates it. This is the lab results discussed during this appointment.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Okay. So each little like section, you'd like a subsection saying how it relates to this appointment.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
That'd be helpful.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Okay. Anything else that you find confusing.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
No!

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Okay.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Alright, (Redacted PII) so now you can. You can stop sharing your screen.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:41.000
I'm just gonna discuss other, your pain on something else.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Okay.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Or actually you know what my apologies that on I'm gonna ask you to.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:53.000
If let's say, for example, you wanted to look at another after visit, Summary on a different day.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
But your on this page, how would you navigate back to that page?

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Can you show me?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
So I probably.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
And you can choose any date that you'd like.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Okay, so I click this back to care summary or note.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Yeah.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
So I click that or maybe the back button on my screen.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Okay.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:30.000
But I'll choose to click this, and then if I wanna see another one, I'm already here under the care summaries and notes, so I can just scroll down.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
To January fifteenth. Why, I guess I was in the hospital.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
I don't remember. My memory's not too good.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Okay, so how we got so on a scale of one to 5, with one being very easy in 5, being very difficult.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
How easy was it for you to get to another after care!

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Summary.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Very easy.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Okay, so now we're gonna now, you can shut off your prototype.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
That's okay.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
My apologies for the confusion, and so II have a go ahead.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
There you go!

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:28.000
I'm sorry. Thank you. So I just have a I mean, just like your opinion on general overall health notifications.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
So let's say, we're gonna pretend that the Va.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Is sending you a notification update your recent after visit.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Summary. And the notification, says new after visit, summary in the contents are a summary of your recent appointments is now available on my healthy Bet login to review Login to review the summary, so do you find this notification helpful or not helpful.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000
And why?

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000
I do find it helpful because I can login see what the doctor wrote.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Make sure that it's everything that I remembered.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Maybe he's telling me that I've got to do something.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
I've got a rest. 30 min in the morning, and 30 min in the afternoon.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
I need to take my blood pressure, and I need to elevate my leg hopefully. That would all be right. There.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Set as a reminder.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Okay.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:50.000
And how would you like to receive these messages? Email, text or phone calls?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Either an email or a text.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Okay. And when you receive these messages and you have multiple appointments in one day, would you like a separate notification for each Appointment for each after visit summary? Or would you like just one notification containing all after visit summaries within that one notification?

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:28.000
I would like one for each visit, because what if the first doctor I saw he did it,
He sent me email, did the aftercare summary. But then my third doctor of the day well, he didn't do any. You know. Send that in, and then I don't have to keep reminding myself to check back and look for it.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Okay. So so you're just concerned that the after visit summaries won't be updated at the same time that the notification will go out is that is that it?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Yes.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Okay. Is there any other thing that you'd like to add to that?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Perhaps when they sent me the notification, it could say aftercare visits.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Some are now available from Dr. Nutt after care visit now available for Dr.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Mouse, you know it tells me which one?

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Okay, so, specific. Yeah, okay, oh, okay, so just a few more questions.



00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:36.000
And I'll let you go if you can change this one thing about anything about this.After visit summary. What would it be?

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:52.000
It just needs to be little bit more close, with more detail.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Can you elaborate that like? What would make it more clear for you?

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:09.000
So back to the medication, where it says Po, just say mail. Just some of the you know, the acronyms that that they use, that the general public doesn't know what they are.
It would just, you know, it would be nice to just have easy terms.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Okay.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
So more patient oh, terms!

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Or yeah, or a button that they could click on to find out more about whatever it is that they said.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
So less medical terms, more layman's terms for patients.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Yes.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Okay? And lastly, do you have any questions for me?

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
I don't.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Okay, so thank you so much. We really appreciate your time.
