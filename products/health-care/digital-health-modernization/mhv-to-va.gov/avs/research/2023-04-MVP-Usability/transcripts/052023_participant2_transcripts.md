00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Great, and now that I started recording, can I have you confirm on the record that you are comfortable?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yes, yes, I am.

Warm-up Questions
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay. So I like to start by learning more about your experience reviewing information about what was discussed during your medical appointment. So do you recall receiving paperwork as you left in an appointment, or reviewing online information which provided an overview of what occurred during your medical appointment?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I did receive a PC. Of paper scheduling the next appointment, and I did go to my healthy bit and look at my lab results.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Yes.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is your lab results. Okay? So that piece of paper that you did receive would suggest your upcoming appointments or any other information on there.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There was. There were no notes about the appointment. Usually on the private side they'll give you a synopsis of what their point was about when I wanted to.This time I didn't see that I just received a piece of paper stating that I had.
Notetaker: Participant does not recall receiving an AVS after a VA appointment; he just received paperwork about scheduling next appointment. She had to go to my healthy vet to look up lab results p. 1-2. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Okay, actually, can we talk about both on the private side and the Va.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Yes.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Then, so why did you review that paperwork, or how did you use that paperwork? What information was valuable to you both of what the VA gave you, and also what you've received on the private.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Yeah, as far as Va. Paper goes, it. It was routine. Usually again, I will go into a My HealtheVet sometimes I'll download the blue button. So to  see with the what was it, or to see what's going on in case I missed it. On the private side, I received the information as soon as I checked out.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It said, had actual doctor's notes. Had my prescriptions. Oh, my vitals! And then it listed. After procedure how to follow up, and to reschedule appointment if necessary. Additionally, it's through apple pie chart, and as soon as my point was over, I received a message from my charge. The same information that I received.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Okay, do you recall a particular appointment Type, or maybe a procedure or a particular reason that you looked at this, that paperwork, particularly the what you're talking about in the private side?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And what that reason was, and what you found was valuable or not valuable.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The reason I checked was to make sure that I didn't miss anything that any issues that I would have. The other reason I use it to track my vitals as if what I'm getting at home, and what was going on in the an office also looking for the medical terminology for whatever complaint I had that they that they were using.
Notetaker: Participant the AVS from private doctor to check vital and check up on the terminology that the doctor was using for the his complaint p. 3:
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
What would you call or name that thing that you actually got from the Non-VA doctor?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It was through an app, MyChart, and the other thing was, I said, an actual physical handout with the same information.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
If you were to give it a name, what would you name that handout?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Oh, I'm sorry. After the visit Summary.

Task 1
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Okay, now, I'm actually going to send you a link to the prototype, so we can get opinions on a section of the VA.gov website that we're working on. So let me. There is a chat feature in Zoom. I'm going to send you the link there.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Okay. I don't. Okay. I see.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Okay, great. If you can actually bring that up and share your screen, have you shared your screen before?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
In zoom.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Yes, I have.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:55.000
This way I'll be able to add you questions and observe you using the prototype

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Here we go. Okay, hold on.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Ex. See that you have the prototype up.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Now that's fantastic. Okay, I'm going to give you a scenario.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Okay.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
We're going to play pretend that today is June sixth, 2,023, and your name is Sector.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000
You can see Hector at the top. There, and he just had an appointment a put, an appointment this morning at 9 50, with Dr. Knutt, who is your primary care Physician At the Puget Sound VA. Facility. So a few hours in past, since your appointment, and you forgot what your doctor's instructions were. Use this prototype to find out what you discussed at your appointment definitely, think aloud and share your thoughts as you're trying to find this information.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Okay, I am going to look under appointments, where it says schedule and manage. And we click past. And then I would click under the June 6th with documents and details.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Okay,Okay. And then. Yes, I would view the After-visit summary.
Notetaker: Participant chose Appointments, then June 6th and clicked on details to het to the AVS. P.5.
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Okay, now that you're on this page, please review all the information and share your overall impressions again.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Talk a lot as your email.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Okay, I'm going to read the first caption.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I like the way it's laid out. And yes, I like this. Is I really like this where it says you were diagnosed with yes. And I will see medications. Okay?I like this a whole lot.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Okay. What in particular makes you say that? What do you like about it?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I like the presentation of the information. It's easy to read, especially, for on a mobile side it's clear it's concise. It's easy to follow you. Think about it a lot. Everything is natural. Okay. I also like. How they tell you that your prescriptions are renewed. And the follow up information.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So this way. I forget, and come home, and I will hit put these like the flu shot things, and any other Items that I need to follow up, follow up with.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Great! Now go ahead! Keep going!

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Oh, and I like how the subsections are with the plus and minus.So that you know it's not too much information. You are inundated with a whole bunch of information at 1 point in time.
Notetaker: Participant liked the way the information was laid out in the accordions; so he is not overwhelmed with too much information, he can close and open the plus and minus as he likes, p.6.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So did Doctor not want you to complete or do anything following your appointment.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:42.000
The only thing that I see we're under the instructions for. Under other instructions, for say, it's called accidentally returned from Seattle area. As far as that they would be reaching out to me. It doesn't appear there's anything else on my end that I need to.
Notetaker: Participant didn’t notice that the doctor had given him next step instructions, p.6:
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So on a scale from one to 5, one being easy and 5 being hard, how easy or hard would you say it was to find those instructions on what to do that?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
One.
Notetaker: Participant found it (One )very easy on the instruction on what to do,  but he did not notice the other instructions the doctor gave him, p.6:
Task 2
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Okay. Now, I'm actually gonna have you scroll up to the top, and we're just gonna talk about the very first like accordion, that first section.It is your appointment. On June sixth. So we're just going to focus on this. Can you provide an example of how you might utilize the information within this section?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Okay. First thing I would do is. Look to see where exactly what clinic it, what clinic it is! I would click on details to see what my appointments is.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Actually website.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Okay.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I would look to see, seek with the reasons for that appointment. And then from there I would go check my results, and I would take these, and with the information from ….. and appointment into my little health app that I had.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:27.000
No. Are there any terms that seem unfamiliar or confusing?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Under the under the medication ….I wouldn't know what acetametaphine 650 mg meant, so I wouldn’t know what PO meant so I would click to see what the definition was for Po, but I don’t.

Notetaker: Participant would like a definition for the medical acronyms, p,7:
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And I'm going to have you scroll up a little bit now to the section that says you were diagnosed with. There you go. Could you provide a definition of the information that is included within this section? How would you define it?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I would define this as a what I was rated for if what information I have given the VA. I mean what was, give it to what the results from my last visit work with my but again I will relate this to what I'm being treated for under my rating.
Notetaker: Participant didn’t understand the purpose of the “You were diagnosed with” section. He thought it was his health conditions related to his overall disability rating and not what was discussed specifically during the June 6th appointment, p. 8. (00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:22.000):

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Okay. What if the type of the section was “health conditions you discussed”? How would you define that? Then?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Then I would be what the actual appointment was about.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000
So between these two, what which one would you find more valuable to see here?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
The second option.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Yes.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
The ones that you discussed during your appointment, and why?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Because it's more specific to the time to what's going on me in my body.

Notetaker: Participant thought that having the “Health conditions that you discussed” was more clear in what the purpose of the section was about; only listing health condition related to the June 6th ,p.9 . (00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000)

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Now!

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Now I'm going to have you scroll down to the section.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
It says, medications ordered for administration in clinic.And similar question, what does the information under this section mean to you? How would you define that?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I would find this as Medicines that I received during for my state during my appointment.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:58.000
How useful or not useful do you find the information within this section?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Oh, I'm finding it very useful again, because sometimes you might come home, and actually forget the name of the medicine that they gave you during the visit, and when we should have interact with anything you have going.
Notetaker: Participant found having the medications ordered for administration in clinic very helpful because incase he get home and he forgets what he took she he doesn’t get any negative interactions, p,9:

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Now I'm going to have you go to the second accordion, where it says, “your treatment plan from this Visit” I'll ask you some questions in that to so how would you utilize this. Review the whole section, and then let me know how you would utilize the information within the section.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I would use his information as my to do list, and also to see any good information on. Were to follow up with, as far as what happened (during the visit) again in case that I forgot. What was said and what I need to.
Notetaker: In “Your treatment plan from this Visit” Participant understood that those were the doctors orders of what he needs to do next based on what was discussed on June 6th.p 10: 
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Now, are there any words or anything listed within a section that are unfamiliar or confusing to?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
No.
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Okay. I’ll Have you scroll up to a section called Medications in Supply?There you go right there. Now, how would you describe the information in this section?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:47.000
This section, I will expect to see here anything that was newly added or changed to my prescriptions, that I already have. So after this visit. something new was given to me. That's where I would expect to see.
Notetaker: Participant thought that Medications in Supply was a list of meds that were newly added or changed during this visit, p10:
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
See this!

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Okay. Now, how does that? If you could describe the difference between the medication section that we reviewed earlier and this one, what's the difference?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000
The first one was specific to the visit of the date.  This will be again, I will look at this after similar after summary report And this is saying that after this appointment this is what you'll be using now.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
So, how valuable or not valuable! Do you find this overall?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
This the medication section is Viable. I would yes, I would use it.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Now we're going to go down to the third accordion that's called your “health information as of this appointment” .So yeah, down. Further. Similarly, what you've done before. Review everything in here and talk a lot as you're scrolling through this, and let me know your basic insights in that section.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
There's a lot of information there. What's your general thought in that section?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Oh! I like this section a lot. This is probably. Next to the. Hmm! According to your treatment plan. I like this section the most so, because now I don't have to go down and download the blue button to see the summaries of what was going on with me. I like to think that I can see my labs right here, as well as the radiology report as well as what medicines that I am currently taking.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Okay. So besides, not having to use the blue button, is there any other reasons or purposes that you would use the section for?


00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Again, I would use this section to cross-reference with my outside provider, and I will also use it to.Keep me abreast of what's going on, especially like with the 1AC and my other levels. And I also like it because it lists the medicines that I'm currently taking.
Notetaker: Participant likes the “health information as of this appointment” because he doesn’t have to download blue button and he can cross reference with outside provider , and it lists the meds he;s currently taking, p,11-12:
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
No, there's a lot of information here again. But is there any terms in particular, as you were scrolling?That seems confusing, or you would. Want to, you know, ask somebody more questions about it, or.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
No, again, it's very user. Friendly. My first. Responsibility to. If I didn't understand, I would click on the Blue Arrow, asking what these method terms mean. So. No, I like it a lot.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And I'm going to have you scroll up to the top and then we're going to go to the section that's called. It’s within that if you open up your “health information as was the appointment, we're still going to stay in there but I’ll have you stay the part that says “recall appointment”. There you go. What is your understanding of a recall appointment?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:19.000
A recall appointment, I would assume that it meant an appointment that was missed and is going to be rescheduled.
Notetaker: Participant didn’t understand what Recall appointment meant. He thought it was an appointment that was missed and it needs to ne rescheduled, p12:
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000
And how helpful or not helpful is this information to you?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:34.000
It's very helpful. The one thing that. I would like to know if. Cancellations that have been cancelled will be listed in this area, and if so, Who are they saying the cancellation fault was on? Will the VA reschedule, or if it was actually me that I missed the I like a no call, no show.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Okay, so would you like cancel appointments to show up here?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Yes.
Notetaker: Participant would like to see the cancelled, or no show appointment somewhere in the recall appointments.
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Now, what if recall appointments were appointments that they want you to come back? You didn't miss them, but the provider wants you to come back and see them again.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
I would probably change it from recall to follow up.
Notetaker: Since Participant didn’t understand at first what recall meant, after learning that it was really appointments that provider wanted to come back for then participant would want that the be called “follow-up Appointments, p.13:
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Okay.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Now I'm going to have you scroll to the bottom at the very bottom page. This “problem list”. We’re going to focus on that section. Oh, Nope, you passed it it's right underneath your appointment. There you go. Okay, what would be your definition of this Section.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
This section clearly states, what my complaints are, what I'm saying is going well.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Okay, and how useful or not useful. Do you find this information?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Oh, very useful in case something that I know is going on.That's missed our case. Something it might trigger me to remember that. Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention this while I was there. I'll make sureI mention it next time.
Notetaker: Participant understood the problems list were the what they discussed diring the appointment and likes this section because he can reference to ensure he covered everything with his doctor and see if he forgot to mention anything, p.13-14.:
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
And now have you go to the medication section in here?I know you already commented on it, but I'm asking more questions. There! I think it's further down. Yeah .Okay. We go, okay? So we've seen medications. This is the third group of meditation. So how does this section differ to the previous other 2 sections of medication?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:07.000
This section difference, because this and this everything that I have going on that has been described to me, whether it's for what I've been seeing for today or not.So this is my 30,000 foot overview.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Okay, so.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
How valuable or not valuable in this particular section.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
I know you already. Come in, but.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:36.000
It's valuable to me again, dealing with memory problems to see that the information reiterated and again, it allows me to have clarity in the moment.Okay, yeah, I am taking this. So I'm not taking that.
Notetaker: Participant likes the 3rd group of my medication because it list all his medication that he’s on not exclusive to this appointment alone. He has memory issues so he likes them listed there.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
So yes!

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Okay. Now, have you go to the very last accordion at the very bottom in that it's called more information. So you can open that up and review that, and again share your thoughts on what is here.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.000
For me. This is just a Stating what other clinics, vital to me within the hospital? Excuse me, and as far as the other information, it's just giving me a. A way to follow up. What's going, what's going on? Again, if any additional help to navigate either this app, or does my future appointments, or any other issues I may have.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Okay, is there anything we would add or take away from this section?

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:49.000
No! I guess I think I would put one more thing in the more information just still reiterate Information about the crisis.
Notetaker: Participant would like to see information about the crisis line in the “more inrofmation”.
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Okay.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Now I'm going to have you pretend. So we reviewed the activated summary for this appointment.But I'm going to have you say that you want to find information from another appointment you've had in the past.So how would you go about doing that?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:30.000
I would go back to the first prompt. Back to the details back to and from here I would search.If it says, let's say I want to go like 6 months out of would expect to see a dropdown go back maybe 6 months.
Notetaker: Participant used back button to navigate to another AVS and he picked the details on the date (00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:30.000).
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Okay.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
If not, I will go back to the.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Yeah, that's probably this is a prototype like I said, not everything is working.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Right, so I would go go back and look to see under this under this tab pass, when said, See which one?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
I'm on one. Get details about.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Okay, we can pick one.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
So on a scale from one to size, with one being very easy and 5 being very difficult. How easy or difficult was it to navigate to another summary.
 
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.000
1, very easy
Okay. And then from here.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Go on very.


00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Now, I'm going to have you go to the appointment list again. So the list of all of your updates, past appointment. I'll ask you some questions here. So how would you describe what you're seeing under this past appointment? Link?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:19.000
I would describe this, and seeing oh, my! After summary reports, compiled in one session, giving me the ability to go back and review some reach some past appointments.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Now next to the pass, or some other links, and I'm not. Going to have you click on them. But could you define what you think you would see under the upcoming link?

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:42.000
I would think that I would see. It would take me to a new tab for upcoming appointments.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
And then for pending? what don't click on it actually.But what do you? Thank? You would see if you clicked on that pending link.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000
I think that would be updating the system. For appointments that might not be in here. Alright when I came in and checked it would refresh it to add putting appointments that haven't been added to the past one section yet. I should say penny pass appointments haven't been Updated any yeah.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Oh, okay, so would those be appointments that already occurred then or not?Appointments that have not occurred.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Yes, appointments that occurred in the past, but they're just not uploaded into the system yet.
Notetaker: Participant upcoming appoint was correct, pending, would be the appointments that have not been updated in the system yet. He thought it was appointments that occurred in the past that just wasn’t uploaded in the system, p17,  

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Okay.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Now we're actually going to move on from this prototype to another topic.We're going to talk about notifications that you might want to receive about your after visit summaries so I'm going to have you pretend that you received the following message could be a text message could be an email something like that. So the subject would be new after visit summary, and the contents would be a summary of your recent appointment is now available in my healthy vet login to review the summary, so do you find this notification helpful or not helpful. And why?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Helpful! Because it reminds you to that. You can review your appointment just in case you didn't receive a physical handout while you were there.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
And how would you prefer to receive this notification?

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Either via text or email. It would be the same.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:41.000
And if you had multiple appointments in one day, would you want one notification for each appointment? Or would you want all the appointments combined into like one notification? So the message would be like for all of your appointments that you had. On June sixth. You can review that after visit Summary.
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Hmm!

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
I would just what one with all of them included all exclusive.
Notetaker: Participant would like a text or email; he has no preference, but he would like to have just 1 notification for all the AVS ,p 18-19:

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
No, I decided, like a few more questions. And then we're almost done.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:21.000
If you could change one thing about the after-visit summary that you saw today, what would it be?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:44.000
I'm sorry.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Don't!

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
See any?

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
The colors are consistent, and they're easy to read.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
I wouldn't change anything. I would expect to see, maybe under the. Recall, section. If there was something that was critical, I would expect to see it highlighted and read.
Notetaker: Participant expect to see something that critical under the recall appointments to be highlighted in red.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Yes.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Okay. So the recall section that was in the actual after visit summary that's what you're talking about.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Okay, okay, now, is there anything that we didn't cover I didn't explicitly ask about for the after visit.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Summary that you would want to share with me before we end the session.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
So any last feedback on the after visit, Summary.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
No, I think it's great. I think it's very, very thorough, and it's actually better than what I expected to think. It's intuitive. It's really good that I have.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Well, thank you so much for the feedback. Do you have any questions for me?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
What do you think this will go into a sec.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Well, right now we are running a series we're talking to.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.000
You're one of multiple veterans, and we're gonna take all of your feedback and try and improve this even more.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
And then we will continue to work on that, actually making this a reality.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
How? All right. Thank you. Look forward to.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Thank you. Okay, yeah. So that's all the questions I have for you today.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:33.000
I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts, and before you go I wanna make clear that everything that we did today wasn't real.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000
We didn't haven't really access through the account, and we'll be setting you a thank you.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Note with a little blur that you can pass along to other veterans.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
You may know to provide them a chance to participate in these research sessions.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
So again. Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your day.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Thank you. Thank you for having me.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Bye!
