00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The recordings are destroyed once after we finish analysis, and now the comments will be attributed to you directly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Sounds, great.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Great now that I hit record, can I have you confirm on the record? Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talked?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Yes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now we'll get into the warm-up questions I'd like to start by learning more about your experience. Reviewing information about what was discussed during your medical appointment. So do you recall ever receiving paperwork as you left your appointment or reviewing information online that provided an overview of what occurs during your medical appointment or.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Both.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Oh, okay. And then why did you review this paperwork or online content?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Usually it was to check about, follow-ups, or to confirm what medications I was now taking.
…if lab test was done checking the results. Stuff like that.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Okay, now, is there a difference of what you look for? Since you said both, is there a difference between something you look for online versus on the paper?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Usually on the paper. It's more for just confirming. If what prescriptions are that any of that have been changed, or any kind of stuff like that in an online, it's usually for test results.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Okay. And what I have written down is that you go to a non va facility in addition to via. Is that correct?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Correct.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Okay, is there a difference between what you've received for these like overviews at the non-VA facility versus VA?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I would say the last time I went to a Va. Facility, the last two times I wasn't given any type of paperwork on the way out, which was fine with me. I didn't ask for any. I didn't need or want any cause. I was there for diagnostic reasons. No matter. When I go to my private provider I always get something a piece of paper, or, you know, confirmation of the visit that I was actually there on like in hand. I wouldn't need it it's just something they do.

Notetaker: Participant received both paperwork and went online for the AVS. Last 2 twice he visited a VA provider, he did not receive any paperwork and dint mind cause he was there for diagnostic reasons; When he goes to a non-VA provider, he always gets some sort of paperwork, p.2.


00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now you've already talked about what information you review on these things. But is there a particular type of appointment or procedure that you always take a closer look at this paperwork?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Usually, if it's some sort of diagnostic procedure, like trying to give you an example of if I would scrutinize it more. so, I guess if I was going there because of something related to my disorders, or if it was something related to my history, with alcohol and my liver, I would definitely pay more closer attention to it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now, if you haven't given name to this thing, this overview of your appointment, what would you call it?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
A Visit Summary.


Notetaker: Participant would scrutinize the paperwork more if it was related to specific disorders or history like related to alcohol and his liver, he would definitely take a closer look. We would call that paperwork “A Visit Summary”, p2:

Notetaker: Participant

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Hey? Now we're going to move on to the prototype. So I am going to in the zoom chat. I don't know if you've ever accessed zoom chat before.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I want to in the zoom chat. I don't know if you've ever accessed zoom chat before.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I want to send you a.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Okay.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
II just sent it. So if you can bring that up on your side, and then, once you have it loaded, if you go back into the zoom app and share your screen.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If I have instruct, I can share more details on how to do that.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
If if you haven't done screen sharing before.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Share screen.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Yeah.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
There we go. It needs to be loading.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And then, if you navigate to the prototype that I sent.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Now, I'm going to give you a scenario where we're going to play for 10 now pretend that it is June sixth, and your Hector. You can see, Hector at the top of the prototype…. you had an appointment this morning at 9:50, with Dr. Nutt, Dr. Nutt is your primary care. Physician as a Puget sound VA facility. So a few hours have passed since your appointment, and you forgot what your doctor's instructions were. The users prototype to find out what Doctor Net and you discussed at your appointment as you're doing that talk aloud, Share your thoughts on what you're seeing.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Let's see. I don't think I ever had to do that until I was just in for a lab. I would see.
And I check. See if it should show. The past, appointments.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Yeah, that looks like the prototype taking some time to load.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Okay.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Oh, wait! A third is down there, but I guess that it costs down on my screen.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I didn't see that before.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Hit, reload, and see if it brings up.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Hmm!

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Finished. But I see this right here details. It's not let me click on it, though.

Notetaker: Participant chose Appointments and chose  the details on of July 6th initially then he chose “Past” and then he clicked on June 6th detail to navigate to the AVS, p. 4.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Yeah, if you scroll up. That is July sixth, where we're looking for June sixth.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Oh, oh, past. Okay, there we go. Details. ….ask for after visit summary?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Okay. Now that you're on this page, I like you. Take some time and review it, and again talk a lot and share your thoughts.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Alright. So I met with Dr. Nutt, and I was having some hypertension, so I was diagnosed with hypertension hyperlipidemia, current pain, tobacco user, vitamin d deficiency, and Ptsd pressure was elevated. I had rapid pulse. I don't know. The 36.4 C is, but I'm assuming that's normal temperature. He prescribed me with acetaminophen tab Says I will be up going into for a CT scan and MRI .scan so they'll contact me. Hmm! I'm going to get some blood work. And I'm continuing on some medications, and I'm going back for a blood pressure check.
Is, that would be more than enough information. I think I don't think I'd look for all that personally, but it's good to know.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 so would you use or not use this page? And why?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Well, I mean yes, if I do not remember what I was told to do. So I would say, Yes, it is possible I could use this page.I definitely think it has a lot of value. If I needed to know stuff about that, especially if I was maybe cause I had TRIcare here from being retired. And I have Va. I used to be healthcare for so I use both for different things sometimes, and if I have to cross reference like what I'm what I'm doing for like, say, my annual physicals through the track here plan or if I'm doing my annual through the VA's usually good for me to know some of this information, so I would review it before I go to other appointments, especially if it's about the same thing. So like. If I was going to my Va healthcare provider for, say, left shoulder physical therapy, I would make sure that I could see how this would be useful to know what was said last time about my visit or my progress.

Notetaker: Participant found the information very useful incase he forgot what was said during his appointment. He would review this info before tother appointments, p.5:

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Thank you. Now, my next question is, did not want you to complete or do anything following your appointment.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It looks like I was supposed to pick up some medication, or it was going to be sent to me, depending on what? What we talked about. I'm supposed to go. I'm going to get followed up and get a Rheumatology consult. Looks like I am supposed to get some X-rays and ultra sounds. And I suppose to get three different tests today before I leave, getting blood draws. And I was supposed to follow up for a blood pressure check, and I have that. We’ll it looks like that’s about it.

Notetaker: Participant understood what Dr. Nutt instructed him to do, p.5.


00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Okay. Now I'm going to have you scroll the way up to the top.
And we're going to talk about the very first sections of the being that gray area, your appointment on June sixth. So everything just in that box, review the section and see if you can answer this. Can you provide an example of how you might utilize the information within this section?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Just the section. To do okay, to note who my provider was, and when I was there, and the reason for the appointment. And what my diagnoses are.

Notetaker: Participant answered that he would use “your appointment on June 6th” section to note who his provider was. When he was there and the reason for this appointment, p.6:

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So you would be referring to like multiple of these sections. Then.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Oh, wait a minute. Are you talking about just the one with the appointment?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Numbers, or just the times.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Everything in that green box. So everything you have this is in that gray box. So the you highlighted a couple of things to the providers, and the reason for the appointment and things like that. So you would utilize all that information is that what you're saying when you're pointing out all those different areas?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I mean I would hope I'd know who my doctor is, but I know that's not always the case. When I go to the Va. Some it rapidly changes.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So it would be good to know. I probably would want to know the diagnoses if anything changed. But other than that, no, I probably would not use most of this information.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
That. Was there anything in there that seems unfamiliar, confusing to you any terms?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Well, you see, it's kind of hard to say that, because I'm assuming if I had these diagnoses, some of these that they would have been explained to me, or I'd already know what they are, were, because definitely know what Ptsd is and I've got hypertension and but I've
got both of those myself, so I know what those are. I have no idea what hyperlipidemia is.

Notetaker: Participant says he know those terms because he has those condition, but he doesn’t know what hyperlipidemia is, p,6:
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Okay.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So, maybe if there was possibly it, maybe if it would be useful, and this is just me thinking out loud. If there was maybe something more simple for some of the more complicated terms if there was like a way like parenthesis  beside it, saying  high blood pressure instead of hypertension. But again, I know what those are, because, and I'm assuming my doctor would have explained to me what those are in person.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Okay, so something, though, that could explain it more simpler terms.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Simple layman's terms, I guess, would be good way to put that.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Now, I'm going to ask you another question about this section. So how would you to find the information in the you were diagnosed with section?If you could reward that.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Sorry about that.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000
That's okay, as you can reword or provide a definition of you were diagnosed with, what does that section mean to you?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000
This means that this is currently the conditions that I have medically, it would means that you know, this is the stuff I need to work or it's something that can be changed, or if it is, or it's just stuff that I have to get some treatment for or live with.

Notetaker: Participant believes “you were diagnosed with” is something that he was diagnosed with at an earlier time before this appointment, and not necessarily what he was diagnosed with during the June6th appointment p.7:

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Now, what if the title of this section was health conditions you discussed?
How would you define this section? Then?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Oh, well, that would actually be stuff that I talked with the doctor at that particular meaning.
So say like, if I'm if I'm somebody that's been with the VA.For a long time for multiple years. I don't. I would like it to say just if things change, or the things that I talked about to that day with the doctor. Not just like over a copy of everything I've ever been diagnosed with to the Va.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So how valuable or not valuable do you find the section, if we called it” health conditions You discussed”?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I would find that valuable if it's stuff we actually talked about during the visit.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
How valuable or not valuable do you find the section you are diagnosed with?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Not valuable at all unless it's something different.

Notetaker: Since participant believed that “you were diagnosed with” was something that occurred in the past, he doesn’t find that information useful in this AVS, however, he finds the information useful now after he was told that the section was “” health conditions You discussed” because it pertained to the actual appointment on June 6th, p. 8:

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Okay, so it's something new. Or, yeah, okay, I'm going to have you scroll down to section that's called Medication ordered for administration and Clinic.There we go. And what is the information under this section mean to you?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000
These would be, new. These would be any medications that were ordered for me, that we're new during the visits. So! Pretty much that.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
How valuable or not valuable! Do you find that information?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Very valuable.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Now, what if I told you the section displays medication you took, or that were administered while you were at the appointment? Oh, only there.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
OH hmm! I mean that would still be valuable, but I think I would rather I'd also like to know what was ordered for me. Long term. During that appointment to.

Notetaker: Participant believed that Medications that were administered during the clinic were his medications that were prescribed during that visit. It was unclear to him that those were meds that were given only during that appointment, p. 8

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Okay. No. If I can have you click on that, what do these medication terms mean?
And then review that and provide your initial impression.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory, active. I mean if I'm going through the Va. And they're telling me that I can refill it at the Va. I mean, that's pretty. I don't. Full. I mean, they're the ones who are giving it to me. In the first place, I'd assume it was coming through the VA pharmacy, the non-VA I guess this would be useful for people that have Non-VA prescriptions, or that the Va. Is not, going to give them something for some reason, because maybe a medicine they don't provide. That would be useful then, but I'd say I rarely would have any occasion to use that part The non-VA stuff.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.000
So how helpful or not helpful are these indication terms, then?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:24.000
It's helpful if they're active. But all the other stuff I mean I don't know why it would show anything, but that was, you know. That would make, I mean for me personally, if it wasn't active. What shown on there. In the first place.

Notetaker: Participant thought the active and non-active was self-explanatory. He didn’t feel that was useful for him because he gets all his meds from VA. But he did acknowledge that it would be useful for people who get there meds from Non-VA providers, p.9:


00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Okay.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
No, I see that you're getting a phone call.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Barge.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Yeah, I got you. I'll put it up. Thank you.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Hello! Sorry about that.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
That's okay. Right now, I just see your. You are sharing screen.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
But I do not see the prototype anymore.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Okay, 1 s. Is that better?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Great. Yes, I do see it now. We're going to talk about the next section, the “your treatment plan from this appointment”. I know you already kind of scroll through this, so if you can scroll through it again and comment on how you would utilize the information within this section.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Definitely the imaging to consultations, the lab test or the lab stuff. And what's been renewed, and the new orders definitely very helpful. All of this extremely helpful. Especially if the appointments are on the same day. Like, if I'm not doing the lab work right then, like the blood it shows I'm doing right. Then, you know, that would be helpful for me to know when, what date times and what I'm supposed to be for any extra.

Notetaker: Participant found the information under “your treatment plan from this appointment” very helpful and wasn’t confused by any terminology, p. 10:

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Okay.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Are there any words that seem unfamiliar or confusing to you in this section?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
No!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Okay, I want to have you scroll up towards those “medications and supplies”? I think you have. There you go, so just looking at medications and supplies. How would you describe the information in this section?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Again the active stuff like we talked about before. I don't know but that would be literally useless. But the what was renewed so that I know I have more prescription for.Say, however long the term is on these, that would be helpful.
Notetaker: Participant found the “renewed medications” valuable under medication and supplies section, p10:
 
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Yeah.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Okay, the more information about the medication, And then how does this “medication and supplies” information in the section differ from the “medications ordered for administration in clinic”? So that was under the previous grey box.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Correct, really no difference, except for the way I look at those sections is anything that's done during the clinic or during the visit, or added new would be better served in that other one.
The other section and they use are just the ones that I've been on, and that they're all together so that I can know that I'm still taking Xyz medication.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Okay. So the top one would be new, and things that you were actually given. And this one just renewed. Okay, so how valuable or not valuable do you find this section to be? And why?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
For the whole thing, or just as medication portion.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Just the medication portion.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
I find it, I find it helpful. Well, I don't know most of the medications that I mean. This is just me speaking for me. I've most of my medications I've been on for years, so if they're had been any changes, it would have been in the top setting.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
But it is nice to know that they were renewed, and that I got more prescription.
But I think that could also be found online. I don't know if it needs to be in every single visit Summary.
Notetaker: Participant correctly discerned the difference between “medication and supplies” and “medications ordered for administration in clinic”, p. 11: 

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Okay.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Now, what have you scroll to the next great section which is called “your health information as of this appointment”?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Okay.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Okay. I don't think we open that up so far. So I'm going to have you open it up and just review it and provide initial. Your initial thought the talk aloud. Did you review?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Alright! So this is my health information, and this summary is from February thirteenth. Primary care factor, primary care team. Shows, my upcoming appointments. And point notes, okay, problem list. And then all my immunizations! Alright, allergies! Lab results. And then a lot of medications again. Some Va. Glucose Supplies. Medications I’m Not taking. I guess, yeah, okay. Alright!

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Okay, so can you provide an example of how you might utilize the information within this section.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Well, I mean there's my lab results. I would be good. I guess I needed those for something.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000
And what would you expect? Cause this is like recent live results. What does recent mean to you? What would you want to see?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:45.000
I would. I guess I'd like to see the most recent, and that'd be the only thing.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
So the very last one you took!

00:22:46.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Actually, you know what for and I don't know if this is possible or feasible. But if those lab results have nothing to do with the type of appointment I'm going for now, what do why are they included in this summary so like, if I was going for an annual physical? And it showed me the last blood results I had for, say, my last annual physical, or if it was for something related to something, I'd gotten my blood drawn for a lot, then I'd want to see those but if it's a random blood work done for some other thing that has nothing to do with the reason why I'm like, Okay, I'm going for me.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Paying. We'll just use this an example. Why would I Want to see lab results about anything outside of I mean, cause I don't have lab results for that If I was going there to get an X-ray or like II would know II would think this would be a lot of information that was useless.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Okay. So you would want the lab results to pertain to. Why, you're going to this appointment. Yeah, okay.


00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:58.000
That visit. Yes, find all my lab results on me. If I needed to know them.

Notetaker: Participant doesn’t not want to see lab results unless they pertain to the actual appointment, p. 13: 

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Now, right where you're at. There you see something called recall appointment.
What is your understanding of a recall appointment? How would you define that?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:17.000
I have never! I have never! I've never heard of, know what a recall appointment is, or never had it used or never had to use it. Let's see, please. Maybe it's I tried to schedule something, and it wasn't available, or it was too far out. So they it would be a period of time before they can reach. I can recall probably and I get an appointment.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And what would be your guess?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Maybe I don't know.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
So. How helpful or not helpful is this information to you?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Its no help to me, since I don't know what it is.

Notetaker: Participant never heard of a “recall appointment” but guessed  correctly what it was. He said it is not valuable since he doesn’t really know what it is,p 13:


00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Okay.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
4, 40.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Now I'm going to have you scroll down. This is called “Problem List”.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Okay.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Now, what does this section tell you? How would you define it?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Okay. This would say, diagnoses that I've had any with. And I'm assuming those dates would be the first time that I was diagnosed with these problems.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
So how useful or not useful do you find this information? And why?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I would say, not useful, very much, probably waste to space. And it's only because I'm assuming I would know what my diagnosis are and how far back they go.
Now, if it was something new or something we just something it may have gotten worse or better during the appointment maybe that'd be useful, but I don't see how the date that I was diagnosed with something is ever going to be useful to me for a current appointment.

Notetaker: Participant expect the problems list to only pertain to issues brought up during this appointment, p, 14.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
For a couple of.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Alright. If you could scroll down to a section called “My Medications”; So how would you define the medication shown in this section?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:23.000
These are all the current list of medications that I would be currently taking. And the it sounds like the instructions on how much in went. I'm so to take them.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:32.000
So how does this? “My medications” information? In this section differ from the other medication section shown earlier on this document.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Definitely more detailed and it actually shows, like the refills remaining when it expires.
Last time I've used it again. If we're talking about just an after visit Summary, I don't know why I would want or need, unless it was one of the ones that were changed. So like in the.
Okay. I would only want to see things that changed. Correct, and it like cause. It has listed up top in a different section. It has all the medications that are currently active, that I'm taking.
So explaining to me how much and how often, how many refills I have left of those medications is not very relevant. And that's just to me. Personally, I mean it might be to somebody else. But for me no idea why, I would need to know that on this particular visit, summary like it, like I said, if I want to refill a medication, there's a whole different area that I can go to for that and that page has all that information more.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:39.000
But you did say above, you assume that what those other sections above contain all of your medications, so you still want to see a list of everything you're taking is that if I did, I interpret that correctly?

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Yeah, in the one section up there where it just had a list of other met all the medications I'm taking into that at the one step, the list above it, where it actually show what was changed.

Notetaker: Participant only wants to see mediations that were changed in this AVS, p.15:

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
And given. I would like all that, you know, differentiated. But down here all this is not very useful.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Okay.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Now I'm going to have you scroll to the final gray section.
It's called “more information” And before you click on it, oh, okay, what would you expect to sign under this section More information.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Maybe. Okay. So say, if I was there for something related to a type of diabetes that I can maybe, or some sort of short, I don't know. Maybe information about one of the diagnoses or places that are to get additional information. Maybe so. Say, if it's like Ptsd, maybe a link, or to the resource for, like, maybe mental health. Or again, I have really I don't even think we went further into any one of these than I've ever been before.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000
So!

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Okay, we'll click on that and review it, and then please share aloud your impression.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Okay, so behavioral health. I'm assuming that's on. There because I have a list of, or one of my diagnosis is Ptsd. Cardiology. That's the context. You're facing, because I have the hypertension. And I'm assuming that other h word up there has something to do with.
Maybe cardiology. So I actually, I think that's great.

Notetaker: Participant this there relevant information to his diagnosis in the “more information and he likes it,p.16: 

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
And you!

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:51.000
As the actual departments that may be service. Some of your more severe diagnose.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Now you already mentioned possibly wanting to see some education material on some of your diagnosis.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:10.000
But is there anything else that you would add or take away from this section?

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Not that I can think of off the top of my head.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:29.000
I don't know when I was looking, and maybe this is something I wasn't thinking about until now, but up at that top section where I had the actual. If we if we're talking about adding things, it might be useful.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Sure!

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Let's see. So the renewed one, or it may be, in any event, probably closer to the top the better. Maybe in this renewed section, or one of these sections up here, there's a link to the page in my healthy bit where you actually order.Or check to see, you know, like how many prescription you know, was just a link to another part of your profile.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.000
The takes you directly to that page, and my healthy Vet, where you can.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Okay.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
That refills Xyz.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
So, maybe don't. In the last section where we actually show refills.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Don't show it there. Just link you over to the other section.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
What you're saying.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:33.000
I wouldn't even put like I said. That stuff is all totally useless to me, but just a link somewhere that says, you know, if you want to refill, or we, you know or check on, you know, Xyz medications or see more information about what major currently taking you click that it takes you over to just a summary page or

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:45.000
the you know the face sheet, for where you can do anything you want with your medications, instead of wasting all of this space on all these different medication stuff.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Okay. Now that you're reviewed one after visited Summary we're going to pretend again that maybe this triggered a question about a different appointment. So I'm going to ask you now if you can review information from another appointment that you had in the past.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Sure! Let's see.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Do I need to select anyone I want, or . But.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Yeah, anyone you want?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Okay, on a scale from one to 5, one being very easy and 5 being very difficult.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
How easy or difficult was it to navigate to another summary from the.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Very easy, one.

Notetaker: Participant scrolled to the top and clicked on the Back button to get to another Avs, and he found it very easy, 1, to navigate to another AVS from the June 6th AVS, p. 18.


00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Now I'm going to ask you to go back to the list of all of your upcoming appointments. How would you describe what you see under this section?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:06.000
So you got up paying points. Monday, July first. But in it shows that it's a video call primary at 1230. I got to be at the same day. I guess I gotta be at the Portland Va. Medical Center in person. Friday, the sixth. It looks like an appointment has been canceled for some reason.
Again. August video appointment, a phone call very easy to navigate and understand.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Okay. Now, don't click on this next thing yet. But just looking at the pending link, what do you expect to see if you did click on it? Can you describe?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
I would expect to see the. Oh, well, that would be the one the ones that are.
Maybe there they're. I've either requested myself, or another physician, or another nurse, or another provider has put into the system, but they haven't been confirmed yet, either by me or the other person.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:16.000
And I know you already looked at the past. But can you describe what you expect under the past link?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Past link would be every Va. Appointment that I've had in the past.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Okay. Now, we're going to move on from using the prototype. But I still have a few questions for you, so you can leave the photo type up, or you can stop sharing your screen either way.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Yeah, go ahead. I'm listening.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
We're going to talk about notifications that you might want to receive about your after visit.
Summary. So pretend that you received the following message, the subject is new after visit, summary, and the contents are a summary of your recent appointment is now available on the healthy vet login to review the summary. Do you find this notification helpful or not helpful? And why?


00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Helpful, and I find it. I find it helpful, because I know it takes time for that
the after summary. Sometimes it could be a couple days before it's available, and I particularly and just me. I like to know when it's in there, so I can at least look at it to see if it confirms, or if it if it if it was something, maybe I forgot to do, I like I'm very proactive in anything like that, especially when it comes to the health.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:36.000
so I liked it. I get a notification that the summary is available.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
And how would you prefer to receive the notification?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
I would like an email for sure. May. Personally, I don't mind if I it's in a text, either or both.


00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.000
If that's an option.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Now I know some of the older people are. Some are not going to want them to be bombarded by text, and I wouldn't want to either.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
But if it's something like this that I signed up for if it was an option, a choice, I guess I would have it.I don't know if this is even a thing I've never looked into.It. If there was a when you're setting up this thing, or if there's a way to say, how would you prefer to be contacted?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:22.000
And there's maybe a check-in boxes, phone text or email, or you know, you could check all 3 if you want.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Okay, yeah. So you would want to set a preference and then have it sent to you. And you could change your preferences.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Correct.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000
What I'm hearing. Got it? Okay. If you had multiple appointments in one day, would you want one after visit?Summary notification for each appointment that day? Or would you want all the appointments combined into one message?

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Oh, that's a good one, trying to think real quick.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000
So I'm giving honest answer without.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Me. Personally, I like them separate unless they were about the same thing.
So like say I went, for I went to a primary care physician for a bump, or I brought.
I thought about mine. I broke something, so they send me to down the road.
The same day to get an extra. I'd like all that to be on one but if I'm going to multiple different providers for a lot of different reasons, I'd want separate ones, so that in the future, when I'm looking for a specific lab result, or specific summary on a certain thing it'd be easier and more concise for me to find like I wouldn't want to scroll through like if I went through 3 different providers for 3, for things I wouldn't want to scroll through one massive after visit summary to find what I was looking for i'd like that would be broken up.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
What if it was broken up? But just be like email or text was the same for the same day?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Oh, yeah, no, that would be fine.

Notetaker: Participant likes to get a notification for a AVS cause sometimes it can take a few days to update the AVS and he wants to know when its ready, He prefers email, but would also like a text message and would like an option to choose how he can receive the notification; Also, he would like one notification for the related purpose, p,19-21:


00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Yeah.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:04.000
If you, if you could change one thing about the after visit, summary experience that you saw today, what would it be?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Just those just those sections that I really told you were pretty useless don't know. Thanks. St that again. It's just me, I think. Cut out a lot of a lot of the stuff that is really never going to be looked at by anybody. And I think that would be that would be the most the thing I'd fixed the most like I just in general, I think it's not just a VA.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
This is healthcare in general is just so much information. That's just useless to most people. I mean, I'm assuming there's legal ethical medical reasons why they put a lot of that stuff in there. But the average person just wants to know certain things like, Hey, where's my lab results? Where's my results? What happened? What medications I'm on now like a slim down list. Maybe there's an option where you just see, like a the summary and it's very, very condensed and concise with like the most partner information. And there's an option with you. Can you can click a different link, and it take you to some crazy, you know more detailed version.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Okay.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
So, maybe if some of those things are useless, you just don't even have to click on them.
Or maybe if they're in there, but they're closed.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:30.000
So you don't. You don't even see them when you open that big tab so like I click on the one gray area, there's multiple tabs under it where I could say, Hey, if I want to see all the medications are currently on cool I can click that little plus button and it opens them all up, but if not, it stays shut, because I don't need to know what I'm already taking.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Okay.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Is there anything related to after After-vsit summary that I didn't ask you about, that you were hoping to share?

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
No, I'm pretty satisfied, actually, with I got no complaints with the Va. Healthcare system, or with my track here or then working together they've done a lot for me in the past, working together to get me the places I need to go.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
So I'm extremely satisfied with whatever the VA decides to do with the.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Well, thank you for sharing that. My very last question.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Do you have any questions for me related to afterwards in summary?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Okay.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
No, you've been very great. I'm I like a part of stuff like this because I mean, I know longer served.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
But I'd like to hope I can still make an impact in some way.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Yes, thank you. We really appreciate, appreciate you. Taking the time to share your thoughts with us today to your feedback.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:38.000
This is the way that we can make sure that it works for veterans this is invaluable before you go.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Sure!

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
I wanted to make sure just a few things that was clear, that what we just knew wasn't real.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
You haven't actually accessed Va. Gov. Account isn't just the prototype.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Correct.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
And then pairing will be sending you a thank you.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans, that you may know, and that'll give them a chance at participate in future research sessions just like you did today.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
So!

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Yes, absolutely. I have several people that would probably be willing to do that.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Fantastic. So thank you for your time, and enjoy the rest of your day.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
You as wellYou too.
