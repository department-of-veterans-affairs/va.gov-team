Participant 14 (Kristenâ€™s)
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, [Redacted PII] are you comfortable with me recording this video and audio today?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Yes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Okay. Great. Thank you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So I'd like to start by asking you your experience of going to the doctor's appointment, and after coming back from the doctor's well, you're still at the office.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Do you ever get some paperwork that that discusses what transpired during the appointment?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Things that you've discussed with your doctor things that he could have prescribed for you.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Do you ever remember receiving appointments like paperwork like that?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
No, I mainly get paperwork when I leave the doctor.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They send me back to like the receptionist, and then they give me like, you know, like, if I have like a future appointment, they'll give me that.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Okay? So it's nothing, nothing related to your health and your like lab work, or anything like that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
No!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Do you ever go on Va Dickev to reach that information or anywhere else?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Sometimes I will go to va.gov to get it, but if I do blood work I know it shows up there, so I will go to.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Okay. And so, yeah.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's my healthy vet, that's the you know what I mean. My healthy.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
That is the site. So when I go there it shows up there, and it may send a letter from you know, from the blood work, though.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Okay. And how often do you do that? Do you do it every time you see a doctor?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Is there a particular appointment that you that you focus more on it?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Mainly when I see the doctor and I have lot of lab work done normally, they'll send a letter don't I get the letter?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Then I'll go to the site. So they they'll give me a letter.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
What besides lab work? What else do you review?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
What the results are. And then I then I can go.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You know, in my healthevet.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Yes.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Appointment. Well, appointments aren't in my healthy that they're in the Va.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Dot go down a separate set that's mainly in my healthy, that, like just doctor's work.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I think I wanna check order pointless. But then I don't see them like that.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
When you say you don't see them like that, can you?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Elaborate on that, too.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
If I had like prior appointments. I don't see. It's not a easy place to get the. It's not a easy place to navigate where it's at.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Okay. So if you could easily get to prior appointments, would you be revealing the notes on there?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Yes.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Okay, so what would you call something like that? You know the online version, you know not the not what.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000
With the Va. Calls it in your own words. What would you think would be a logical name to call something like that?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
For, like your prior appointments and stuff.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Yeah, just like, paperwork on what transpired during the office.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Okay? Hey? Digital paperwork.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Okay.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Yeah, Prior Prior Office, Visit, Information that's the only thing that's kinda like popping up in my head.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
But I know when I go to the site there's no like button, or it's no way to, you know.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
You know what I mean to find it.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So there's there's no titles there that will give you a hint.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
That's what it is. Right?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Yes, yes, it's nowhere.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Yeah. It's no way to see it.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Okay, great. Thank you so much for that information. It's very helpful.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So now I'm going to send you a proto type in the chat.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So. Do you know where the chat is on the Android?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Yes, I see it.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.000

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Oh, so it should be in the chat.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Yeah, I just sent you something. I said, testing.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Yes, and okay, let me try to send it again.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Okay.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Okay, let me try. Let me try this. It may be going to.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Yup, I got it.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:59.000
How about now? Okay, my apologies.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The prototype. Come up, [Redacted PII] .

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It's loading now.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Okay.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Yeah, I see it now.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Okay.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Okay, excellent. So if you can get back on on the on the zoom, try to share screen.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And do you see an area where it says share screen on the zoom?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Yeah.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Excellent great, that's perfect. So if you can scroll to the prototype, great!

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
It was there a second ago.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Yeah. Just saw it. No.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Hold on!

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Oh, I'll share my screen. Hold on!

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Let me go. Oh, it's loads. Kind of slow. Okay?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Yes. Okay. Great.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Okay. So now, I'm gonna ask you to pretend that today is June sixth and your name is Hector, and you have an appointment this morning at 9 50 A. M.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:47.000
With, doctor, not your primary care, physician. At the sound. Ca, facility.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Yes.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000
A few hours have passed since your appointment, and you forgot what your doctor's instructions were during the appointment. So please use this prototype to find what you and doctor not discussed during your appointment, and also think out loud.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:30.000
So I'm gonna ask you to scroll around and see if you can find a way to get to the notes that from Doctor Not.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And if you can, please think out loud. [Redacted PII] .

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
It's okay.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess. Health history!

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Okay.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Review your care summaries and notes.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Allergies. Review your health conditions.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And he gave me notes right.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So it's not just notes. It's just information that you want to know about what you discussed, what transpired.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Okay, I'll try review case summaries and notes.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Okay.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And I'm just gonna remind you that appointment was on June sixth with Doctor Not.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Okay.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So I guess it would be primary care, active visit, Summary, and this is the summary right here.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So now I can go to details.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Excellent!

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:44.000
What hypertension you're diagnosed. Okay, down on blood pressure. Pause.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Respiratory temperature, bodiness.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So [Redacted PII] . Now I would like you to focus on your appointment. On June sixth.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Okay.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Oh!

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So please review that section and just talk out loud, and let me know if if there's any terms that are unfamiliar, or anything that's confusing for you in section.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Take your time. Just slowly scrolling down.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Okay. Reason for appointment was for hypertension.
And it's like you were diagnosed for hypertension.
Hypoglymia chronic pain, Tobacco. Use vitamin d deficiency. Ptsd.
The paulse. Respirations.Body, mass pains 3 procedures is the ultra medications. Order.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Medications ordered, is.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Given, once.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Do you just want to speak on loud? If anything I'm finding funny or like.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Exactly anything that's confusing. That's not really.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It's not really clear, you know, that's not common sense.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Uhhuh.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
The amino finishing tab like it's like given 650 milligrams. Po once.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I don't do you want me to take that once a day?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Do you like like? It isn't clear on how often you wanted to take it.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Okay. Alright. So you'd like more clarity on that on that.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Anything else in that section that seems unclear to you, or confusing if you can.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Procedure,  
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Okay, so you want more context for the ultrasound.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Yes.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Okay. And as you scroll up again, if you can scroll up slightly again and just let me know.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:49.000
With the information that's displayed here. How would you utilize this information?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Can you provide an example how you would use this?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Paying, these are the first shows that that he gave me in the .

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.000
When we did it, you know, I guess when you know, when I went to to the doctor.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I guess the way the weight and the height and the temperature. I guess this. The European standards, not the American standard.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Uhhuh.      

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So so I wouldn't know how to read those off hand.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Okay, so would you prefer that? There!

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
That they're displayed in American or.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Yeah, like, 80, so 88.7 kg is I don't know how many pounds that is.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So so that's how I'm kind of used to reading it.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Yes.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Same thing. With what height you know what I mean like, just like 5, 11, or 6, 2, or something like that in the temperature 36.4.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Celsius. I know we use Fahrenheit, so it's I wouldn't know if this is high.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I don't know if my temperature is high or low. What you know.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Okay.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
That in respirations.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Okay.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
What does that mean? Like? I wouldn't know what that I don't know what that means.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
What do you think it could mean if you had to guess?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Spontaneous sitting. I guess I think I guess it means what's your heart rate is when you're sitting.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Okay.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
But II don't know.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So you'd like that in more plain language. Maybe.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Yes, and posts up oxygen. I don't know what that means, neither.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Can you guess what that means? Just give me any guess.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Post posts.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Oh! Oh! Like your post! Is your heart rate so it's your heart rate.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I don't know. I've seen actually, Metri. I don't know what actually actually means.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Okay.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
But I know a pulse is, and over blood pressure is blood.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Pressure is high.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:39.000
So what would you prefer them to do other than adding plain language there? What else would you prefer them to discuss on here, to make it easier for you to to read through this information?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Better, plane, language.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Better plain language, cause even like you were diagnosed with hypertension.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Hyperlip media like is that high cholesterol.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
What do you think it is?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Okay.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I think that's what it means. I think that what that means cause it's it's.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And I know.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Okay. So the term you were diagnosed with, what does that mean to you?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Okay.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Within the context of this appointment. When you're reading this.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So if I came in with hypertension.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And then all this other stuff like what does that check for the other stuff?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
You know what I mean?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:49.000
You know, like, if it's just from a hypertension, or you know, did you see me from my Ptsd.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
So it's.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Did you see me from my vitamin d deficiency like, you know, the got like that part of me?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So it's not clear to you why those are there.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Right, like I have a diagnosis for it. But is my appointment just for this, or is it for everything? Or what like?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I'm thinking it's just for the hypertension. So.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:14.000
So what if I told you? It's it. It means health conditions that you discussed with your doctor during that visit?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Is that clear? By that? But that's what it is.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
No!

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
What would you have liked it to say?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Reason for appointment. You were diagnosed with.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Either make another section that says we.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
You know we you were diagnosed with, and then it's like we discussed.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:53.000
During your appointment. Hypertension, hyper, ledger, chronic pain, tobacco use, you know. Right? It's like, say what you talked about in the meeting cause.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Yeah, so you wanted to use other just plain language to describe instead of your diagnosis.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Is that what you're saying?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Right? That's just yeah. That's saying what my problem is.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Right.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
But we may not have talked about my problem like or we might only talked about one thing.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
You know what I mean. I think when you go to primary care, I think he tries to touch everything.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
You know what I mean. But what if he skipped something? Yeah, I don't know.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Or if he just focuses on something like this person's blood pressure is high, like I know he may have just mainly focused on that.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Yes, exactly.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:42.000
You know what I because it's pretty high, so it's he may not, you know, like, if his Ptsd isn't, is it?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000
You know he may not you know I mean he may take his medication for Ptsd, so it may not be an issue, so so he may not have discussed that.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
So same thing with chronic pain. His chronic pain was low.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
So you know, he may just been like, well, how's your pain?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
My paintings fine. Okay, keep it moving.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I'm great. Okay, thank you for that. I'm gonna direct you down to medications.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Order for administration. In this clinic. So when so you read this, what does this mean to you?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Oh!

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:27.000
When you write this, what did you think this the medicine is for? And.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Alright. I'm going. I'm guessing it's for his hypertension.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Okay.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Because that's what the appointments for. But it isn't clear what it's for, and I mean it is unclear what it's for, and it doesn't say how often they take it.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And it doesn't. Hey, it doesn't say what the what it, what like. If it's for hypertension, it's for Ptsd. Is this for?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Is that anything like it doesn't say you know what it's for.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:10.000
It doesn't give, and it says once daily, once in the morning, once at night, does it matter by?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Like it's just a daily. Go ahead.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Okay, so what if I? So what if I told you this medication was given to you during your medical appointment while you were at the doctor's office?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
No!

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Is that clear from the way it's written?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
No, because it says, Give it, says, give 6, 50 milligrams.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
If if he was at the doctor's point, it would have been like given given 650.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
You know what I mean? Milligrams once at you know you could say the time like 12.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
You know the the point was at 9 39, 40, a.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
M. And a date, or whatever.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000
So you'd actually like dates and times, and of when this was administered in the office.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
So it's more clear. Is that correct?

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Correct, because it's not clear. Now it's just says, give like.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
It doesn't say if it's given or not. You know what I mean.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
This is, give. So I'm thinking it's, if it's me I'm looking at.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
It's saying that he hasn't taken it yet.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Ready. Okay. Can you open up the glossary up top?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000
That says, what do these medication terms mean?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Tell me what you think of these?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Active for perception that can be filled at the local pharmacy.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Active means that you currently have to take it.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Not be a medication that came from someplace, else.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Okay, this may be a prescription from either the meeting or other providers that was filled outside the Va.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Or maybe over the counter, or boom.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Okay, okay, active means that the Va is giving it. And then, non da, is that the non va does not purpose right?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
That's.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Yes.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
That's the way I'm understanding it.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Yes, so did you find it hard to get to that point, or was it apparent right away?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Pretty apparent medication that comes with the place that within the Va pharmacy this may be prescription from even from either the Va. Or other providers.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
That was filled outside the Va.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:37.000
That part is that second sentence is a little confusing.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Which one?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
This may this may be a prescription from either the Va.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Or other providers that was filled outside the Va.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000
So is that saying the Va. Doesn't prescribe it, but the Va. Can fill it.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Okay, so that's unclear to you.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Yes, it's unclear.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Okay, so how would you use this information?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
If I'm the patient.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Yes, if you are Hector.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Cause. I'm Hector. I'm using the information to see what prescriptions they've given me for the Va.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
So!

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Hey? Do you find this information valuable or not valuable?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Fairly valuable if I need, especially if I need.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
I mean, that's I mean Tab.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
It's a tablet right?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
I'm not sure to be honest with you.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Yeah, yeah, you may wanna put that in.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:24:02.000
But yeah, cause sometimes, when you're apply it for benefits, or if you or if you're or if you're just talking to another doctor, and they're like, what type of medication that you're on like, some of you a lot of these, you don't know

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:14.000
them it when you take a medication, you know, just to take the pill, but you don't necessarily know the name of it off hand, like, you know, like, if it was we had a fortune had to spell it.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Okay.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
I wouldn't know how to sell this. So so yeah, so the central place to have it so that I can get to it so I can copy and paste it somewhere.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Yeah.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Okay, so would it help to have like. So what in particular, the medication or the directions, the Po ones?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
The Medication.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
The medication. So like maybe have a little glossary there, with that help for.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Oh!

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Maybe a little while.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
No, I gotta give a book. But yeah, you know what I mean.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Yes. Okay. So, I'm gonna move on to the next section.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Okay.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Thank you for that, [Redacted PII] . So so we're gonna move on to the your treatment plan from this appointment.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:12.000
And I'd like you to scroll through that and think out loud and again, if anything is confusing or unfamiliar to you, please.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
I'm sorry. That's that's our fault.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Okay, okay, not a problem would have technology consulting is that the ultrasound?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
I'm sorry.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
The rule of what Rhode Islandology.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.000
His name is Doctor. Not? Where are you looking at? I'm sorry.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Yes.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
And you see the bullet.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Oh, yes, rheumatology. Yes.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Okay. Rheumatology is what?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Okay.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Okay, so that's a condition. So and you thought it was a doctor.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Is that what you thought? I'm sorry.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
I don't know what the condition is. I don't know what the condition is for.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Okay. But initially, you thought it was a doctor's name right?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Oh!

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
No, no, no, no, no, no! I didn't know what route it. I didn't know what it was for.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Okay.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Imaging for Ct and MRI scans, you will be contacted by images, services for your appointment for X results.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Please. Report 2 engaging services, is a specific preparation that's required.

If a specific preparation is, it will inform you.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Is this what he's getting off for?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Could you repeat that, John?

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Where? Says imaging, app the 3 bullets?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Yeah.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Is that what he's getting off stand for?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000
That? That's the question I need to ask you. Do you think that?

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
I would not. I think that.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Why is that?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Because we don't cause it doesn't say it.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Okay.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
So it's not clear to you.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
No!

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:59.000
And it's like, isn't an appointment, or is this an appointment, or is it something that I just walk up to get it?

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
So you'd like to know that information.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Yeah.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
It's unclear about whether it's an appointment or a walk-in situation.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Right cause. It doesn't really like they might getting.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Am I getting a MRI? Am I getting the office? Well, I guess I guess getting Theri.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
You know you can get an MRI on a thing.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Yeah, you'll be contacted right? So I don't know if this is an appointment.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Okay.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
I don't know if this is X ray. So if it's X-ray, I'm just walking into the building if it's MRI I need to make an appointment like, yeah, yeah, this is Unclear and it says, MRI, brain.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
So yeah, you know, I mean, MRI is the brain and sort of contacting with that.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:53.000
But the other 2 I don't. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if it's I don't know.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Okay. Great. I'm just gonna ask you one more thing.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Did not ask you to do anything after your appointment with him this morning.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Did he give you any instructions for anything?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Didn't give me any instructions. I can look around right.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Yes, yes, you can look around.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Remind me for a flu shot.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:42.000
And a post deployment screen screening.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Other instructions. Call back to Smith when you return from Seattle and the call Dr. Smith.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Okay, anything else in your free to scroll up more if you'd like.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And then they're supposed to check my blood pressure in October.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
I think that's all I see.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Okay.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:25.000
I would have gotten these today.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
So when you mean you would have gotten those today, can you?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
What you mean by that?

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:40.000
When I had the appointment, I would have gotten these lab tests correct for the cam 8 goaltop serum, the lipid profile goal.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
And vitamin d total.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Okay, so are you saying this is what you already got done at the clinic.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Is that what you?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Yes, that's the way I'm interpreting it. Yes.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Okay.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Alright! What if I told you that this is actually his directions for you to get the blood tests after the medication?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
F. I'm sorry. After the visit. Is that clear?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Clear.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:22.000
It's unclear in this description here, but I know, like in a visit, it's kinda well in my dealings with the Va.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
It's kinda they send you to. You know what I mean, like after the clinic they'll send you.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
They normally try to send you there that day.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Okay.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
So he would. He would have told you in that, you know.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Like, if if you got time to go today, go right now.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
You know what I mean to to handle that, and then you would have told you know what I mean.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Okay, I got time to do it. You know what I mean.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
I'll go up to the third floor whatever to get the test done.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
But you would say, Well, I gotta run. I can't do it today.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
And then, you know, I'm thinking that would have changed so.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Me looking at it. It looks like he, you know, that that he got this done.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Yeah, so let's say, you did forget to get the lab test.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Right.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Yeah, to run somewhere. And you look back on this. Would you have known?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
No!

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
That this is a direction from him.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
No!

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Yeah.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
No. Okay. What would you have liked to see in here for them?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
To display here for you, for it to be more apparent to you.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
You could say scheduled. You know what I mean.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And then, when it's completed, complete, completed.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Okay.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Alright. Next I'm gonna have you look at the medications and supplies.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Just gonna have you read that through? And I'd like to ask you once you read it through, how does this section differ from the medications that were up on top before this one?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
So I'll let you read this, [Redacted PII] .

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
This section only place changes to your medication. Regimen PC.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Or complete medication lists under that on going careful. Well, so I have 4 medications that are renewed.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Okay.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:35.000
20 milligrams for the milligrams. That's what they renewed.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
So what does that section mean to you like renewed?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Okay, it says that it's renewed. But in one context.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000
When I'm thinking it's to be mailed out like they're sending me this.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
I'm asking for for more of it. So.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Okay, does that mean that?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Or wait. No, no, it doesn't. No, no cause.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
It could be cause. Your medication is gonna expire.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I'm sorry cause medications can expire, so cause he only, like primary care, like you, may have been on it for years.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:31.000
So the year comes, and he you know what I mean. He can either, you know, if you don't need it anymore, he'll he can give you a lower dose and give her hired those he can, you know, so that's what I'm thinking when he's saying

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Yes.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
renews do you know what I mean? You can renew at a higher dose you can just you know what I mean.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Get rid of, you know you don't need a medication no more, etc., etc.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Okay, so how does this section differ from the other one that we saw earlier?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:51.000
That, said the medications, giving at that clinic.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
How do you find them different?

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Yes.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
The one that I saw at the top right like this one right here.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Yes, exactly. How does that differ?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:12.000
The one at the top is a new medication, and these are the current ones that are that are changing.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Okay. So when you say current ones, that means that you are on them.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Yes.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Or so you are on the prior to the appointment.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Yes.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Is that what you're saying? Okay, what if I told you that the medications are the ones that were given prescribed to you, or change during this specific appointment?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Is that clear to you or not? Clear?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
No, it's not clear.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
What would you have liked to be said here to make that more clear?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
The date.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
The date of what?

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:02.000
The date of when he renewed them. So if he like, if I went to my appointment, and he said, I wanna renew all your medication.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
So the ford is listed here, he could say, renewed on 6.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Today's the sixth, right? 6, 6, 23, renew 6, 6, 23, you know, you know.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
The other day the day of yeah.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Okay, so do you find this part valuable? Just listing these here after what I told you, do you find it valuable or not valuable?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Cause. It's a place, a central place where I can go, you know, to get a list of my medications. Yes.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Okay, right? So I'm gonna move on now. So let's take a look at your health information as of this appointment.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
And.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Where's that?

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
I'll have you look for it.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
My health information.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Yes, it's titled your health information as of this appointment.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
So if we can go back to the same page, and I'll direct you to.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Okay.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
If you could go back to the June sixth with Doctor.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Not. If you can follow through with review, yeah, and hit on details with June sixth, yeah.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
And I really wanted to get most of these questions.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000

I'll have you to go.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Yeah, this is everything. We just went over consultations, consultations, imaging.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000

Yeah, this information is as a February thirteenth. Okay?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Appointments in the next 13 months. Okay, so you got one in August.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
We call appointments.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
What is? What's the recall appointment?

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:43.000
That's what I'm gonna ask you, what's your understanding of that?

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
If you can think out loud.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Okay. When you call you'll be assigned a confirmed appointment, date and time.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
I don't know cause the Va. Doesn't do.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Walk in walking the appointments. See your primary care.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
So you're not sure what we call acquaintances.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
No, I'm not.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Okay.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:20.000
How about? Let's go to the problems list. Can you tell me what that means to you?

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.000
The problems list.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:40.000
I guess these are the things that I guess when you test the when you tested me, that you know what I mean issues that you saw, you know, I mean, like if my hypertension is high at hyperlipids are high.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
You know what I mean. Tobacco use is high.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Yeah, I haven't had my info ones that I haven't had my Covid test.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
So things that may need shots for.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Uhhuh.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
So, yeah.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
This is so, does that.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
So that's how it is. Is so.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
I'm sorry. Could you just repeat what you thought?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Problems list was.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Problems listed like the issues, like the like issues that you that you're seeing like problem areas that like hypertension like, like, if your blood pressure is high, hyperlip being like, if your high, if your cholesterol is high like if you're a

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:42.000
smoker. If you're a smoker, you know, like any you know, like you need any immunizations.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Okay.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Or do you need? And if you need any shots?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
So!

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Like.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:59.000
So? What if I told you, [Redacted PII] , that this is the diagnosis for this appointment?

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
No!

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Is that clear for you from this list that this was a diagnosis.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
No!

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
What would you have liked it to say?

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Okay.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Hypertension diagnosed on hyper liminic diagnosed on.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
[Redacted PII] , I just have a quick question for you.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
We're supposed to keep you only an hour, and it's 1031.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:38.000
We had some technical issues in the beginning, so we can either us end this session and you'll be, you know, free to go, or you can stay on and there's no obligations if you if you can stay on a few more minutes.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
But if you're running, whatever you decide.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
I could do. Probably 10 more minutes. Is that okay?

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Okay, Tim. Okay, sure, yes, that's perfect. Thank you so much.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Okay.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Okay.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Alright, so!

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Okay.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Alright. So I'm just gonna ask you now, let's say you wanna look at another after visit Summary from a different day , how would you go about navigating there from this page?

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Let's say you wanted to look up another appointment.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
What would you do?

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:39.000
So I'm gonna try to go back.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:46.000
I guess this is. This is the list of my appointments.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000
And I guess II would go here to check.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
So if I wanted to check like for April eighth, I guess I would check this.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Yes.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
You know what I mean? The one right on. Yeah. Do you want me to click that or no?

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
You can if you'd like but I don't know if it's clickable.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:09.000
But okay, okay, okay. Great. So now, done with the prototype.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
I just have a few more questions to ask you.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Okay.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000
And these are in terms of notifications that you get from the Ea.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:28.000
So, I'm gonna give you an example of a notification for an after-visit summary from your doctor.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:41.000
And the subject says new after visit, summary, and the contents say a summary of your recent appointment is now available on my healthy bed.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Login to review the summary, so would you find this notification helpful or not helpful?

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000
And why?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Where would the notifications? Would it come by phone call or email, or?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
What? How do you normally get them?

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
And normally don't.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000
You normally don't get any notification. Okay, so tell me, how would how do you prefer to get them?

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Well, well, well, I guess email, email, I guess preferably.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Okay, that's your preference. Okay?

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Yeah. But I do get notification in the mail normally.
I get mail notification that the lab tests of what the lab tests are.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
But I don't get nothing that goes on my healthy that you know what I mean by name.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Yeah, it goes directly into healthy. But, okay.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
There's nothing. Yeah, like, I'll get. This. I'll get like a physical mail.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
You know what I mean?

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Okay. So if you had a preference to do anything, what you wanted, what would it be?

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Okay.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Email to say, like, the results are in my healthy event.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
And then I could just go look and my healthy let me just view, you know, just.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Okay, so you wouldn't expect to after visit summary to be in your email.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:01.000
You'd expect to get a notification of the email that it's in my health event, right?

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Yes, yes.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
And do you find that, helpful or not helpful?

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
It would be helpful like I've gotten it to snail mail.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Yeah.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
I've gotten regular mail, so when it gets regular mail, then I'll just stack.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
But it's counter that's counter product.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Yeah.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
It's redundant. So what? 4?

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Yeah. So so if you had multiple appointments for one day scheduled, and you had an after visit, summary notification, would you prefer an after visit, summary notification for each appointment separately.Or would you like one notification that lists all the after visits, summaries in one?

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
To go.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000
You could do it. Good question. You could do the one email, but just make it.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
That has you all the visits in there. Just make sure that they're all there.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Yes.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
You know what I mean? Just that. If I have 5 appointments, so I have 3 appointments, 3 separate emails.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
You can have the one, you know it is just the summary, you know. Just make it clear.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.000
You know, and just have the summaries, you know. Just make it clear, you know. Just make it clear. You know you have 3 appointments today, and then you know your summaries are in link. You know what I mean.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Check my healthy vet. For this, you know, for your primary care, or for your blood work.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:40.000
If you can change one thing about the whole after visit. Summary that you just visited with Hector, what would that be?

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
If you can change anything on that page.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Can I look at the page again?

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Yes, please.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:04.000
We were diagnosed with. I guess the date of the diagnosis.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.000
So you'd like dates right? Cause I remember you did mention dates and other things, too.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Yeah, yeah. You were diagnosed with this. On this you were diagnosed with this on this.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Dates. Okay. Great.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Yeah, oh, that and that, and but I don't think the Va.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Does this. But the way to height the temperature just makes them the American standard.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Okay, yeah, we'll definitely take that into consideration. This is for you.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
This is for veterans. So if the you know, there's the Vpa.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Can change things. The way to accommodate the veterans.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
So!

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Yeah, like the like, the normal American veteran, you know.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:51.000
If they said 88 kg, they're going to think that 88 pounds of it.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
They're not to say they're stupid, just they're not going to know how to convert that.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
So!

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Right? Right? It's yeah. It takes more effort to convert.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Right.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
And lastly, do you have any questions for me?

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
No!

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Okay, [Redacted PII], thank you so much for today, we really appreciate your patience and staying on a little longer with us, your feet is very helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure that it really works for the veterans before you go.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
I just wanna make sure that everything we did today wasn't real.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.000
We didn't access your va.gov, and also that per gene will be sending you a thank you.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Note within a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans, that you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in future studies with us.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Okay.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
And again. Thank you so much, and have a good day.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Bye, bye!

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Send you have a good day. Bye.
