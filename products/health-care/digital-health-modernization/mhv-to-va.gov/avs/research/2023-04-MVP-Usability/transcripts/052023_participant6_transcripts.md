00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay, let me hit. Record to cloud. X. And I actually see now that our second observer has joined.Let me admit them.
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Hey, [Redacted PII], do you want to introduce yourself to the group?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Hi!. Redacted PII I'm the senior product manager for the appointments team on Va.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Hmm! Welcome!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Thank you. Okay. Now that I actually, I click record right before we did that introduction, can you confirm on the record? Are you comfortable with our record? My screen audio, as we talk today?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Yes.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Fantastic, so now we'll get started with what I call warm up questions.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And we'll start by learning more about your experience. Reviewing information about what was discussed during your medical appointment. So, Do you ever recall receiving paperwork as you left for your appointment or reviewing information online?That kind of provided an overview of what was discussed during your medical appointment or procedure.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Okay.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Hmm! Sorry. Let me so I see, I guess I've never received paperwork, but I always review the notes in my healthy vet, so I don't know if that's a yes or a No.
Notetaker: Participant doesn’t remember receiving a AVS from VA; but does review providers notes on My HeatheVet.
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Okay, so can you tell me a little bit more about what you do? Review in my healthy vet, so what's type of information? Is there? And what do you find particularly valuable on that information?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Yeah, I reviewed that so that I can see how the doctor, or whoever I saw, interpreted what I was saying. If they, if they heard what I intended to convey, there we go.
Notetaker: Participant reviews providers notes to ensure provider understood what they wanted to convey, p,2:
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Now, is there any appointment, type, or procedure that you really take a closer look at that documentation compared to other types of appointments?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:37.000
My primary care. I always look closely at those notes.
Notetaker: Participant always reviews primary care’s notes, p.3:
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now, if you were to actually to receive a piece of paper, or something that was that review of everything that you talked about with your doctor, what would you call that? Or what would you like, What name would you give to that?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
An overview or a summary. There we go.
Notetaker: Participant would call that paper or discussion an overview or summary, p.3:
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The next. I'm actually going to have you review a prototype, and I'm going to send you a link in zoom chat.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Redacted due to Participant having technical issues with Zoom’s Screen Share.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Great. Okay, so now we're going to play, pretend, and pretend that today is June sixth, and your Hector, you can see Heather Top here just for today, and you had an appointment this morning at 9 50, with Dr. Nutt, who is your primary care physician at the Puget Sound, VA facility. So few hours have passed since your appointment and you forgot what your doctor's instructions were. So use this prototype to find out what Dr. Knutt, and you discussed at your appointment, and to like you can give me directions, and I'll click on anything. I'll scroll up and down and share your thoughts as you're reviewing what's on the screen.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Okay, sorry. It's a little small. I can. So, if I click on appointments, I can't read what's in blue under there.
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Okay, let's see if I can. Let's see what I can do.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Oh, I'm sorry! So if I was trying to review notes I would not click on appointments. I would keep scrolling down past messages, past notifications, health records. There we go. Can you read me the 3 Blue?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Yes, I can. Yeah, I was going to try to see if I can make it bigger.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Okay.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
But I can't, so it's the test results.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Health history and share medical records. Well, it's. Trying to think what I usually how, how I usually get to view notes. Health, history. I guess, is the second one. Health records health history. Yes.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Okay, can you see this page?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Let's see care summaries and notes again. I can see that. What's the same blue under care? Summary in notes. Review, your care, summary. Yes, I would click on that.
Notetaker: Participant chose Care summaries to get to the AVS,.p.5.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And I can't read. All I can see is care summary, and notes.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Okay. Let me see if I can. Let me stop sharing this with. See if I can get the screen bigger.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
No, let's actually try one more time. To see if we can get it up on your side.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Cause. It might be a lot easier to view on your side. Then.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:14.000
That's what I'm working on. I just I oh!

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
There!

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Okay. Can you see mine, Now?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I cannot!

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Oh, okay, I thought I had it figured out, but I guess not.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
So!

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And I can't. Oh, gosh! Now I've now I've lost zoom!

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
There we go. Okay.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Oh!

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Oh, wait here we I see your screen now. Great!

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Oh, okay. Excellent.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:00.000
You did it. Okay? Then, if you can go to go in zoom, I don't know if you still the prototype, …, or Oh, there you go!

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
You did. You scroll right by past it?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Okay.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
It was like the third one. Over there we go. Okay.
Notetaker: Participant had no comment on the initial AVS overview,p.7.
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Okay, there we go. Alright. Okay.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.000
So we will let me say the prompt again of like what you know, what we're playing. Pretend so, Oh, okay, I got it summary after June sixth. Great. Okay? So yeah, we're looking for June 6 to your appointment with Dr. Nutt and trying to find out what you guys talked about.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Oh, okay.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Okay from here. What would you do?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Okay.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Hey, yeah. Yeah.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Wow! Goodness! I have high blood pressure, lots of pain.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Okay, so.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Yes, I was like, keep reviewing this page and talk a lot as you're reviewing it.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Okay. So what we talked about were those issues we had, hey…? See you, ordered CT. And MRI. Labs. He renewed for prescriptions. Suggested that I get it suggested, or I did get. I did get a flu shot. Oh, if deployment screen! And let's see. My! The doctor his full team. Other appointments. Shots, result, lab results. Oops, sorry and meds. Previous meds that I've taken. And I'm not sure what the more information is.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Okay.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
But yes, so is that what you were looking for? I mean for taking to hear from me?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Sure. Yeah. So after doing this review of this, did document want you to complete or do anything following your appointment?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Oh, I didn't read that closely. Oh, let me! Can I review? Can I review the notes again?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:14.000
That's okay. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Did he want you to complete or do anything following your appointment.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Okay. Did he want? Say the question again, okay. Following, the appointment.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000
So new orders I'll be contacted for referral from Radiology.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Ct. Mris for my hand, or Yeah, and.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Help help checks!

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Okay.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Well, I'm sorry I'm feeling like the answer should be, yes, but other than going and following up with the other referrals, I'm not seeing any post appointment instructions.
Notetaker: Participant couldn’t find the instructions that Dr. Nutt wanted him to do after the appointment, p. 10:
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Okay.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
That that is absolutely a perfect answer. We want to understand what stands out to you when you're reviewing this.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Okay.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
So now I'm actually going to have you go up to the top and we're going to review the very first. Accordion in the first day, so that your appointment on June 6, can you scan that?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Okay.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
But I was like, can we take a closer look at that and talk through this section and let me know?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000
If you could provide an example of how you might utilize the information in this section?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Okay.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Sorry. I guess I'm and provide an example of how I might utilize this section.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I'm not.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Yeah. So once you review it, what does this information tell you like, what is valuable to you or not?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Oh, okay.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Valuable like. How?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Yeah.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Okay, alright. So I would definitely review the diagnoses. I like the fact that the vitals are listed right there. They aren't always. It tells, you know. He used the ultrasound. Yeah, and it and Meds ordered this visit. So yeah, go ahead.
Notetaker: Participant would review diagnoses, vitals, and the meds the doctor ordered for the section “your appointment on June 6th”, p. 13.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I was going to stop you on that medication side part. If you can scroll down so particularly for this section, how would you define? What is shown in that section.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Hmm! The it tells the meds name, and how it's I don't know what how to say it. It's a tablet, not a capsule, or a gel, or it gives the dosage and I'm not sure what I think PO means once daily. Is that right? But I'm not pause. It doesn't. Give in clear instructions how often to take it like as needed, or once daily or yeah.
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Okay.
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000
And how valuable we're not valuable, is it?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Seeing this information and or reviewing this information particularly, just as medication. It would be more of it. Is, it is valuable information, but it would be more clear if it specified in clear English, not pharmaceutical shorthand. How often to take it!
Notetaker: Participant was unclear on what the June 6th appointment section contained and why it was there instead, he commented how the med should be listed in plain language instead of pharmaceutical shorthand, p.13:

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Now, what if I told you? This section displays medications that you took or that were administered while you were actually in your appointment. What do you think about reviewing that information?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Oh!

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Yeah, it does say that right there. Sorry I wasn't. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yes, that would be very helpful.

Notetaker: Participant was unclear that the medication was administered during the June 6th appointment, but he said it is very helpful to know what was given to him during the appointment, p. 14:

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Now, I'm actually going to have you scroll up. There's a section called you are diagnosed with, and we'll stop on there. No. Can you define like? How would you define the information in this?

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:57.000
I'm not sure. Can you be more specific? I don't know what you mean by how would I define it?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Mean, can I define the terms used, or how? Okay?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Right.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
No, not the no, yeah. So not like what hypertension is, but what the overall section is trying to tell you. So, for you were diagnosed with what's another way, you would say that.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Well, I like you were diagnosed with, or I guess here's what we found.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Okay.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Now, what if the title of the section was “health condition you discuss”?How would you define that?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Well! I would! I think that there's a difference between a discussion about and diagnosed with. So just because we did, it doesn't mean it's an actual diagnosis. I think that I think you were diagnosed with this much more specific.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Okay, now, between those 2 things. So you are diagnosed with or health conditions.You discuss which one do you find more valuable or not valuable? And why?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Well, I like you were diagnosed with, because it's more specific. If we just discussed it, I would like to see that in the Notes section.

Notetaker: Participant thought there was a difference between “what you were diagnosed with” vs “Health conditions that were discussed” , he didn’t think they were the same thing, he found you were diagnosed with more valuable because it was more specific p.15:

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Okay. No, I'm actually going to have you scroll down to the next accordion. The “Your Treatment Plan from this appointment”. You can open that up, and then, if you can take a detailed look in all this and share your thoughts as you're reviewing it.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Oh, sorry. Share my thoughts. Okay, so pardon me.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:17.000
I have a referral, and will be contacted by rheumatology as well as imaging, for. Let's see. I'm assuming that on my hands they're just going to X-ray. And then, MRI, of my brain. So with, Oh, that okay lab tests. They're going to draw blood. Medicine, Supplies. Renewed for meds. Blood pressure check. They they'll recheck my blood pressure in a few months. Health Reminders. Let's see your I've already gotten the flu shot in the screening, and I should receive a call from Doctor Smith when I return from the Seattle area.
Notetaker: Participant understood that he had to follow up on the things listed on Your Treatment Plan from this appointment but was unclear what some of the meds were, p. 17.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Now there are any words or terms in this section that are unfamiliar or confusing.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.000
I guess. Well, I know what the lipid and the vitamin d like on the labs. I don't know necessarily what the chem ate is. And the meds. I know what a omepzeole and are for Tracedonia. So, I don't know what the term solution is other than that's all I mean. That's I'm familiar with the rest of it.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
So would you want to add or remove any information in the section?

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Hmm! Hmm! No, I don't think so.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.000
And how could you, after doing this? How could you utilize this information? So what would you do with this after reviewing it?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
I don't know that I would do anything necessarily with it. I guess I might double check within the app to make sure that I would go to the Pharmacy section and make sure that in that section the orders had been renewed. And I, because there's nothing, I could put in my calendar yet for the Referrals cause I have to wait for them to contact me.
Notetaker: Participant would go to the medication section in “Your Treatment Plan from this appointment” to ensure his medications were renewed, p. 18: 
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Okay. No, since you're particularly on that medication section, right there, “medication and supplies”, how would you define because We already reviewed a section with medication. So how would you define this section compared to the section you saw?

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:01.000
You mean the section of Meds that we that I took in the appointment?

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Oh, okay.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Yeah, so, how does this? How does this section differ? And how would you define this one?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Well, this one is simply a list of renewed. The other section was, well, I guess they're similar. I guess it tells the drug. How it's delivered and the dosage. So they're very similar.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Now, how valuable or not valuable do you find this medication section? And why?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:30:01.000
I guess it's I guess it's valuable, because it's a it tells me that he did, in fact, renew those or renewed the order for those prescriptions.
Notetaker:  Even though participant distinguished the “medication and supplies” as the “renewed meds” and he found that valuable because the doctor did renew it, participant still didn’t find a difference between the “the medication ordered for administration in clinic:, p.14:

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000
So it's a yeah.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Now I'm going to have you scroll down to the next accordion that's called your health information as a disappointment. We're going to do somewhat similar thing. So you can review this in detail and talk a lot as you do. And as you're reviewing, think about how you might utilize this information with this section.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Okay, so provider the team. My next appointment. I was just going to say, I'm not sure what a recall appointment is.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
How would you define that? What will be your guess?

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Is it a follow up appointment? I'm not like, I say, I'm not sure what that is, so I don't know how to define that.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:35.000
If it was a follow-up. How helpful or not helpful is that information to you?

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
If it is a follow up, I guess it would be helpful. I'll receive a a reminder about the 3 weeks.Yeah, I don't. I don't know.
Notetaker: At first participant was confused what a “recall appointment” was but he read further and said that it was a follow-up appointment and that he will be called in three weeks for confirmation, and he found that to be valuable information, p. 20.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
So, I'm going to have you as a variable of the screen where it is problem lists. I'm going to ask you a question about that one, too. So how would you define problem with what's another way to reword that?What do you, I think, is included in this section.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:21.000
The diagnoses, things that they want to keep an eye on, to monitor. There we go!

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And how useful or not useful. Do you find this information, and why?

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
I guess it's kind of useful in that. The good doctor. The teams keeping an eye on it. But it's already listed in the diagnoses, and so, and they've prescribed meds for it. So I know. I already know that they're going to be monitoring those situations.
Participant understood that the “problems list” was what was listed in the “you were diagnosed with” section, p.21.
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Now you can continue to scroll and share your thoughts.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Immunization. Allergy drugs. Huh! I have an adverse reaction to it. Here, sip, tape! Lab results. And this is a oh, I could keep going, I guess, with the lab results. I appreciate the fact that these are in there, but I always want to interpret, and I never, I mean, I know it gives a reference range, but I never know. You know, if it's good or bad, or and this is an issue that I personally have, that's why, because I always look at the results and I never know how to interpret them. And I always have to call the Doc back.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Yeah, no, definitely. Thank you for sharing that.
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Sorry II was reading the Radiology report, so my knee is not broken or dislocated, but I do have mild oestiopenia. Oh! And then here's the List of meds, and where it's filled.
Notetaker: Participant would want a way to interpret them, he ends up calling the doctor to find out what they are, p. 21”
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:19.000
So this is another list. Where? How would you define this section?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Oh, did I scroll? Whoops? What happened? Oh, okay. Sorry. How would I define this section?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Yes, what! Taking a look at this, what is included in the section? Or how would you define the section overall?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:45.000
I actually like it. It gives a description of the pill. How often to take it where it's filled, who filled it? You know how many refills, and when it expires, when oh, and when it was last built. That's not currently in (other section) the yeah, I like that.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Now, how does this my medication information differ from the information in the medication and supplies and the administered section, like the other medication section above.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:34.000
This is, this is much more informative. Yeah, II like this layout, or I like the amount of information relate here. I guess the other was just a summary. This is more like a full report.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:51.000
So how would you utilize or not utilize this section?

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:06.000
I guess if I forgot how much I was post take, I could refer to this, although it's probably on the laser, or when I last filled it. That's an important yeah, II that's a feature in there that I like when it was last filled.
Notetaker: Participant didn’t distinguish the other med section from the “My medications” section, he believed the my medications section was a full report of all the medications where the others were just summaries, p.23:
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Okay.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
No, you can keep scrolling down and talking a lot as you share the rest of the section.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:49.000
The acute check. So test strips. Sorry I'm meds that I'm no longer taking, and then.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
So how useful or not useful is that section 2. And why? Why would you utilize it? Or not.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:22.000
I'm I guess I don't know that it's particularly useful for me unless. I have whatever issue I was taking it for. I have it again, and I could tell that as a doctor, you know this didn't work particularly well, or you know I had this free all the way there's a different section for reactions. Adverse reactions. Yeah, I've. I generally I mean, I know what I've taken in the past. Generally. I've always kind of wondered why this was always included. Yeah, I guess it's helpful in the broad scope. But generally it's not something that I am concerned about.
Notetaker: Participant thought the “medications you are not taking could be useful to see what the adverse reactions were to meds taken in the past but it’s nothing he really pays attention to, p. 24;
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Then you can keep scrolling and reviewing the rest of the section.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Okay. Oh, yeah, we're at the bottom now, have you I think you opened up the “more information” before and commented that you wouldn't. No! What's that? About this? Sections, or didn't weren't quite sure what was in it. Can you elaborate a little bit more on your expectations of what you would want in the more information section? Well! More information section. So when you want to add or take away any of this information, that's a better way to put it.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:13.000
I'm just not quite sure why it's there, because it doesn't necessarily pertain to pertain to anything about my appointment on the sixth with Doctor Knutt. This looks like just general information, and it's not even at the clinic at which, where I was. I mean, this is a completely separate clinic. So I'm not sure why it's included. With this particular appointment.
Notetaker: Participant thought that the more information had nothing to do with the June 6th appointment, so he doesn’t understand why its there, p. 24:
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Okay, what about the section? That's” more help and information”.If you can review that and share your thoughts on that section.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Let's ask your healthcare…. Okay. I'm not sure what in-person authentication is. Authentication is, after completing in-person click.. Oh, okay. I've already done that. So that's okay. Now it makes sense. I guess it's I'm already on my healthy bet, and I'm already I've already done the in-person authentication. I know this is just a very generic message, but not of this really pertains to me, because I already do all of this. I'm already accessing my health. Records because I'm here and tracking my health and on my HealtheVet or on yeah, the va.gov website. So it's, I guess, to me personally, specifically, it's all extraneous. But it's good general information.
Notetaker: Participant didn’t find the info under “more helpful information” useful since he’s already on Myheathevet the info does not pertain to him, p.25

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Now that you reviewed one after mid summary, we're going to pretend that there's another appointment in the past that you wanted to review. So how would you go about doing that?

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Oh let me get back to the top. Back to care and summary,  So is there one specifically that I'm wanting to look at?
Notetaker: Participant used the back to care summaries bread crumb back button to navigate to another AVS, p25.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
You can pick, you can just find another.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Okay, let's see what I was admitted for on April sixth and seventh, at the Dayton's, VA.

Okay. I was like, this is the prototype. So not everything will be clickable.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
So I don't know if that one is. Yeah. Okay, that one does not go up. Mental health, There we go. Wow! I go all over the place. I was in Fargo, this one with Jacob Gyllenhaal, nice!

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Oh! For this! Let's count from one to 5, one being very easy and 5 being very difficult. How easy or difficult was it to navigate to another summary.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Very easy. One, sorry.
Notetaker: Participant that it was very easy to navigate back to another AVS, he gave it a 1, p.26.
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Okay, now, we are actually done with the prototype. But I do have some more other questions, so you can either close it or we can leave it up and continue to.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Yeah, you you can stop sharing your screen if you want to, as well. Okay, our next topic is about notification. So we're going to talk about notifications that you might want to want to receive about your after visit summaries.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:11.000
So pretend that you receive the following message, so the subject is new after visit, summary, and the content is a summary of your recent appointment is now available on my healthy bed.Log in to review the summary. Do you find this notification helpful or not helpful?

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:25.000
I think it would be helpful, because, depending on the appointment, I may want to review it more quickly, like lab results. I would want to see those immediately. General, like mental health notes. I generally check those midweek. So you know, after 3 or 4 days I know they'll be up. But lab results. It would be very helpful, I would think.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Okay, how are you prefer to receive this notification?

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:09.000
I think I think an email notification.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:17.000
And if you had multiple appointments in one day, would you want one after visit, summary notification for each appointment? Where would you want all the events combined into one message? So just for that one day.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
No, I would want it, separate it into each appointment.
Notetaker: Participant finds having a notification for an AVS very valuable and would like a separate notification for each appointment, p.27.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Okay. If you could change one thing about the after rising summary that you saw, what would it be?

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
I'm not sure. Bye, I was missing. Maybe I would take away the. The what I can't remember. The last thing that was didn't seem to pertain to the specific appointment. The “information about those other clinics”.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Could be adding something, taking away something. Okay?
Notetaker: Participant thought that the information” about those other clinics” could be removed from the after-visit summary under “More Information”, p. 28.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Is there anything that you want to share about after visit Summary that I didn't. We didn't already cover today.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Hmm! I can't think of anything.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Do you have any questions for me?

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
I do not.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
So that's all the questions I have for you today.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Okay.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Yeah.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us and your feedback is so helpful to us we can continue to work on the site and really make sure it works for all better.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:48.000
So before you go, I wanna make sure it's clear that everything we did today wasn't real.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Correct.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
You were using a prototype. You didn't really access your account, and Parage and will be setting you a thank you.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other vendors who may, who may know and that will provide them a chance to participate in research sessions.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Alright!

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
But this, too. So thank you so much for your time today, and enjoy the rest of your day.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Thank you you as well.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Okay.
