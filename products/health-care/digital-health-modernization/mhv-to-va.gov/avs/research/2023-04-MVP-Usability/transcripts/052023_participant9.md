## Moderator Logistics
-	2-3 days before the session
-	Review guidelines for moderators
-	Send guidelines for notetakers
-	Send guidelines for observers
-	Ensure prototype(s) are prepared and Perigean will share them with participants

## Day of the Session
-	Prepare prototype on your device and be ready for screen sharing if necessary
-	Log into the Perigean Zoom meeting (you will be the host).
-	Turn on transcriptions by clicking the LIVE TRANSCRIPT button in the bottom toolbar, then, in the Live Transcription section, click the ENABLE button.
-	Prepare yourself and your space for a video interview by clearing clutter (on screen and around you), ensuring you have good lighting, and muting distractions like Slack notifications.
-	Use headphones.
-	Review goals and research questions for this study in the research plan.
-	Starting the session.
-	If the participant doesn't show up in the first few minutes, reach out to Perigean on Slack.
-	Turn your camera on, but don't require the Veteran to turn their camera on, it's up to them. If they choose to have their camera off, ask if they'd prefer you turn your's off.
-	Where applicable, confirm the participant is able to hear and see you.
-	Go through the consent process slowly and intentionally. Remind the participant of their autonomy and choice.
-	You can only record the session if the participant gives you permission to record. Once you start recording, you must let the participant know they're being recorded and have them acknowledge that they give permission. Remember to hit record to cloud.
-	Ask if participants are okay with notetakers and observers joining the session. If they are, add them to the meeting and ensure they are on camera with their name visible on the screen. Introduce them to the participant. Then, ask all third parties to turn off their cameras so you can begin.
-	Ensure everyone except the participant is on mute.

## Introduction - 5 minutes
1.	Thanks for joining us today! My name is [**YOUR NAME**] and I'm a researcher at the VA.
2.	I also have a few colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we invite them, I'd like to tell you more about what we're doing today.
3.	Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
4.	This entire session should take about 1 hour. I'd like to make sure I don't take too much of your time, so I may occasionally move us along so we can cover everything we're hoping to talk to you about.
5.	In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
6.	Today, you'll be interacting with a prototype. This is basically like a pretend version of the website. It might not work exactly how you expect. For example, you'll be able to click on somethings on your screen, but not all of them. We use prototypes to help us test things before we decide what to make real, and what to change.
7.	If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
8.	Perigean did ask for your consent to allow people to observe today, but I'd like to confirm. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
9.	**If participant says, no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
10.	**If participant says, yes:** Admit observers.
11.	**Then, briefly introduce all observers while they keep their cameras on and microphones off. If you have time and prefer to, you can ask the observers and notetakers to introduce themselves instead.**
12.	**Then, ask all observers to turn off their cameras for the rest of the session.**
13.	Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we finish analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
14.	**If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
15.	**Start recording.**
16.	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up: - 3 minutes
I'd like to start by learning more about your experience reviewing information about what was discussed during your medical appointment. 
1.	Do you, or the Veteran you care for, recall receiving paperwork as you left your appointment, or reviewing online information that provided an overview of what occurred during your medical appointment or procedure? [**Moderator Note:** Use You, or the Veteran you care for, depending on who the participant is.]  ...both....
    -	[**If answered yes**, ask these questions. **Otherwise**, skip to question 2.]  
    -	Why did you review that paperwork or online content? 
    -	What information did you review?  
    -	Do you recall if any particular appointment type or procedure made you take a closer look at this paperwork or online information?  taking.....paer for confiming meds...online for test results..... 
2.	What would you call or name something like that? ...to check about followaps or to confirm the medication I am

## Task 1: Initial Reactions to the AVS Interface - 7 minutes
- Great, next I’d like to get your opinion on a prototype of a section on the VA.gov website.
-  I'm going to send you a [link to this prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/VHHxvo1QA1ndWc0TBhfkNq/Add-After-Visit-Summary?page-id=2%3A3&type=design&node-id=1233-16119&viewport=-892%2C210%2C0.4&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1233%3A16119) in the Zoom chat. Since this is a prototype for testing purposes only, it may not work as you may expect even though it may look like the actual VA.gov website. ...i never had to so that expect for a lab...
- 
- Okay, I've just sent you a link in the chat.  Please open the Zoom chat and click on that link. [**Moderator Note:** Help participant with the prototype if necessary. If the participant is unable to share their screen, then share your screen and follow the participant’s instructions.]
-	Now pretend that today is June 6th, 2023, and you are Hector.  You had an appointment this morning at 9:50 am with Dr. Nutt, your primary care physician, at the Puget Sound VA facility. A few hours have passed since your appointment, and you forgot what your doctor's instructions were. Use this prototype to find out what Dr. Nutt and you discussed at your appointment. Please think aloud as you are trying to find this information. 
    - [**Notetaker:** 1. Note where participant navigates to; note if participant navigates to “Care Summaries” or “Appointments”?]
    - [**Moderator Note:** Only assist if they have difficulty locating the After-visit summary. Continue with the below questions once the participant navigates to the After-visit summary page.]

1.	Please review the info on this page and share your overall impressions. Think aloud as you review. 
    -	[**Notetaker:** Note any observations about the following things: Do they open the accordions? How far down the page do they scroll? What do they comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?]
    -	[**Moderator Note:** If participant finds anything confusing, ask the following:] What does that term mean to you?
    -	Would you use or not use this page and why? clicked on details....doesnt know what 36.4 celsius...but he's assuming he has normal temp.... he needs to get blood work ...he

2. Did Dr. Nutt want you to complete or do anything following your appointment?

## Task 7: Insights into Notifications – 7 minutes
Okay, so we will move on from this prototype to another topic. We’re going to talk about notifications that you might want to receive about your After-visit summaries. Pretend that you received the following message:

   **Subject:** New After-visit Summary
   
   **Contents:** A summary of your recent appointment(s) is now available on MyHealtheVet. Login to review the summary.

- Do you find this notification helpful or not helpful? Why? helpfl because I know it takes time  for after visit summary i like that I get notification cause summary is availbe 
- How would you prefer to receive this notification (email, text message, phone call, etc.)?i would like an email....i would like it bothe a email and text....have a way to check how would you like to be contacted....set a preference so that you can changed how you like the appoinments...
- If you had multiple appointments in one day, would you want one after-visit summary notification for each appointment that day or would you want all the appointments combined into one message? i'd like them separate unless they werre about the same thing, but mulptile providers for a diffeerent reason then I'd like it separate and broken up.....If they were broken up but in the same notification, then it would be fine....

## Closing Questions – 3 minutes
-	If you could change one thing about the After-visit summary, what would that be?  so much information thats useless, slimed sown list...an option to jest see more consise info...maybe in there but not open until i open.....
-	And lastly, do you have any questions for me?  No... I am extremely satisfied with the VA wants me to do...
-	Okay, great! That is all the questions I have for you today.

## Thank you - 2 minutes
1.	We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
2.	Before you go, I do want to make sure it's clear that everything we did today wasn't real. And you haven’t really accessed your VA.gov account.
3.	Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
4.	Thank you so much for your time today, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
- Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
- Blame technology: I'm so sorry, but I just learned that the prototype we'll be reviewing today is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
