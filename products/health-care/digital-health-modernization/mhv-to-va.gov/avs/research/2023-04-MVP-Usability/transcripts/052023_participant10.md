Participant 10 (Kristen)

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay, [Redacted PII], so are you comfortable with observers observing today?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Yes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And this session being recorded today. Okay, thank you for that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Okay, so I'd like to start. I'm learning about your experience with the Va.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Va. Appointments. Do you recall ever receiving paperwork as you left the doctor's appointment? Or do you recall reviewing any such type of information after a doctor's appointment? Information that was provided online. Do you, too, any of those things?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yes, again!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So sometimes I'll get my next appointment, our of paperwork, saying, by some time they'll give me a paperwork. With the next appointment, or sometime I'll get paperwork with all of my coming appointments different time.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Okay, I think. And so do you get that in it. So you get that after the office in paper form, correct?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Yeah, sometimes I'll get it that day, sometimes they'll give it to me.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The Confirmation. Sometimes they'll give me a confirmation of all of them.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Sometimes they'll send it in the mail. Sometimes I'll get like a little postcard, so I'll get all different kinds of confirmation.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Okay, so these are basically this is paperwork that confirms your appointments.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Yes.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Right? So how about after you visit the doctor, or have a procedure done?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Do you get any paperwork at that point after?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Yeah, so, my, I've had a procedure done. Then sometime I'll get like, follow up, paperwork, telling me what I need to do.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Yeah. So when I've had the procedure.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:20.000
They'll give me like the follow up paperwork what I need to do following up that procedure, you know that they'll call me usually when I've had a procedure, a nurse will call me to check on me, and then I've had the doctor cal lto check on me within 24 h, so I had 2 calls, checking to see how done. And then also the paperwork will tell me like what I need to do. Following the procedure, going forward, and then, when the follow up visit will be medications that I have what I need to do. So that type of paperwork.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Excellent, so do you find that certain that you look more closely at certain paperwork after certain medical procedures or appointments.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Or it does it change for you at how closely you look at, pick the paperwork, or do you treat all paperwork the same?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
No I look at all my paperwork, this site. So anything I get I look at it to make sure to see what it is.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So if it's an appointment when I get home, I look at the appointments, and I put it on my calendar so that way I can keep up to date with my appointments. To make sure I have my calendar up to date, and then from time to time I go back into like my health, my healthy binding accept my appointments to make sure my calendar is up to date, and then, after my procedures.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I want to check, to see you know what I need to do with my daughter's.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Just to make sure that I'm up to date on what I need to do, because I have so much medication.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I take. I need to make sure what medications I have.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
How are you to take on?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Excellent [Redacted PII] So one of my colleagues, who's an observer, just is waiting in the waiting room right now.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So I'm gonna let him in and excuse me if that's okay with you.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
That's fine!

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And he'll be on shortly. So Adrian, would you like to introduce yourself?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Oh, he's coming!

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Just skip them a moment.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Hi, Adriene, would you please introduce yourself?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Hi, there! My name's Adrian. I'm an engineer on Va Dotv.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Thank you.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Hey! Good morning!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Good morning. Good to see you.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So sorry for that interruption, [Redacted PII] so what would you call that paper?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
That paperwork that you receive  after your doctor's office, which, if you were to give it a name, what would you call it?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So which one are you talking about? The follow-up like the confirmation for the appointments, or the one after the procedure?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Okay.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The one after procedure or medical appointment, the one that you've already seen your provider.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So the one after the provider, I would just say like after appointment confirmation.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Okay.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So the one after the provider I call that like a medical report, and then the one like for the appointment is like a confirmation appointment, confirmation, or something like that.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Okay. Great.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And then like after a procedure, I'll call. That something like a post OP. Or something like that.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Okay? And so procedure like, of course. So what's your definition of a procedure?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Okay.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Like I had to get a colonoscopy, so that would be like a post-OP or some approach procedure, or something like that.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So that's more of a invasive procedure where you have to but they kind of knock you out, or something like that. So I'll call that like a our procedure where they give you something like, take it all, drink alcohol, for, like, you know, 48 h, or something like that, because you, under the influence of the anesthesia stuff like that.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Okay, so you would definitely have different names for 2 different types of appointments.
Your doctor's appointment. You would call mostly a summary right.
Oh, is that what you said? I'm sorry.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Yeah, like, that would be like a medical. Yeah, like a medical summary.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Yeah, and.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And then like, if you had a procedure like what you had to go so where it wasn't just an appointment where they had to like more of a procedure.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Okay.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Where they kind of like did something. To you. What you had to give anesthesia or they have a cut, you, or anything like that.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Then that would be more of a operation, a procedure where they get there, I guess anytime there's gonna be more than one person dealing with you like in a decision anytime.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
They gotta anytime you have to sign a waiver, I guess, cause like if you get a colonoscopy, if they do, an incision.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Outpatient perceive, if they call it a proceed, I guess it. They call it a procedure.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Okay. Great. That was very helpful. Thank you for distinguishing those 2 for us.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So I'm gonna send you a link to a prototype and I'm just gonna ask you to click on it.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And then, if you can share your screen. So here is the prototype.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Do you see it there, [Redacted PII]?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Okay.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Okay.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:11.000
It's I believe it. Did you get it? If you can click on it? And then I'm gonna ask you to share your screen. Please.

Okay. Alrighty, alright. Now, how do I share my screen?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Go to zoom. So I gotta go back to zoom.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Okay, here's Zoom.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:52.000

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Hmm!

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Did you click on that more screen on the bottom where it says more.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
More!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Yeah, the bottom should say more. There's a little camera to the right of it, and then in the middle it says more.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Kristin or Adrian. Please feel free to to jump in if you can offer.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
They're the camera. I got the camera video call effects settings.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:24.000
You. It sounded like you were in the correct area where you said Share, and you are clicking on that with the share screen.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Yeah. Well, when I when I said to share the screen, and I say, start recording or casting with Zoom.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Okay. So should I just go down to where it says, Zoom.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.000

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Okay, then you'll see my screen. Now. Alrighty!

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Yes, thank you. So if you get on the prototype, are you able to get back there? Perfect?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000
That's it. Excellent, right? Thank you. Excellent!

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Good job, [Redacted PII].

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Oh, all right. Oh, we are! What are cool!

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Sorry about that, and thank you. Thank you for your patience.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Alright. Here we go. No problem, no problem. No, I know what I do.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Alrighty! So where are we going now?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Okay. So I'm just gonna have you take a look at this screen without clicking anything.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And just you can scroll up and down and just tell me your thoughts about it.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Just tell me your initial reactions to what you see.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Hello!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Yes, hi!

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Okay, appointments scheduling, manage appointments. 5 year. Okay?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Messages, medications, health records, payments.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:06.000
So now, now then it now we're going to pretend that you have an appointment that you had in appointment this morning on June sixth. And your name is Hector, and so your appointment was today at 9 50, with doctor, not your primary care, physician at the Budget Sound, va facility. How would you go to that employment to find out additional information of what transpired during the appointment? From this page. How would you get there? To find out about the appointment, start to find out.That you had this morning to find out about the appointment, and what your doctor, you and your doctor discussed.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Okay.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
If you can think aloud while you go through this information, so I can hear your thoughts.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Okay, so to find out about the appointment.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Yes.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Okay.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Alright, so. The thing about the notes, the notes don't show up in and your lab records for the 72 h, so you won't be able to find out anything about your lab records for 72 h so I can't go through my health history or anything like that so the only thing I would be able to do is see if I had the appointment, and if it was kept so I will go to like schedule and manage my appointments.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Okay.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
So I could. I could click on schedule and manage a point.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Okay, okay, go ahead. Go ahead and click there.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:42.000
And so again, you want to just find out some information about the about what it transpired at.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
The June sixth appointment at 9 50, with Documents.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Where would you go next?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
So then I would go to past appointments, cause it.

Yeah, it's taking some time to load, I believe.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Okay.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Oh, no problem!

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
You may have to go through there.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Oh, there you go!

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000

But tell me, tell me about what you think of this information.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Okay.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:19.000
The appointment was there. So what's the 1130? Et? Oh, so that's when he went to do his labs.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:35.000
I guess he wants to do labs at 1130.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
So for what you see here, can you provide me an example of how you would use this information in the section?

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I would. I think that if I click details it would take me back to the previous information. The 1130.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Meant that he went to do his lab work at 1130.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
If I clicked on that. Oh, I don't think his lab information would be ready yet, unless it was a lot of days passed, but I would expect once the lab results came in, I would click details, and I would be able to get my lab results.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Okay.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
That their reason for appointment was hypertension.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
And then I could see what he was diagnosed with.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
So he, I have hypertension, hyperledemia, chronic pain.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
He smoked. There's a vitamin d deficiency.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Post, your, and then also, okay. So this is where his vital signs are at.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:43.000
You got eye blood pressure.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Are there any terms there that seem unfamiliar to your confusing at all?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Okay.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
The hyper Ledia. I don't know what that means, so I'm not. I'm not familiar with that one.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
The poly symmetry. I know what that is.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
I don't know what respirations are. I know what the temperature is.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
I don't know what the temperature is and see, and instead of Fahrenheit.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:19.000
That's oh, this temperature is not good.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
No. Why is that?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
36.4 degrees C.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
If you convert that. II used to work offshore so I know a little bit about temperature.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.000
And if I pull up my, I got a little program, and I know 32.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
It's 36 if I pull up my little converter program.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
What is 36. I think that's kind of high.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
For temperature. That's probably.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Real quick. So see us to Fahrenheit.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
What is 36. 4?

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
So, having this information, how will this help you or not help you?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Oh, you! You can keep track of your information.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
No, that's 97.5. So that's not bad.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:41.000
His way. He's not bad for weight. His mass paying this free, he scheduled to have an ultrasound, but it's a lot faster, I mean.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Keep going.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Cool. All this information is in one place, so you don't have to get a print out of it.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:56.000
So with with the section you were diagnosed with, how would you?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Define this information.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
He has high blood pressure. I don't know what hyperlipidemia is.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:10.000
He has pain, he has chronic pain. He's a smoker, so I don't know if he's trying to stop smoking or not, but I know the Va.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Has programs, first smoke cessation his vitamin D sufficient.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
But I don't see that they have him on a vitamin d supplement.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:31.000
And then he has Ptsd. And I don't know if he's on any kind of.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:44.000
I don't know if he's being treated for that or not.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Okay, I'm gonna ask you to scroll down to medications ordered for administration in this clinic.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
What does this information mean to you under this section?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
That just means they're giving them something for us, paying.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
They're giving him 600. Philly 650 milligrams of catering.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:13.000
So that's Tylenol.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Okay. And how would you use this this information?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Up how valuable or invaluable with this information be for you here.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
If you were to see this.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:36.000
That I mean if I was taking, if I was the patient, I mean I'm taking Tyler now, but I know, Tylenol is an anti-inflammatory, so it just depends on wouldn't take in for me as a patient.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
I would need to know what I was taking Tylenol for.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:49.000
If I'm looking up, here he is. High blood pressure, chronic pain.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:29:03.000
I'd have to if I was a patient. I wanna know what I was taking Tylenol for.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Okay, so so you would want to know. You would want it to say why you were administered.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.000
The Tyler on anything else on there, under the Medications order for administration and clinic. Anything else.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
There that seems confusing, or or or words, or terminology, that you are not familiar with.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Well, I mean the Po. One, you know. Usually you don't.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:33.000
This is medical terms. So you don't wanna see that that's prescription terminology po ones.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.000
So you don't need to put Po. You need. You need to have it written out like you know what?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:30:00.000
How does he need to take it? So it's 650 mg, and you need to say, like, if he needs to take it once a day, or how often.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Okay, so what does this mean? Medications ordered for administration and clinic?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
What does that mean? What is the benefit mean to you? That tablet?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:17.000
That means that they gave him a Tylenol while he was in a clinic right for pain.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Okay, alright. So do you find that useful, knowing that?

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Well, I mean, if I'm if I'm the patient, I mean it, it wouldn't. I mean, it's good to keep track of, I guess, because that was no.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Kind of sorta, I guess. It's good to know that they you can keep track of what they gave you while you were in the clinic.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Because this beats that they gave him some. They gave him 650 milligrams of acino medicine while he was in the while he was in the clinic is what this means to me.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Okay, okay, great. So, [Redacted PII], thank you for that. So I'm gonna have you go down to your treatment plan for this appointment.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000
And I'd like you to open that up and read through that.

Brain, with Brainstail click out and with contrast. Okay, so lab test patient no longer need too fast for most labs.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:23.000
You all check with your provider whether fasting is required before completing your laboratory draws.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Please report to the lab for the following blood tests on the date listed for each test camp, a goal top zoom room team today.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
You how you like. What would it do I do for you?

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
This means I'm gonna well, it just means I'm gonna have some medical things done so that means I'm gonna have a seat.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
I'm gonna have some Ct and MRI scans done.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Thanks, Ray's ultra sounds on my risk looks like he's got.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Like, yeah, corporal probably got corporal tunnel syndrome, and both his wrist left and right.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
And also probably got migraines or something so he's having a Ct.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Scan done and then he's getting some blood work done today when he leaves the doctor's office.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:54.000
That was the 1130 appointment looks like, which probably is why the details was not underlined in that under the 1130 blood work.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:07.000
So did Doctor not ask you to do something during after the medical equipment this morning or not?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Okay.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Yeah, so, told you at 11. So you probably made an appointment for you to go get your blood so you probably put in orders for you to go get blood drawn at 1130.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Okay.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
So if you had a appointment this morning, or if you took today's June the sixth, or whatever the date is, if you had the appointment this morning, or whatever date it is you go and get blood drawn after your appointment, if you had this appointment this morning then

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
you're gonna get blood wrong, or if you had the appointment in the past, you went got blood wrong.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000
The same day.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Okay. So how useful with this information be for you or not useful.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
It would be. I mean, it's useful, I guess, because you know what you had to.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:52.000
You know what blood test that they did on you? What blow work you had done?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Okay, great. Now, I'm gonna ask you to focus on the medications.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:08.000
And supply section on this page. How does this medical and supplies information in this section?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
From the medications ordered for administration in the clinic that we've seen up further up that we had encountered previously.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Okay. So they say, it only lists, changes to your medication regime.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:28.000
So there's no. So you're not gonna lift anything that you're already taking.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
So this one, you believe, is only lists.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
The medications that was that were changed.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Yeah, so this section only lists changes to your medication regime.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Okay.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
So that means they're not. They're not.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
The current medications are taking or anything. That's the same strength of dosages. So they're only gonna list anything that's changed.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:54.000
So!

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Whereas, whereas the previous section was.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
The.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
No, so any other medications that are are sort of saying you can find under my own going.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Care. So that's probably under your regular, your regular prescriptions on the main menu.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Okay, so how valuable or not valuable would, having these.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
This list here of the section only list changes to your medication.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
How valuable is that for you right now!

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Well, this is fine, this is good because it shows you when this shows you when your medication is changed, so it cans track of changes in your medication.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:43.000
So when you want to find out, so you can keep track of changes.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Okay.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000
So this is, this is good. So you know, when your medication changed.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Okay! Alright! Oh, so I'm gonna ask you to go down to the next section where it says your health information as of this appointment.

Well, you know who your nurses is. You know who your team is, so in case you got a call, the Va.

What about? What about recall appointments? What is your understanding?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
If you can scroll down and look for recall appointments.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
What is your understanding of the meaning when they say, recall appointments?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
What does that mean to you?

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Recall appointments. Please note that recall appointments are not confirmed.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Apartments you will receive.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000
When you call you will be assigned a confirmed appointment date in time.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:15.000
I have no idea if that's what to be like that us on your next appointment.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
But it's not confirmed.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Is that what? What? You're guessing that it could be?

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Okay.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Yeah, I've never heard of that before, because I just have follow up.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
I have follow up appointments. I've never heard of a recall appointment.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Okay, so how? How far? Not helpful this actual information be for you.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
I don't know, cause II don't know.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
You will receive a reminder approximately 3 weeks before your recall appointment.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:52.000
I mean II don't know if you what.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Bye!

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
So it's not clear to you right?

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Right. I don't know what I've never heard of a recall. I mean, either.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
You have a either you have an appointment, you have cause.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Usually when you go to the doctor they give you a the next up usually when we have our doctor appointment, they usually have another appointment at 6 months we usually make cause they're using cause.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
At the Va. They make appointments every 6 months.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Okay.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
What's what's your doctors? Are your specialists?

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
They make appointments every 6 months, except for my allergy doctors, for my Alex, for my Zolar injections.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000
I make appointments every 2 weeks. So when I go see them they make like to appointments ahead.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
So I have for 3 appointments with them. So.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
We say, this is a confusing, this is a confusing second.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
How are you?

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Yeah, yeah. So I don't know if they have like.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Usually you have follow up either as a follow-up or your next appointment, but you that they say, follow up appointments.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
They don't say recall.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
So this is something that you'd like clarified more than.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Yeah. So yeah, I've never heard of a recall appointment.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Okay. Alright, [Redacted PII], thank you for that. I'm just gonna ask you to scroll down to problems.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:18.000
List, and if you could just tell me what that information tells you.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
I don't know if I would call it a problem list.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Okay? Why?

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Because that I mean I wouldn't say problem. I mean, you probably say, what's up?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:40.000
That word what we call it?

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Symptoms, I guess, or.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Oh, still got a word instead of problems.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Because what does problems mean to you? What does the problem mean to you?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:10.000
It's kind of got a negative.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Problems has like a negative connotation.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Okay.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Oh!

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:43.000
So in so in this section, it's supposed to Lewis all the things that you are diagnosed with.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Yeah.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Does that make sense with? Or is it confusing? Considering the title?

00:42:47.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Yeah, it's not a fee. Why, you could put diagnoses or let's see.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:09.000
For?

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
So you would like a different terminology instead of problems.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Lists. Is that what you're saying, [Redacted PII]?

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Yeah, you could put.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
I wanna say the ailment you could put ailment or this order Melody.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Oh, I'm trying to say. What word did you have?

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Problem.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:40.000
I guess that's probably no. Yeah. Probably the problem.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
I guess any other word I'd like this probably gonna be as bad.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
I was thinking ailment, ailment might be a little better complaint.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Okay.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Yeah, ailment ailment list. Maybe.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:05.000
So, knowing that now how useful are not useful with this information be for you.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Oh, that's good, because it shows you that date when you're diagnosed with it.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Okay.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
And how would you use that information? Knowing that?

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
That just shows what your diagnosis date is. I mean, it's just good to know.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Okay, alright. So I'm gonna ask you to slowly scroll down again.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Please. And then I'm gonna ask you to stop at my medications.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:07.000
And so, after reviewing this, if could you tell me how it does this section differ from the medications?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
And supplies list.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000
So this is, this should be a total list of the current medications you're taking.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Okay.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Not just the new medications that have changed and that were prescribed on this visit.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:33.000
You can scroll down and look further if you need to.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
So this, okay? So it was only so there's only 2.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:47.000
So what do you think about this in comparison to the medications and supplies, or even the other medications?

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:55.000
My medications all the way up. If you scroll back up to the top the first, my mitigations.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Do you remember that section?

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Yeah. It just shows that they add a lot of medications to his list.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:12.000
He is only taking 2 pills, or they ought to. Either they change the strength of the medications.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Yeah. So they just me. They check the. So either either they added a lot of medications or they change the strength of a lot of medications.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Okay, in this section.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Okay. And so, how would you utilize this this this information, or would you not utilize it at all?

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Oh, no, this is just good, because every time you go somewhere everybody's always asking you, what medications are you taking?

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Okay.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Is good to have a list of the medications that you're taking.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Okay. So now I'm going to have you.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Navigate to another section. Another appointment, so you can read the the after care summary. There.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000
How would you go about going to a different appointment on a different date?

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.000
How would you do that?

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
For the same person.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Same person, just a different appointment, and you can choose any point that you'd like.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
How would how would you go about doing that?

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000
No, I probably just clicked this home button.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
The whole button. Huh!

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Which is it? Which was it? The Va button that you clicked?

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.000
But I clicked. I click this person here, but it probably the Va button should take me to home, or something like that.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:54.000
I guess if I click that or I can log out log back in, or something like that.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Back to appointment details, or something to get out of here.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Okay, go ahead and click on that.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
So, you've clicked that backup back to appointment.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Details.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Yeah, I click it a couple of times. I don't know what it's doing.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Might not be.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:39.000
But my thing, don't be working sometimes.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.000
See? Can you click, can you go up a little? Yeah, okay.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
So where did you click! That got you here?

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
I just click the back out at the bottom of the page.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Yeah, I just can.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Oh, the back arrow. Okay, so, okay, so how would you?

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:03.000
How would you go to? Okay? So you click the bottom alright.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Yeah, there's the bottom. Okay?

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Okay. Can you tell me if you can see the upcoming past and pending on that screen here, what would you think upcoming needs?

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000
So that'd be like the future appointments.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Oh, okay. And so the past appointments.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Oh, how far past would you expect to see these appointments?

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
So right now it should be the past 3 months, because that's what it says. Right? There.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
So you would only expect it to see the left the past 3 months.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Alright. So zoom may. Yeah. April, right?

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
I think you can scroll down further.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Okay. So going to January.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
So it says.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
And when you look at pending, when you see pending, and what do you suppose, though it's under there?

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:16.000
So it shows me so it says they got 3 pending appointments, so if I hit that one, I should see the next 3 appointments.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Okay.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000
So the next 3 of appointments.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Can you collaborate on that?

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
So pediatry, primary care.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:46.000
I canceled those. So it's only 2.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
And both of those have been canceled.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.000
So what is what do you think that this section means?

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Pending should be the ones that are upcoming.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Okay. Alright. Thank you for that, [Redacted PII]. And finally, I'm gonna ask you.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Oh, some questions not pertaining to this prototype!

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:17.000
It's so what I'm gonna do is we're going to talk about newifications.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:22.000
And how you might want to receive them regarding your after visit.    

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Summaries pretend that you received the following message, so the subject is new after visit, summary in the contents are a summary of your recent appointments is now available on my healthy Login to review the summary. So would you find this type of notification help from, or not helpful? And why?

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:16.000
I find it helpful cause he just left me it refresher lets me know what went on during the visit, and I can confirm with the dot. Put into my notes, because I've had some issues in the past with one of my doctors in particular, putting information that was incorrect in my medical records that I actually had to follow. File something with the patient advocates about it, so I check my medical records. 

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Okay.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:39.000
My healthy vet to make sure that the doctor's putting exactly put in what I say into my medical records, because I had one of the doctors right, some incorrect information in there.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
So, okay.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
So you're saying you'd like to have the notifications right?

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Yes.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Okay? And what form would you like the notifications to be sent to you?
Would you like email text message, phone call, etc.?

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Email.Yeah, I prefer emails.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:09.000
How would you like them to email, okay? So let's say, for example, you know a couple of appointments in one day.In one, and after summary visit, summary notification for each appointment. Would you like them separately, or would you like them in all in one notification? So, in other words, would you like different notifications for each different after visits, summary?

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Yeah. No. Separate.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Or would you like them all at once? Separate? Okay? And you mentioned that you had and you'd like them via email.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Yes.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Is that correct? Okay, alright. And finally, I'm just gonna ask you the last 3 questions.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:54:00.000
If you can change one thing about the after visit. Summary, what would it be?

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:14.000
About this particular prototype. If you could change anything, what would you change about it?

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Change anything about it. What would I change about it?

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Yeah, if you found anything confusing, or if anything, you know, you felt that didn't belong or should have belonged in there. Just a lot of the little details at the bottom of it, where it's got all a little notes.Those little a addendum's at the bottom of it. A lot of that stuff there's repetitious on each page.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Okay.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000
A lot of times a lot of that stuff on your phone.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Just takes so space. If you put it on the main page a lot of times.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:55.000
That's just enough. Just repeat it on each page.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000
So what on the main page? [Redacted PII]

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Like this right here, need help.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Hey? You know you got that, and then it kind of feedback stuff, and a lot of times you'll have this same thing on every page.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Okay.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Okay.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:28.000
So you don't need to repeat that on every page you can just pay it on one on the first page, and then kinda we don't need to have it on if you cannot have it on every page repeating itself.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000
But the other stuff, the details, and how it highlights.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:39.000
If there's information I did like that cause. I noticed when I went into the.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000
You can go back in there if you'd like to show me what you mean.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:49.000
So if you wanna go back to.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:56:03.000
The after visit summer, and show me on June sixth.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Let's see.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Yeah. So we went ahead oh, they didn't have anything cause the details.
And see how they have. Don't have it. It's not underlined.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Uhhuh.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000
So? What it's so like, it's not underlying me.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Yes.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:27.000
There's nothing under it that you can't click on. So I do like the fact that if it's not underline that you can't go any further.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:33.000
You do like that?

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Okay.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Yeah, I like that. So that means, if it's not underlined that you can't click on it but if it is underline, that means that there's a link to it.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.000
So it kinda lets, you know, you know, if if something is underline that means you can click on it.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:54.000
It's like a hint some people may notice it.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Okay.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Some people may not. I don't know it. It just kinda lets, you know if you see something underline that means you can click on it. If it's not underline, then you can't click on it.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Thank you for that much. Go. And lastly, do you have any questions for me regarding what we did today?

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
The prototype.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Hmm, no, and this is only from my healthy vet right!

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Okay.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Yes, it is so. It's not yet. This is just a prototype.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Okay.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000
We're still in the design process. We're trying to figure out what we should include and shouldn't include before we.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Okay. And this is gonna be a new version.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Yes, it will be.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Okay.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.000
So, oh, great! So that's all the questions that I have for you today, [Redacted PII] and I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Your feedback is so helpful for us as we continue to work in this site and make sure that I really works for the veterans.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:02.000
So before you go, I just wanna make sure it's clear that everything we did today wasn't real. And you haven't accessed your v.gov account today.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Oh, no problem, thank you.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:10.000
And Jean will be sending you a thank you. Note with your little blur that you can pass along with 2 other veterans.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:17.000
You may think you may know, to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000
So thank you so much for today. Enjoy the rest of your day.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
We appreciate it. Have a good day.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Oh, thank you, thank you so much. You have a good one.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Bye-bye.
