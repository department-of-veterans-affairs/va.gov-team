|2024/05/21|Lauren Alexanderson, Mikki Northuis, Kay Lawyer, Kaitlin Fink |Pharmacy will be renamed Medications will be the name on VA.gov.|Decision was previously made an approved by OCC.  Modern patient portals call them medications. This section is a full list of your medications not just a list of things VA prescribed you. Pharmacy is limiting and the name of a place vs. a thing. Medications works with the current implementation as of May 2024. If/when we decide to include more than medications ie. supplies and devices, etc. we will come back to discuss options with CAIA. As we launch we will montior feedback to determine if changes should be made.

|2022/10/18|Lauren Alexanderson, David Conlon, Danielle Thierry|Unauth content will not be a priority for now|There are a lot of dependencies for this currently, and our main focus is migrating the apps|
|      |Lauren Alexanderson|Medical Records will be built domain by domain|This will allow the teams to more quickly show progress|
|      |Lauren Alexanderson, Coulton Bunney|The first domain to be created will be Immunizations|This one is relatively straightforward and a good one to start with|
|      |Lauren Alexanderson, Leah Bannon|The second and third domains will be Labs & Tests and Notes|           |
| 2023/01/29     |Erick Spahn, Maureen Layden                   |Medications will be rolled in with Pharmacy as a new section of the health portal.          | Veterans will be able to see current and past medications and request refills in one place. This structure has been confirmed by tree testing research, implied by GAO reports, supported by common sense.        |
|2023/02/02      |Lauren Alexanderson                   |Links to Appointments will point to VAOS, not MHV                         |Good way to start the soft retirement of Appointments on MHV           |
|02/08/2023     | Lauren Alexanderson, Patrick Bateman        | Name of the VFS product for the landing page, navigation and other shared elements will be *MHV on VA.gov Portal*  | The work must have a name to do a Collaboration Cycle kick-off, and this is a good "umbrella" name.|

|10/6/2022      | Dr. Evans, Chris Johnston                   | Health Portal should be consistent with the flagship mobile app as much as possible | Consistency will keep users from having to learn two different mental models.  Portal can also glean knowledge from things Mobile has already implemented.          |
|02/08/2023      |Lauren Alexanderson, Dave Conlon, Patrick Bateman  |"My Health" button in authenticated VA.gov main nav will be changed to "My Health*e*Vet |In the future, weâ€™re sticking with the My HealtheVet branding on VA.gov, so the link text should match.           |
