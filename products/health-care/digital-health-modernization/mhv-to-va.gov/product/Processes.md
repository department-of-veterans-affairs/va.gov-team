# Universal Team Processes on MHV FrontEnd

## Purpose

We want to ensure that all of the processes that we use between and among our teams on MHV FrontEnd continually operate with clarity and efficiency.  To that end, we want to advocate for consistency where possible, pariticularly in areas of overlap or interaction.  For this reason, we have identified Best Practices for the various processes that our teams practice regularly, and we will adjust and refine them as we go.  

The processes outlines below are not intended to constrain, but to provide frameworks that all of our teams and members can easily navigate.


## PR Reviews
To ensure that PR Reviews happen within teams and between teams reliably and without delay, please use the following practices for the given scenario:
#### PR Reviews within a team: 
xxxxxxx
#### PR Reviews needed from other teams: 
oooooo


## Team Retros
Each Tool team is expected to have a Sprint Retro to allow the team to internally consider how to improve, as well as consider any items that may need to be surfaced at the program level.
#### Timing:
At the conclusion of each Sprint
#### Format/tooling:
Parabol, AgileBin, or Mural can be utilized. 
#### Records:
A record must be kept of the Retro, whether that is the original board used or a summary of takeaways, action items, or learnings to share out.




## Pointing
Each Tool team is expected to point its stories for planning and tracking purposes.
#### Timing:
The Github ticket should be pointed no later than Sprint Planning, though it can be pointed earlier, (such as Backlog Refinement).
#### Methodology:
Planning Poker is a suitable approach.  The important part is to ensure the entire development team has the opportunity to give their input.  
#### Points:
We will use a Fibonacci sequence for the sake of consistency.
