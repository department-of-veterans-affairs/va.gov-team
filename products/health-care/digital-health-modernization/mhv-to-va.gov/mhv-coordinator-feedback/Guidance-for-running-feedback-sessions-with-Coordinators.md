# Research Strategy & Guidance for Running Feedback Sessions with Coordinators: 
## Collecting Feedback from MHV Coordinators on Health Applications

## Goal: 
To define a process and guidelines for collecting and interpreting feedback from MHV Coordinators (MHVCs) on different health applications on VA.gov. 

This document refers to the strategies we will employ to collect feedback on specific products and health services in a typical human-centered design process. Additional strategies related to continuous feedback mechanisms and foundational understandings that can be learned from MHVCs can be found in [this Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1686243085603/5caca6710b1410ff8a66d69501226dd342b075c0?sender=u1f2503bbfc7ec1e87fca8800).  

## Background: 
-	MHVCs are on-the-ground staff providing support to Veterans at VA facilities or at the regional level (i.e., the Veteran Integrated Service Network, or VISN, level). 
-	Though not included in their core job responsibilities, MHVCs report having to provide significant support to Veterans to navigate non-health applications and therefore have insights into broader issues on VA.gov
-	We would like to include MHVCs more regularly into the product development and launch process to ensure that (1) we are aware of their feedback and relevant insights, and (2) they feel more included and invested in the upcoming changes. 

## How we view MHVC feedback: 
-	Collecting feedback from MHVCs does not replace collecting feedback from Veterans. MHVCs, some of whom are Veterans, have unique insights based on their familiarity with the VA, its resources, and MHV/VA.gov, and how they have observed Veterans interacting with these resources. MHVC feedback is Subject Matter Expert (SME) feedback, not user feedback. We will collect and interpret feedback from MHVCs through the lens by which we interpret other SME feedback, which will complement and be juxtaposed with feedback collected from Veterans. 
Process for collecting feedback from MHVCs on health applications: 

### Step 1: identify what it is that you need to learn from MHVCs. 
- Could be helpful to read their [training manual and job description](https://vaww.va.gov/MYHEALTHEVET/docs/training/MHV_Coordinator_Handbook.pdf) to familiarize yourself with the type of insights they might be able to provide (requires VA Network access).  

### Step 2: identify when you need to learn things from MHVCs. 
-	Would they be helpful to talk to when you are trying to understand the general issue? (E.g., during Discovery phase)
-	Do you want their feedback on an early- or later-stage design? (E.g., during Testing phase)

### Step 3: collect and analyze feedback from MHVCs
-	Come up with a brief description of (1) what you want to learn from an MHVC, and (2) how you will use that information. 
-	Liaise with Robyn Singleton to sign up for the MHVC/OCTO Office Hours to speak with an MHVC. Specify if you would like to speak for 30 or 60 minutes, if you want to speak with 1 or 2 MHVC (or more), and if you would like to have separate discussions or would allow multiple Coordinators on the same call. 
-	Speak with MHVCs
-	Separate your MHVC data from other types of data (e.g., feedback collected from Veterans). Be explicit about what findings relate to who you collected data from by either grouping insights from different groups or identifying a MHVC participant versus other type of participant. Always include de-identified participant IDs when using quotes.

## Additional thoughts: 
### Discovery research: 
-	What would be helpful to understand about on-the-ground realities of using a digital service? Examples include:
    -	What common problems arise for Veterans when using X service?
    -	What aspects have you heard the most complaints/praise/appreciation for?
    -	In your opinion, what about X service should be kept vs. cut or reworked? 

### Generative research: 
-	Unclear value of including MHVCs in this type of research. Generative research is typically about getting inside the perspectives of intended users (e.g., Veterans). While some MHVCs are Veterans themselves and have deep insight into this group, they still are distinct in meaningful ways (e.g., familiarity with VA resources like MHV and VA.gov). Would probably recommend not including MHVCs in this portion of the research unless you have a compelling reason for doing so. 
Getting feedback on or testing with prototypes or launched applications: 
-	Can get feedback on specific aspects where their subject matter expertise can influence early-stage designs
-	Can get feedback on later-stage work, but need to be careful as could be more difficult to implement any suggested changes immediately
-	Shape expectations by explaining that we are interested in their feedback on mock ups/ prototypes/ staging- or production-level applications, but that this feedback will be juxtaposed with Veteran feedback, technical feasibility, and business viability and sustainability. We may not be able to act on their feedback but appreciate the opportunity to hear it

### Prototype or usability testing: 
- Testing of prototypes or built pages is best done with end users, rather than MHVCs
- However, would be helpful to get feedback from MHVCs on existing designs or products. Always juxtapose this feedback with other forms of feedback, including from business stakeholders and end users, when thinking about the strategic implications of MHVC feedback.
- 
### Confirming or validating feedback from other sources
- Can validate or gain further insight on feedback that is provided through other sources, like VSignals, Help Desk reports, Medallia, or emails sent to the mhvfeedback email.
- Can also validate or gain further insight on information provided by other SMEs.
- Goal would be to triangulate across multiple data sources in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of an issue.
