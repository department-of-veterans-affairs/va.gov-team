# MHVC feedback sessions: Medications
January 2024 

## Takeaways  
- The majority of support they give is with MHV on web, they rarely get questions about other pharmacy apps like RxRefill or VAHB App.
- The majority of veterans who come to them about pharmacy are looking to refill a medication and asking why a medication is not showing up.
- Coordinators have varying experiences and levels of training when troubleshooting medications with a veteran.
- Their biggest concern is the transition to va.gov and helping veterans login and verify their identity. 


 

### What types of questions do you get from veterans using Medications/Pharmacy on MHV? 
- Had a patient who was saying in MHV that all his prescriptions were gone. We elevated it up to the person who was in charge of MHV who basically told us that he was not able to see them. Which doesn’t make sense to me.
- Why aren't medications showing up? I sometimes have to explain that they are in pending status. Someone said that after 90 days they're gone - I don't know if that is true, so I don't know what's up with that. If he goes into Blue Button, he can see eveything.  CPRS is supposed to mirrior MHV. So why don't they show up?
- That patients cant view their medications in MHV. Or it was there and now its missing. Those are things at a local level that we cant fix. We have no control over what medications appear in MHV. I can just troubleshoot with them the best I can and if they're out of medications, I can refer them to the provider who can refill them.
- Past medications seem to be a problem. A Veteran needs refill on medications but if its because time has expired, but sometimes these medications look like they could be easily filled. They’ll send a message to their doctor even though they have refills left and should send it to their pharmacy.
- Sometimes CPRS says there are refills, but MHV shows there aren't. So they will contact their provider out of habit. That glitchiness needs to be addressed. 

### How do you troubleshoot with veterans? 
-  In person, I have them log in over the phone, I log into my own MHV account so I can kind of see what they're seeing on their end. Sometimes my medication isn't showing either and it’s a weird glitch in the system if its being updated and I log in the next day and its back.
-  Having patients transferred over to MHV then that’s a task. Explaining if a medication is missing, then we direct them to pharmacy to ask over the phone. I have a point of contact and I send her a teams msg to let them know I'm sending someone over. 

### Do you ever get questions from veterans about other places they can refill like the apps? 
 -  No. its easier to log on to MHV - its one and done.
 -  For me its just MHV because we have an older population and they can barely even log in to MHV.

### When veterans come to you looking to find their medications, what are they trying to accomplish? 
- Nine times out of ten they just want to refill online and monitor tracking information. However, I tell them that once they send the medication to the post office, they have to track it through the USPS because they will have to talk to their local post office about where it is left.
- One Veteran is trying to get back into the military and he needs to provide all the medications he has ever been given from the VA for disability purposes. If I signed up for MHV today, would I have all the medications I've ever taken in the past? I don't know how to go back any further.

### Have you gotten any questions/feedback on refilling multiple perscriptions at one?
  - Haven't heard any issues.  The real issue that I've consistently heard about is when the prescription isn't showing when they should be.
  - Agree, it's easy to refill, just click the box.
 
### Have you gotten any questions/feedback on renewals?
  - No issues as long as there are refills and the medication isn't expired. 9/10 times the issue is because the medication is expired or out of refills. To troubleshoot, I click on the I, it tells you if there are refills left or if its expired, so then I tell them to message the doctor.
  - Usually they are older veterans and just confused. One Veteran was trying to get a refill of eyedrops and was surprised that the prescription expired because he has been taking it for 10 years and the record showed that he was due for an exam. Which is why he couldn't just refill it. 

### Have you seen veterans struggle to find a particular medication? 
  - I've showed them how to use the feature to change how many items are on the page. Sometimes they just don’t understand they can display that the newest is at the top or the oldest. Or you can have all the medications display on one page by picking show 10 or 100
  - I've shown them all that in the office in person and that helps.

### What would make your jobs easier? 
   - I think it would be fine as long as the system is working properly. Its a pretty user friendly system from my experience. Even compared to the SSM my chart. I think its pretty comparable to the industry standard. I know there are a lot of changes and there are going to be a lot of kinks to work out.
   - I'm a visual person so it would be great to have training material. I. work in telehealth and I have a book where you can see each step by step picture. I know its monotonous, but it just helps.
   - There is a quick ref guide/packet that shows how to send a secure msg, how to view a prescription, how to view notes, etc. we have 4 ref guides we give to patients. One when they come in and enroll, one to show what the portal looks like and they can refer to the guides if they have questions

### What concerns do you have with the transition to va.gov? 
   - We get a lot of questions because there are a lot of questions in the transition to MHV on VA.gov. they use the VA health and bens app more here in St. Louis because they do the one stop shopping - access bennies and MHV items in one place. They like that one better. The other ben to the app is if I can get them se up with face ID then they don’t have to worry about getting codes. That’s the easiest for Veterans. They have to come in to help them do that in person.
   - My only concern right now is this transition from our current record system to oracle Cerner because MHV pulls data from CPRS and there are still glitches. Is MHV still going to work and pull data out of that new system?
   - My concern is were going to lose a lot of Veteran for those who aren't able to access either of those platforms. Were still having issues for both. We still haven't gotten a definitive answers. To actually get access. When I tried twice, and couldn’t do it a third time. My phone number was a number from when I lived with my parents in high school. Older patients might not know that. This was with ID.me. After about a week I got access. I have patients come in and say this is ridiculous and they don’t know why they have to. I have to explain about the exec order. On a good day it could take 30 mins. On a bad day, an hour and a half.
   - I've spent 90 mins with a patient before trying to get them onto ID.me and taking pics of ID cards and upload them. I explain that this is the industry standard for cyber security. If you pay bills, bank, buy anything, everything is going to a multifactor auth. If the older gen is willing to learn fine, but if they're not then its just going to be a barrier. The younger gen has no problem - they're all using it but they expect it to work and get frustrated when things aren't working.
   - Oh yeah I'm dreading the transition. Maybe I'm just confused. I have signed in and I just hit a stop. I know when I explain all the ways to sign in over the phone I know they just want to come through the phone and grab my neck. I'm looking forward to it becoming easier.
