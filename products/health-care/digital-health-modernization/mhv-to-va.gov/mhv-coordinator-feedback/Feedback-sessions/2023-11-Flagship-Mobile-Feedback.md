## Questions for MHV Coordinators


### MHV Coordinator Role Questions

* **Can you walk us through a typical day in your role as a MHV Coordinator?**
    * There to support the staff – liaison with secure messaging system and any problems they have
    * Setup the teams with the providers to make sure the patients are on them correctly + help veterans enroll
    * Downloading apps for veterans, telling them about the chat app, share app
        * Educating them on how to use it
    * Been creating ID.me and Login.gov accounts vs. MHV accounts since they don’t work with the app
        * Doesn’t see a point in creating the MHV account since they are supposed to be retiring that
    * Intent to file (showing them what they need to do, etc.)
    * Participated in Veteran meetings with the American Legion, VFW, VSO county government representatives (help out of their offices sometimes), vet centers (available to 100% disabled veterans)
    * Reports + auditing
    * Password recovery
    * Travel will send people down (and will do the phone version)
    * Working through how to get someone on over the phone when they don’t have any computer schools at all (explaining the difference in the address and search bar)
    * They don’t have computers that Veterans can use to access their personal email addresses
    * No one has told them how and when they are supposed to end MHV accounts and they don’t have any next steps / information
        * They have been complaining about the ID.me issues, but they just get told that it is happening

### General App Questions

* **How often do you get questions or comments about the health and benefits app? Are there certain themes/patterns in the questions you get?**
    * Have had to explain that it is an app and they won’t get to see everything they see on the web (medical records, etc.)
        * Older generations don’t understand why
        * They see some things but not everything and they get confused by it
    * He didn’t know until yesterday that you could add your direct deposit information
        * Really easy (less than 2 minutes)
    * On his, he can see his payments, but can’t change his direct deposit information
    * Everyone he has talked to has liked it
    * When you hit the health button he can see immunizations (pretty important)
        * A lot faster to get to things (which is what you expect in the app)
    * They don’t see the difference between the app and VA.gov 
        * Thinks they would like the 4 main functions of MHV to be on the app (is this a PHI issue? Not sure why it isn’t there / available)
            * 4 main functions: pharmacy, appointments, health records, and secure messaging
    * Have no idea when new things come to the app
        * They are behind the 8 ball
        * Would like a heads up on what is changing and why
        * Have no real knowledge base / information
    * Don’t remember ever getting an overview on the app (what it does, etc.)
        * He is a veteran, so he went on and learned / experienced the app for himself (Scott)
    * Percentage of support related to the app: 
        * Very, very tiny (2-3 questions a month) – Scott
            * Things this will change more as they move to VA.gov, but hard to say
        * Most of his day has nothing to do with our app – Geoffrey
            * Don’t see much, but when they do it is via the phone and is usually someone confusing VA.gov with the app
            * Don't’ know enough about it to walk them through it
            * Doesn’t feel comfortable trying to troubleshoot it
            * He is also a veteran
                * You do it yourself, for yourself, and then try to relay what worked for you
                  
* **Do you ever have an issue determining which app/technology that Veterans are referring to?**
    * Would try to simplify the apps by condensing them
    * Would hope they are doing walkthroughs with the patients on what the app is, what it does, etc.
    * There is just no knowledge-base
        * Comes up tertiary and trying to guide them on the best avenue to go
    * Big thing that comes up is travel, but there is no travel app
        * Why didn’t they just tuck it into MHV?
        * Travel doesn’t want anything to do with MHV
            * They send them down to setup an account and then they have to send them back to travel
    * If / when they come in, you just politely move them along
    * Things need to be more compact
        * Scott is referring to the [VA Mobile App store](https://mobile.va.gov/appstore)
            * Can’t find it anymore / doesn’t know if it still exists
    * They’d just get down to 1-2 apps
        * To have all of this stuff that no one knows anything about (32 apps) is just unneeded and too much
        * Maybe have a health app and a benefits app
    * Robin participants in provider education
        * Robin is also a veteran
        * Their travel department did walkthroughs and she took screenshots to share with Veterans and walk them through how to do things
    * Probably half or more of the questions Robin receives are about the health and benefits app
        * Tells them upfront when she helps them download the app that only about 1/10th of what is on VA.gov is available on the app
        * They don’t understand why all of their appointments are not viewable in one place

## Questions / Suggestions for the Mobile App team

* Robin: The VA does have an app where you can check-in for your appointment by scanning the QR code. Any thought about merging that with the community care network? They have issues with appointments, ER visits, etc.
    * They’d like to build in all of the facility’s information to the emergency contact center (would cut down on the number of reports significantly)
    * Scott wasn’t aware of the QR code.
* Scott: If we could include information on / links to things they might be looking for (health records, for example). If it isn’t in the app, tell them where they can go, what app they can download, etc.
    * Blue button
    * Labs
    * Where to create / add a claim
* How are we going to do any of this at CBOCs?
    * There are no resources unless an MSA happens to know what is going on
        * No one there that can help them do what MHV is doing
    * Doesn’t know how we’ll bridge this gap at the CBOCs
    * More staffing would be wonderful
        * May be having in 2024
* What’s coming down the line?
    * Check-in capability
    * Onboarding (additional information being added, etc.)
* Would be nice if old claims + claims letters would appear in the app (some who haven’t filed a claim in 10+ years don’t show up)
* Scott likes it (has the Samsung fold and it fits every single time)
    * Likes that it shows your most recent appointment right on top with a different section for past appointments
    * Thinks the tab bar is very helpful
    * Home page may be confusing (with “About VA”)
    * We keep it simple
    * He worries that the VA website is too cluttered / complicated for those who are visually impaired, but he thinks that ours is perfect and “not gooey”
