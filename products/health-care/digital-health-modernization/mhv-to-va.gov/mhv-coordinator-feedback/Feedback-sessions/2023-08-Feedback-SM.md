# MHVC feedback sessions: Secure Messaging 
## August 2023 

## Takeaways  

### Inbox  

#### Scrolling:  
- Gravitation to filter, but concerns about utility of what that filter can enable filtering/sorting. Scanability/scrolling of inbox seemed to not be preferred go-to of Coordinators, in that they described using filter or referring to date as concrete point (however, this might be due to task).
- Voiced concern about Veterans ability to use provider names (due to triage group names complications) and message ID as ways to filter. Message ID cited as something Veterans most likely won’t know by 3 out of 3 Coordinators.  

#### Starting a message:
- Like that at top and easiest CTA
- Some concern that not most obvious CTA and that some Veterans might miss it (organically brought up by 2 out of 3 Coordinators) 

### Transition from conversation view to compose a message 
- All Coordinators able to transition from conversation view to compose a message
- All Coordinators voiced appreciation that Veterans will have to start a new message if older than 45 days
- Some confusion re: who sent the message (could be result of task; not knowing who Melvin/test user is)
- One Coordinator concerned that “draft” would be misunderstood by Veterans. Suggested “Cancel message”.  

### Navigating to Sent folder 
- All Coordinators used secondary nav to get to Sent folder
- Similar scrolling/ scanability observed as in Inbox view
- Similar use of filter, with similar concerns as Inbox view (Veterans won’t know message ID, might have issues with triage group names, may just use “General” category for expediency making subject unhelpful for filtering purposes) 

### General UX comments 
- 1 out of 3 mentioned concern re: whether Veterans will know to click on hyperlinks to open a message. Has this been answered in previous usability testing? If so, can cite those findings.
- 3 out of 3 worry about mobile experience. Could be helpful to do mobile demos in future.  

### Product Guide: only able to ask 2 out of 3 Coordinators about it (_waiting to confirm with Antonio_) 
- 2 out of 3 aware of product guide; reviewed in earlier days as Coordinator but not used regularly
- Prefer shorter “how-to” versions (particularly if can share with Veterans), in person trainings, or figuring out by doing.

## Conversation flow

Introductions & explanation of where SM is at to date (5 mins) 
- In Phase 0 -> been shared with “trusted users” to try out, provide with feedback, and generally help us to identify major issues or bugs.
- Also using Phase 0 to conduct 3rd round of usability testing with Veterans, focusing on Veterans with complex challenges.
- What looking for today – to get your feedback on several parts of the updated SM that the “trusted users” are currently using in Phase 0. Juxtapose Coordinator feedback with Veteran feedback – identify areas for improvement before launch to larger group of Veterans.  

Review & feedback for SM phase 0 (20 mins) 

Viewing the inbox

A message (2+ messages, want to see most recent, then convo): Transitioning from conversation view to compose messages

- This is an example of a message that a Veteran might have received.
- What are your thoughts on this page? What do you like/ dislike about it?
- Let’s say that you wanted to respond to the message that was sent on August 5th. How would you send a response to that message?  

Navigating to the Sent folder
