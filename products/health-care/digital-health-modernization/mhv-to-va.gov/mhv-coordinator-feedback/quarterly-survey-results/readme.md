# Quarterly MHV Coordinator Survey Results

This survey is initally shared during a monthly "What's New with MyHealtheVet on VA.gov" call. Coordinators are asked to complete the survey during the call. We found that having them fill it out at the beginning of the meeting results in more responses, then sharing the link at the end.
