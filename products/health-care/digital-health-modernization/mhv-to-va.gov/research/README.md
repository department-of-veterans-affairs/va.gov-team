## Key principles for user research on MHV on VA.gov

1. _Work in the open:_ Store all artifacts in public locations that are convenient to your team processes. These include: GitHub, SharePoint, VA Mural, and/or linked to ZenHub tickets. Do not store research artifacts in organization-centric locations. This ensures all collaborators can access research artifacts when needed.  
2. _Be collaborative and transparent:_ Engage a range of stakeholders throughout the research process, from identifying research questions to developing data collection instruments to analyzing data to sharing out findings. Diverse perspectives enhance the methodological rigor and utility of research processes. Regular demos are encouraged. 
3. _Be communicative:_ Communicate out progress in team Slack channels to ensure all relevant stakeholders are aware and in the loop.
