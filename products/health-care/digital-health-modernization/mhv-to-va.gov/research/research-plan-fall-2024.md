# Research Plan for Cartography Team, MHV on VA.gov portal, October 2024

## Background
The My HealtheVet on VA.gov team’s mission is to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov. This research is in large part intended to inform our understanding of how "simplified" the new health experience truly is for our users. 

[Product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product/product-brief.md)

### OCTO Priorities 
This research supports the following OCTO objective: Veterans can manage their health services online

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	
- What hinders our users from discovering and returning to MHV on VA.gov?
- What unintentional friction are our users encountering on MHV on VA.gov?
- What information about new features on VA.gov might counter-balance the challenges associated with switching to the new portal?
  
### Outcome
The learnings of this research will inform changes to the MHV on VA.gov experience and strategy for change management. 

### Research questions
- Are CTAs to try out the new MHV portal effective? Do users notice them and understand what they're saying?
- Once users try out the new portal, do they understand how to return?
- Are changes made to national portal language or tools causing confusion?
- How much do users care about what the new MHV offers them? 

### Hypothesis
- The majority of our users do not know that MHV is moving over to VA.gov, even directly after using the national portal. Many of them do not know what this change would or could mean for them outside of understanding that this change will pose a challenge to them that they would prefer to avoid.
- The guidance to try MHV on VA.gov is unclear and the user journey to get to MHV on VA.gov is disjointed and confusing.
- Users will be interested in the differentiators between the two portals but only those with a great deal of MHV experience will seem excited about the changes. 

## Methodology	
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. The interviews will require users to share their screens and demonstrate how they complete a task (or tasks, plural) on the national portal, and on the VA.gov portal. While we observe the participant as they navigate, we will also pose direct questions to understand how they are thinking about different aspects of their experience. When this part is complete, we will move to the second part of the interview, which will be a series of statements that the user will read and rate based on how they feel in response to the statements. 

### Research materials
Conversation guide
Statements for second part of interview (the rating part)
Mural board for note-taking and synthesis
	
## Recruitment	
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans.

We request a kickoff meeting with Perigean.

Availability for potential kickoff meeting times with Perigean, depending on their availability. Anticipate KO meeting lasting 30 minutes:

We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information in an encrypted Excel file on the VA Network.

### Recruitment approach


Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
We'll be testing on prod, so no artifact needs to be prepared for users to interact with.

* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
