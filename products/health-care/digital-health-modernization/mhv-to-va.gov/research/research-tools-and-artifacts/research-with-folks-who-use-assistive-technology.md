# How to prepare for conducting research with participants who use assistive technology if you have never done this before (or simply need a refresher)

**Step 1:** Read the information on this topic found on the [Platform Documentation site](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-assistive-technology-sessions)
- Estimated time burden: 1 hour

**Step 2:** Complete Level 1: Community Member of the [A11y Champs program](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/a11y-champs#accessibility-champions-community), including playing around with a screenreader

**Step 3:** Participate in a video demo of a research session with a person using a screenreader, followed by a Q&A with an a11y specialist

## Specific challenges that often come up in research sessions with screenreader users

_Hearing or not hearing screenreaders:_ Sometimes the audio for screenreaders comes through but not always. This can leave the moderator without a sense of when they are talking over screenreaders and increase confusion for participants. 
  - **Solution:** Allow extra time for participants to do things before asking questions. If necessary, ask the participant to tell you what the screenreader is saying. Confirm there's no screenreader audio happening when you ask questions. 

_Directing without using guidance that assumes sight:_ As sighted individuals, we are used to using visible symbols to guide navigation and wayfinding. These may not be useful to someone without sight. 
  - **Solution:** Include in your conversation guide specific ways to guide someone using a screenreader. Engage with an a11y specialist on how best to do this, while keeping in mind that different screenreader technology rely on different strategies and shortcuts. 

_Variation across screenreader tools:_ Basically the same as above - some shortcuts work for VoiceOver but not JAWS, for example. This can make it challenging to provide guidance on where to go in the event a participant becomes lost or confused. 
  - **Solution:** Include an a11y specialist as an observer who can help troubleshoot screenreader difficulties. Include in your conversation guide some generic backup guidance that can be used for a range of tools to redirect participants back to central locations, like a home or landing page. 

_Newer users of screenreaders might not be very comfortable with them yet:_ Folks who are just beginning to use screenreaders will most likely have greater difficulties performing tasks than folks who have more experience. For example, in a recent usability test with a beginner screenreader user, it took 45 minutes for the participant to log in. This is not unusual and shows the real challenges folks face to using the digital services we produce. 
  - **Solution:** No real solution. Prioritize participant wellbeing over data collection. Be kind and try to address any feelings of frustrations that may come up. Remind them this is not a test of their abilities and they are helping us enormously by allowing us to witness their experiences. Thank them a lot for being willing to participate in a research session. 

_Sessions with folks using screenreaders can be more emotionally tiring than with other groups of users_
  - **Solution:** Take care of yourself as you need. Include an a11y specialist in sessions for support. Budget extra time between sessions for emotional decompression. Assume sessions will go long and don't book too many in a given day.
