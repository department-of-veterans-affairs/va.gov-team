# MHV on VA.gov + Sign In Transition and Adoption
# Research Brief: Executive Summary

## Key challenges: 
-	Adoption of My HealtheVet (MHV) on VA.gov will not be possible if Veterans do not adopt Login.gov or ID.me and are able to use those credentials in a painless manner to access their digital health services. 
-	Multiple teams are communicating similar information to Veterans and VA staff and there is a need for cohesive, coordinated messaging grounded in an understanding of audience needs and realities.

## Lessons learned: Factors that influence transition and adoption
Through a review of previous human-centered design (HCD) research, grey and peer-reviewed literature, the following factors have been surfaced that will most likely impact Veterans transitioning to both modern credentials (ID.me or Login.gov) and MHV on VA.gov. These factors include: 

Technological - 
-	Device usage: having a device that enables remote identity proofing
-	Bandwidth and access to internet

Broader support context – 
-	Access to support: in-person or phone-based
-	Attitudes of support personnel towards the transitions
-	Resources and instructional guides: digital and paper-based

Awareness and Understanding – 
-	Awareness that a change is coming: for sign in, for transitioning MHV services onto VA.gov
-	Knowledge of how to transition: how to set up new login credential, MFA, and access MHV services on VA.gov
-	Knowledge of where to reach out for support

Attitudes and Motivations – 
-	Attitudes towards setting up and/or using new login credentials: informed by past experiences or problems
-	Motivation to change to new login credential: understanding and valuation of cost/benefits to transition
-	Attitudes towards MHV Liferay and VA.gov
-	Motivation to use VA.gov to access digital health services

## Takeaways and considerations for Communications team and Training & Support team

**Provide technical and self-service support for Veterans with less complex challenges; provide instructional guides and other resources to help staff support with more complex challenges**
- Veterans who are more confident and comfortable troubleshooting difficulties and navigating technical transitions will most likely prefer to carry out the majority of credentialing steps without VA staff. The degree to which UX flows and step-by-step instructions can enable this will most benefit this group of users.
- Veterans who are less able to troubleshoot or more easily confused by the transitions will need VA staff (both in-person and on the phone) to help them. This will require a cohesive strategy that empowers VA staff with relevant training and support guidance.
- Potential content for training and support guidance includes:
    - How to remote identity proof (this excludes guidance for Identity Verifiers who will conduct in-person identity proofing)
    - How to set up and use MFA
    - Awareness of password changing requirements and suggestions for how to manage passwords

**Engage VA staff groups and Veteran advocates (including Help Desk staff, MHV Coordinators, Veteran Serving Organizations, among others) early and often to ensure positive attitudes towards and collaboration with changes**
-	Research indicates that when VA staff and other change agents have negative attitudes towards digital services, or for other reasons do not promote digital services, Veterans are more likely to be unaware of services or echo negative attitudes towards said services.
-	At this point, we are unlikely to overcome attitudes based on past negative experiences with login issues or VA.gov.
-	What we can do is empower these audiences by communicating consistently and involving them in developing resources to help them support Veterans.
-	Could include engaging in feedback sessions around training and support resources with different groups, communicating back out how that feedback led to improvement in resources. 

**Collaborate with Research to establish effective feedback and monitoring strategies (or build upon existing strategies) in order to inform future Communications and Training and Support efforts**
- Strategy under development


# MHV on VA.gov + Sign In Research Brief

## Context:
- In an effort to consolidate digital resources into one central location such that Veterans can more efficiently and easily apply for and manage their health benefits and care, the VA patient portal My HealtheVet (MHV) is being migrated to VA.gov.
- This effort will require MHV users accessing health services on VA.gov, and therefore adapting to and adopting a new experience in a different website. 
-	There is a simultaneous effort to remove credentials that do not adhere to mandated security requirements, specifically DS Logon and the MHV credential, and transition Veterans to Login.gov and ID.me credentials. Adopting these credentials will require some Veterans to complete identity proofing and will require multifactor authentication (MFA) for all Veterans. 
Key challenges: 
-	Adoption of MHV on VA.gov will not be possible if Veterans do not adopt Login.gov or ID.me and are able to use those credentials in a painless manner to access their digital health services. 
-	Multiple teams are communicating similar information to Veterans and VA staff and there is a need for cohesive, coordinated messaging grounded in an understanding of audience needs and realities.

## What do we know about the Veteran audiences?

**Device usage:**
-	Between April and June, 2023, 30% of MHV users accessed MHV through either their phone or tablet ([My HealtheVet Metrics, April-June 2023](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/webusers))
-	In June, approximately 60% of mobile or table users accessed MHV through a device that would enable identity proofing (e.g., Apple device) (MHV Google Analytics dashboard)
-	However, two usability studies  found that the participants they spoke with preferred to use a computer to complete identity proofing ([Proactive CSP Migration Study, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration%20research%20findings.md); [Deferred Identity Proofing Usability Study, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/2023-03-Deferred-Identity-Proofing-Round-1-Usability))

**Demographics:**  
-	In June, approximately 40% of users were above the age of 55. (MHV Google Analytics dashboard)
-	MHV Coordinators cite older Veterans as requiring additional assistance with digital services, including both navigating and using MHV and VA.gov, as well as in navigating sign in challenges like multifactor authentication ([MHV Coordinator Quarterly Survey, July 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/mhv-coordinator-feedback/quarterly-survey-results))
o	This is supported in the broader literature about the ways in which advanced age many contribute to low rates of patient portal enrollment and digital platform use ([Improving Patient Access to the My HealtheVet Electronic Patient Portal for Veterans, 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10071446/)) 
-	While it is unknown how many MHV users are rural vs. urban, a higher proportion of rural Veterans are enrolled in the VA healthcare system (61% versus 41% of urban Veterans); 27% of rural Veterans do not access internet at home, potentially complicating their ability to transition to modern sign in credentials or transitioning to a new web experience ([Rural Veterans Health Care Challenges, 2022](https://www.ruralhealth.va.gov/aboutus/ruralvets.asp#atlas)).
    -	This group also is disproportionately older (55% over the age of 65), are more likely to have medically complex conditions, and often have greater difficulty accessing in-person care, increasing the urgency of keeping them connected to digital care services like MHV. 
-	Additional research into the digital divide in Veteran communities has demonstrated that Veterans who are younger, with higher educational attainment, more health literate, and more comfortable with technologies like navigating the internet and using email are more likely and more able to use digital healthcare services ([The Digital Divide Amongst High-Need High-Risk Veterans, 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8680628/)). 

**Broader support context:** 
-	The role of healthcare providers and patient advocates in promoting adoption of digital health resources has been well documented (see [Veterans’ Perspectives on the Meaning of MyHealtheVet as it Impacts Adoption, 2020](https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=2067816&facet_format_t=%22application%2Fpdf%22&facet_date_t=%222020%22&sort=created_tdt+desc) for a more detailed review of the literature). 
-	Discovery research revealed that many Veterans trust VA staff opinions. Communications with VA staff – like healthcare providers, MHV Coordinators, or Helpdesk staff – can influence Veterans’ attitudes towards a change in VA websites and digital systems (VEO EHRM Discovery Report: Health Portal Experience, 2021)
-	MHV Coordinators have historically provided substantial support to Veterans accessing and using MHV. Veterans also have the option of calling into Virtual Health Resource Centers to receive phone-based support. 
-	Navigating sign in challenges, including essential steps to adopting login.gov and ID.me like identity proofing and multifactor authorization, have been cited by MHV Coordinators, Help Desk workers, and through surveys provided by VSignals as primary barriers experienced by the Veterans they work with ([MHV Coordinator Quarterly Survey, July 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/mhv-coordinator-feedback/quarterly-survey-results); OCC My HealtheVet Management Dashboard, 2023)

## Barriers and facilitators

**Motivations and attitudes towards change: Sign in/Identity** 
It is reasonable to expect some or many Veterans to be reticent to change to a new login option. One study found that their participants would continue to use familiar credentials (like My HealtheVet or DS Logon) even after setting up a Login.gov account (Login.gov Adoption Discovery Study, 2022).

Multiple studies ([Proactive CSP Migration Study, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration%20research%20findings.md); [Deferred Identity Proofing Usability Study, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/2023-03-Deferred-Identity-Proofing-Round-1-Usability); [Login.gov Adoption Discovery Study, 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research/login.gov%20adoption%20discovery%20research%20findings.md)) have observed that their Veteran participants are motivated to change login options only when: 
-	They are forced to change – i.e., in response to fearing loss of access to their benefits (observed most often)
-	They will obtain new benefits from transitioning to a new login experience

**Motivations and attitudes towards change: MHV on VA.gov** 
Discovery research that validated the premise of MHV on VA.gov indicates that Veterans are often confused by having their benefits located in disparate websites and would value a centralized location to access all their benefits and services, including health services (VEO EHRM Discovery Report: Health Portal Experience, 2021; [Digital Health Modernization Generative Research Study, 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/6)). 

That being said, some MHV users have been using My HealtheVet Liferay for years or decades and have internalized the mental model of this experience. 
-	A 2023 study showed that some MHV users are likely to struggle to adapt to navigating the VA.gov experience and may require additional support to locate their digital health services in the new platform ([Health Wayfinding Study, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-06-health-wayfinding-study))
-	Multiple studies have also shown that some Veterans do not distinguish between My HealtheVet Liferay, VA.gov, and other VA websites, conflating them into a pan-VA digital space ([Health Wayfinding Study, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-06-health-wayfinding-study); [MHV on VA.gov Landing Page Usability Testing, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/landing-page/research/2023-03-Landing-Page-User-Research); [MHV on VA.gov Round 1 Usability Research Findings, 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/initial-mhv-prototype/Round2_Usability))
-	This is further complicated when Veterans conflate My HealtheVet the credential with My HealtheVet the website, which has been observed amongst MHV users who do not use VA.gov ([Proactive CSP Migration Study, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration%20research%20findings.md))
Feedback from MHV Coordinators indicates that attitudes towards transitioning to VA.gov are likely to be influenced by past experiences and current attitudes towards the login experience ([MHV Coordinator Quarterly Survey, July 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/mhv-coordinator-feedback/quarterly-survey-results)). 
-	For example, if Veterans (or Coordinators) have had past negative experiences logging in, setting up and using MFA, or switching to a new credential, these attitudes will inform their attitudes towards transitioning MHV to VA.gov. 

**Multifactor authentication (MFA): Barriers and facilitators** 
Past studies indicate there is most likely a range of knowledge and skills related to how to set up and use MFA. 
-	One study found that most of their participants understood the concept of MFA, some of whom could recall the term or related term ([Proactive CSP Migration Study, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration%20research%20findings.md)). However, this same study and another study found that some of their participants confused and conflated authentication and verification purposes and processes ([Proactive CSP Migration Study, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration%20research%20findings.md); [Deferred Identity Proofing Usability Study, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/2023-03-Deferred-Identity-Proofing-Round-1-Usability)), indicating a gap in knowledge amongst some Veterans.
-	It is probable that many or most Veterans will choose to set up SMS and are somewhat familiar with using SMS for MFA. Identity researchers found this during discovery research and further confirmed this finding by data from Login.gov ([Deferred Identity Proofing Usability Study, 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/2023-03-Deferred-Identity-Proofing-Round-1-Usability)). It is possible, however, that this approach is more difficult for Veterans living in rural regions with slow cell service (VEO EHRM Discovery Report: Health Portal Experience, 2021)
-	Importantly, VSignals feedback indicate that a portion of MHV users struggle with MFA, often requesting that MFA requirements be removed (OCC My HealtheVet Management Dashboard, 2023). This is not possible given policies around MFA requirements but indicates a need for additional support for some Veterans to ensure they have enabled and are using MFA correctly.
