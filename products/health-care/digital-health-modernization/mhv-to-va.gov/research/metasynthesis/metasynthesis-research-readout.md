# My HealtheVet - Metasynthesis research readout
By: Athena Bozak, Florence McCafferty, Jonathan Nelson, Sara Sterkenburg

## Executive Summary
A "metasynthesis" in research refers to a method of synthesizing and interpreting findings from multiple qualitative research studies; combining their themes and meaning in order to develop new knowledge, theories, explanations, or insights.

In February 2025, the Cartography Team worked with OCTO research lead Robyn Singleton to analyze 34 past research studies from the VA research repository through the lens of high-level research questions related to both My HealtheVet and the broader authenticated experience on VA.gov. We hoped to surface new insights that held true across multiple studies, and measure our degree of confidence in that insight. We believe research insights with a high degree of confidence can unblock strategic business decisions that will generate known user value. Research insights with a low degree of confidence indicate that additional research will need to be conducted to confirm whether or not they are ripe for design solutioning. In effect, this research report seeks to develop a research and design roadmap: exposing known pain points in the user's navigation and behavioral experience that can move into solutioning; and possible pain points, where further research study development would make the most sense as the business is able to take it on.

## <a name="questions"></a>Research questions <br>
1.  **What are the most consistent health-related navigational pain points (health specific)?**
    * What are the common issues or frustrations Veterans face when trying to find or use health-related tools and information on MHV?
2. **What are the highest impact navigation-related pain points (General/all of VA?)**
    * What navigation problems that cause the biggest challenges or make it hardest for Veterans to accomplish their tasks?
3. **How do behaviors differ (or don’t) in the health space compared with the benefits space (health/ general all of VA)?**
    * Do Veterans use My HealtheVet (health) differently than they use VA.gov for benefits? If so, how? If not, what’s the same?
4. **What do Veterans expect from an authenticated experience on VA.gov that includes benefits from a range of VA sub-agencies? (general/all of VA)**
    * What do Veterans want or expect when they log in to VA.gov, especially when it comes to easily accessing benefits and services from different VA departments (like health care, education, or disability)?
5. **What are the use cases where there’s overlap between health and other areas, where people might not find what they need in the health space? (Health/general all of VA)**
    * When do Veterans’ needs for health-related tools or information cross over into other areas (like benefits or education), and where does this overlap cause confusion or make it hard for them to find what they need?

### Identifying a pool of previous studies
Our team identified and analyzed 34 previous studies that we thought were most relevant to re-analysis in order to surface any previously identified pain points related to comprehension + navigation that may still persist in relation to the My HealtheVet health portal on VA.gov and the broader authenticated experience. These studies were initially conducted by a wide variety of teams working on VA.gov, and vary in methods from card-sort and tree-test studies, evaluative research, generative research. Some broadly consider authenticated experiences on VA.gov, information organization, user needs for personalization and help, and more. A full list of citations to the 34 studies that were reviewed are listed below in the "Sources cited" section. 

### Seeking specific information
As a team, we divided up the studies and re-analyzed each one. Some were highly releavnt to our research questions, and others turned out to be less valuable. Since many of these studies are multiple years old, primary pain points or problems may have been solved or remedied already, so the current validity of old findings is certainly a question. We paid some attention to our knowledge of what has and has not changed since each study occurred and bubbled up insights from each study. If a given insight rang true across _more than one study_, we considered it a macro "insight" for the purposes of this report. 

### Evaluating the findings
We quickly realized the need to measure the relative evidence for each insight, and our confidence that the problem persists now in 2025. So, we developed a confidence rating rubric to rank our insights in a consistent way. Each insight will be marked with a low, medium, or high confidence rating.

#### Confidence rubric:
| # of studies | Data diversity  | Recency | Study quality/rigor |
|:-------------|:----------------|:--------|:--------------------|
| Two studies | 1 method (5 points) | Outdated: more than 2 years old (5 points) | Low (5 points) |
| Three studies (10 points) | 2 methods (10 points) | Slightly outdated: 1-2 years old (10 points) | Medium (10 points) |
| More than three studies (15 points) | Mixed methods (15 points) | Recent: less than 1 year (15 points) | High (15 points) |

**Add values and calculate the score:**
* 20-30 total points: **low confidence** in evidence
* 30-45 points: **medium confidence** in evidence
* 45-60points: **high confidence** in evidence

- Co-design research
- Discovery research
- Card sort

**Details:** 

Veterans desire a personalized and centralized online experience, that streamlines access to their most relevant benefits, tasks, and personalized notifications.

**Examples across the study:**

"Veterans want their experience to be tailored to them—a 'digital version of themselves'” reflecting what matters to them, right now (Review of related user research: Mobile app personalization, July 2023). 

"Veterans want a page that is focused on current information specific to them, rather than generalized information for all Veterans " (VA.gov home page user research, 2023). 

Veterans had positive reactions to seeing My VA immediately upon login because it was more personalized and showed them "their stuff" (My VA audit, March 2023).
Veterans prefer a concise overview of urgent or actionable items on a landing page...(My VA redesign research findings, Dec 2020). 

Many participants expressed appreciation for the personalization of My VA. Those who favored the homepage valued its versatility and the range of actions it allowed. Meanwhile, users who preferred My VA highlighted its streamlined and personalized experience. Regardless of their preference, both groups acknowledged the benefits of My VA’s personalization (My VA 2 research, March 2021).

### Insight 2: Veterans expect that VA.gov can leverage information it already has about them to surface details about additional benefits that they’re likely to be eligible for.**

**Methods:**

- Usability study
- Co-design research
- Discovery research
- Social listening
- Tree-test

**Details:**

Across at least 9 studies and nearly 30% of the studies reviewed for this metasynthesis, there are recurrent themes of Veterans expecting the VA to leverage known information about them to connect them with additional benefits that they may be eligible for.

More specifically, Veterans are interested in clear information that helps them: 

- Learning about benefits that they may not already know about;
- Understand the likelihood of their eligibility before taking the time to apply
- Whether or not their family members are eligible for care
- How to determine their eligibility for additional health benefits like dental and vision care 

**Example findings from various studies:**

- “Veterans are overwhelmed … [they] do not know what they’re eligible for, and aren’t sure how to find out. Veterans expect the VA to make use of their personal information: personalize their VA.gov and MHV experience, use personal and military information to make recommendations for benefits they are likely to be eligible for.” (Logged-in homepage research, 2020)
- Many Veterans suggested that a “benefits screening tool” or recommendation system could surface benefits they may be eligible for based on their profile. (Digital Health Modernization Generative Research Study, Sept 2021)
- "[I want to know] things we may be eligible for: all the resources VA offers. For example, I didn't know about Vocational Rehab until the VA person who helped me do my claim told me about it. [I’d like to see it all together] on one page instead of going through websites." - (P2, VA mobile app prototype testing and co-design research)
- The GI Bill comparison tool is great but what are the other things you could be eligible for? There is no quick and dirty "this is what you may be qualified for." (P3, Transitioning service-member interview; My VA Personalization 2.0 discovery research) 

In healthcare specifically, a social listening study identified a high negative sentiment around eligibility (7/25 posts analyzed), and also found that there is significant misinformation about how eligibility and care coverage works (10/26 posts analyzed). Veterans expect transparency when they become eligible for a new benefit type, or a change in the amount of coverage; but on the other hand they also expect to be notified if their coverage decreases or they lose access. 

- “How do I know if my wife is covered healthcare wise? Do I need to start paying for Tricare? I’ve heard a lot about CHAMPVA - should we apply for that? I’m 100% P&T sorry for all the questions and a bit of a breakdown. It’s a lot and I”m pretty confused by all of it. I just want my loved ones taken care of.” (Social listening healthcare mental model, Sept 2024)
- I just had my first appointment yesterday and the nurse looked stunned when I told her I had no other insurance. She explained that if I were in a car crash or something, it'd be unlikely that the VA would pay for the treatment I'd receive in the ER. (Social listening healthcare mental model, Sept 2024)

### Insight 3: Veterans want to be notified about changes, updates, or new information - especially time-sensitive information. 

Studies supporting this insight:

VA Mobile research review: Personalized app homescreen, Nov 2021
Mobile comparative analysis: Personalized and contextual home screen content, July 2023
Review of related user research: Mobile app personalization, July 2023
Methods:

Co-design research
Desk research
Comparative analysis
Details: 
Findings around notifications emerged in five of the studies reviewed. 
Veterans value timely, personalized notifications to enhance transparency, manage claims, and stay informed about relevant updates.
Notifications are highly useful. Veterans value learning about something relevant as soon as possible and voiced that notifications could bring more transparency to their VA experience (VA Mobile App Prototype Testing and Co-Design Research, 2020). 

Personalized notifications and more general notifications both have potential to be useful, but personal ones are much higher value (VA Mobile App Prototype Testing and Co-Design Research, 2020). 
"There are town hall meetings - any kind of meetings - VA does lots of good things, if I knew about them I could schedule appointments and attend." -- P4
"Notifications would be really useful - the more specific ones that are personalized. That would function the way I think VA launchpad could have been." -- P5
"VA information would need to be more specific...important things that are happening that we need to know about and suggestions for other things I am eligible for or any changes to their policies [are the types of things I want to be notified about]." -- P2

Transparency in claim status updates are critical, with Veterans requesting clear timestamps, pending status indicators, and proactive notifications (VA Mobile App Prototype Testing and Co-Design Research, 2020) 
Veterans value a system that allows them to manage their claims and documents to the best of their ability. This management includes timely notifications, shortcuts to streamline frequent tasks, and secure messaging to receive answers on demand (Review of related user research: Mobile app personalization, July 2023). 


Veterans' mental model around notifications is shaped by their online experiences.
A comparative analysis reviewing 26 apps across industries found notifications in 16 of the apps reviewed. 
Notifications were present in half of the apps, but overwhelmingly they were not included on the home screen (Mobile comparative analysis: Personalized and contextual home screen content, July 2023) 
Further research revealed,  
All competitors use badge indicators and/or card-style notifications to draw the user's attention to new, unread, or time-sensitive information (Landing page gap analysis, July 2024)

All competitors highly personalize the page to clearly communicate information unique to the user. Personalized components (notification cards or sections with specific content) are almost always given primary hierarchy placement on the page, but some features are prioritized as secondary (i.e. notification badges that are less visually "loud" or prominent) (Landing page gap analysis, July 2024). 

When it comes to notifications and updates on the My VA webpage, Veterans expect to see them at the top of the page (VA Mobile research review: Personalized app homescreen, Nov 2021)
