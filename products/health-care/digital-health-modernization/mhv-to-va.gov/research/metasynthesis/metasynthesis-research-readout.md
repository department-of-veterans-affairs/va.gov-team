# My HealtheVet - Metasynthesis research readout
By: Athena Bozak, Florence McCafferty, Jonathan Nelson, Sara Sterkenburg

## Executive Summary
A "metasynthesis" in research refers to a method of synthesizing and interpreting findings from multiple qualitative research studies; combining their themes and meaning in order to develop new knowledge, theories, explanations, or insights.

In February 2025, the Cartography Team worked with OCTO research lead Robyn Singleton to analyze 41 past research studies from the VA research repository through the lens of high-level research questions related to both My HealtheVet and the broader authenticated experience on VA.gov. We hoped to surface new insights that held true across multiple studies, and measure our degree of confidence in that insight. We believe research insights with a high degree of confidence can unblock strategic business decisions that will generate known user value. Research insights with a low degree of confidence indicate that additional research will need to be conducted to confirm whether or not they are ripe for design solutioning. In effect, this research report seeks to develop a research and design roadmap: exposing known pain points in the user's navigation and behavioral experience that can move into solutioning; and possible pain points, where further research study development would make the most sense as the business is able to take it on.

## <a name="questions"></a>Research questions <br>
1.  **What are the most consistent health-related navigational pain points (health specific)?**
    * What are the common issues or frustrations Veterans face when trying to find or use health-related tools and information on MHV?
2. **What are the highest impact navigation-related pain points (General/all of VA?)**
    * What navigation problems that cause the biggest challenges or make it hardest for Veterans to accomplish their tasks?
3. **How do behaviors differ (or don’t) in the health space compared with the benefits space (health/ general all of VA)?**
    * Do Veterans use My HealtheVet (health) differently than they use VA.gov for benefits? If so, how? If not, what’s the same?
4. **What do Veterans expect from an authenticated experience on VA.gov that includes benefits from a range of VA sub-agencies? (general/all of VA)**
    * What do Veterans want or expect when they log in to VA.gov, especially when it comes to easily accessing benefits and services from different VA departments (like health care, education, or disability)?
5. **What are the use cases where there’s overlap between health and other areas, where people might not find what they need in the health space? (Health/general all of VA)**
    * When do Veterans’ needs for health-related tools or information cross over into other areas (like benefits or education), and where does this overlap cause confusion or make it hard for them to find what they need?

### Identifying a pool of previous studies
Our team identified and analyzed 41 previous studies that we thought were most relevant to re-analysis in order to surface any previously identified pain points related to comprehension + navigation that may still persist in relation to the My HealtheVet health portal on VA.gov and the broader authenticated experience. These studies were initially conducted by a wide variety of teams working on VA.gov, and vary in methods from card-sort and tree-test studies, evaluative research, generative research. Some broadly consider authenticated experiences on VA.gov, information organization, user needs for personalization and help, and more. A full list of citations to the 41 studies that were reviewed are listed below in the "Sources cited" section. 

### Seeking specific information
As a team, we divided up the studies and re-analyzed each one. Some were highly releavnt to our research questions, and others turned out to be less valuable. Since many of these studies are multiple years old, primary pain points or problems may have been solved or remedied already, so the current validity of old findings is certainly a question. We paid some attention to our knowledge of what has and has not changed since each study occurred and bubbled up insights from each study. If a given insight rang true across _more than one study_, we considered it a macro "insight" for the purposes of this report. 

### Evaluating the findings
We quickly realized the need to measure the relative evidence for each insight, and our confidence that the problem persists now in 2025. So, we developed a confidence rating rubric to rank our insights in a consistent way. Each insight will be marked with a low, medium, or high confidence rating.

#### Confidence rubric:
| # of studies | Data diversity  | Recency | Study quality/rigor |
|:-------------|:----------------|:--------|:--------------------|
| Single comprehensive studies (5 points) | Single method (5 points) | Outdated: more than 2 years old (5 points) | Low (5 points) |
| Two different studies (10 points) | Two methods (10 points) | Slightly outdated: 1-2 years old (10 points) | Mild (10 points) |
| Three or more studies (15 points) | Mixed methods (15 points) | Recent: less than 1 year (15 points) | High (15 points) |

**Add values and calculate the score:**
* 20-30 total points: **low confidence** in evidence
* 30-45 points: **medium confidence** in evidence
* 45-60points: **high confidence** in evidence
