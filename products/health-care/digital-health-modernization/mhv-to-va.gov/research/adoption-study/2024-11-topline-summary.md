This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholders/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes 

Note: We will gather numbers for appropriate findings during final synthesis

## Research Goals	
- What hinders our users from discovering and returning to MHV on VA.gov?
- What unintentional friction are our users encountering on MHV on 
VA.gov?
- What information about new features on VA.gov might counter-balance
the challenges associated with switching to the new portal?

### Hypothesis
- The majority of our users do not know that MHV is moving over to VA.gov, even directly after using the national portal. Many of them do not know what this change would or could mean for them outside of understanding that this change will pose a challenge to them that they would prefer to avoid.
    - Partially true: Participants were able to conceptualize the My HealtheVet to VA.gov migration to some extent. However, perceived challenges, such as sign-in/learning a new thing were potential blockers. 
      
- The guidance to try MHV on VA.gov is unclear and the user journey to get to MHV on VA.gov is disjointed and confusing.
    - Partially true: Participants seemed to understand the messaging within the "Try-me" banner. However, participants often scrolled past the banner.
    - The journey between MHV National portal and MHV on VA.gov was disjoined and introduced confusion. 

- Users will be interested in what we’ve decided are the most important or useful differentiators between the two portals but only those with a great deal of MHV experience will seem excited about the changes.
    - True: Participants were excited about having benefits, health care, and other VA information in one place. Also, managing Community Care appointments and direct scheduling were positives for participants. 

## Initial Findings

- Our research revealed low engagement with the "Try Me" banners on the My HealtheVet National Portal. Participants frequently scrolled past these banners.
- While participants generally understood the concept of the MHV to VA.gov transition, significant uncertainty remained regarding its practical implications. Concerns centered around potential disruptions to established workflows, including the need for repeated logins and possible loss of functionality.
- Even those able to conceptualize the transition, participants frequently conflated the MHV National Portal and MHV on VA.gov.
- While participants identified ways to access My HealtheVet on VA.gov in the future (such as using bookmarks), the sessions did not definitively establish their ability to navigate back to My HealtheVet on VA.gov and often participants voiced circuitous routes to return.
- Participants understood updated language (e.g., "Pharmacy" to "Medications") and understood the in-tool experiences. The confusion arose with naming My HealtheVet in two places (see above).
- Participants positively noted the streamlined experience, access to community care information, and the consolidation of services within VA.gov 
- The secondary navigation proved effective for both orientation and navigation across tools

## Detailed findings (by research questions) 

**Research questions**

1. Are CTAs to try out the new MHV portal effective? Do users notice them
and understand what they're saying?

**Effectiveness of CTAs: Our research revealed low engagement with prominent "Try Me" banners on the MHV national portal. Participants frequently scrolled past these banners.**

Possible reasons:

**Task-focused behavior:**

> "If I've already made it this far to the page, I don't care about all this. I"m already where I was trying to be" - P2

> "Hmm..no, i usually scroll really fast and went right down to my appointments. - P13

**Banner overload**

> "3 boxes all the same color makes it seem like these are all the same information." - P2

**Some participants skimmed the first banner on the page and language like "retiring MHV" password seemed to add confusion.**

> "And then at once point, it's giving you the option to cancel your MHV. But if you do that you can't get into any of this stuff . So why are they doing that?" - P12

**Precieved irrelevant massaging**

> "I have all these banners here and I tend to ignore them."  - P9

> No, honestly I look past these most of the time. I used to pay attention to them when I first started using MHV but it seemed that none of it was truly important." - P5

**Understanding the Transition: While participants generally understood the concept of the MHV to VA.gov transition, significant uncertainty remained regarding its practical implications. Concerns centered around potential disruptions to established workflows, including the need for repeated logins and possible loss of functionality.**

> "I think it will take me to VA.gov, but I wonder if it will make me login again." - P10

> "I won't come to Va.gov until it's fully functional. Now I have to click one more time to go back. Nobody wants to turn backward." - P 13

> "There is no driver to make me want to click on that, especially when everything is still available as an option" - P2

**Navigational Challenges: Even those able to conceptualize transition, participants frequently conflated the MHV national portal and MHV on VA.gov.** 

This confusion stemmed from several factors:

**Naming conventions**: The consistent use of "My HealtheVet" for both platforms created ambiguity for participants. 

> "It's confusing that it's still called this, but it's different. I think it would be less confusing if it was just different"** - P1 

**Navigation inconsistencies:** Misunderstandings about link behavior—expecting MHV links to redirect to the national portal and vice-versa—led to significant navigational difficulties.

The expectation that My HealtheVet links (in the global header, authenticated menu, and secondary navigation) would redirect to the national portal, and the belief that health links within My VA would keep users on VA.gov, led to navigational confusion among most participants.

Clicked on My HealtheVet in the Secondary Nav participant is trying to go backward by clicking that My Healthevet in the secondary navigation

> "Expected it to take me to the page I was just at. But it left me on the new version?" - P 12

> "Depending on which button you hit at what time, it's gonna look different so it's important you understand what terms you're looking for. So right now I just went back to VA.gov."  - P11

**URL reliance and confusion:** A few participants some relied on URLs for orientation, the integration of VA.gov within the MHV national portal URL proved confusing. 

> "I know I'm in MHV because I scroll up and it's there (looking at My HealtheVet logo but then notices VA.gov in URL) it's a little confusing. I'm not techy so maybe they're linked. I signed into MHV, but this says VA.gov. Did they already switch?" - P13

2. Once users try out the new portal, do they understand how to return?

**While participants identified ways to access My HealtheVet on VA.gov in the future (such as using bookmarks), the sessions did not definitively establish their ability to navigate back to My HealtheVet on VA.gov and often participants voiced circuitous routes to return.**

> "I would honestly have to pock around bc I would not know how to get to this again." (VA.gov version) - P12

3.  Are changes made to the national portal language or tools causing confusion?

Further analysis is needed - Participants did not comment on language (e.g., "Pharmacy" to "Medications") and understood the in-tool experiences. The confusion arose with naming My HealtheVet in two places (see above). 

4.  What challenges or hiccups are users encountering on the new portal?

Further analysis is needed - They expected to be able to schedule directly under appointments. 

5.  What are positive changes that users notice while using the new portal?/6. How much do users care about what the new MHV offers them?

**Participants positively noted the streamlined experience, access to community care information, and the consolidation of services within VA.gov. 

> "Mainly just because of how easier it was to get to compared to the old version for me." - P1 participant has trouble with remembering how to spell/say My HealtheVet)

> "Have info in one centralized area and not having to hunt for things...Once VA finishes Medical Records, you'll have all the documents you need." - P5 

> "Streamlined options all on one site." - P9

> "To me, you all are trying to improve our care...including community care." - P10

**Tool specific** 

Medications 
> "Traditionally I wouldn't be able to click one button to fill them all. I'd have to go down the list and hunt and pick the ones that were ready" - P12

**The secondary navigation proved effective for both orientation and navigation across tools.** 

9 of the 10 participants used the secondary navigation to establish a "sense of place" and/or move between tools. 

> "very fluid" - P9

> "This does look like the newer version of things (looking at secondary navigation) This is the newer version because the top there. The icons, the style is different" - P12

## Other takeaways 

8. 7 of 10 participants utilized a web search to locate the My HealtheVet national portal, indicating challenges associated with the site's naming convention. 

> "I can never remember 'My HealtheVet' The whole 'evet' part just throws me off, I don't know why" - P1

Participants noted VA.gov was easier to remember 

> "VA.gov is a lot easier to remember." - P11
