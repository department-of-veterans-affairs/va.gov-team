## Research Goals

This research aims to assess users' understanding, reactions, and expectations to the transition of My HealtheVet to VA.gov. We wanted to achieve the specific goals of: 

- What hinders our users from discovering and returning to MHV on VA.gov?
- What unintentional friction are our users encountering on MHV on VA.gov?
- What information about new features on VA.gov might counter-balance the challenges associated with switching to the new portal? 

## Research Questions

- Are CTAs to try out the new MHV portal effective? Do users notice them
and understand what they're saying?
- Once users try out the new portal, do they understand how to return?
- Are changes made to national portal language or tools causing confusion?
- What challenges or hiccups are users encountering on the new portal?
- What are positive changes that users notice while using the new portal?
- How much do users care about what the new MHV offers them?

## Methodology 

We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. The interviews will require users to share their screens and demonstrate how they complete a task (or tasks, plural) on the national portal, and on the VA.gov portal. While we observe the participant as they navigate, we will also pose direct questions to understand how they are thinking about different aspects of their experience. When this part is complete, we will move to the second part of the interview, which will be a series of statements that the user will read andrate based on how they feel in response to the statements.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. The majority of our users do not know that MHV is moving over to VA.gov, even directly after using the national portal. Many of them do not know what this change would or could mean for them outside of understanding that this change will pose a challenge to them that they would prefer to avoid.
    - Likely true: Participants were able to conceptualize the My HealtheVet to VA.gov migration to some extent. However, perceived challenges, such as sign-in/learning a new thing were potential blockers.
2. The guidance to try MHV on VA.gov is unclear and the user journey to get to MHV on VA.gov is disjointed and confusing.
    - Likely true: Participants seemed to understand the messaging within the "Try-me" banner. However, the journey between MHV National portal and MHV on VA.gov was disjoined and introduced confusion.
3. Users will be interested in what we’ve decided are the most important or useful differentiators between the two portals but only those with a great deal of MHV experience will seem excited about the changes.
    - Definitely True/Not enough information: Participants were excited about having benefits, health care, and other VA information in one place. Also, managing Community Care appointments and direct scheduling were positives for participants. 

## Key Findings

1. Participants ignored the "Try Me" banners on the My HealtheVet National Portal, scrolling past them. 
2. Most participants generally understood the concept of the My HealtheVet to VA.gov transition, however, significant uncertainty remained regarding its practical implications. 
3. Even among those who could conceptualize the transition, participants often conflated the My HealtheVet National Portal with My HealtheVet on VA.gov.
4. While participants identified ways to access My HealtheVet on VA.gov in the future, such as using bookmarks, the study highlighted challenges in navigating back to My HealtheVet on VA.gov. 
5. Participants identified My HealtheVet on VA.gov as a familiar portal for health care, with most participants expressing positive views on the  updates.
6. The secondary navigation proved effective in supporting both participant orientation and navigation amongst the various tools within the health portal.

## Details of Findings 

### 1. Participants ignored the "Try Me" banners on the My HealtheVet National Portal, scrolling past them. 

Among the ten participants, none engaged with the "Try Me" banners promoting My HealtheVet on VA.gov. Participants' task-focused behavior, banner overload, and perceived irrelevant messaging contributed to the lack of engagement.

**_All 10 participants demonstrated a strong focus on task completion and scrolled past the banner._**

> "If I've already made it this far to the page, I don't care about all this. I"m already where I was trying to be." - P2

> "Hmm, no, I usually scroll really fast and went right down to my appointments." - P13

**_Some participants perceived the banners as irrelevant._**

> No, honestly I look past these most of the time. I used to pay attention to them when I first started using MHV but it seemed that none of it was truly important." - P5

**_At least 5 of 10 participants experienced banner overload. The presentation of two to three vertically stacked banners of similar coloration resulted in a lack of visual differentiation among them._**

> "3 boxes all the same color makes it seem like these are all the same information." - P2

> "I have all these banners here and I tend to ignore them." - P9

> "And then at one point, it's giving you the option to cancel your MHV. But if you do that you can't get into any of this stuff . So why are they doing that?" - P12

### 2. Most participants generally understood the concept of the My HealtheVet to VA.gov transition, however, significant uncertainty remained regarding its practical implications. 

Despite a conceptual understanding of the My HealtheVet to VA.gov transition, most participants (8 of 10) expressed considerable uncertainty, citing concerns about workflow disruptions, repeated login requirements, and possible loss of functionality. 

_3 participants noted disruption of workflow:_

> "There is no driver to make me want to click on that, especially when everything is still available as an option" - P2

_3 Participants mentioned login as a potential barrier_

> "I think it will take me to VA.gov, but I wonder if it will make me login again...My concern is I'm already on MHV. Do I have to login again and go through that frustration?" - P10

_2 Participants pointed to functionality, specifically Medical records not being available. 

> "I won't come to VA.gov until it's fully functional. Now I have to click one more time to go back. Nobody wants to turn backward." - P 13

---

### 3. Even among those who could conceptualize the transition, participants often conflated the My HealtheVet National Portal with My HealtheVet on VA.gov.

Despite being able to articulate the My HealtheVet transition, participants (9 of 10) experienced a persistent challenge in differentiating between the two My HealtheVet platforms throughout the study. This confusion stemmed from several factors including naming conventions and navigation challenges. 

_**The consistent use of "My HealtheVet" for both platforms created ambiguity for some participants (4 of 10).**_

> "It's confusing that it's still called this, but it's different. I think it would be less confusing if it was just different"** - P1

> "I know I'm in MHV because I scroll up and it's there (looking at My HealtheVet logo but then notices VA.gov in URL) it's a little confusing. I'm not techy so maybe they're linked. I signed into MHV, but this says VA.gov. Did they already switch?" - P13

_**Navigation inconsistencies and confusion around link behavior provoked uncertainty with most participants (9 of 10).**_

The expectation that My HealtheVet links in the global header, authenticated menu, and secondary navigation would redirect participants to the My HealtheVet National Portal created ambiguity. Furthermore, the assumption that healthcare links within My VA would keep users on My HealtheVet within VA.gov caused navigational confusion for most participants. 

> "Expected it to take me to the page I was just at. But it left me on the new version?" - P 12

> "Depending on which button you hit at what time, it's gonna look different so it's important you understand what terms you're looking for."  - P11

### 4. While participants identified ways to access My HealtheVet on VA.gov in the future, such as using bookmarks, the sessions highlighted challenges in navigating back to My HealtheVet on VA.gov. 

Participants frequently described or demonstrated convoluted or roundabout paths to return to the platform.

> "I would honestly have to poke around because I would not know how to get to this again." - P12

> "I guess I would go to VA.gov and hope that I could find a My health or My HealtheVet link?" - P13 

---

### 5. Participants identified My HealtheVet on VA.gov as a familiar portal for health care, with most participants expressing positive views on the  updates. 

Participants positively noted the streamlined experience, access to Community Care information, and the consolidation of services within VA.gov. 

> "It's just repackaged. I don't get anything different out of the new version. It's just a different style." - P12

> "Mainly just because of how easier it was to get to compared to the old version for me." - P1

_Note: participant has trouble with remembering how to spell/say My HealtheVet_

> "Have info in one centralized area and not having to hunt for things...Once VA finishes Medical Records, you'll have all the documents you need." - P5 

> "Streamlined options all on one site." - P9

> "To me, you all are trying to improve our care...including Community Care." - P10

---

### 6. The secondary navigation proved effective in supporting both participant orientation and navigation amongst the various tools within the health portal.

9 of 10 participants used the secondary navigation to establish bearings and/or move between health tools. 

> "Very fluid!" - P9

> "This does look like the newer version of things (looking at secondary navigation)...This is the newer version because the top there. The icons, the style is different." - P12

## Additional Insights

- 7 of 10 participants utilized a web search to locate the My HealtheVet National Portal. 

> "I can never remember 'My HealtheVet' The whole 'evet' part just throws me off, I don't know why" - P1

> "VA.gov is a lot easier to remember." - P11

## Recommendations

1. **Banners**  
(Supported by findings 1 and 2)
 - Tailor banner content to align with the Veterans' immediate needs, such as highlighting benefits. 
 - Consider refining the language in the banners' call-to-action to better distinguish between the My HealtheVet National Portal and My HealtheVet on VA.gov.
 - When possible, reduce banner overload.
 - Continue using clear, concise language to explain what the transition means for users in practical terms, such as changes in navigation, login processes, or new features.

2. **Clarify platforms**
(Supported by findings 2, 3, and 4)
 - Consider revising the branding, naming conventions, and messaging to emphasize the distinctions between the My HealtheVet National Portal and My HealtheVet on VA.gov 

3. **Make navigation a more consistent experience**
(Supported by finding 3)
 - Consider standardizing the destination of links across the global header, authenticated menu, secondary navigation, and My VA to ensure consistency and reduce user confusion. 

4. **Streamline navigation back to My HealtheVet on VA.gov**
(Supported by finding 4)
 - Continue to improve the findability of My Healthevet on VA.gov

5. **Maintain and enhance secondary navigation**
(Supported by finding 6)
- Continue to maintain and potentially enhance this feature to further support Veteran orientation and navigation within the portal.

## Next Steps

- Review with the product team and align on recommendations
- Share findings with stakeholders and other teams working on VA.gov
