## <a name="intro"></a>Introduction (5 minutes)

> Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`.

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Sara]. How are you?

I’m a researcher from VA. I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to manage their healthcare.

My colleague is also here. They're a researcher too and are here to take notes as we talk, as well as support you and I during this conversation.

> Notetaker says hello.

**What I hope to do today** is talk to you about an upcoming transition the VA is making to move My HealtheVet over onto VA.gov and get your thoughts and feelings about how you experience that. In a little bit, I'll ask you to share your screen with me. We'll sign into your account together and do a few tasks within the session. 

**What I don't want to do** is add to any frustration you may have had in trying to manage your healthcare with the VA previously. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustrations in case there are things we can improve for the future.

**I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to quietly observe?**

- `IF NO` Use Slack to let observers know.
- `IF YES` They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. This is [participant].

Let's go around and say hello, starting with ____.

**Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.**

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session could take up to 90 minutes**
   - I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **We’re here to learn your honest opinions.** Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- **I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability.** So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure the description is clear. If it isn't, that's okay too and it helps us learn what to improve.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
- The last thing is about recordings. Because we will be asking you to share your healthcare portal with us today and looking at your real patient data, we will not record any video. We would like to ask if we can record the audio for our session, so that we don't mis-capture anything you. If you agree, we will not link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record our audio as we talk today?**

## <a name="warm-up"></a>Warm-up questions (5 minutes)



## <a name="set-up"></a> Set up & sign-in (10 minutes)

- Have you ever shared your screen on Zoom before?

Okay, great. We're going to do that now. 

- [Have they shared before?]
  - `IF YES` Please share your screen when you're ready.
  - `IF NO` I’ll help guide you through how to share your screen...

### Troubleshooting: Screen share issues
Add screen-sharing instructions
- If after trying everything, screen share still isn't working: We'll politely end the session. Refer to [pause and exit strategies](#pause-or-exit-strategies).

> Screen sharing starts.

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen. I see [describe window].

Next, I'm going to ask you to go to the My HealtheVet website.

Okay, great. Now, I'll ask you to sign in on this website. 

## <a name="mhv-classic"></a>My HealtheVet Classic (15 minutes)


### Task 1


### Task 2

**Direct user to a "try-me" banner on one of these pages: Medications, Appointments, Secure Messages**
- Can you read this rectangular box with a message in it here?
- What do you think this means?
- Where would you expect the link to send you if you select it?

Okay, now go ahead and select that link. 

## <a name="mhv-va-gov"></a>My HealtheVet on VA.gov (45 minutes) 

Okay, now where do you think you are?
Do you notice anything different?

Why don't you take a few minutes to move around, and while you do so, please try to think out loud so that I can try to understand your thoughts. 

### Tool 1:

### Tool 2: 

### Tool 3: 

### Navigation notes:

## <a name="questionnaires"></a>Questionnaires (5 minutes)

[You can stop sharing your screen now if you'd like to.]

TBD

Florence wanted to ask a few questions where the participant rates their experience 

## <a name="cool-down"></a>Cool down (5 minutes)

Let's spend the last few minutes reflecting on that experience.

**Do you have any questions for me about this project or this research?**

Thanks again for sharing your time with us. It’s been so helpful to learn from you.

Perigean will send you a thank you note with some information that you can pass along to other Veterans if they’d like to participate in future research sessions. 

I hope you have a lovely rest of the day.


### If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
