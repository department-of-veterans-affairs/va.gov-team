# Update Tool Landing Pages Initiative Brief

## Outcome Summary
Veterans can access their Messages and Medications with fewer clicks to find what they are looking for and conduct the tasks they want within the tool.  Ensure relavant tool content lives in the right place with the patient portal and that veterans know where to go to find help or learn more about the tool and how to use it.

## Problem
- Veterans have to continuously go through a landing page to get into Medications or Secure Messaging when navigating through secondary navigation.  This requires an additional click(s) to get to the tasks they want to accomplish.
- The landing pages were always meant to be temporary as we launched each tool in isolation to give users some context to the new experience as they were trying to out.  Once we connected to secondary navigation, this became more of a user problem as they navigate between tools.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans can quickly find and navigate the tools to complete tasks within the tool. 
- Veterans are able to navigate the tools and know where to go to find what they are looking for.
- Veterans are able to find help or information about a tool when they need it.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans are unsuccessful navigating the patient portal to complete the tasks they want.
- Veterans are unable to find help when they need it.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Consistent IA across the patient portal to meet our IA standards.
- Get users to their tasks more quickly, to improve user trust and satisfaction as we make the switch to VA.gov. (Similar pattern to the current MHV experience).

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Improved IA to land users directly in their inbox, leading to more message interations or on their medications list to take more actions. 
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Users don't need to learn any new IA patterns, will lead to less clicks overall and less time spent in the patient portal, getting them to accomplish their tasks more quickly.
  - Removing the landing page, also removes the take me back links within the tools, users who want to go back to Classic now only have one place to go back (MHV on VA.gov landing page) but with updated Try Me banners they are always routed through the landing page anyways.
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Improving the already incorrect IA in medications.
  - Will remove pages from the IA
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - These pages were introduced initally as temporary pages to give context to users when they were trying out tools in isolation.  The business has been informed and aligned of this decision for awhile.  Will make it simplier to troubleshoot with veterans trying to find what they are looking for.

### What're you building
- Update tool IA to take users directly into the tools (SM- inbox, Meds- Medications list).
- Evaluate content on the tool landing pages (SM, Meds, MR) and determine where it should live to provide the most value to the user.  Consider within the in context in the tool, benefit hub pages, or a separate page/section in the tools.  Ensure content is not duplicated on VA.gov and is easily accessible for those who want to learn more about the tool.
- Ensure users understand how to get help or more information within a tool and there is consistency across the portal.

#### Go-to-market 
- This initative is part of Milestone 1 (March 15) to ensure we have a seamless experience for users as we begin our big push for adoption in 2025.
