## Problem
- Veterans have to continuously go through a landing page to get into Medications or Secure Messaging when navigating through secondary navigation.  This requires an additional click(s) to get to the tasks they want to accomplish.
- The landing pages were always meant to be temporary as we launched each tool in isolation to give users some context to the new experience as they were trying to out.  Once we connected to secondary navigation, this became more of a user problem as they navigate between tools.
- 
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?

    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples:
