# Research Design
methodology: "Semi-structured interviews"
research_format: 
  location: remote
  moderated: true
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand how My VA Health portal users currently access and manage their care on the existing platform"
  - goal_2: "Assess effectiveness of planned transition communication tactics and identify user concerns or confusion"
  - goal_3: "Understand how previous patient portal transitions impact current sentiment and adoption approach"

research_questions:
  - "How do users currently approach using their online healthcare tools?"
  - "What language and communication strategies help users understand the upcoming transition?"
  - "What variables impact a user's comfort and adaptability to transitions?"
  - "When faced with changes in how to access healthcare online, what do users look for?"
  - "What hesitations, fears, or concerns does a new experience introduce?"

hypotheses:
  - "Users who had smoother previous transitions will show higher confidence in adapting to the new portal"
  - "Clear, plain-language messaging about what stays the same and what changes will reduce transition anxiety"
  - "Trust indicators (such as data security assurances and direct navigation pathways) will increase adoption intent"

expected_outcomes: "Findings will inform the design of transition messaging, in-product nudges, and user support strategies to increase adoption of My VA Health portal at the 6 Oracle Health facilities, with initial rollout at Columbus."

# Research Plan for My VA Health (OH) patient portal transition research
October, 2025

## Background
My HealtheVet teams building on VA.gov will begin to transition users from 6 current facilities that use the Oracle Health (OH) electronic health record (EHR) system who rely on a separate patient portal to manage their care (My VA Health) over to My HealtheVet on VA.gov beginning in 2026. 

In order to communicate this transition to those users, we want to better understand these users' mental models around transitions and how they manage their care so that we can meet their needs. 

## OCTO Priorities
* **Objective 1:** Our digital experiences are the best way to access and manage VA health care and benefits.

* **Key Result 1**: CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.
  * Veteran Journey 
  * Starting up
  * Taking care of myself
  * Putting down roots
  * Retiring

## Research Goals
As we think about the transition rollout at Columbus, there are two key target time periods to keep in mind for how users experience the transition. First, the initial nudges in the user experience that will roll out in January for Columbus users. Second, the more assertive prompts that will roll out after January. The goals of this research are:
* Gain insight into how current Veteran access and manage their care using the My VA Health patient portal.
  * Understanding their current experience will support the VA.gov team in designing an experience that can influence how Veterans at the 6 current Oracle Health facilities behave and approach the transition. 
* Understand what conveys trust, and how language choice or previous experiences might impact users' reactions toward this transition
* Understand whether planned tactics for communicating the transition are effective by getting users' reactions to those tactics. 
* Understand what fears, concerns, or confusion might be standing in the way of these users adopting the new experience on VA.gov. 
  
## Research Questions
**Self-reflected behaviors:**
  * How do users currently approach using their online healthcare tools?
  * How do they navigate, _where_ do they look to understand where they are, decide what information is relevant, or have confidence that they successfully completed a task? 
  * What is their current experience like using My VA Health?
    
**Attitudes to change:**
  * What language helps users understand the upcoming transition? 
  * What are the variables that impact a user's comfort/adaptability to the transition?
  * How do they feel? What concerns them when it comes to transitions?

**Impacting future behaviors (reacting to prototype):**
  * When faced with a change in how to access their healthcare online, what do they look for?
  * Do they understand what the transition messaging means for them?
  * If they are stuck or confused, what do they do next?
  * What indicates that this is an experience they can trust? What would they expect from a trustworthy experience?
  * What hesitation, fears, or concerns (if any) does a new experience introduce?

### Goals / questions / methods matrix

|Research goal| Research questions | Planned method |
|-----|------|------|
| Understand how My VA Health users currently access their health portal & manage their care | Self-reflected behavior questions | **Warm up questions** will let us know how often they sign-in on line & visit a VA health facility. **Part 1: Sign into patient portal** (will show us how they sign-in and where to place tactics), look up appointment details (will show us how they navigate once on My VA Health and what details they look for); we'll also know if they are hybrid facility/EHR users from seeing their screens.| 
| Are planned tactics effective? How do users react? | Attitudes to change; Impacting future behaviors | **Part 2: react to prototypes** qualitative questions that ask users to respond to blue alerts in the prototypes (in context of completing health tasks) will unpack whether users noticed the tactics, what the language means to them, and help us understand whether the placement / language / tactic encourages adoption. If reactions are not what we expect, we can adjust our approach before transition start date.|
| What nudges users _toward_ adoption? | Impacting future behaviors | **Part 2: react to prototypes** qualitative questions that ask users to respond to blue alerts in the prototypes will help us understand whether users would continue to My VA Health or not. We can probe on what would keep users on VA.gov.|

## Methodology 
**Location**
* 60 minute video interviews over Zoom.
