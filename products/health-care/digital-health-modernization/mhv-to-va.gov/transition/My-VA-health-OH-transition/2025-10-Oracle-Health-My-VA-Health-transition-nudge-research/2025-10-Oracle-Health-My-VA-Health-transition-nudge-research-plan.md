# Research Plan for My VA Health (OH) patient portal transition research
October, 2025

## Background
My HealtheVet teams building on VA.gov will begin to transition users from 6 current facilities that use the Oracle Health (OH) electronic health record (EHR) system who rely on a separate patient portal to manage their care (My VA Health) over to My HealtheVet on VA.gov beginning in 2026. 

In order to communicate this transition to those users, we want to better understand these users' mental models around transitions and how they manage their care so that we can meet their needs. 

## OCTO Priorities
* **Objective 1:** Our digital experiences are the best way to access and manage VA health care and benefits.

* **Key Result 1**: CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.
  * Veteran Journey 
  * Starting up
  * Taking care of myself
  * Putting down roots
  * Retiring

## Research Goals
As we think about the transition rollout at Columbus, there are two key target time periods to keep in mind for how users experience the transition. First, the initial nudges in the user experience that will roll out in January for Columbus users. Second, the more assertive prompts that will roll out after January. The goals of this research are:
* Gain insight into how current Veteran users who have already transitioned onto Oracle Health systems and use the My VA Health portal access and manage their care.
* Better understand how these users felt about the transition to My VA Health patient portal. 
* How might previous transitions impact their approach towards future transitions regarding their experience with digital VA healthcare? 
* Better understanding these users - what they are doing, why, and ultimately how they make decisions - will support the VA.gov team in designing an experience that can influence how Veterans at the 6 current Oracle Health facilities behave and approach the transition. 
* What are their reactions to planned tactics for communicating the transition of My VA Health to My HealtheVet on VA.gov? 

## Research Questions
**Self-reflected behaviors:**
  * How do users currently approach using their online healthcare tools?
  * How do they make decisions about where to go for what? How do they access their online healthcare tools?
  * How have their behaviors changed over time? What impact does time since transition have on their reflections, if any?

**Attitudes to change:**
  * What are the variables that impact a user's comfort/adaptability to a transition?
  * How do they feel? What concerns them when it comes to transitions?

**Impacting future behaviors / reacting to low-fi concepts:**
  * When looking at/for a new path by which to access their healthcare online, what do they look for?
  * To them, what indicates the path of least resistance?
  * What indicates that this is an experience they can trust? What would they expect from a trustworthy experience?
  * What challenges (if any) does a new experience introduce? 

## Methodology 
**Location**
* 60 minute video interviews over Zoom.
