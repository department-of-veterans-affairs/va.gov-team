### Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Moderator Name] and I'll be moderating. One of my colleagues will be taking notes throughout the session. Today we're going to talk about your experience using your VA patient portal to manage your healthcare online. We will ask you to walk us through how you see what's new in your healht portal, schedule an appointment, and refill medications when you need more. We may jump around through these topics depending on what exists in your medical record. Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This session will take about 60 minutes.
- During this session, we'll be asking you to share your screen which will show your personal health records. Your participation is completely voluntary. You can stop at any time. You can choose to show us one thing but not another - this is your choice. There will be no repercussions on your VA benefits if you want to stop at any point or don't want to share some information with us.
- Are you comfortable sharing your screen while you navigate your VA health records?
  - [Record Answer]
- I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with a couple of observers joining us?
  - If no: Ask observers to leave.
  - If yes: Admit observers and have them do quick intros, then turn off cameras.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio during this session? We use these recordings to confirm that we have an accurate record of what we learn from you, and refer back to them to make sure we are not misremembering anything. We save these files on the VA network and destroy them after the study is finished.
  - [Record Answer]
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable with me recording this session?

## Warm-up (5 mins) 
* How long have you had healthcare benefits with the VA?
* How often to you go to a VA health care facility to receive care?
* How often do you sign-into your health portal online?
* Can you tell me about the last time you signed in to do something for your care?
  * How was that experience for you?
* On a scale of 1-5, one being very uncomfortable and 5 being very comfortable, how do generally feel about learning new websites or apps?

## Part 1: Production / How participant accesses and manages their healthcare now (20 mins)
Thanks for answering those questions. I want to transition us to exploring your patient portal together. First I want you to share your screen. Is that something you've done before?

**Screen-sharing instructions**
* In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, first tap anywhere on the screen, then you should see a row of buttons. In the center is a button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad).
  * (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  * Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.
 
Great, now I can see your screen!

### Sign in and show us how they access their patient portal
Could you show me how you typically get to your patient portal to manage your healthcare online now?
[Give user time to sign-in]

**Task 1:** Can you show me how you would check to see details for an upcoming appointment?
Prompts if needed: 
* _What type of appointment is it?_
* _What date/time is it happening?_
* _What facility location?_

* What other things do you commonly do here?
* How often would you say you do that?
* Have you ever had trouble finding something on this portal? What helped you figure it out?"
* How much do you trust the information you see here? What would make you more confident in it?
* On a scale of 1-5 where **one** is very hard and challenging, or frustrating for you and **five** would be fantastic and extremely easy, how would you rate your experience using this patient portal overall?
* If someone told you 'your health information has been moved from this website to My HealtheVet on VA.gov,' what would you expect that to mean?

Okay, thank you so much for showing us how you navigate your health portal and answering those questions, it's really helpful to see how you use it and hear about your experience. Before we move on to the next step, I want to check in: How are you feeling so far? Do you have any questions before we continue?

## Part 2: Prototype / Reactions to planned tactics (30 mins) 

### Opening the Figma prototype
- Moderator put link to prototype in Zoom chat: figma.com/proto/NlczsEfLZj7Pz5OeJGMqTM/My-VA-Health-OH-transition-research-study?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=z3rXmFFIwP5l8ztc-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A2496

-  For the next part of our time together, I want to show what we call a prototype. This is not an actual website. It is a file that we use to explore what the website could look like and get feedback from users like yourself before we make any final changes to the website. This prototype will not work exactly like a website, and you won't see your name or your own personal information. For example, not all of the links will work and you cannot click the back button in your browser because it will take you away from the prototype. 

- To switch over and have you view the prototype, I need you to go back to the Zoom window and click on the chat icon at the bottom of your screen. It should look like a little conversation bubble with three dots inside. Do you see it?
- Great. In the chat I just dropped a link to the prototype. Can you select that link? It will open up in a web browser momentarily.
- Like I said before, this is not an actual website, it is a prototype. But it will look a lot like the VA.gov website and we will show you some ideas that we exploring.

### Task 1 - Appointments
Okay looks like you have the prototype open. As a reminder, the back button on this screen will not work as you expect. Instead you'll need to use the prototype back and forth arrows to navigate back or forward a screen. Do you have any questions about that? 

Great! 

Just like you showed me before when we were signed into your patient portal, I'd like you to now use this prototype and show me where you'd go to check on details for an upcoming appointment. Please talk out loud as you click things or read things. It's really helpful to understand your thought process and what's clear to you or confusing. 

_Participant "signs in" using simulated sign-in in prototype and lands on My VA page._
* From here, what would you do to check appointment details for that upcoming appointment? How would you find what time of day that appointment is at?
  * _Does the participant see information in the "upcoming appointment" card on My VA Page? Navigate to My HealtheVet? Other?_
  * Prompt participant to go to appointments if they do not do this on their own.

#### On the appointments page
_Participant navigates to appointments tool. There should be a blue expandable alert communicating the transition._
* _Does participant just look for appointment details directly?_
* _Are they surprised by seeing appointments data on VA.gov?_ 
* _Do they look for the yellow alert that we used to have at the top of the page here?_
* _Do they see, expand, or engage with the blue info alert at all?_

**[User DOES NOT notice the alert on their own]** 
- If you saw a message on this page when you signed in, what would make you actually read it? What would make you ignore it?
- I wonder if you see that blue alert near the top of the prototype?
  - Did you notice that before?
  - What do you think that alert is for?
- Without expanding this alert, what do you think that one line of text means?
- Can you go ahead and expand it and read it?
  - What does this mean to you?
  - How does it make you feel?
 - What concerns you most about this information and potentially using a new portal to manage your healthcare?
 - Would you want to see this information every time you sign in?
 - "What could go wrong in a transition like this? What's your biggest fear?"
  - [Listen carefully, then probe:] "You mentioned [concern]. Tell me more about that. What would need to happen to ease that worry?"
 - What would encourage you to manage your records right here instead of navigating to the My VA Health portal?

**[User notices alert on their own]**
- Without expanding this alert, what do you think that one line of text means?
- Why do you think you are seeing it?
- Now go ahead and click that alert to expand it, and read the information inside the blue alert.
  - What do you think this means now?
  - What would you do next after reading this information?
  - Next time you sign in, would you expect to see these alerts again?
- What concerns you most about this information and potentially using a new portal to manage your healthcare?
  - "What could go wrong in a transition like this? What's your biggest fear?"
    - [Listen carefully, then probe:] "You mentioned [concern]. Tell me more about that. What would need to happen to ease that worry?"
- What would encourage you to manage your records right here instead of navigating to the My VA Health portal?

### Task 2 
Now that you know you can complete tasks here on My HealtheVet on VA.gov, I'd like you to show me where you'd go to request a prescription refill. We won't actually request anything since this is just a prototype, but am curious about your reactions to completing a task here using the new My HealtheVet on VA.gov experience. 

_Observe: How does the user navigate to a different tool?_

_Participant lands on the Medications tool, gets to the Refill page._
* Does it surprise you to see that blue alert on this page, too?
  * What else do you notice on this page?
* Would you want to continue refilling your medication here on VA.gov, or would you prefer to go back to My VA Health to complete your prescription refill request?
  * Why/why not?
* If you ran into an issue trying to refill it here on VA.gov and needed help with something, what would you do?
* What makes you feel like you can trust this experience? What makes you feel hesitant?
* Do you feel confident that this experience would give you accurate information? What makes you say that?
* Let's say you came home today and realized that My VA Health shut down permanently. How would you feel about that?
* What's the ONE thing you'd miss from My VA Health?
* What's the ONE thing that would need to be true about this portal for you to feel confident switching completely?"
    
## Thank-You and Closing - (5 mins)
Thank you for sharing your screen and completing those tasks today. This is really helpful information as we make decisions for this upcoming health portal transition.
