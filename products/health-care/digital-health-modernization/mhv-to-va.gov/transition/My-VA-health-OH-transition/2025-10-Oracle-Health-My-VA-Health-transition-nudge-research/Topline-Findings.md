## <a name="background"></a>Background<br>

My HealtheVet teams building on VA.gov will begin to transition users from 6 current facilities that use the Oracle Health (OH) electronic health record (EHR) system from their current patient portal (My VA Health) over to the new My HealtheVet on VA.gov experience beginning in January 2026.

In order to communicate this transition to those users, we want to better understand these users' mental models around transitions, how they access their portal currently, and their experiences managing their care online so that we can meet their needs.


## <a name="overview"></a>Overview<br>

We interviewed **13 participants** who are current patients at one or more of the 6 Oracle Health facilities who will transition from their current patient portal (My VA Health) to the new My HealtheVet on VA.gov experience. 

Sessions were 60 minutes and were divided into two primary parts:

* **Part 1: Participants showed us how they get to their healthcare portal** - this helps us understand 1.) the method they use to access their portal currently 2.) health care tasks they are most familiar with, 3.) whether they are a hybrid user with both VistA and OH facilities, and 4.) any challenges they have today with this experience
* **Part 2: Participants reacted to prototypes with planned tactics** - this helps us 1.) if users notice the planned tactics, 2.) understand if the language we had previously planned to use is effective in describing the transition to these participants, 3.) if the tactics are in the right places, and 4.) ask probing questions about how much control users want over dismissing these alerts in the user experience, their fears, and what the new experience feels like to them.


## <a name="goals"></a>Research goals<br>

As we think about the transition rollout at Columbus, there are two key target time periods to keep in mind for how users experience the transition. First, the initial nudges in the user experience that will roll out first in January 2026 for patients at the Columbus, Ohio VA facility (and eventually to five additional facilities). Second, the more assertive prompts that will roll out after January. The goals of this research are:



* Gain insight into how current Veteran access and manage their care using the My VA Health patient portal.
    * Understanding their current experience will support the VA.gov team in designing an experience that can influence how Veterans at the 6 current Oracle Health facilities behave and approach the transition.
* Understand what conveys trust, and how language choice or previous experiences might impact users' reactions toward this transition
* Understand whether planned tactics for communicating the transition are effective by getting users' reactions to those tactics.
* Understand what fears, concerns, or confusion might be standing in the way of these users adopting the new experience on [VA.gov](VA.gov).


## <a name="testing"></a>Screens and Paths Used in Testing (Version A and Version B)<br>

A little past the halfway point in the study, we reached a point of feedback saturation on Part 2. Users were not noticing the planned tactics or understanding the language used once we drew their attention to them. Following interview 8, we changed the prototypes to reflect feedback we had heard in sessions up to that point. We then conducted 5 additional interviews with updated prototypes. 


### Version A: Expandable Alert

# <a name="insights"></a>Insights<br>

## <a name="groups"></a>Insight 1: User groups<br>
There are a couple of sub-categories that can help us better understand these users, what they have seen or understand about the My HealtheVet on VA.gov portal, and their expectations based on the number of facilities where they have received care:

### 1. Navigation tactics to accessing My VA Health portal

Three methods of accessing My VA Health were identified during this study.

* **The Hoppers** - the Hoppers go step 1) start on [va.gov](va.gov) or VAHB, step 2) go to a health tool page and 3) follow the redirect link in the yellow alert to My VA Health.  These users accounted for 7 out of 13 participants.  **The hoppers are the lowest hanging fruit because they just need to be stopped at step 2 - and they can be with the right communication.**

* **The Bookmarkers** - These participants had a direct link to the My VA Health portal bookmarked in their browser or elsewhere.  This accounted for 4 of the 13 participants.  This group can only be reached using an interstitial experience or through other, non-website means (think posters, flyers, etc)
   <img width="893" height="411" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-19 at 4 21 39 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f129f74-178f-4371-bb17-ca1ef1fd9d59" />


* **The Random Outliers** - 2 of 13 participants started at the National Portal - this routes them to My HealtheVet on VA.gov, then to My VA Health portal, meaning they travel through all 3 portals to arrive at the one they can use.

### 2. Data types - the hybrids and the solos 

Quantitative data analysis helps us estimate that somewhere between 2-3% of all current VA patients have “hybrid” facilities, but further breakdown is hard to get at. Many of those users are not receiving active care from both types of facilities. We predict that the vast majority have historical data from VistA facilities that they no longer visit actively. Still, a few “types” of profiles exist, including: 

* **“Historic” data hybrid user** - The vast majority of My VA Health (OH) users fall into this category. When their facilities transitioned to Oracle Health, only a small subset (between the last 3 months - 1 year) of their complete historical health record was moved to the My VA Health portal, and the remainder still exists in VistA. These users may need to download complete or historical records from My HealtheVet, but this is a “low-touch” use case and is likely not common for many My VA Health users. However, it could impact whether or not Veterans notice “new” information once we integrate OH data into My HealtheVet on VA.gov.  \

* **“Active” hybrid users who receive care at both Oracle Health and VistA facilities** - This is a smaller percentage of My VA Health portal users. “Clusters” of users who have these scenarios could include: 
        * Patients who live in high-density urban areas that only have one VA on the Oracle Health EHR system could feasibly also receive some specialty care from another VA in their area that is a VistA facility.
        * “Snowbirds” who live in the Midwest and attend a VA facility including North Chicago or Columbus could seasonally head to another place like Florida and temporarily receive care from another VA that uses the VistA EHR system.
These users have to manage care using two different patient portals. They may be more likely to rely on the VAHB mobile app - a method with long-term sign-in and very easy access to My HealtheVet (VistA), but which has a downside of a very circuitous route to My VA Health (OH). **These users have the most to gain from this integration.**

* **“Solo” data users** - have only received care at an Oracle Health facility post-EHR migration - these users only use the My VA Health portal, and do not have historical health records that remain in VistA. This group will be an extremely small percentage of users in this transition. 


## <a name="see"></a>Insight 2: See, but not register<br>


### 1. The Forgotten Fork 

Of the 8 users who only saw users who saw Version A (did not see the interstitial), all overlooked the blue alert and went to try to directly complete their healthcare task on My HealtheVet on vA.gov  Absent a visually “loud” link *telling them* to go to My VA Health, they did not seek it out. This is especially important for the hoppers, who have no need to go to My VA Health.  Instead, participants looked at the page - specifically the MHV on [VA.gov](VA.gov) screen and the secondary navigation - to determine what they could do. 

### 2. Alphabet Soup 

Participants didn't understand the difference between My HealtheVet on VA.gov, My VA Health, or MyHealtheVet Classic (National Portal). Because they did not understand the difference between the different sites, they did not understand why they were being shown another option in the alert. They cared about getting their task done, not the name of the website they used to complete that task.

- _“The blue box made it seem like I had to choose, but I don’t want to think about that. Just take me where I need to go.”_ - Participant 5

### 3. Why are you sending me away?

Because participants did not distinguish between the different sites, they did not understand why the blue alert (in both Version A and B) were re-directing them somewhere else.  To most of them, they had reached the destination where they could do their healthcare task.  Adding another site made them confused and concerned.  Those who had trained themselves to go to another site wanted something more direct.

- _“It’s kind of redundant. It’s saying I can do it two different ways... which is kind of what we’re trying to get away from.”_ - Participant 5

- _“You need to clarify that right up front because I would guarantee you 90–95% of the vets from [state], when they see this, they think they're going back to the system we had before.”_ — Participant 3

### Interstitial awareness 

Of the 5 participants who saw Version B, 4 of 5 read interstitial unprompted.  One went right through it and had to be directed back to it.  All those who saw the interstitial  indicated that they liked how up-front it was. However, they still struggled to understand why they were being given two options.

- _“I like that it tells me what’s changing before I get into the site.”_ — Participant 13

- _“This is better. It tells me what’s happening and what I need to do.”_ — Participant 12


## <a name="confidence"></a>Insight 3: Building confidence in change with reassurance<br>


### 1. Burned before

Participants expressed frustration with all the transitions.  They were afraid to be a “guinea pig” again.  This frustration was especially resonant with users who had complex or long medical histories.  They expressed fear that their information would be lost or that they would have to go someplace else in the future.  These participants were skeptical and wanted reassurance that putting in the effort now on VA.gov will be worth it.  

- _“I don’t want to be another guinea pig.”_ - Participant 3

### 2. Value prop of "one ring to rule them all"

Participants who were afraid they were “guinea pigs” and would have to go somewhere else wanted greater clarity on why the VA was making this change and *what was in it for them, the Veteran*. They specifically called out that having “one place to do everything” would make them more likely to invest in adoption.  

- _“... would be nice if I had one thing…anytime I have to do with the VA stuff… like a one stop shop on the VA website and then I can do anything I need to do with the VA.”_ - Participant 8

### 3. Visual confirmation  

Landing on MHV on [VA.gov](VA.gov) or a child page, users look to *see* what they can do on the page to determine what could do on the website.  Specifically, they called out the contents of MHV on VA.gov landing page and the secondary navigation on the child pages.

- _“... the home screen is My HealthyVet. Appointments, messages, medications, records…”_ - Participant 6

- _“At the upper bar it says VA, My VA Health Home and Appointments, Messaging, Pharmacy…”_ - Participant 6



## <a name="trust"></a>Insight 4: Build trust by emphasizing ease and consistency<br>

### 1. Too many choices  

Having the option to go back to My VA Health made some participants nervous, like the VA was "hedging their bets" or might change direction in the future.  Participants consistently said that they did not want too many choices and did not want to have to decide where to complete their healthcare task, they just wanted to be taken to the place that they could complete their healthcare task.

- _“I clicked the blue alert but then got confused. I don’t want to decide between MyHealtheVet and VA.gov.”_ - Participant 7

- _“Why would I still need to access my VA health portal if I have this other portal?... I want everything on the same database."_ - Participant 3

### 2. Timeliness 

When it came to how long participants thought they would have to make the transition, participants did not take away a real sense of when they actually need to finish or complete any decisions.  They did get a sense of urgency or why they transition now and not in the future.  4 of 13 directly mentioned timelines.

- _“If I know that I can wait 6 months, I wouldn't go through this, I don't want to be a guinea pig.”_ - Participant 3

- _“Just letting me know about transitioning over and when it's gonna happen and probably a little time to be able to access the new site before the old one goes.”_ - Participant 5

- _“If I have two weeks, I'm probably gonna do what I need to do now.”_ - Participant 6

- _“...just having end dates would be really nice… Or suspected end dates…it would be nice to have a rough timeline of when I need to get my ducks in a row.”_ - Participant 8


When it came to how long participants expected to be alerted as to their *option* to transition, participants were of many opinions.    

- _“If you haven’t noticed it after 2 months, you’re probably not going to notice it.”_ - Participant 5

- _“There would be an option to say, no longer show me this.”_ - Participant 5

- _“If the pop-up were to go away and disappear: they acknowledged it, they know they have that option.”_ - Participant 3

### 3. Data integrity 

Data integrity was a main fear for every participant.  Primarily, they were concerned about 1) data being lost in the move, as they had experienced before and 2) data not “syncing properly” across two portals.  For this reason, the idea of two portals made participants anxious.  This fear was particularly strong for those who had complex medical histories.

- _“It's more than a frustration for me…I have spent two years of my life in a hospital…I'm a stroke survivor, I'm epileptic… I broke my neck,  I've had 14 major operations... you put all that together and you, you can understand better when you have loss of data…it's critical because you can't get a full answer … when [the data] got moved over … some of it was lost.”_ - Participant 13



## <a name="personal"></a>Insight 5: A personal touch<br>

### 1. Learn by doing 

When it came to how they would want to learn a new site or what would make them comfortable, almost everyone said that they would want to learn by doing or just poking around and trying to “do stuff.”

- _“I might mess around a little bit with it, you know what I mean?”_ - Participant 13

### 2. Take it for a test drive 

Some participants wanted to be able to access both portals as they tried out the new one.  This way, they felt that they could have a more gradual transition and learn as they go instead of having an abrupt cut off.

### 3. Through the grapevine

All participants mentioned that they would expect to learn about the transition from in person events, signs, letters, etc. Some number explicitly called out that they would trust hearing that it was worth making the change more from another Veteran than from the VA itself.  Using these methods to reach the bookmark user group will be especially important. 



## <a name="recommendations"></a>Recommendations<br>

1. **Recommendation:** stop the Hoppers on [VA.gov](VA.gov) (step 2). 
    1. To decrease their confusion, and since they are not looking for a redirect to My VA Health, recommend decoupling the informational update from the redirect link to My VA Health.
    3. Be extremely blunt in the informational text — consider something like “hey you! Yes, you!” to clarify that this now applies to them as well.
       
2. **Recommendation:** Give users a sense of timeliness and urgency by** **adding a deadline/date of some sort or providing a sense of how this transition will play out.
   
3. **Recommendation:** Given the importance of visual confirmation, consistency and timeliness, have an alert on the child pages.  That alert should be temporary, not persistent, visible early in the experience, and dismissable.
   
4. **Recommendation:** Since data integrity is so important to users, address data integrity concerns directly.  If there’s a chance that a user could see different data or duplicate data, acknowledge that and reassure them that it is not cause for concern.  Their early impressions of the data integrity of the new experience is key to their decision to adopt.
   
5. **Recommendation:** Partner with Veteran orgs, mail flyers, put up signs in the VA facility, walkthroughs, banners, etc. Consider an overview video or ad.  This will be especially important for the bookmarkers. This will be especially needed to reach the bookmarkers.

6. **Recommendation:** If you want to ensure that the bookmarkers know that they can go to [VA.gov](VA.gov) for their healthcare needs now, implement some kind of interstitial experience.
