# My VA Health (OH) transition - Content audit Health Care hub
By: Sara Sterkenburg, Tori Moore

## Overview
When all health tools have integrated OH data, we can begin transitioning current (OH) users of the My VA Health portal over to My HealtheVet on VA.gov to manage their care. At that point, we may no longer want to advertise anything about the "My VA Health portal" on unauthenticated Drupal pages in the health care hub or R&S hub. This audit covers an analysis of which pages in these hubs currently have content or URL references to the My VA Health (OH) portal, and recommendations for what to do at the time of transition.

## Questions
* When would we want to make changes to the `/health-care` hub pages? This are unauthenticated pages, and all users would see any changes. Do we wait until Spring 2026 when all current OH facilities are seeing transition messaging elsewhere?
