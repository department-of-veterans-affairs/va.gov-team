# Research Plan for Health Apartment IA, November 2022

## Background

Based on the previous tree test findings, the team iterated on the information architecture for the health hub and health apartment. As the team considers how to properly include the Health Apartment on VA.gov to ensure Veterans and Caregivers to get and manage their health care benefits, this research will help inform decisions on the information architecture of the health apartment and how it links to the broader VA.gov structure.

## OCTO Objectives

This effort supports the following OCTO objectives:
- Veterans and their caregiver/families can easily find information on benefits applications and apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged in users have a personalized experience, with features that saves them time and energy in applying and managing benefits

## Veteran Journey

Veteran tasks fit in the following key points in the Veteran journey:
- Primary – Starting up and Taking care of myself
- Secondary – Putting down roots, Retiring, Aging

## Research Goals

The goal of this research is to gather quantitative insights on the information architecture for the health hub and the health apartment that was modified based on the previous tree testing. We will be looking to better understand how labeling and organization of the menus impact users’ ability to successfully complete tasks.

We will have two sets of key tasks for Veterans and families/caregivers. We will not only test the information architecture of the health care hub and health apartment, but also test the deeper structure of the site navigation, such as the left navigation.

In these tree tests, we will aim to:

- Evaluate the usability of navigation in and between the "get health care benefits" and "My Health" sections
- Evaluate the location of health care benefits programs (mental and dental care) as core health care information
- Evaluate “My Health” as a replacement label for the "Manage Benefits" spoke/section of the health care hub
- Evaluate whether users can easily manage their health with the categories under “My Health”
- Evaluate whether family members and caregivers can navigate the information architecture to get and apply for benefits themselves
- Evaluate whether family members and caregivers can find information and manage Veterans' health on their behalf 

## Outcome

We will use the insights from this research to validate and refine the information architecture for the health apartment and health hub. It will also identify what additional research needs are and help inform the roadmap for the continued health apartment work.

## Research Questions

Can Veterans and their families/caregivers navigate proposed changes to the information architecture of VA.gov in order to find information and complete key tasks as they get and/or manage their VA health care benefits?

## Hypothesis

- Veterans who have health care benefits account will go to My Health directly for finding information and managing health instead of browsing on VA.gov.
- Grouping and prioritizing all health care benefits programs (such as mental health and dental insurance) will help Veterans and caregivers and families easily find benefits information for their needs.
- Viewing popular categories for medical records instead of downloading the full records will help Veterans quickly locate their health information.
- Families and caregivers will prefer to find their benefits under family hub.
 
## Method

This phase of the research is designed to validate the refined information architecture and to see if the key tasks can be completed successfully by participants.

### IA Tree Test (remote, unmoderated)

Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a tree test activity that contains, 12 tasks for a Veteran and 12 tasks for Caregivers and family members that they may experience when getting or managing their health care benefits. For each task, the participant will locate in the tree where a specific task can be completed.

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Optimal Workshop.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information (whether the Veteran has used MyHealtheVet before; whether the Veteran uses VA healthcare) on a [folder on the sensitive repo](set up and link). We want to have a meeting with Perigean before recruitment begins to make sure there is no confusion with criteria table and screener questions. 

## Recruitment criteria

We will schedule a total of 108 (54 Veterans and 54 family members/caregivers) participants for a completion rate of 80 tree tests.  

|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|     108       |        80        |   54   |      27     |    27    |               |

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.

## Appendix A: Tasks

### Tasks 

The prioritized tasks, linked to our testing objective, were carefully curated such that they reflect how Veterans might naturally approach the website.

## Appendix B: Recruitment email (for Veteran cohorts)

Subject: Be part of a new VA online research activity

Hello,

The Department of Veterans Affairs is conducting research to learn how you get and manage VA health care benefits. We'd like to invite you to take part in an online activity to help improve VA.gov for your fellow Veterans and their families.

**Here's what to know about this activity:**

- We’ll give you a series of tasks and a list of menu options. Each menu option represents a page on the VA.gov website. For each task, we'll ask you to click through the menu options to find the page that you think would have the information you need to complete the task. 
- This self-guided activity usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete. You can complete the activity at any time that's convenient for you.
- You can complete this activity on a smartphone, laptop, or any device with an Internet connection.
- We're not testing your abilities. We're testing changes to our website.

If you'd like to take part in this activity, reply to this email. We'll send you a link and a participant code to get started.

Thank you for your interest in VA research.

Subject: Be part of a new VA online research activity

Hello,

The Department of Veterans Affairs is conducting research to learn how you and the Veteran you care for get and manage VA health care benefits. We'd like to invite you to take part in an online activity to help improve VA.gov for your fellow caregivers of Veterans.

Here's what to know about this activity:

- We’ll give you a series of tasks and a list of menu options. Each menu option represents a page on the VA.gov website. For each task, we'll ask you to click through the menu options to find the page that you think would have the information you need to complete the task. 
- This self-guided activity usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete. You can complete the activity at any time that's convenient for you.
- You can complete this activity on a smartphone, laptop, or any device with an Internet connection.
- We're not testing your abilities. We're testing changes to our website.

If you'd like to take part in this activity, reply to this email. We'll send you a link and a participant code to get started.

Thank you for your interest in VA research.
