# My HealtheVet - Metasynthesis research readout
By: Athena Bozak, Florence McCafferty, Jonathan Nelson, Sara Sterkenburg

## Executive Summary
A "metasynthesis" in research refers to a method of synthesizing and interpreting findings from multiple qualitative research studies; combining their themes and meaning in order to develop new knowledge, theories, explanations, or insights.

In February 2025, the Cartography Team worked with OCTO research lead Robyn Singleton to analyze 34 past research studies from the VA research repository through the lens of high-level research questions related to both My HealtheVet and the broader authenticated experience on VA.gov. We hoped to surface new insights that held true across multiple studies, and measure our degree of confidence in that insight. 

We believe research insights with a high degree of confidence can unblock strategic business decisions that will generate known user value. Research insights with a low degree of confidence indicate that additional research will need to be conducted to confirm whether or not they are ripe for design solutioning. In effect, this research report seeks to develop a research and design roadmap: exposing known pain points in the user's navigation and behavioral experience that can move into solutioning; and possible pain points, where further research study development would make the most sense as the business is able to take it on.

## <a name="questions"></a>Research questions <br>
1.  **What are the most consistent health-related navigational pain points (health specific)?**
    * What are the common issues or frustrations Veterans face when trying to find or use health-related tools and information on MHV?
2. **What are the highest impact navigation-related pain points (General/all of VA?)**
    * What navigation problems that cause the biggest challenges or make it hardest for Veterans to accomplish their tasks?
3. **How do behaviors differ (or don’t) in the health space compared with the benefits space (health/ general all of VA)?**
    * Do Veterans use My HealtheVet (health) differently than they use VA.gov for benefits? If so, how? If not, what’s the same?
4. **What do Veterans expect from an authenticated experience on VA.gov that includes benefits from a range of VA sub-agencies? (general/all of VA)**
    * What do Veterans want or expect when they log in to VA.gov, especially when it comes to easily accessing benefits and services from different VA departments (like health care, education, or disability)?
5. **What are the use cases where there’s overlap between health and other areas, where people might not find what they need in the health space? (Health/general all of VA)**
    * When do Veterans’ needs for health-related tools or information cross over into other areas (like benefits or education), and where does this overlap cause confusion or make it hard for them to find what they need?

## <a name="methods"></a>Methods <br>
### Identifying a pool of previous studies
Our team identified and analyzed 34 previous studies that we thought were most relevant to re-analysis in order to surface any previously identified pain points related to comprehension + navigation that may still persist in relation to the My HealtheVet health portal on VA.gov and the broader authenticated experience. These studies were initially conducted by a wide variety of teams working on VA.gov, and vary in methods from card-sort and tree-test studies, evaluative research, generative research. Some broadly consider authenticated experiences on VA.gov, information organization, user needs for personalization and help, and more. A full list of citations to the 34 studies that were reviewed are listed below in the "Sources cited" section. 

### Seeking specific information
As a team, we divided up the studies and re-analyzed each one. Some were highly releavnt to our research questions, and others turned out to be less valuable. Since many of these studies are multiple years old, primary pain points or problems may have been solved or remedied already, so the current validity of old findings is certainly a question. We paid some attention to our knowledge of what has and has not changed since each study occurred and bubbled up insights from each study. If a given insight rang true across _more than one study_, we considered it a macro "insight" for the purposes of this report. 

### Evaluating the findings
We quickly realized the need to measure the relative evidence for each insight, and our confidence that the problem persists now in 2025. So, we developed a confidence rating rubric to rank our insights in a consistent way. Each insight will be marked with a low, medium, or high confidence rating.

#### Confidence rubric:
| # of studies | Data diversity  | Recency | Study quality/rigor |
|:-------------|:----------------|:--------|:--------------------|
| Two studies | 1 method (5 points) | Outdated: more than 2 years old (5 points) | Low (5 points) |
| Three studies (10 points) | 2 methods (10 points) | Slightly outdated: 1-2 years old (10 points) | Medium (10 points) |
| More than three studies (15 points) | Mixed methods (15 points) | Recent: less than 1 year (15 points) | High (15 points) |

**Add values and calculate the score:**
* 20-30 total points: **low confidence** in evidence
* 30-45 points: **medium confidence** in evidence
* 45-60points: **high confidence** in evidence

## <a name="insights"></a>Insights <be>

**Insight 1**

**How are people moving within the portal?**

RQ1 

**In Jan: had 1.1M in portal**

- 445k used secondary nav: 280k desktop; 152k mobile
- Most of this is not happening on landing page, implying that it’s mostly cross-tool activity
- Much less mega menu: 13k in MHV (compared with 56k My VA, which has &gt;2M users in Jan)
- At least &gt;200k used back button in Jan. Data is spotty bc juxtaposing between GA and DD, and missing info on SM and meds. Lots of bb usage in medical records (makes sense). 
- 50k (4.5%) left /my-health for /my-va; compared with 48k (7%) in July 
- 750k (~75%) of exits happen on /my-health

**Findings details**

- Most people using either secondary navs or back buttons
- Less people use primary nav to orient selves, but some still do ((<100k, so <10%)
- Less people go to My VA now than 6 months ago
- Majority of /my-health users (75%) exit VA.gov from a /my-health page
- We still don’t have great metrics to feel very confident, but given magnitude of difference, I think we can conclude that most people are staying within the portal to do portal things.

**How are people moving outside of the portal?**

_How much traffic are health-adjacent pages seeing?_

- 33k clicks on Pay copay link by 29k users (3%)
- Compared with 85k views of /manage-va-debt/summary/copay-balances
- Travel claim status: 29k (3%)
- Travel reimbursement clicks: 18k
- Compared with 48k clicked from /my-va
- Bottom cards getting much less clicks than top cards → might not be due to placement but other factors influencing products

**Category 1 (most consistent):**

Pain points with common health tasks that differ most from MHV Classic experience AND have a lot of information: 

- Meds & MR → issues with finding specific information, issues with learning new experience
- See Nov-Jan Transition Evaluation for more details.

**Category 2 (less consistent but still present):**

The IA of VA.gov works best for users that are not logged in and are browsing (looking to read about benefits and eligibility). Users that are logged in and are seeking to complete tasks employ other methods to navigate the site.

- Seeing relatively low usage of health-periphery tasks in portal. Unclear if it's because users do those tasks elsewhere anyways (e.g., go straight to Pay.gov with their EOB; go to BTSSS/ fill out paper claim)

   - 33k clicks on Pay copay link by 29k users (3%)
      - Compared with 85k views of /manage-va-debt/summary/copay-balances

      - Travel claim status: 29k (3%)
      - Travel reimbursement clicks: 18k
         - Compared with 48k clicked from /my-va


- Bottom cards getting much less clicks than top cards → might not be due to placement but other factors influencing products
- 3k/ 1.1M (<1%) of users click "Check your claim, etc." link from primary nav (was 3rd most common primary nav event from /my-health: see report spun up and blessed by Jamie)
- 31k (3%) clicked on Profile link from /my-health

**Findings details**

Lower numbers of users are clicking on health-periphery task. We don't know if that low usage reflects:
- how much those products are needed by this audience (doubtful for copay, travel reimbursement, travel claims; maybe for profile);
- whether people aren't finding them or noticing them
- if people simply do them elsewhere (BTSSS; pay.gov; paper/ in-person)
- that not everyone connects those concepts in their mental models (some evidence to this in UXRs)


## Insight 2: Veterans value personalization. They want an experience tailored to their current benefits, claims, and tasks.

High-confidence - RQ4

**Studies this insight appeared in:**
- Landing page gap analysis, July 2024
- My VA audit, March 2023
- Mobile comparative analysis: Personalized and contextual home screen content, July 2023
- VA Mobile App IA research, 2021-2022
- VA Mobile App Prototype Testing and Co-Design Research, 2020 
- My VA redesign research findings, Dec 2020

**Methods:**
- Usability study
- Co-design research
- Discovery research
- Card sort

**Details:** 

Veterans desire a personalized and centralized online experience, that streamlines access to their most relevant benefits, tasks, and personalized notifications.

**Examples across the study:**

"Veterans want their experience to be tailored to them—a 'digital version of themselves'” reflecting what matters to them, right now (Review of related user research: Mobile app personalization, July 2023). 

"Veterans want a page that is focused on current information specific to them, rather than generalized information for all Veterans " (VA.gov home page user research, 2023). 

Veterans had positive reactions to seeing My VA immediately upon login because it was more personalized and showed them "their stuff" (My VA audit, March 2023).
Veterans prefer a concise overview of urgent or actionable items on a landing page...(My VA redesign research findings, Dec 2020). 

Many participants expressed appreciation for the personalization of My VA. Those who favored the homepage valued its versatility and the range of actions it allowed. Meanwhile, users who preferred My VA highlighted its streamlined and personalized experience. Regardless of their preference, both groups acknowledged the benefits of My VA’s personalization (My VA 2 research, March 2021). 

## Insight 3: Veterans want to be notified about changes, updates, or new information - especially time-sensitive information. 

High confidence - RQ4

**Studies supporting this insight:**

- VA Mobile App Prototype Testing and Co-Design Research, 2020
- Landing page gap analysis, July 2024
- VA Mobile research review: Personalized app homescreen, Nov 2021
- Mobile comparative analysis: Personalized and contextual home screen content, July 2023
- Review of related user research: Mobile app personalization, July 2023

**Methods:**

- Usability study
- Co-design research
- Desk research
- Comparative analysis
  
**Details:**

Findings around notifications emerged in five of the studies reviewed. These studies clarify that Veterans want proactive, transparent information and updates from the VA. They see notifications as a way to achieve this. 
Timely, personalized notifications would help Veterans take action on time-sensitive tasks such as managing claims, and stay informed about relevant updates. (VA Mobile app prototype testing and co-design research, 2020; Review of related user research: Mobile app personalization, July 2023)

Personalized notifications and more general notifications both have potential to be useful, but personal ones are much higher value (VA Mobile App Prototype Testing and Co-Design Research, 2020). 
"There are town hall meetings - any kind of meetings - VA does lots of good things, if I knew about them I could schedule appointments and attend." -- P4
"Notifications would be really useful - the more specific ones that are personalized. That would function the way I think VA launchpad could have been." -- P5
"VA information would need to be more specific...important things that are happening that we need to know about and suggestions for other things I am eligible for or any changes to their policies [are the types of things I want to be notified about]." -- P2

**Importance of clear and granular notifications:**

Personalized notifications and more general notifications both have the potential to be useful, but personal ones are of much higher value (VA Mobile app prototype testing and co-design research, 2020). Further, simple status updates are inadequate. They need contextual details and more information to be useful (e.g., claim type, date, next steps) to interpret the status and understand where a given application, submission, or claim is in the process.
In early 2024, analytics data for the “Go to inbox” link on the My VA page saw a 47% increase in traffic when a red notification dot was next to it. This data indicates that calling attention to links and areas with “new” or “unread” information does drive engagement (Notification dot indicator analytics, September 19, 2023). 

**Examples:**

- "[Status of a claim] is a big stressor - you don’t know where you are in the process, hard to know what step you are on. I just want to see where I am in the process and what else I have to do." (P3, VA Mobile app prototype testing and co-design research, 2020).
- "There are town hall meetings - any kind of meetings - VA does lots of good things, if I knew about them I could schedule appointments and attend." -- P4
- "VA information would need to be more specific...important things that are happening that we need to know about and suggestions for other things I am eligible for or any changes to their policies [are the types of things I want to be notified about]." -- P2
- Transparency in claim status updates are critical, with Veterans requesting clear timestamps, pending status indicators, and proactive notifications (VA Mobile app prototype testing and co-design research, 2020). 

_Veterans' mental model around notifications is shaped by their online experiences._

A comparative analysis reviewing 26 apps across industries found notifications in 16 of the apps reviewed. 

- Notifications were present in half of the apps, but overwhelmingly they were not included on the home screen (Mobile comparative analysis: Personalized and contextual home screen content, July 2023) 

Further research revealed,  

- All competitors use badge indicators and/or card-style notifications to draw the user's attention to new, unread, or time-sensitive information (Landing page gap analysis, July 2024)
- All competitors highly personalize the page to clearly communicate information unique to the user. Personalized components (notification cards or sections with specific content) are almost always given primary hierarchy placement on the page, but some features are prioritized as secondary (i.e. notification badges that are less visually "loud" or prominent) (Landing page gap analysis, July 2024). 
- When it comes to notifications and updates on the My VA webpage, Veterans expect to see them at the top of the page (VA Mobile research review: Personalized app homescreen, Nov 2021) 

## Insight 4: Veterans want a central authenticated place that they see as a “jumping off point,” where they can return again and again to re-center themselves. 

Medium confidence - RQ4

Studies that support this insight:

* Authenticated user generative research, 2020  
* VA.gov home page user research, 2023  
* Generative research on Transitioning Service Members, 2024  
* Logged-in Homepage Redesign: Comparative Analysis  
* [My HealtheVet landing page gap analysis, July 2024](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/landing-page/research/gap-analysis-2024.md)

Methods:

* Generative research  
* Comparative analysis

Details:

A study from 2020 interviewed 10 Veterans and determined key needs for an authenticated experience that we are still not quite delivering today (Logged-in homepage user research, 2020\)

1. We should focus the logged-in homepage on helping Veterans complete tasks as directly as possible (not linking them through multiple content pages to get to where they want to go).  
2. We should minimize content on the logged-in homepage that is not specific to the user.

We still see these same needs articulated in studies as recent as 2024\. While My VA has gone through several iterations, Veteran feedback and competitive analysis both suggest that users expect curated dashboard pages that are highly conditional, showing the Veteran only the most actionable information that is relevant to them in one central place, where they can return over and over again to understand timely updates, view in-progress tasks, and easily navigate to authenticated pages where they can manage their health and benefits.  

* "Veterans want a page that is focused on current information specific to them, rather than generalized information for all Veterans." (VA.gov home page user research, 2023\)  
* Veterans would like to see us surface benefit recommendations alongside existing benefit management in a single place. (Generative research on Transitioning Service Members, 2024\)  
* When Veterans were asked to design their own home page, they created pages that gave them access to most important tasks in one place, guided them to benefits information and recommendations, minimized content not specific to them, and provided them with important updates. (Logged-in homepage research, 2020\)

Veterans’ expectations about what this “central page” should look like are impacted by their broader experiences on other websites and authenticated portals, where Veterans regularly engage with features “make them feel known” and are more relevant to them than what we offer on VA.gov. These pages are also easier to find in portals outside of VA.gov, where the purpose of the site is more straightforward and isn’t balancing multiple benefit types in one place. In general, Veterans seem to understand that this “central page” would not reflect *all* of their information, and that they may need to go off to another page to get fuller information or details.

* Veterans are looking for a personal summary with clear calls to action and an “at-a-glance” understanding of the status of each item that needs their attention so that they can quickly identify statuses and top tasks that should be completed. ([My VA Redesign research findings, 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research/MyVA-research-findings.md))  
* Almost every site we looked at (Delta and Google being exceptions) predominantly display content related only to the user upon logging in. The sites typically included very little, if any, generic marketing or promotional content in the main body upon login. (Logged-in Homepage Redesign: Comparative Analysis, 2020\)  
* The Cartography team took on a gap analysis research effort in 2024 that identified significant differences in the information architecture approach and level of personalization on the My HealtheVet landing page compared to common authenticated portals on major financial, travel, and health websites ([Gap analysis research on the My HealtheVet on VA.gov homepage, 2024](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/landing-page/research/gap-analysis-2024.md))

## Insight 5: Veterans have heightened information needs when they encounter major life transitions.

Medium confidence  RQ 4  Needs more research

Studies that support this insight

* Generative research on transitioning service-members, 2024  
* My VA Personalization 2.0 discovery research, 2020  
* Social listening healthcare mental model, Sept 2024  
* VES Veteran Unmet Needs report, 2024

Methods:

* Social listening  
* Generative research  
* Usability study

Details: 

The differences and severity of needs among Veterans are most pronounced during major life transitions. Aligning examples of these transitions to the [Veteran journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf), the first and most universal change occurs when Veterans start up with the VA. Two studies point to the need for an onboarding process for recently separated Veterans, naming their need for orientation to the vast suite of benefits that they may be eligible for with the VA. Direct interviews with recently separated Veterans deeply reflect the lack of training around how to *use benefits* at the VA, what to apply for first based on their needs, and how to figure out what they and their family members are eligible for. Veterans want to be guided through the process (My VA Personalization 2.0 discovery research). 

* The complexity of the VA discourages people from applying for benefits. Especially people with cognitive considerations. (Generative research on transitioning service-members, 2024\)   
* Separating service members have the additional stress of getting to know the VA for the first time and figuring out how to settle into their lives outside of the military. While there are many ways we could better address \[their needs\], one of the biggest ones is creating an onboarding experience for first time users at the VA. (My VA Personalization 2.0 discovery research)  
  * “Is there a walk through to the websites, like a point and click to see what is available and what is provided? It would assist in properly navigating the website … Walk me through how to… fill prescription or make an appointment.” (P1, Transitioning service-member interview)  
  * I mean even if it were just a link \[on the website\] that said "separating: this is how we help" and have a page and links that are categorized that it was easy to navigate. Or apply for different situations or types of people that are getting out. Like going to school click here, going right into a job click here, something like that.” (P2, Transitioning service-member interview)   
* Veterans transitioning to  civilian  life face challenges  in relating  to  non-military individuals,  workforce entry,  securing  basic necessities, accessing essential  services such as healthcare  and insurance, and adapting  to  a different  pace of life. This transition is notably  challenging,  with  43% of service members  experiencing  serious suicide  risk factors  in the  first  three  months  after  military  discharge. (VES Veteran Unmet Needs report, 2024\)

Once Veterans have “started up” and move on to “putting down roots” or “taking care of themselves,” Veterans feel concerned and unclear about what could change if they go through another major transition, such as losing their job, getting married or divorced, retiring, or having a child. A change in their disability rating can also create confusion as to how that impacts their access to care.

 It is possible that a major health diagnosis could be considered a similarly massive life transition, but we did not find evidence in the research at this stage to back that up. We recommend additional generative research to better understand what significant life changes are stressors for Veterans both within and beyond healthcare.  

* In a social listening study conducted by the 10-10 health applications team, 3 of 11 reddit posts cited getting a new job or having a change in income that meant they no longer met the income limits to qualify for VA health care.A common concern was that giving VHA information about their employer health insurance plan would remove their eligibility to VA healthcare. (Social listening healthcare mental model, Sept 2024).  
  * “I just got a new job last year and I’m making more. It’s over the income limit. It doesn’t say I’d get kicked out \[of VA medical benefits\] tho. The providers I’m currently seeing are great and I’d rather not have to look for a new one.”   
  * “I am waiting on approval for a \[...\] claim that should put me at 10% \[service-connected disability rating\]. Will I be eligible for VA care at that point or will my income level continue to prevent me from utiliz\[ing\] VA healthcare services?”    

## Insight 6: Veterans need a seamless way to access health and disability benefits information, but conflating the two platforms creates confusion and inefficiencies.

**Summary**

Various Studies show that Veterans often conflate the health and benefits space on VA.gov, unsure where to find their health and disability benefits information. As a result, they frequently search across multiple platforms, backtrack, or abandon their search when the information isn’t where they expect. The separation of health and benefits services deepens this confusion, leading to inefficiencies and frustration. These findings highlight the need for clearer distinctions between health and benefits platforms to better align with Veterans’ expectations and improve access to essential services.  

**Tasks** (*Health Apt Tree Test \- Health Hub, Health Apt, Deeper Nav, Dec 2022\)*

* Determining health benefits eligibility based on disability rating:   
  * Some participants searched under Health Care \> Eligibility, while others looked under My VA Health Care \> VA Health Care Coverage or Disability Rating, leading to inconsistencies in search behavior.  
  * Some backed out of About VA Health Benefits after realizing it did not contain the information they were looking for.  
  * Others assumed their VA Health Summary \> Records would contain benefit details but abandoned the search when they realized it wasn’t there.  
* Finding dental coverage eligibility:  
  * Participants needed to determine if they qualified for VA dental care but struggled with where to start.  
  * Many first searched under Health Care \> Eligibility, while others looked under VA Health Care Coverage or Help and Resources, leading to inefficient navigation.  
* Finding PTSD-related information for a Veteran they care for:  
  * Many assumed PTSD resources would be in Health Care but ultimately relied on Help Pages, FAQs, and User Guides instead of direct navigation.  
  * Some checked their VA Health Summary, thinking it might contain PTSD-related information.

Veterans face confusion and inefficiencies when navigating multiple platforms for health and disability-related benefits, often switching between VA.gov, MHV, and other resources to complete tasks.

* "VA.gov, My HealtheVet, eBenefits, military.com—there are too many websites that you can go to and it can get confusing." (P4, *MHV on VA.gov Round 2 Initial Prototype \- Usability Research/POC \- mobile users, May 2024\)*  
* "MHV is strictly for health records and doctor interactions. My VA is for everything else, but I don’t understand why I need to switch back and forth." (P1, Health Wayfinding Study, July 2023\)  
*  "My VA is more focused on benefits, while MHV is more focused on healthcare, but managing overlapping tasks across both platforms was frustrating." (P29, Health Wayfinding Study, July 2023\)  
*  "Sees disability benefits on the page and would expect them to be on eBenefits. They are used to going to eBenefits, so it would be another thing they have to learn." (P7, MHV on VA.gov Round 1 Initial Prototype Usability Research/POC, March 2022\)  
*  Veterans associate VA.gov more with benefits rather than health services, relying on My HealtheVet for health-related tasks. (Digital Health Modernization Generative Research Study, Sept 2021\)

Veterans expect clearer connections between disability ratings, health benefits, and related tools.

*  "When you click Disabilities you're approved for, once you click on there, there could be a link that goes to track your disabilities and it breaks down your ratings and has claims and appeals information." (P2, Logged-in Homepage Research, May 2020\)  
*  The VA’s information architecture does not align with Veterans’ mental models for accessing their benefits. (Logged-in Homepage Research, May 2020\)

Veterans appreciate a personalized dashboard but still struggle to understand their available health and disability benefits.

*  "Veterans want a clear indication of the specific types of healthcare benefits they are enrolled in (e.g., vision, dental) and the source of that healthcare (VA vs. other provider).” (Research Outline and Recommendations: VA.gov Auth Experience, April 2023\)

   
Veterans struggle with redundancy and resubmitting documentation across platforms.

*  "VA has all my stuff but they want me to resubmit it as new evidence. Have to download the info from VA, highlight what the doctor said on what day, and then submit it as new evidence... then schedule another appointment." (P9, Landing Page Gap Analysis, July 2024\)

## Insight 7: Veterans have historically struggled to find their health and benefits information due to fragmented platforms, often requiring switching between platforms.  While progress has been made in integrating MHV onto VA.gov  potential confusion and inefficiencies may still arise if health and disability benefits information are conflated rather than clearly distinguished.

**Summary:** 

Veterans have historically struggled to find their health and benefits information due to fragmented platforms, often switching between systems to complete tasks. Integrating MHV into VA.gov has helped address these inefficiencies, but confusion may still arise if health and disability benefits aren’t clearly distinguished. Veterans’ past experiences with separate platforms may continue to shape how they navigate the new system.

Research shows that Veterans frequently backtrack, search across platforms, or abandon tasks when information isn’t where they expect. Managing overlapping healthcare and benefits tasks remains a challenge, and transitioning to a new system requires relearning navigation, which can add frustration.While MHV’s integration into VA.gov is progress, ongoing research is needed to ensure Veterans can easily find what they need, reducing confusion and improving access to essential services. 

Veterans struggled to determine where tasks related to benefits and health should reside.

*  “I think I would go to Benefits and Health Care... then I would click on Health Care... and then I would go over to Manage Your Health.” *(P16, Tree Test of the Health Apartment IA)*  
* Some users expected their VA health summary to be useful but struggled to find it under Records \> VA Health Summary. *(Tree Test of the Health Apartment IA)*  
*  Some Veterans initially looked under eligibility when searching for health care information, indicating confusion about where management tasks should reside. *(Tree Test of the Health Apartment IA)*

Veterans rely on external resources and redundant tools when they can’t find what they need.

* Veterans often relied on Help and Resources \> Help Pages, FAQs, User Guides or Contact Us instead of direct pathways, indicating uncertainty. *(Tree Test of the Health Apartment IA)*  
* "VA.gov, My HealtheVet, eBenefits, military.com—there are too many websites that you can go to, and it can get confusing." *(P4, MHV on VA.gov Round 2 Initial Prototype Usability Research/POC – Mobile Users, May 2024\)*  
*  "I already go to eBenefits for my disability rating, so I assume that’s where my VA health care benefits are too." *(P7, Digital Health Modernization Generative Research Study, Sept 2021\)*

 Search behavior indicates confusion on where to start.

*  Logged-in Homepage Discovery data shows that "Benefits" **(\~150K searches)** and "Health" **(\~59K searches)** were among the most searched terms, suggesting that Veterans frequently search for them together rather than knowing where to locate information directly. *(Logged-in Homepage Discovery)*  
*  High success with low directness: Participants completed tasks but took inefficient paths, indicating that task locations did not match their expectations. *(My Health IA Tree Test, January 2023\)*

   
Veterans struggle to find key health and benefits information, as the site structure does not align with their expectations for where tasks should be completed.

* Veterans had difficulty locating information on dental care, mental health services, and community care due to their deep placement in the IA. *(Health Apt Tree Test \- Health Hub, Health Apt, Deeper Nav, Dec 2022\)*  
* Veterans struggled with nested structures—findability improved when keywords were placed higher in the IA. *(Health Apt Tree Test \- Health Hub, Health Apt, Deeper Nav, Dec 2022\)*  
*  P9: "What if I need to do something that is not here? What would I do then?" Finding anything is really challenging on VA.gov. *(Logged-in Homepage Research, May 2020*)  
* P14 initially looked under Disability when seeking letters, indicating a misalignment in where Veterans expect information to be housed. *(Logged-in Homepage Research, May 2020\)*  
* "Track disability claim would go under 'My info.' Upload claim or appeal under 'My info.' All of that is stuff you’d do pertaining strictly to you." *(P9, Logged-in Homepage Research, May 2020\)*

Many Veterans struggle with navigation due to long pages and overwhelming content.

* Almost half of participants reported difficulty finding needed information, especially if it wasn’t in the "top 4" boxes on the homepage. *(Research Outline and Recommendations: VA.gov Auth Experience, April 2023\)*  
*  Many never opened the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu, missing navigation options that could have led them to key health and benefits information. *(Research Outline and Recommendations: VA.gov Auth Experience, April 2023\)*  
*   "It is a lot of information, and it’s overwhelming." (*P11, Research Outline and Recommendations: VA.gov Auth Experience, April 2023\)*

## Insight 8: Veterans expect a straightforward and intuitive way to access financial tools such as copays and travel reimbursements and debts. When these tools are not located where they anticipate, it leads to unnecessary navigation across the platform, and difficulty completing tasks efficiently. Aligning access points with Veterans’ mental models can reduce confusion, streamline navigation, and improve task completion.

Multiple studies indicate that Veterans experience confusion and inefficiencies when searching for health-related financial tools. Expectations around where these tools should be located vary, leading Veterans to navigate between platforms, backtrack, or abandon tasks when they struggle to find the right information.

As Veterans transition to and become accustomed to MHV on VA.gov, further research is needed to understand how they prefer to view and access their financial information. Specifically, it is important to explore whether maintaining health-related financial tools separately from other benefits tools aligns with their expectations or if a more consolidated approach would improve usability.

This misalignment forces Veterans to rely on homepage top tasks or My VA links, which they often find insufficient. Many search using broad financial terms alongside health-related terms, suggesting that the current structure does not match their expectations. The resulting frustration and delays in accessing essential financial resources highlight the need for a more intuitive and seamless navigation experience.Ongoing research will help determine the best way to organize financial tools within VA.gov, ensuring Veterans can efficiently access the information they need without unnecessary navigation barriers. 

Veterans frequently bounced between My VA, MHV, and VA.gov while searching for copays and travel pay reimbursements, unsure where to start.

* "It’d be great if I didn’t have to leave MHV to go to travel pay or other healthcare tools.” *(P16, P23,* VA [Mobile app prototype testing and co-design research, 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/ux/mobile-app-MVP/2020-06-prototype-testing/testing-summary.md#claims-features-are-highly-useful-checking-a-claims-status-and-direct-access-to-claims-support-through-an-app-are-highly-useful)*)*  
* P6, P18: Veterans bounced between My VA, MHV, and VA.gov while trying to locate travel pay reimbursement and copay information, unsure where these tools should reside. *(Digital Health Modernization Generative Research Study, Sept 2021\)*

 This pattern of inefficiency extends to expectations for where health-related payments should live:

* Veterans did not expect to find copays under "Manage Your VA Debt," assuming instead that these tools would be housed within health sections. *(P16, P23, Health Wayfinding Study, July 2023\)*  
* "This is a bad place…this is not clear. If I’m looking for something that’s related just to health care, I want it under health care. Logically I would never think to go to My VA.” *(P16, Health Wayfinding Study, July 2023\)*

Veterans expect a dedicated space for healthcare-related payments rather than mixing them with general financial obligations.

* 4 out of 9 Veterans in card sorting exercises created a separate "Payments" section, indicating a strong mental model for keeping financial tools in one place. *(VA Mobile App: IA and Navigation Evaluative Research, Sept 2022\)*  
* "Everything to do with money I'd like to keep in one place." *(P14, VA Mobile App: IA and Navigation Evaluative Research, Sept 2022\)*

 Navigation inefficiencies were further confirmed through usability testing:

* Many relied on homepage top tasks or My VA links but found them insufficient for locating specific financial tools. *(Research Outline and Recommendations: VA.gov Auth Experience, April 2023\)*  
* Veterans struggled to determine where financial tools like copays and travel reimbursement belong within the VA system. *(P6, P8, Health Wayfinding Study, July 2023\)*  
* Veterans frequently searched for broad financial terms alongside health-related terms, suggesting that the current structure does not align with their expectations. *(Logged-in Homepage Discovery, 2020\)*
