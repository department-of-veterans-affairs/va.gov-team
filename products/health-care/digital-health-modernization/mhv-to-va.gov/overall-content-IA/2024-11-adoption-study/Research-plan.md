# Research plan for Adoption of My HealtheVet on VA.gov Generative Study

## Background
The My HealtheVet on VA.gov team’s mission is to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov. This research is in large part intended to inform our understanding of pain points that our users experience in transitioning to a new VA health care portal.

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the following OCTO objective:
Veterans can manage their health services online


### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	
- What hinders our users from discovering and returning to MHV on VA.gov?
- What unintentional friction are our users encountering on MHV on 
VA.gov?
- What information about new features on VA.gov might counter-balance
the challenges associated with switching to the new portal?

### Outcome
The learnings of this research will inform changes to the MHV on VA.gov experience and strategy for change management.

### Research questions
- Are CTAs to try out the new MHV portal effective? Do users notice them
and understand what they're saying?
- Once users try out the new portal, do they understand how to return?
- Are changes made to national portal language or tools causing confusion?
- What challenges or hiccups are users encountering on the new portal?
- What are positive changes that users notice while using the new portal?
- How much do users care about what the new MHV offers them?

### Hypothesis
- The majority of our users do not know that MHV is moving over to VA.gov, even directly after using the national portal. Many of them do not know what this change would or could mean for them outside of understanding that this change will pose a challenge to them that theywould prefer to avoid.
- The guidance to try MHV on VA.gov is unclear and the user journey to get to MHV on VA.gov is disjointed and confusing.
- Users will be interested in what we’ve decided are the most important or useful differentiators between the two portals but only those with a great deal of MHV experience will seem excited about the changes.

## Methodology	
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. The interviews will require users to share their screens and demonstrate how they complete a task (or tasks, plural) on the national portal, and on the VA.gov portal. While we observe the participant as they navigate, we will also pose direct questions to understand how they are thinking about different aspects of their experience. When this part is complete, we will move to the second part of the interview, which will be a series of statements that the user will read andrate based on how they feel in response to the statements.

### Location
These research sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom.

## Recruitment	
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans and we request a kickoff meeting with Perigean. We anticipate that the kickoff meeting will last 30 minutes. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information in an encrypted Excel file on the VA Network.

Availability for potential kickoff meeting times with Perigean:

Possible meeting times for a kick-off: 
* Monday, October 28, 9-1est 2-5 est
* Monday, October 29, 9-1est 2-5 est
* Let me know if you need more time options! 

## Recruitment approach
