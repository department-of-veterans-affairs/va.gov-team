# Research Plan for Health Team & Sitewide IA, June-July 2025

## Background 🏗️
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

Questions have arisen with regards to where to put appointment tasks that are not solely health appointments. There are ongoing questions about where to put other tasks in the sitewide IA. We grouped these questions together into one tree test so as to only recruit once for multiple questions. 
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

Auth. 
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

Varies by product. 

`Product Brief`

No product brief for this study. 

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

`Objective 1:  VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey?
Are there moments that matter?

- `Taking Care of Myself`
- `Reinventing Myself`
- `Putting Down Roots`
- `Retiring`
- `Aging`

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Where should non-health appointments live on VA.gov?**

`2.` **Questions related to other tasks, once finalized.**

`3.` **[Enter answer here]** 
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**Veterans will be able to more easily find specific resources, tools, or services on VA.gov** 

---

### Research questions

**`1.`Where should VA.gov surface scheduliing for claims exams, as well as for viewing or managing said appointment?**

**`2.`Where should VA.gov surface appointments, including managing and viewing said appointments, for Veterans in their first year out of service scheduling with Solid Start?**

**`3.`Where should VA.gov surface denial letters to Veterans who were denied Community Care?**

**`4.`Other Mikki tasks**

**`5.`[Enter Q5]**

  
## Methodology  🛠️
***Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.*** 

**Unmoderated tree test**


### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Optimal Workshop's Tree Test functionality. 

- [X] **Remote**
- [ ] **In-person**

## Recruitment 🎯	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

### Recruitment approach
Veterans or caregivers. Intentionally open so recruitment can go faster. Will go through Perigean. 

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
- Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
- Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:
> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **1.5x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 10 ideal completed sessions, request 15 total participants)*


- `Veterans:` **[n]**
- `Caregivers:` **[n]**
- `Dependents:` **[n]**
- `Total:` **[n]**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **[n]**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?* 

- `[Place primary criteria here between hash marks when in edit mode]`
- `primary criteria`
- `primary criteria`
- **`Add more criteria as needed`**

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
*What criteria would strengthen your results?*

## Timeline 🗓️
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **[Enter dates and times MM/DD HH:MM]**

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[Enter time length]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[Enter buffer time]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[Enter NUM per day]**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
