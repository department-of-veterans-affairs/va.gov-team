## Research goals

As the VA.gov ecosystem continues to grow, questions have come up about where to place certain tools and tasks that do not always have a clear home in the current site structure. This study focused on transitioning service members and explored how they navigate to find key information and tools across VA.gov during their first year after leaving the military. While many of the tasks were benefits related, some touched on health care as well. The goal was to better understand how Veterans approach both health and non-health topics and how they interpret the site’s information architecture when trying to get things done.

Veterans were asked to complete tasks based on common situations like:
- Connecting with a VA Solid Start representative  
- Scheduling a claim exam for disability compensation  
- Checking the status of a care request from a non-VA provider  
- Giving a school permission to access VA education benefits  
- Checking the status of a VA housing grant  
- Adding a child to VA benefits to increase compensation  
- Downloading military exposure records   

Through this research we aimed to:
- Learn where Veterans expect to find VA tools and information related to their benefits, health care, and service history.  
- Observe how Veterans approached common but sometimes ambiguous scenarios like managing dependents or tracking external care requests.  
- Identify moments of hesitation, missteps, or confidence in navigating VA.gov's current menu structure.  
- Use these insights to improve the way information is grouped and labeled on VA.gov so new Veterans can find what they need more easily.  

## Research questions

1. You recently separated from the military. You were told to schedule a time to connect with a VA Solid Start program representative who can help you get started with the benefits and services VA offers. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
2. You received a letter from VA asking you to schedule a claim exam to evaluate the service-connected condition you reported as part of a claim. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
3. You recently submitted a request for care from a provider outside of VA and want to check the status of that request. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
4. You're applying for college, and the college needs your VA benefits information. You need to give VA permission to release your information to the college. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
5. You recently applied for a VA grant to make improvements to your home to better accommodate your needs related to a service-connected condition. You want to check the status of that application. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
6. You currently receive compensation for an injury you got during your military service. You want to add your child to your benefits to increase your payments. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
7. You need to download a copy of the record of toxic exposures you had during military service (called the individual longitudinal exposure record, or ILER) to support a VA benefit claim. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?

## Methodology

- We ran two identical unmoderated tree tests using Optimal Workshop’s Treejack tool.
- After low participation in the first round, we relaunched the second without screener questions to encourage more completions.
- Participants were asked to complete seven tasks by navigating a menu structure and selecting where they believed they would find the correct information.
- Tasks were randomized to avoid bias from learning the tree as the study progressed.
- Participants were not allowed to skip tasks.

## Limitations
This study included feedback from 48 participants, enough to spot patterns, but not enough to make strong statistical claims. Some tasks showed clear trends while others had more mixed results. Because this was an unmoderated tree test, we are only able to observe where participants clicked and not why they made those choices. Any takeaways should be considered directional and used to guide future testing or improvements rather than as definitive conclusions.

## Key findings
**1. Veterans explored broad benefit sections when trying to connect with a Solid Start representative**
  * Many Veterans explored broad benefit sections like Education, Claims, Applications, and Payments when trying to schedule time with a Solid Start representative, possibly seeing the task as part of applying for or managing benefits rather than connecting with a specific program.

**2. To schedule a claim exam, Veterans often chose Claims and Appeals**  
  * To schedule a claim exam, Veterans often went to Claims and Appeals or other claims-related sections. Some also selected Health Care, Disability Benefits, or Medical Records, though these paths did not lead to the correct location. This may reflect that Veterans associated the exam with the overall claims process, rather than as a separate task to schedule.

**3. Veterans selected a wide range of paths when trying to check the status of a community care request**
  * When trying to check the status of a care request from a provider outside VA, Veterans selected a wide range of paths such as Health Care, Secure Messages, Community Care, and Claims and Appeals. This suggests it is unclear where non VA care activity is tracked in the current IA.

**4. Veterans looked in Education and Training, but missed the correct path to authorize college access**
  * To give a college access to their VA benefits information, many Veterans looked in Education and Training paths like Verify Your School Enrollment, About GI Bill Benefits, and Eligibility suggesting they may have been searching for documentation rather than a way to authorize information sharing.

**5. Most Veterans successfully found where to check the status of a housing grant**
  * Most Veterans checked the status of a VA housing grant by navigating to sections like Claims and Appeals or Benefit Applications and Forms, which may reflect an association between housing benefits and the broader claims process.

**6. Veterans often looked in benefit applications and family support sections when trying to add a child for compensation**
  * While trying to add a child to their VA benefits for increased compensation, many Veterans searched in Benefit Applications and Family and Caregiver Benefits, including CHAMPVA and Survivor Benefits. Fewer navigated to the correct location under Disability or Benefit Payments in My VA, suggesting it may not be immediately clear that dependent management is part of ongoing compensation rather than a new application or family support service.

**7. Veterans looked in health and claims paths when trying to download their Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER)**
  * Many Veterans searched in Health, Claims and Appeals, or Disability-related sections when trying to download their Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER) to support a benefit claim. Few navigated to the correct location under Records in VA Benefits and Health Care, suggesting ILER may be seen more as medical or claims documentation than a general records file.

## Details of findings

### Finding 1: Veterans explored broad benefit sections when trying to connect with a Solid Start representative
To schedule time with a Solid Start representative, many Veterans clicked into areas like Education, Claims, Applications, and Payments. These paths reflect an effort to locate post-military support, but not necessarily a direct connection to the Solid Start program itself. Only 35.4% completed the task successfully.

### Finding 2: To schedule a claim exam, Veterans often chose Claims and Appeals
After receiving a letter from VA, Veterans looking to schedule a claim exam often navigated to the Claims and Appeals section. Others explored Health Care, Disability Benefits, or Medical Records, which did not lead to the correct location. Just 37.5% of Veterans reached the correct destination.

### Finding 3:  Veterans selected a wide range of paths when trying to check the status of a community care request
To check the status of a care request from a provider outside VA, participants selected a wide range of paths including Health Care, Secure Messages, Community Care, and Claims and Appeals. This variation suggests it’s not clear where non-VA care activity is tracked in the current IA. While some successfully navigated to Appointments or care management-related areas, others relied on familiar tools typically used for managing benefits. Only 37.5% of participants completed the task successfully.

### Finding 4: Veterans looked in Education and Training, but missed the correct path to authorize college access
When asked how they would give VA permission to release their benefits information to a college, many Veterans selected paths under education and training, including Verify Your School Enrollment, About GI Bill benefits, Eligibility, and After You Apply. Some also chose Download Records, which is not part of the education and training section and did not lead to the correct location. While several Veterans landed in broadly relevant education-related areas, most missed the specific path needed to complete the task. Only 20.8% completed it successfully.

### Finding 5: Most Veterans successfully found where to check the status of a housing grant
To track the status of a VA housing grant application, most Veterans navigated to paths that ended in pages like Claims and Appeals, Benefit Applications and Forms, or Check Claim, or Appeal Status. These selections aligned with the intended destination and contributed to a 77.1% success rate. A few Veterans selected unrelated areas, including Benefit Payments, Secure Messaging, Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA), and Medical Records.

### Finding 6: Veterans often looked in benefit applications and family support sections when trying to add a child for compensation
Adding a child to VA benefits for increased monthly compensation prompted many Veterans to explore Benefit Applications and Forms or Family and Caregiver Benefits, including areas like CHAMPVA and Survivor Benefits. A smaller number found their way to Manage the dependents on your compensation under Disability or Benefit Payments under My VA. Only 33.3% reached the correct destination.

### Finding 7: Veterans looked in health and claims paths when trying to download their Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER)
To download their Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER) in support of a benefit claim, many Veterans selected paths under Health, Claims and Appeals, Benefit Applications and Forms, or other Disability-related areas. Only 20.8 percent navigated to the correct path, Records under VA Benefits and Health Care. While this tree-test did not have a statistically significant number of participants, the low findability of this form may point to an opportunity to add a cross-link to the ILER from within the My VA page.

## Recommendations
Even with a small sample, a few consistent patterns came through in how Veterans navigated and interpreted the site. Based on those behaviors, there are some initial areas to explore further:
- Clarify labels and pathways for tasks like adding dependents, checking non-VA care requests, and giving permission to share education benefits.  
- Reevaluate where tools like ILER or claim exam scheduling live, and/or when there is split or low signal for those "correct" destinations, consider additional cross-links to those resources. 
- Look at areas where users expected to find proof of something (like letters or records) but actually needed to take an action. This gap came up in more than one task.  
- Continue leaning into task based entry points especially for high-impact actions tied to compensation, housing, or post-military service support.

## Further research needed
This study offered meaningful insight into how transitioning Veterans move through VA.gov and MHV to approach common tasks. While the patterns we saw were useful, the sample size of just 48 participants wasn’t large enough to draw statistically confident conclusions. These findings should be seen as early signals and not final answers. A second round of research with a larger and more diverse group would help confirm what we saw and uncover anything we might have missed. As part of this effort, it may be helpful to work with the recruitment team at Perigean to strategize ways to reach more transitioning service members and Veterans who are not yet enrolled in VA health care or using VA.gov. Expanding Perigean’s recruitment database to include more of these individuals could also strengthen future research efforts across VA.gov and MHV.

### Who we talked to  
A total of 48 Veterans completed the study. All participants were either transitioning out of the military or had recently separated and were asked to complete a series of tasks based on common post-service needs. This group represents a small portion of the broader transitioning Veteran population. For context, an estimated 58,000 users engaged with the VA service-member hub in May 2025, and approximately 200,000 individuals transition out of military service each year.
