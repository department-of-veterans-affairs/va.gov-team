## Research Goals

Most broadly speaking, the goal of this study is to help us get a sense of how closely the current organizing structures and wayfinding tools within the MHV on VA.gov experience align with users’ expectations and mental models. The purpose of this research is to assess users' reactions to and expectations of the MHV on VA.gov experience and whether the current wayfinding tactics are effective at guiding users through key tasks. More specifically, this study aims to help us understand how users navigate across health tools to non-health tools, and what their understandings and behaviors are when they are linked to other VA.gov sections or outside of VA.gov.


## Research Questions

* When users are at the "manage health" stage, where do they look for their health-related services and resources on VA.gov? What health-related information do they seek out?  ​
* How do users navigate from an unauthenticated state to the MHV portal?​
* How easily can users navigate to various tasks within the MHV portal and between tools in the portal?​
* Once deep within MHV portal tool navigation hierarchy, how do users navigate back out to MHV portal or wider VA.gov? ​
* If a user clicks on a task that takes them out of the MHV portal, can they find their way back to MHV portal? If so, what paths/ strategies do they take?​
* How do users differentiate between My VA vs. MHV portal? What resources do they expect to be in each of those two locations?


## Methodology 

_Brief description of method chosen_

We conducted 18 remote interviews via Zoom. In these interviews, participants navigated across 4 key tasks using a prototype.  These interviews also included questions documenting users’ process navigating to and within My VA and My HealtheVet, the mental models they use to find certain information, and their expectations related to key tasks.

## Key Findings

1. Earlier navigational behavior and outcomes​

2. Recurring navigational behaviors and outcomes: "gravitational pull" of wayfinding tactics​

3. Spectrum of "figure-it-outness"​

4. Sensemaking around health vs. Non-health resources: Differentiating between My VA and MHV portal experience



## Details of Findings 

**Finding 1: Earlier navigational behavior and outcomes​**

<img width="1117" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/129799592/e58ba9ab-e5b5-4059-82c8-368425a69b13">

Participants who did not directly sign in had a more complex experience than those who did.  These early actions impact the rest of a participants’ experience.

**Finding 2: Recurring navigational behaviors and outcomes: "gravitational pull" of wayfinding tactics​**

<img width="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/129799592/98506969-d814-467b-9f42-0f0e6bb5dde2">

We observed certain navigational tools exerting a “gravitational pull” on participants, in that participants would return to those comfortable tactics to accomplish their tasks, despite at times having wayfinding alternatives that would enable a more direct path.  The intended behavior embedded in the designs is for users to utilize the My VA and MHV landing page and, in the case of MHV, the secondary navigation within the MHV portal. When users used those strategies, they were more efficient at achieving their tasks. However, we observed a number of participants who returned throughout the course of their interviews to the Megamenu or Home page, or who referenced wanting to use Search functionality.

<img width="247" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/129799592/28036a20-9f40-4502-aaa0-6ba76423c30a">
<img width="86" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/129799592/f758f4c0-29d2-4f9e-a83e-407bc751259e">

Some participants would be in MHV portal experience and return to Megamenu, Home page or Search. They indicated that they did this because they believed that they could "restart" from those spaces. These participants commonly did not indicate an awareness of the MHV portal experience, or, at times, My VA, despite having navigated periodically in those experiences when seeking to accomplish those tasks. These participants had to follow circuitous routes to accomplish the tasks and often indicated frustration or described VA.gov as complicated or confusing. This lack of awareness of how to return to these personalized spaces or how to use these spaces to accomplish their tasks was most pronounced amongst participants using the mobile prototype. No participant using the mobile prototype looked for the tabs in the Authenticated Menu and as a result, did not locate the MHV landing page without support from facilitators. 


**Finding 3: Spectrum of "figure-it-outness"​**

We observed 3 groups:

1. Not able to figure it out: These participants were unaware that they were in an authenticated health experience. They relied on the Menu dropdown and direct links and the home page and top task links. No mobile participants were able to “figure it out”
2. Struggles but figures it out: These participants also relied on the Menu dropdown and direct links and the home page and top task links but were more successful and confident in their ability to troubleshoot. They also gravitated to other self service functionality, like Search.
3. Experience is intuitive: These participants relied on direct links in My VA and immediately noticed and engaged with the MHV portal and wayfinding tactics available there.
  

**Finding 4: Sensemaking around health vs. Non-health resources: Differentiating between My VA and MHV portal experience**

*Finding #1:* One group of participants expressed that they want everything in one place.  These participants understood and used the links on My VA as a snapshot or gateway to start to access health care benefits, returning to where they started sometimes even when they were already in MHV.


> _“This [My VA] is like a snapshot of everything that would cover me...” – P13_

> _"I see it's [My VA] a jumping off place to for getting the rest of your VA stuff..." - P18_

*Finding #2:* Another group of participants distinguished their medical care from their other VA benefits.  At the start, for some this meant automatically MHV while others would guess at the Healthcare and Benefits megamenu.

> _“Normally I would think kind of like on the civilian side... I think of something like MyChart and so that would be my first instinct on the VA side, like, ok where do I find my like MyChart equivalent for VA?” – P23_

> _"I'm looking for something that says After Visit Summary... I think I would go to Benefits and Health care... then I would click on Health care... and then I would go over to Manage your health" - P16_

*Finding #3:* Participants' distinction between a snapshot of available VA benefits and one place to manage medical care required a greater recognition and awareness of the differences between the My VA and MHV pages writ large. Not all participants got there, and many never got there without help from the facilitator. Participants who did get there were more likely to be aware of the My VA than the MHV page, especially if they signed in and first landed on the My VA page.

> _“MHV is going to deal with your health... and then you have to go to My VA to get all your information about your other benefits...My VA is for everything else but MHV is just for your health.” – P8_

> _"...if it has anything to do with my health and wellbeing it's MHV app... anything else that's I think it's like a different app... like a copayment... it's going take you out of MHV" - P12_


## Next Steps

#### Short term

* Make it easier to find My VA and My HealtheVet within the navigation on mobile web.

#### Long term

* Increase the prominence of My VA and My HealtheVet within the primary navigation.
<img width="632" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/129799592/7d5be565-e024-4059-a92d-8dd772f61cff">

Expose My HealtheVet link to unauthenticated users:					
* Add MyHealtheVet link as part of "Manage healthcare" section of unauthenticated content. 						
* Add MyHealtheVet link to the Healthcare benefits fly-out menu in top nav under "manage"

* Add My HealtheVet link (and potentially My VA link) onto home page.
