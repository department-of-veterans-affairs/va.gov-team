# Research Plan for Wayfinding study, July/August 2023

## Background

This study is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information.  This study aims to support this effort by investigating the different wayfinding strategies users use when completing key health management tasks on MHV on VA.gov.  It is part of a broader research effort to align Information Architecture for the MHV to VA.gov integration.  More on this [can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/1d786b3abb178f9ae326c821596729b896a65090/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA).

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
Most broadly speaking, the goal of this study is to help us get a sense of how closely the current organizing structures and wayfinding tools within the MHV on VA.gov experience align with users’ expectations and mental models. The purpose of this research is to assess users' reactions to and expectations of the MHV on VA.gov experience and whether the current wayfinding tactics are effective at guiding users through key tasks. More specifically, this study aims to help us understand how users navigate across health tools to non-health tools, and what their understandings and behaviors  are when they are linked to other VA.gov sections or outside of VA.gov. 

### Outcome

This research will inform updates to the MHV on VA.gov wayfinding efforts to support users across different experiences.

### Research questions

1. When users are at the "manage health" stage, where do they look for their health-related services and resources on VA.gov? What health-related information do they seek out?  
2. How do users navigate from an unauthenticated state to the the My HealtheVet portal?
3. How easily can users navigate to various tasks within the My HealtheVet portal?
4. Once deep within My HealtheVet portal tool navigation hierarchy, how do users navigate back out to My HealtheVet portal or wider VA.gov? (e.g., out of health landing page, or specific tool on landing page) What do users do if they get lost?
5. How do users differentiate between My VA vs. My HealtheVet portal? What resources do they expect to be in each of those two locations?


## Method

### Interviews
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. These interviews will include questions documenting users’ process navigating to and within My HealtheVet, the mental models they use to find certain information, and their expectations related to health-specific tasks. The interviews will consist of a combination of tasks and direct questions. 


### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom.
