# Warm-up questions
* **What kind of device are you using today?** (_Computer / Tablet / Smartphone_)
  * P:  Laptop
* **What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA?**
  * P: Only healthcare

# Task 1: AVS task

P: Would I need to create an account?

**M: What if you have an account?** 

P: Then maybe I'd search. (_scroll and read the top tasks section of the home page_) I would either sign in or click on My VA. (_sign in with MHV account log in_)

**M: What are you looking at?**

P: Ok, claims and appeal, but that's not what I'm looking for. (_click MHV and read through each card_) I will look in the inbox because I don't see anything on here that's about my visit. (_click inbox_) Oh, wait, here's the appointment (_click sec nav. and click into details of the first upcoming appointment) I don't see any notes on here. I'd go to medical records (_click sec nav._) Then Care summaries and notes (_click first AVS and read and scroll, click treatment plan and read_) 

**M: Would you want to or expect to learn more about this appointment?** 

P: No this is already very detailed, gives me a lot more than usual. I don't have any more questions about the appointment. 

# Task 2: Copay & Disability claims 

P: (_click on MHV, and scroll and read everything on MHV landing page_) I'm looking for something financial. (_click "Pay my copay" in payment_) Nope, that's not it. 

**M: What are you looking for?**

P: Looking for something financial. (_accidently went to go the home page_). Can I just make a point about the first session? I'm not tech-savvy, and I struggle. So someone with keenness of mind will probably do better. It was hard to get to the summary thing. I had to really search. So I'm saying it may be just me, especially when it's quite new, but then again, it didn't necessarily give me a clear path to get there too. 
(_sign in again_) So, I'm on My VA now, but I signed in with MHV, or does it matter? 

**M: Repeat task**

P: I signed in with MHV, but this is My VA (not what was expected). I'm looking for a payment, so (_click MHV_) That's two different sites. I'd go down again (_read the whole page_) "Payments" is the only financial since you asked me about claims. 

**M: Do you think you've accomplished the goal?**

P: I'd click on the "pay copay bill" again. (_read pay.gov_) 

**M: Where are you now?**

P: I'm at the VA medical copay, Pay.gov. 

**M: If you wanted to continue and make payment, how could you do from here?**

P: It's self-explanatory. I would fill in the form. 

**M: Where are you now?**

P: (_read the whole page_) I think I'm on another website because it was pay.gov. 

**M: Let's move on to another task, what do you find about disability claims?**

P: (_accidentally clicked on prototype restart, then sign in_) This is where I'm confused. I signed in with the MHV login, but this is My VA. I see "claims and appeals" on My VA. If you have no concern about where I get that information, I'd click on that. 

**M: Ok, go ahead**

P: (_click the details of claims and appeals on My VA_) So, it's in the third phase. 

# Task 3: Lab and test results

P: I'd go to MHV. (_click MHV and read the whole page_) Again, I don't see where I'd go in and find what you asked. I'm looking for medical records, or messages if my doctor left a message for me. (_click appointments and details for an upcoming appointment) I don't see any notes here. Ok, now I'd go to message and inbox, it has test results (_looking at inbox_). I'd prefer a tab (on the secondary nav.) that has lab and test results. 

# Task 4: Appointments 

P: I'd go back to appointments (_click on secondary nav._) I'd look at details, and expect to give me an address and email. Ok, that's very good, it gives me all the information. 

**M: Can you go back to the larger appointment section?**

P: (_click back to appointments_) 

**M: What requests mean?**

P: Asking for an appointment. 

# My VA vs. MHV 

**M: How would you organize different resources here?**

P: (_looking at MHV_) First of all, I'd change Payments to Financial, then put all the claims and copays and other things you want here. I'd also make sure...umm. (_click My VA_) 

**M: How would you explain these two pages to another Veteran?**

P: I don't want to say troubling, but it's exhausting to find some of your information in one part of the area, and another part in MHV. You got claims here (My VA). Supposedly pick whatever accounts are, we should have everything in that. I'm not thinking that I have to go to My VA to find claims and appeals. I don't know where to go for what. You have to look for information in both pages. All I can say is how it is, and that's how it is.
