# Task 1: AVS task

P: So, normally I go to My Chart to find my health information. Now, on here, I'd question where I can go to find the equivalent. (_srolls the whole home page, look at top tasks_) Here is "get VA medical records", but I don't want to see the whole records. I'm curious about what's under the "VA benefits and health care" (_main navigation_). It's still not obvious where I'd go for that information. (_clicked "all health care" and scrolls_) I guess I would click on "Get medical records" since that's the only thing that makes sense. Ok, this makes sense. (_clicked on care notes and summaries_) I would expect it to be more prominent on the home page. 

**M: Where are you now?**

P: (_read through everything on the care notes and summaries page_) 

**M: Do you think you'd find the next steps in your care on this page??**

P: Hm, "primary care after visit summary" doesn't sound like it's what you told me to do. 

**M: Can you read more about the AVS from here?**

P: Well, I'd click on "details". (_read everything on the page, and click on treatment plan_) 

**M: If you'd like to know more about this appointment, what would you do?**

P: It seems pretty clear that everything talked about in the appointment is here. If I still want to know more, I would probably message my provider if I don't find anything on the AVS details page.

**M: Do you think you're logged in at this point?**

P: I would think so. This is all my information. Also, there's no long a "sign in" button on top. There's a person's name "Jesse". So, yeah, I'd think I'm logged in. 

**M: Can you go back to the care notes and summaries page?**

P: (_clicked on "back to" breadcrumbs"_) This feels pretty intuitive to click on that for a website. 

**M: How can you learn more about that appointment?**

P: I would just click into details of AVS again, but I don't think it would give me more information than what I have already looked at. 

# Task 2: Copay & Claims 

P: I would go to Billing or Health care. (_clicked on "VA benefits and health care"_) I'd view all health care since the main navigation doesn't tell me bills and payments. (_browse and scroll on the all health care page_) Ok, here's "Pay your VA copay bill". That was a few clicks to get here. It's buried down on the website, but I also see it'd be hard to have everything on the home page. 

**M: What do you expect to see?**

P: It would take me to a payment portal, and it'd tell me how much I own and tells me how I can take care of the bills. 

**M: Do you think this link will take you to that?**

P: Yeah, I'd think so. It's the only thing about payments I see so far. 

**M: What makes you say it's different?**

P: The Pay.gov logo and the logo is also on the top and bottom of the page. 

**M: How do you feel about that?**

P:  Mixed feeling, if I was working for a commercial, I would pay on their website. I know this is still a government website, so I still have confidence. This is something I used to deal with in the defense finance department in the military, and sometimes I had to call 3 places within the same department. 

# Task 3a: Medical Records - blood test results

(_click on the main navigation, and click on check lab and test results_) I used to work in health care, so this result kind of makes sense, but the abb. still doesn’t mean anything. I can see the results, but it doesn’t explain much of what it means. It’s not helpful without interpretations. 

# Task 3b: Medical Records to secure messaging

(_click on message on the secondary nav._) Ok, so I'd start a new message. This is intuitive. I'd make sure I send it to the right person, and here are the steps to tell me what to do. It’s pretty simple.

# Task 4: Appointments

P: I wonder what appointments do (_look at Appointments on secondary nav., and click_). Ah, yes, this is where all the appointments are. (_click into details_) The titles don’t match (refers to the title on the appt list and the title on the details page). This would confuse me if I forget which appointment I look at the details for. 

**M: How would you get back?** 

P: (_click "back to") 

**M: What does "requests" mean?** 

P: I didn’t notice requests until you said it. Requests mean appointments requested but not booked yet, like pending. Not sure how that would function. 

# My VA vs. MHV

**M: How do you go back home page from here?** 

P: (_click VA logo, and go to My VA as directed_) It's all commonly used functions on this page. If there are some ways to let people know everything is on this page so don't have to struggle to navigate the whole site, that'd be very helpful. It's really nice since everything on here is everything we have done so far. 

**M: Can you click on MHV and what do you think of it?** 

P: This looks pretty simple. I'd like to customize it. It's helpful to have disability on the top because I don't use it now, so It'd be nice to have some ability to reorder the benefits. 

**M: How would you explain these two pages?** 

P: My VA is a snapshot of everything. Having all the information in one place is really nice. If I knew these two pages, I would navigate primarily between My VA and MHV. It’s a lot easier. Instead of doing the way how I navigated so far.

**M: Thoughts on "VA benefits and health care"?** 

P: I wouldn’t necessarily want to click on anything else. I start on the main nav., based on past experience because I have found things there before. If I didn’t pay attention, I wouldn’t even notice benefits. Then I click on it, I see “Oh, there are lots of other benefits besides health care”

# Priority Groups

P: I wouldn’t even look up VA priority group. I have no idea where it would be.
