**M: would you mind signing in?**

P: Sure 

**M: what would you be looking for now about claim?**

P: Check your status or disability claim…. I guess I would have to sign in [note: now she is signed in as Judy]

**M: Why?**
 
P: Oh there’s the claims … I ‘d click view detail but that wasn’t right.  I don’t know where to go 

**M: Go up a little bit… do you see where it says check you claims and appeals and its underlined? What do think that is?**

P: That’s what i clicked on earlier and i thought it was …

**M: if you go up a little bit, can you explain what that is or does?**

P: That should take me to the beginning of myhealthevet

**M: what do think that judy is?**

P: It should take me to different places in the app… like refills, messages

**M: Would you mind clicking where it says judy?] **

P: i did

**M: would you mind signing in**

_[note: now signed in]_

**M: if you had to describe what is my va?**

P: It would be an introduction to the different places I could go… if you have a questions about the website or if you have a problems with the website anything going on with the va
[myheathevet] pharmacy refills, messages… i usually go for messages and pharmacy refills 

**M: what about profile what would that bring up?**

P: My name and address and email and maybe social security number

**M: So info about you?**

P: Yes

**M: ...explore the ‘myva’ page what is it?**

P: It looks like it has notifications… it has news about my debt… it looks like it has all the helpful info… you can start looking here to go to the next step… i see refills and i can request that i would go to myheatlhtyvet… oh you can submit travel reimbursement.. I have trouble with that…. So this looks like an overview of evertyhign you need to know [what do you mean?] like notification, like i can click on one page and it will tell me where to go next 

**M: having now seen this page, what would you expect when you click judy?**

P: Wow I mean evertyhings on the first page…unless it’s just another way to know to get to other places like yaou go to… oh this is nice 

**M: what makes yo usay that?**

P: Everythings in order its easier to see … I don’t think I’ve ever seen medical supplies and equimet

**M: myva page and mhv page differences?**

P: uhh … i think va page shows you more like claims and stuff like that so if i had this i would go to myva first if i couldnt find there i would have to go to myhealthevet 

**M: couldnt find what exactly?**

**M:: There’s the blue my va under did you see that?**

P: Yes

**M: what did you think it would do?**

P: It would go back a page

_[[on pay.gov]]_

**M: what is this page?**

P: Paygov… where you set up your baking information or your debit card so I guess thats the first step…so is paygov

P: So it took me to another area 

**M: how do you feel about that?**

P: Youd think it would say you’re getting moved to or another stie of the va

**M: how would you get back if you filled out the form and paid?**

P: Maybe menu? Click on menu?


# Priority Groups

**M: What do you think "VA priority group" refers to?**

P: Umm to me it would be everything you need to know [about what?] different things on the website [what kind of things?] like uh appts uh messages refills instead of my va it would put the other one 

**M: With that in mind, where would you expect to find information about your personal priority group on this website?**

P: Id go back to myva…

**M: why?**

P: myhealthevet to me that means everything you should already know with myva its a place where if i don’t if i don’t have any assigned info then i would go to my va 

**M: (Direct to MHV on vA.gov landing page) Where would you expect to find information about your personal priority group on this page?  If it were on this page where would you expect to see it?**

P: After medical supplies and equipment… 

**M: why?**

P: Most people are already on myhealthyet if you put it first umm…. I feel like it should go at the end

**M: is that bc it doesn’se seem important enough ot put at the top or it doesn fit the boxes?’**

P: It doesn’t fit any other boxes.  I would put it under myvahealth benefits bc you don’t need a box ou need a site that tells you all that info.
