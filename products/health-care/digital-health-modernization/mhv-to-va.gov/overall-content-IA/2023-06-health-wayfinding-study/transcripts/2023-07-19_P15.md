# Warm-up questions
**What kind of device are you using today?** (_Computer / Tablet / Smartphone_)

Computer (Apple)

**What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA?**

Disability -> adding on wife as dependent. Participant is wife of Veteran (caregiver?). Used to check status of claims open on VA.gov. Husband is in hospital for 3 months, has memory issues. Prior to hospitalization, used VA.gov and MHV together, but now that he's in hospital, mostly participant (wife). 

# Task 1: AVS task

P: i think I would go to benefits and healthcare. Glad you're working on this bc find that very difficult. Don' tknow if you're familiar with My Chart - that to me is the ideal model for finding AVS. Have hard time with VA. Click on Benefits and Healthcre (_menu_), go to health care, go to Manage your health (_reads options_). Um, I don't know where I woudl go. I'm looking for something that says After Visit Summary. My husband has just started using VA healtahcare recently. Used to using My Chart and they link... I find it very hard to locate AVS for a particular specialist. I'm very used to using these websites and teh VA's is very difficult for me to navigate. 

So I'd go to health benefits and then, the prescriptions is right up there, that's easy, I don't wnat to message anyone, dont' want to schedule. Yeah, I don't know. That's a problem for me. 

**M: You're looking for AVS?** 

P: Or the notes. 

**M: Where do you think that would be under? Where else?**

P: (_Husband joins._) He's teh actual Veteran, used to use togehte. Um, youknow, would expect first tab would be Manage your health, and right after refill your presecripton or send a message to yoru team, probably between schedule and manage appts and view lab results, should be link to - I just call it AVS bc that's what I'm used to My Chart calling it, but drs notes. 

**M: Would you mind making this menu disappear? Oky. Do you usually sign in? At what point do you sign in?**

P: Immediately when I open the site. 

**M: Where do you think you are? VA website usually go?**

P: It looks not exactly like what we log into. But I have it bookmarked in my favorite spots I look for. I click on VA and right away syas Sign in, have login saved in my laptop and desktop. And so just click in, login, don't do anything w/o logging in. 

**M: Could you show me how you login?**

_P logs in._ 

P: (_Describes logging in process._) 

**M: Just to remind you again, it's a prototype, that's why it signs in. So where go from here now that signed in?**

P: I woudl go under healthcare. I like how laid out (_My VA_). Well, I don't want to scheudle or manage my appts (_Scrolls_). I guess VA Medical Records... I guess. (_Lands on Secure Messaging inbox; M directs out._)

P: (_Back on My VA_) Again, I find these categories not quite what I"m looking for, so I guess get your Medical Records and labs and tests (_again takes back to Inbox._). Oh here's MR down here (_secondary nav_). Care notes and sumamries, that's where I'd go. This is much better. Oh my god - this would be perfect! Primary care AVS. (_Husband tells her to click on details to see if info correct. P reads details._) And then your treatment plan, great (_clicks dropdown_). Do this! Cuz this is the info we're always looking for. We have short memories and can't always hear waht the doctor said. This is absolutely what we're looking for. 

**M: So now that see treatment plan, do you think would wnat/expect to read details of appt form this page?**

P: Um, yeah, I went down (_Scrolls treatment plan page_), let's see, let me go back up again (_Scrolls up and then down. Tries to click on other dropdowns._)

**M: What looking for right now?**

P: Actual notes from doctor, live notes. Mr Irving, I don't know, discussed his Parkinsons and gate freeze and recommended that talk to his specialist or something like that. If this is the PCP. 

**Expect AVS in details link or scroll down to AVS page?**

**Blue Button**

# Task 2a: Medical Records

P: I'd go to MR and lab tests (_clicks fromMHV landing page_). 

**M: how read more?**

P: I'd open up the details and hopefully would have here (_Scrolls_). 

# Task 2b: Medical Records to Secure Messaging

P: I woudl go to messages (_clicks on side nav; gets to SM, scrolls up and down Messages landing page_). I'm looking for Message your doctor. I think I saw that on a previous page but don't know where... Oh, sorry! I just say "Start a new message". I overlooked it, sorry! I would make that more prominent. (_clicks on start a new message._)

**M: Would send message from here?**

P: Yes, that would be good. 

# Task 3: Appointments

P: Iw ould go to Appt (_cliks on secondary nav_), and I clikc on details, says it's Puget sound. Looks like there's a direction link. 

**M: Go back to appt list section from here?**

(_What did she do?_)

**M: What does request mean here?**

P: Um make an appt? To me, I like upcoming and past. I would take the "s" off Request - would think it would Request an Appt, if that's what it's supposed to mean. 

**M: IF clicked on, what expect?**

P: I'm not sure what would happen after that but would have list of doctors, his primary and specialist names and depts, would click on that, nad then would think there's be something like "Schedule an Appt" and possibly give you dates they were available. Something like that. 

**M: What do you think husband?**

P husband: As long as you keep my wife from swearing at his appt. I would think it's Scheuldle an appt. 

P: I think it's vague, could be requesting anything. 

P husband: Well you're in the appt folder, so should relate to that. 

**Understanding Requests**

# Task 4: Copay & Claims

P: So I'd go back (_looks at Menu_), and I'd go to Disability - eligibility, Check your claims statusa or appeal, we've done that alot. (_Goes to page_). Would sign in. And would (_scrolls Check your status page_)... I don't do anything on my phone. Would go down to Claim fro compensation, read all the notes and details (_Clicks link, goes to your compensation claim_). 

**M: Is this telling your the status?**

P: Yeah, it's saying in review mode. 

**M: How check copay, or anything owe for past appts?**

P: I Would go back to healthcare (_Menu, looks through options_). I have to tell you, I don't know cuz we have no copays and don't pay for anything. So not something I've done and usually there's a prominent tab on other websites. I don't know where I would do that here. I would expect under healthcare that there would be a tab/link that woulds ay billing or copays or whatever. 

**M: Where do you think you would find that information?**

P: Let me kgo back to the (_Clicks back_). Let me go back to home (_home page_). Benfits and healthare (_menu, scrolls through links on helathcare menu_), I would expect to see tab under Manage your health that would say Billing. 

**M: So if checking anything owed for past appt, should be under health?**

P: Absolutely. This is basically saying "get benefits, apply, how to apply," and then manage your health - would expect bottom tab to be billing. 

**M: Minimize menu? Thank you. Do you see My VA on the right side? Click on that?**

P: Oh, under healthcare (_on My VA_), oh OUtstanding debts? 

**M: What think about OD?**

P: I think this is not clear. I wouldn't go to My VA because if I'm looking for something related to just healthcare, would look to helathcare. Wouldn't go to My VA claimsa nd appeals. Would expect it to be under healthcare... Yeah, I think copya nad bills to be under healthcare. Not sure what else pay for at VA. I find it difficult to find that. 

**M: Click back. What do you think My VA?**

P: Everything that's available to you under the VA. Benefits, basically, it's about all your benefits. Claims, appeals, healthcare. Again, outstanding debts. Not sure if VA charges for anything under healthcare. Doesnt' seem like logical place for HC bills to be paid. Seemslike very generalized section. Would expect any copays that were due to be in healthcare. 

**M: Directs to MHV landing page.**

P scrolls down.: OKay payments - yes that's very easily found. 

**M: Like to hear your thoughts on what you think MY VA is vs. MHV and how explain that to another Veteran?**

P: The VA benefits gives you all the informtion about the vraious benefits trhough VA, and MHV is the electronic health records. So generally if looking for health stuff, click over to MHV immediately. I kind of like, would like to see, the VA section encompasses all benefits sort of informational. ANd then health - go straight to in order to refill prescriptions, AVS, appts. That should be... We alwyas look for AVS so would like to see... WHat I have seen is pages and pages and pages, very repeetivie. Would like to see page just with AVS. 

**M: What think about this page?**

P: I think it's good. Schedule appts, prescriptions, track prescriptions, payments, send a mesasge, medical supplies - all good. Under records, to me "Review your medical records" is diff than AVS. That to me means every record of every test or visit ever had. But think page is nicely laid out. 

**M: HOw pay?**

P: Would go to pay your copay (_lands on Pay.gov flow_). Would click on preview the form, fill all stuff out. 

**M: Where now?**

P: Same website, just a category to pay my bill. Not a different website. 

**M: What makes you say that?**

P: Well, because I'm on MHV and this is like a subcategory. Can send a messag,e order prescription, or pay copay. If on another website, get a little popup saying leaving MHV and going to payment website. 

# My VA vs. MHV

**M: How woudl you organize the diff sections?**

P: I think claims and appeals up top is importnadn and logical place to start. Healthcare is good that second category. I don't kow what other debts there could be if there's more debts beyond healthcare. If there aren't, would have bills money due under healthcare, but if other kinds of debts then Outstnading debts good category. Benefits/payments is good, then apply for VA benefits. Yeah, I think it's... oh I see, under Outstanding debts has copay bills, yeah, that's okay, I didn't look to the right. There must be other debts to the VA you can incur other than health. It's pretty clear, I like it, I like the layout. And I think they're in the order of importance. 

**M: So you were on MHV earlier. What think about all healthcare stuff on MHV compared to healthcare section on My VA?**

P: Um prescriptions (_reads categories_). I think this is... I like this layout better than what currently is. The only thing I would add is AVS under MR. Rathert han Review your Medical Records, cuz that makes you click at least twice, I would say "Recent Visit" or... waht does My Chart say? I forgot. Visit Summary, After Visit Summary. To me, when I think of MR, I think that's everything he's ever done or tests that he's had. I think would be easier just to have category under MR at top AVS. And then review youre entire medical records. 

P husband: Date range or whole summary?

P: Oh, that's good. (_discuss BB issues._)

# Priority Groups

Never hearad of PG. 

**M What refers to?**

P: Uh, VA Priority... I have no idea. Like you're a VIP? (_laughs_) I don't know. (_Husband also doesn't know._)

**M provides definition.**

P: Oh, does thta have to do with the percentage of your... I think I read that. Husband has 100% so he's in Group A. 

**M: You're right, has to do wtih disability rating. Can change if income changes.**

P: Oh I thought it had just to do with your disability percentage rating. 

**M: Yeah, both. With that in mind, where would you expect to find that information?**

P: Oh, um... Hmmm. Well, probably - this is just for healthcare, right? I think it's just for healthcare. I think I would find it back under "VA benefits and healthcare" (_Menu_), um... 

**M: It'd be your personal PG.**

P husband: Ther'es nothing that relates to your personal PG, so hard to determine. 

P: Yeah, I don't... Let me think about this. I think it would be under VA benefits and healthcare (_Menu_) and then... (_reads options in menu_). Hmmm.. Explore VA benefits and healthcare (_bottom of home page_). Would be under this Explore VA benefits and health care, under these icons, and then Priority Group. 

**M: Expect to see right away?**

P: I think so? Or maybe under healthcare. Because I'm assuming that only applies to healthcare. Honestly never thought about that. When got disability letter, said 100%. (_Scrolls VA helathcare page from Menu_)
