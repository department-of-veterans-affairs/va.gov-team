# Warm-up questions
* **What kind of device are you using today?** (_Computer / Tablet / Smartphone_)
  * P:  Computer
* **What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA?**
  * P: I use a VA loan for my house and then I use education benefits to get a degree

# Task 1: AVS task
* **M: Where would you expect to find information from your doctor about next steps in your care?** 
* P: Let's see, I think I would have to sign in. Because if its specifically me its hopefully not public I would sign in and get a different screen?
* **M: How would you sign in?**
* P: Um this button right here (*clicks sign-in button*)
* **M: Okay, go ahead and click it. This is a fake sign-in page so feel free to just click anywhere on these pages.** 
* P: Let's see umm maybe this one My HealtheVet (*referring to the sign-in options on the modal*).
* **M: is that the one you use normally?** 
* P: No, (*laughs*) I usually see a link and I am not sure what these are. Are all 4 of these logins the same?
* **M: No, they are different**
* P: Okay, so I clicked in and now I can see that my name is Hector Garcia. Right?
* **M: That's correct.** 
* P: Okay, so I see some claims. I don't want claims, I'm looking for something from my doctor. Oh wait wait here we go. But I don't want the apointment. And I know I don't want claims. But I'm not looking for an appointment I do want healthcare. Oh wait I do want "Get your VA medical care and lab test results"
* P: Okay  care notes! I would go to this area and try to find the right specialist. I don't know what specialist but I would find that thing there.
* **M: Lets assume its the first one**
* P: Okay, I would click this and then select details
* **M: why did you select details?**
* P: Because if I saw this person I would expect to see details about it here. I was diagnosed with hypertension and I see all my vitals here. But wait, maybe I am in the wrong spot.
* **M: why do you say that?**
* P: Because I don't see anything about what the doctor is telling me to do. Is that what I'm looking for?
* **M: You are looking for information about the next steps in your care.**
* P:  I don't see it. I do see procedures. But are these procedures I already had? Or ones I need to get? 
* **M: That's a good question**
* P: Apparently at that visit I was given acetaminophen, so I am thinking....I am not sure what that means either. That's a little sketchy to me. I am thinking those were ordered during this appointment but then I'm reading ......Umm...so...
* **M: Out of curiousity what kind of words are you looking for?**
* P: Well I am looking for it to say "medications ordered for this visit" but it says "medications ordered for administration in clinic" which is confusing. That is stupid I can take my own tablet.  Probably because I am a little bit confused right now, I would click this underscored term thing here (*referring to additional info component*), which when I click that it says "Status: hold" what does that mean? Will they mail it to me? How am I getting it? Am I already on acetaminophen or is my specialist telling me that I nees to start taking it?"
* P: Oh wait, here! sorry
* P: Okay, so rheumatology is going to contact me, imaging is going to contact me for MRI scans. Okay. So here we got new orders from this appointment. Consultation, okay good.  Imaging, okay good. But lab/tests is confusing. The bolding part [about fasting] feels like it should be at the bottom in another section where there a list of actions for me. (continues reading)
* **M: Do you feel like this is a good summary from your doctor of next steps in your care? Or are you still confused?**
* P: I'm not really confused, but it seems like it should be clear next steps for me to do. Got it. But the wroding is kind of weird with a lot of bold text in one spot. 
* P: These bolding things seem to me to be highlghts from the doctor of what I need to do with what it means. Wording could be different on meds because this is the consultation so yeah I get it only the changes to my medication. SO renewed to me means meds I was already on. I don't know what H6 means, it should say refill/renew. So to me this means I was on on 'em already and the doctor says yes I"ll give you refills. 
* P: So this also means I was ordered to get a blood check on October 6th so maybe it should have an appointment or something I need to go and get, but I don't know if it is something I already did? Or do I need to do it? 
* P: It's a good summary but the headers aren't all the same, so the ordering to me needs to be clear. The future actions I need to take. 
* P: Flu shot? Yeah no I'm not doing that I hate those. I think the information is good but I don't feel there is a good summary of my specialist visit that tells me what happened at that appointment. Like - we reviewed your blood pressure and decided we need to monitor it, so go and see the nurse. And then there should be heres these to do list items that I should do next. 
* **M: That makes sense, you are looking for the details of the appointment.**
* P: Yeah, exactly. I want to see a high-level thing about the appointment before the other details.

# Task 4: Copay & Claims (task asked out of order)
* **M: Okay now we need to you check the status of a claim and ....disability**
* * P: I remember when I logged in I saw disability, how do I get back to that?
* **M: Well, how would you do that?**
* P: Hmm...well when I first hit your prototype it had a page...it had healthcare but it also had status about disability or something like that. Where was that splash page? How do I get to that? 
* **M: well it looks like when we went into full-screen moe the back button disappeared, so we may need to hit esdcape to go back to the view that shows that back button. The arrows are like a back button on a normal website.** 
* P: (*hits escape to exit out of fullscreen mode with prototype and clicks back arrow to go back*) I'm in a little oodle oop here. Hmm. Okay, there it is "Claims and appeals" (*clicks MyVA*)
* P: Okay, so here's where I would go. 
* **M: Can I ask what made yo uclick MyVA?**
* P: Because nothing else makes sense. I don't want to find a VA location, but I am thinking these two things are for just me [MyVA and My HealtheVet] so I thought I would click in to those. And there, there's the debt thing. That al makes sense to me. And then this My HealtheVet, I would think that would probably be the same thing as this healthcare area. I am looking for the status of my disability thing?
* **M: Yes, checking to see the status of a disability claim and if you owe any payments for past appointments.**
* P: Okay I am going to claims and appeals and looking for the status of my claim. Okay, so this is the status. The ygot my claim and I am thinking hte VA is doing hte initial review, somebody there. And then, okay, so...now this conflicts in my head with the healthcare thing about getting my blood pressure. That one said October 13 and now this one says October 30. So I am waiting there. 
* P: Okay, so it is in the evidence gathering phase, but then it says we closed...so I am not sure if there is some action up i nteh air but I am not sure who is doing what. Is it the VA's action or my action? 
* P: Now I am going to go back. I need to go back where I was (*clicks back button*). ooooh shoot, I got ot the wrong spot (*clicks back button several times to return to home page - then clicks into MyVA*). Ooh I got overpaid. Oh no, wait - that's bad, I owe money. Wait, do I? I don't know why this would be a debt. I guess this is a VA debt? 
* P: Okay, so about $300 has been outstanding for about a year since October 2022. 
* **M: How would you pay that?**
* P: I would click details. Looks like I went to the hospital last June. Now pay your bill. Wow, I didn't know the VA had all this. Okay, so I would click pay your copay bill. (*Clicks into Pay.gov*) I would go to the form and put my data in. I would need to find my account number. I'm not sure what this means 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 
* **M: This is as far as this prototype goes. Where do you think you are right now?**
* P: I'm in deep. There is some form with all of my information and I need to enter my credit card information. No wait that doesn't make sense. It has a payment option at the bottom. I would think the payment would already be prefilled with my information but I don't see that. Who am I paying? 
* **M: Well, you are paying the VA but are you on the same website?**
* P: Well I shouldn't be [paying the VA], shouldn't I be paying Tampa? 
* **M: Well, yeah the VA clinic at Tampa**
* P: This can't be the same because why are they asking for all of this? It should be pre-populated. It should have more information here [in order to pay]. There should be more. Like [I expect to see] the little box for visa, mastercard, amount. 
* **M: Sounds like you are interpreting this website as a VA website that should already have your information** 
* P: Yeah, I am thinking this is a VA site that has my data and I can click this and give them my money. Is that not the case?
* **M: Well, this is a payment website external to the VA that federal websites use for payment**
* P: Well now that you say that it bugs me. I see the VA logo in here [on the Pay.gov site] and it didn't tell me I was leaving the VA. 
* **M: How do you go back to the VA website?**
* P: (*clicks back arrow in prototype*) This is the VA website. This is where I found that I had money owed. 
* **M: Mhmm yep. Okay. Switching gears again.** 

# Task 2a: Medical Records
# Task 2b: Medical Records to Secure Messaging
* **M: Let's say your doctor put you on a blood thinner and you need to see the results of those tests. Where would you go to find the results of those tests?**
* P: (*clicks into and scans My HealtheVet landing page*) hmm I don't see labs and tests. I only see 6 boxes and none of those talk about any kind of lab results. So maybe medical records? (*clicks into it*) Oh, look I guessed right. I see lab and test results on the left. And I click into it, and oh look, a blood test. So I clicked into it. Wait, it doesn't have the details. (*scrolls down further*) Oh, yes it does - I just have to keep scrolling. 
* **M: let's say you are confused and one of your tests confuses you and you want to ask your doctor about it. How would you go about asking your doctor?**
* P: I would go to messages. Ooh I have 15 unread messages. So if I have a question I would go to start a new message and would go to my medical team and click in the dropdown whoever I was trying to go to, hopefully my doctors name. And I would go down and send them a message. 

# Task 3: Appointments
* **M: How would you figure out where to go using this website?** 
* P: Do I already have an appointment?
* **M: You already have an appointment booked but you don't remember where it is - imagine it is so new to you that you don't even remember the name of where you are going.**
* P: there it is, I would go to myhealthevet appointment, and then I would find the thing where I don't know where it is. So let's pretend its primary care with Dr. Nutt. I would assume it is under details. And there it is I see a directions link and I click it and it even tells you right where it is. Boom, that's what I would do.
* **M: Now that you're here, you want to look to a list of your appointments. How would you get back to that larger list?** 
* P: I would click back to appointments up here (*clicks back breadcrumb*) and boom done
* **M: Can you tell me why you did that?** 
* P: Umm...I drilled down on July 1 to the details of the map, so I would just go back on my computer to the previous screen or I saw this little thing up here in the left corner that says back, instead of a back button, it says back to all the appointments.

**Understanding Requests**

* **M: If you see underneath appointments it says start scheduling. Under that it says "Requests" - it doesn't work if you click it in this prototype. But what do you think you would see there?**
* P: I have two thoughts - I think it would be appointments I requested last time I was at the doctor. It could be active instead of passive and I could click it and request an appointment with somebody. Actually I think its passive, I think its requests that I have made for apopintments in the future. 
* **M: What would be the difference between requests and upcoming appointments?**
* P: upcoming to me would be actual appointments with time, date, etc. But requests are something that the clinic has to get back with me and it is a pending action.
* **M: Now that you have spent some time on this website, if you could design this the way you wanted, how would you organize the different benefits**
* P: So that's where I would look for benefits information. Well now its not me anymore. 
* **M: In the real website it would be you [your account information].**
* P: The bottom in this dark blue stuff (looking at footer) that's not me that's just generic VA stuff.
* **M: It's more in general if you were setting this up, how would you organize disability resources, education resources, health resources. How would you set that up?** 
* P: Hmm..I would have another button there. I'm not sure I'd have "About VA" that is confusing. Maybe VA resources would be useful? Or maybe under VA resources & healthcare I'd have another dropdown with education resources or housing resources or whatever bold topics for VA resources. What I saw down here *(scans to footer*) is good - all of these resources would be great to see but they're at the bottom. So I get that I'm in MyVA, but I don't really get why all these resources are at the very bottom. Because to me now I clicked MyVA and everything I see should only be my stuff at this point. I don't care about everybody else's stuff and what the world provides. I want to only see my stuff. Put everything for the VA on the left for everybody, and on the right it's only stuff for me for myVA. 
* **M: If you were to describe these sections to someone else how would you describe them?**
* P: I would say MyVA is my information and debts and benefits, etc. All of this is my specific data with regard to my interactions with the VA. And myHelatheVet is all my specific interactions with regards to medical with the VA 

# Priority Groups

* **M: Have you ever heard of the term VA priority group?**
* P: I have...I am thinking...it was a long time ago when I retired and when my husband first retired. I think was it was based on disability or something. And we were in different priotity groups, and it had to do with disability or something. And How disabled you are. Like I am more diabled than my husband - that sounds terrible. But it has something to do with the VA and groups on who gets to be seen first. And has to do with how much you have to pay. So if you are first priority you get to be seen first? So they are getting the first group in first? 
* **M: [explains priority groups]**
* P: Oh, I didn't know that. why wouldn't that information be on the MyVA then? 
* **M: Is this where you would put it?**
* P: well, maybe in the dropdown my personal data shows like my address and phone number and maybe my priority group # with some kind of explanation about priority groups so I know what it means. And maybe you can update it if info changes and you can let people know your priority group has changed. Maybe you changed from 70% to 80% disability and now you are priority group 2 instead of 3. 
* **M: It sounds like you would put it...**[check transcript..lost track of this sentence]
* P: No, I would put it in MyVA. IT's not an "or" - if it's about me it should be in the "My" section. 
* **M: Would you put it on this page (My HealtheVet)**
* P: No this doesn't look like information that manages my healthcare so I wouldn't put it on this page.

# Wrap-up
* **M: Is there anything else you think I should have asked you about that I didn't?**
* P: No, I learned from this. I am going to be careful in the future interacting with the VA when I left the site and went to a treasury website to pay something. Especially the IRS. that is like swearing and throwing a bomb. People have things going off in their heads about that. I am not going to that site for the IRS to take my data and come to take my money away. Because now they can see my benefits and the IRS can tap into the VA and get my benefits and disability and no, they are not doing that. 
* **M: is there anything you don't want me to icnlude that you said?**
* P: No, I think I was pretty good about not swearing but if I did you can take that out. 
* P: Thank you guys. I think this will be very interesting. It will be interesting to get an older Veteran experience. I have some website experience and know how to do some of this. But I run the military women across the nation group. But there are only a few of us that have actually smart phones and know how to point and click. A lot of our Veterans don't know how to call or text or check any of the apps. Those are the Veterans that are important to reach. 
* **M: If you think there is anyone who would be willing to sign up for these sessions, please let them know to sign up with us so we can get their experience as we continue to work on this.** 
* P: Was there some kind of gift for this? Did you say that?
* **M: Yes, as a part of doing this we will send a $50 giftcard for your participation today. The recruitment partners will send this through your email.**
* P: That's good to know that they need emails to send out in order to be part of this. Some of them don't have email accounts. 
* **M: I'll let you go thank you again so much.**
* P: Thank you for doing this - for Veterans adn on behalf of all of us. Thanks for making it better for us
* **M: Thanks for your feedback.**
* P: have a good day, bye.
