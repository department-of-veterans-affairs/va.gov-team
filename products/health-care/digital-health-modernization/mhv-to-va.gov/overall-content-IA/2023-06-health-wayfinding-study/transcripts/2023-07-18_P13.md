(_Confused by prototype._) Go to menu... Looking for where to go to helath records. _Continues scrolling on My VA._ The screen I'm loooking at here doesnt' look like what comes up when I actually do it. 

**M: What do you think this page is?** 

P: This is like a snapshot of what would cover me. But when I go to MHV, it doesn't come up like this. Have to go to separate links. Okya, Refill and track prescriptions. On MHV, go to menu and says "Pharmacy", has refill list, stuff liket hat. Otehr choice is SM, which is best way to get to messages. Choices. Like compose a message, etc. And I thnk if I want to look at my health records, takes to BB access. Do that. 

**M: Can you get to BB records from here?**
