# Task 1: AVS task

**M: Where would you expect to find information from your doctor about the next steps in your care?** 

P: (_Scroll_) I don't see anything. I would search "report". 

**M: What would you normally do?**

P: Let's log into MHV. Usually, after I log in with MHV login information, it lands on the MHV page, and it doesn't show VA.gov. 

**M: Okay (on My VA now), now what would you do from here?** 

P: Let's click on the menu and see what options it gives us

**M: Why menu?** 

P: It should give me overview of everything that's available. I would go to "VA benefits and health care" because it's for my doctor. (_click health care_) I'm looking for notes doctor put in, but don't see anything. Then, maybe send a secure message. 

**M: What else would you do?**

P: (_scroll_) Let's click on "Get your VA medical records and lab and test results". 

**M: Where are you now?** 

P: On medical records, then I'd go to Care summaries and notes. 

**M: What are you looking at here?** 

P: 15 records here, which I hope the most recent should be the first one. Then I'd click on details to see the notes. 

**M: What are you looking at here?** 

P: It tells me when I went and which clinic I went to. (_sroll_) Under the time (9:50), it says details. Click on details it should give me notes. 

**M: What else can you learn?** 

P: Labs...everything happened during the visit. (_click on treatment plan_) This is not notes though, just basic information.

# Task 2: Copay & Disability claims

P: Well, that's where I have problems with you guys. I want to get back to the home page, the main screen. 

**M: How would you do that?** 

P: Well, I guess I have to go to the menu, then search "claims". Hopefully shows me different types of claims. 

**M: You want to go back to the home page?** (_click VA logo_)

P: Yes, but not everyone knows to click on the VA logo to go to the home page. (_scroll down, and click on "check claims" on the top tasks_) 

**M: Can you check if you own any money?**

P: (_click on the back button on the browser_) Back to the home page. Click "review payments" on top of tasks. Ok, they say there are no records. Go back to home. I don't see anything on home page, I'd search. MHV doesn't have it. 

**M: Looking at My VA, do you think you can find it?** (_click My VA_)

P: (_scroll_) See overpayment debts, in the menu, it should link here. Search doesn't work if you don't search right words. 

# Task 3: Lab test results

P: I'd click on the menu, then search. Go to "VA benefits and health care", then "view lab and test". Why do I have to sign in again? (_sign in_). Go to details. 

**M: How would you ask a question?** 

P: Send a message right here. (_click compose a message_) in the information box. 

**M: Can you send a message from here?** 

P: I wouldn't send a message because it doesn't say secure message. But, I would select my doctor on the form. 

# Task 4: Appointment

P: Back to MHV, and (_click schedule and manage appointments_), then (_click details_)

**M: Can you go back to the appointment section?** 

P: (_click back button on browser_) 

**M: What requests mean?** 

P: Nothing, I don't know what that means, maybe a referral from a doctor. 

**M: Any other feedback?** 

P: I'd go to go back to the home page easily. The menu should have different areas and more of breakdown and contains everything. Search doesn't always work. Benefits should be separated from health care.
