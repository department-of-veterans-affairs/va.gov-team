# Task 1: AVS task

P: I guess I would log in... (_Logs in_) 

**M: Why click on MHV login?** 

P: More or less thew ay I get into My Health, then I would look for any specific research within that site. That's more or less thew ay I do things. But if there was a specific area outside of that, would have gone to that. But this is the way I do things. 

**M: Now logged in, where go?**

P: (_SCrolls down My VA_) I woudl go to the map site and type in that specific area. I would go to a site map, or if there's a site area within here, like a search engine is what I'm trying to say. 

**M What would you search?**

P: that's a good question. Specific area that I was supposed to be listening to that you told me to look for. I forgot it, sorry. (_At bottom of the page reading links._)

**M repeats task.**

_P continues scanning My VA._

**M: What are you trying to find?**

P: That area you said to go to. TBH, I'm having a hard time reading the fine print here.

**M: You can zoom in (_instructs_).**

**M: Do you usually use magnifier to read things on website?**

P: the three dots? Yes. More or less THB haven't been in here haven't been in here to navigate smoothly. It's more or less. I'm asking for some navigation help here. 

**M: You told me earlier that you would go on MHV, the health section of thew ebsite to look up the health stuff. And so from this page, the health section, do you think you can get to where you can read about next steps in your care?**

P: After navigating and getting to know the info, yes. But if a time crunch, will take me some time to findit. (_Sees Health care section of My VA_) Oh, there it is. It's got My VA, claims and appeals, healthcare for next appt - can look at that. Can look at any debts or bills that are outstanding. Got benefits and Apply for Benefits - got htat. 

**M: Wht think purpose of this page is?**

P: Point out diff areas for you, more or less. Feel like i'm trying to read right below My VA says "Go to...my profile" I can barely make that out. I'm having difficulty. Says "Manage all claims" right there. Healthcare - I can scheulde stuff and manage my appointments. 

**M: So do you think this page is giving you any info in the next steps in your care? Or how could navigate to that?**

P: I'm not finding it TBH. Not seeing it. 

**M: Okay. Could you scroll up a little bit? See MHV on top right corner? Click on that. Okay. Where now?**

P: (_SCrolls up and down._) Looks like landing area to go out and explore more options for you. Appointments, prescriptions, payments, messages, yeah. This helps a little bit better. 

**M: What do you think this helps?**

P: I can actually read what the stuff has to say. My Appts - can read a lot easier. Can see any Prescriptions, see what I"m on. MR. Medical Supplies. 

**M: So from this page, do you think you can find any information that could potentially take you to find what doctor said about next steps in care?**

P: Quickly looking it over for you.  Trying to navigate (_scrolls to bottom, seems to be reading content._). 

**M: What are you looking for.**

P: MR - never done that. Maybe Review Medical Records? I don't know? 

**M: Feel free to click in.**

P: (_Clicks into MR landing apge, scrolls up and down reading content. Clicks on Care notes and summaries. Reads content._) Okay, guess I might be in the right area. (_Clicks on detials for Primary care AVS. Scrolsl down page._) Okay, I must be in the right area. Geez, I still can't read it. Reasonf or appt - hypertension? Something chronic pain? Okay. I'm going to assume I'm in the right area. 

**M: Do you think you are able to find the next steps for your care in this AVS page? I can help you read it out loud if you want.**

P: (_scrolls up and down page._) From looking at summary, says AVS - medications ordered, I guess, your treatmnet plan forom this appointment. Okay, I'll close that (_tries to close summary. Click son TP dropdown after prompted by M. Reads content._) 

**M: Do you think that tells you about what to do in your care?**

P: quickly reading it? I would assume yes. But I would have to read it further to say yes or no. 

**M: that's oaky, don't have to read farther. Expect to get back to details of appt?**

P: Yeah, I'd have to get back to Care summaries and notes? I could possibly navigate back but doing so quickly for first time, would take me a while to get there. Would find my way back. I could attempt it. 

**M: Mainly curious if this page tells you enough about the appt that you'd like to know, and if not, how would you like to find out if you'd like to know more about your appointment?**

P: Yeah, I would assume so, yeah. (_Tries to click back._) It has notes about apt, plans from appt moving forward, what plans are moving forward it looks like. But like I said, I'd have to read it further to understand that. 

**Expect AVS in details link or scroll down to AVS page?**

**Blue Button**

# Task 2a: Medical Records

_P clicks into My VA. Scrolls down. Clicks on MHV._

**M: Any words looking for? Anything confusing you?**

_P scrolls MHV landing page.**

P: Not a prescription, not appts, messages maybe? 

**M: Why messages?**

P: Maybe emailed me the results. Just assuming. Wouldn't be in the prescriptions, not refilling anything, not tracking. Not allergies, not payments. Not ordering supplies. Maybe Review Medical Records or Inbox. Those art he ones I would look at. (_Clicks MR._) There you go, Lab and test results, there go you. I want to go back (_clicks undo, bakc on landing page._) That doesn't... (_hovers over MR._) The wording on it - says MR. After exploring it, would help with navigation of it, just says MR and assuming or guessing that's where it is. Click on that, that's where lab/test area. (_Clicks L&T link._) Now I know where the path is, I'm more familair with it, it's less frustrating and stuff. 

**M: Could you click on the details and seee if you can learn more abou tit.**

(_P clicks on details. Reads content, scrolls down._) Oh test results, there we are. 

# Task 2b: Medical Records to Secure Messaging

_P clicked on - don't know._ 

P: That's where person would need to contact doctor, categories (_reads SM content_). 

# Task 3: Appointments

_P looks at top menu._ Probably click on Find a VA Location. 

**M: What expect to see after clikco nthat.**

P: Probably screen, type in location, Beaver Dam VA in Wisconsin - hopefully gives you address or number to call. 

**M: Let's say you don't know name of medical center, just have upcoming appt with specialist. How even find out the name of the medical center for that appt?**

P: (_Long pause._) I would give a personal call. That's what I would do. 

**M: On this page, that would give you info on that? Or hel pyou navigate to somewhere else?**

P: Contact us button or search button? Assume would help us out.

**M: What search?**

P: Maybe doctor's name. 

**M driects to clickon Appts. NOw that on Appts page, do you think yo ucould find the VA medical center from here? Would that help you?**

P: (_Long pause_). Yeah, should be. (_Scrolls down._) 

**Understanding Requests**

**M: Requests - what means to you?**

P: request appt, I would assume. I don't know. When I request an eye exam, put that here. Hearing exam. Is that where I would need to go to submit that request? Or would that be Start scheduling - is that the same thing? 

**M: I want to hear what you think.**

P: I would clikc "Start scheudling" and would go to "Requests" to submit my requests. 


# Task 4: Copay & Claims

_P clicks My HealtheVet tab, looks at options. Sees payments._

**M: What keywords looking for?**

P: Payments nad bills. (_Reads content from Payments box._) Woulda ssume that one first, see if owe anything (_clicks into pay copaybills, lands on Pay.gov_). 

**M: Where do you think you are right now?**

P: Tryign to figure out if owe copay or anything. TBH, having difficulty reading anything. It's too small and blurry, can hardly make out "Continue to the form." 

**M reads contents to P.** 

P: Okay, assume I'm in teh wrong area to see if I owe anything. Will it allow me to go back?

**M: Actually, before you go back, what do you think this page is? Do you think you are on the same website from earlier?**

P: This website is more or less to pay any bills. Going to assume that not on website at all. Think I'm on a diff website. 

**M: Waht tells you that?**

P: The Pay.gov area. 

**M shows back button. Repeats task.**

_P scrolls to bottom of MHV landing page._

P: Looking for bills or anything that identifies disability tab. I'm not seeing anything from quickly looking at it. I want to file a claim for reimbursement... I suppose I could go to My VA (_Clicks on My VA tab._) There you go. Got 2 outstanding debts, 2 copay bills. Can click on those - found that, that's on My VA site. (_Scrolls down._) See Disability compensation on the bottom - learn how to file a disability claim. That must be the area I'd need to go to. 

**M: Could you see how you would check how much you owe exactly?**

P: (_HOvers over Outstnading debts._) Nope, that's not allowing me click on that one (_Manage VA bills; clicks on Copay link_). Okay, I owe two bills. (_Cliks pay copay bill link. Reads content, scrolls down._) HOw do I pay my copay bill? Ehhh... I'm just reading on this page what the steps are so I'm not going to miss anything, instead of just clikcing nad trying to figure sutff out. Maybe "Pay your bill" (_link on bottom. Gets taken back to Pay.gov page. M instructs to click Continue._). 

**M: Where do you think you are? Still on same website?**

P: I would assume so. 

**M: What makes you think that?**

P: I didn't see any link that clicked me out or anything like that. I'm just assuming. I don't see anything saying we moved anywhere TBH. 

**M: Could you go back? Click on Undo. How to check on disability lcaim status?**

P: (_on copay bill page; clicks back, scrolls My VA page._) "Application page" - don't wnat to go there. Claims and appeals (_reads contnet_), okay cool. (_SCans down._) 

**M: What looking for now?**

P: My disability status, something that will put me in that direction. Not really seeing it. I'm not really sure of where to go. Do I need to go to Claimsa nd Appeals, reveal details? 

**M: See waht happens if does what you think?**

P: (_Cliks CLaisma nd Appeals. Scrolls down page._)

**M: Hard to read?**

P: Yep. 

**M: Can see status on this page? (_Reads content._)**

P: oh there, there's the decision. 

**M: What trying to read right now? Maybe I can help you.**

P: Trying to find out if this is a disability claim or something else. Not telling me. View claim... (_There's a typo that's confusing P._) Is this partof the disability claim or something else? 

**M: That's good feedback cuz shows this form is confusing.**

P: As of right now, this is very frustrating. TBH. 

**M: Let's move on.**

# My VA and MHV landing pages

**M: Diff and similarities betwen two pages?**

P: (_SCrolls MY VA and MHV_). To be honest, I like this page better (_MHV_). I tink it's more straight to the paoint, I've got the Appts, see what's below them. (_Goes back to My VA_) I just like th elayout, that's what I think. Cuz it has Appts, canclikc on (_diff links in Appts_). That's just my opinion. I just feel the navigation is easier that way for me. 

**M: If explain to another Veteran what this page is intended for compare dto other, how explain?**

P: Guess I would say go to My HealtheVet page, will list Appts, messages, and below those there are links that will take you to that area. It's a step by step process. (_clicks to My VA._) I think the VA one has, it's a little broader maybe? Just a little broader. 

**M: What do you mean by broader?**

P: On the My VA one, I can go to my profile area, and MHV I'm not seeing that. Might be there but not seeing it at a glance. So that's why it's broader, cuz I can click onmy profile I guess. 

**M: How organize benefits and resources?**

P: If I could design this website? (_long pause_) I guess if anything can have a benefit payment area, or benefits availale tab. Person clikcs on that, sees what benefits available for that person. Say if certain prescription benefits, shoes available, that would be helpful. 

**M: So more benefits, resources?** 

P: if that's what you're looking for, that would be helpful.

**M: Mentioned that couldn't do that on MHV landing page. Why does clicking on My Profile make My VA broader?**

P: Would like to see what that Profile has to say, if correct. All my personal information was correct wtihin there. See what it's all about. 

# Priority Groups

P never heard of PG. 

**M: What refer to?**

P: Well, priority is sort of important. You're important, like priority mail. Um... Yeah. Like, um, more like a more importnat group. 

**M explains PGs. Where expect to find info about your PG on website?**

P: I would assume in Profile. 

**M: Could you show me where?**

_P clicks on Profile link under My VA._

P: That would be my personal information. I would assume would be listing all my health, my income, all my vitals of my personal information. Looking at My Profile, am I qualified in this group or not? My profile. Cuz there's nothing else on this page (_My VA_) that would relate to this. (_Goes through content._) So I would assume would be under Profile. 

**M: What about on MHV page. WHere expect on that page?**

_P clicks to MHV landing page, scrolls down._

P: i'm looking for it, not finding it in any spot. Um... Maybe my helath information card? That's the only thing I can see that's actually would sort of tell me about, or that would link to My Profile. 

**M: Looking for something about your particular information?**

P: yeah.
