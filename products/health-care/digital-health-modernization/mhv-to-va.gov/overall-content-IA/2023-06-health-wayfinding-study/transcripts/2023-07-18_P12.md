# Task 1: AVS task

_Starting from home page_

P: Where do I go to find what information? (_Confused by task; Jenny repeats._)

P: I would go to MHV and see if there's any notes there. 

**M: Coudl you show me how from here?**

P: From here? (_Scrolls up and down_) I would see if I can find MHV on here. And I would click on it and type in my password and see if it takes me to tha page. I woudl go there to see if there's any notes for me there. 

**M: Got it.**

P: I went to the VA yesterday and I went to see if I can get a new CPAP and when I came back, I went to MHV. Instruction son htere on how to use the CPAP, how to clean it nad use it. So that's the information that I got from that appointment. 

**M: So you recently did some of these activities. Are you able to find MHV on this page here?** 

P: on this page here? I... I can go to refill or track prescriptions and it will take me to that page and I think on that page it has a choice of ID Me or MHV, so I would try to click on that. DO you want me to? In order for me to get in there, I have to go through MHV and once i get on that page, will give me a choice of how I want to log into the page. MHV or ID.me or some other form. 

**M: not sure that link works.**

P: If I go to the VA hospital, he or she will tell me what the next steps would be. I wouldn't have to get on MHV or anything like that. They either would give me the next step on paper or they would tell me. So it's not necessarily going to be in MHV bc they will tell me what my next choice is. 

**M: So doing appt they usually tell you that. Let's say that you forgot some details or tried to look for that hard copy of the next steps but couldn't find it. Where do you think you could find it on this page?**

P: on this page? 

**M: Feel free to navgiate to diff pages, but starting from this page, where could you find the info you need?** 

P: I would go to... (_Hovering on Top pages_) Not seeing anything on here where can find this information from. 

**M: What looking for?**

P: Well, if I just finish a consultation wtih my PCP, I would like to see if she noted it, would like to see what she put on there. If missing something, woudl like to go back and see her notes. But I don't think there's anything on here to do that. 

**M: Please scroll to top of page. Mention that usually go ointo MHV. Could yo usign in and we'lll go from there?**

P clicks on "search". 

P: Sign into MHV? I don't see where can sign in here. Where? There's healthcare. 

**M: It was right next to the Menu.**

P: Alright, sign in. (_Signs ins) Would tap MHV, (taken to MY VA). ONce I get into this page, you can see notes that was left for you by your primary care or whoever. 

**M: Did you see the sign in?**

P: Yes, I did. 

**M: What made you not want to click into it?** 

P: do you want me to sign into MHV? 

**M: Yes. Where do you think you are right now?**

P: I didn't sign in yet. I don't know who this person is. Judy Morrison? Who is this? 

**M: This is a prototype. (_Explains prototype_) Where would you go from here?** 

P: I'd go to healthcare. It says Next appt or "Schedule or manage your appt". I have never seen a page on MHV where a doctor or nurse leaves instructions. 

**M: If you were to put the notes on this page, wehre would you put this?**

P: I'd put it under recent appts or recent visits. Then I could go into MHV and read the notes that she left me so that I can understand more of what she said. But I don't think there's anything for that. I would like to look under my recent appt nad review the notes that she has, review what she told me. Should be printed out. 

**M: Do you think you can get to your recent appts from where you're at?**

P: yes, it says Schedule and manage your appts. (_Clicks link from My VA_) It says Appts, Start scheduling, Upcoming and Requests. Yes, this page shoudl show upcoming and prior appointments. So I would know if I have an appt on August 10th. 

**M: How would you navigate to previous appts from here?**

P: I think there's a way to do it in MHV. It just gives you all the dates. Let's say I go to travel reimbursements - it tells you the date you went to the VA. And future dates, upcoming appts. So if I wanted to know what my next appt was, I woud just go to MHV and look at upcoming appts. 

**M: So if you want to read next steps in yoru care from previou s appts, where check that information on this website?**

P: I don't think there's a place on here to check that (_scrolls down_). 

**Expect AVS in details link or scroll down to AVS page?**

**Blue Button**

# Task 2a: Medical Records

(_Starting from Copay details page_)

P: I don't think there's anything about MHV about blood tests. Haven't seen anything that tells me about blood or urine tests. 

**M: Yeah, currently not available. This project is we made some changes, so let's say it's available to view those tests. Where go find them?**

P: I'd go in..the only place I can think of is back to MHV and look under appointment I had under that day and see if any notes there. 

**M: Click on Judy - navigate to MHV from here?** 

P: Yes. 

**M: From here (_landing apge_) where find blood test results?** 

P: (_Scrolls down landing page) Let's see... My medciations and alergies. Or Review Medical Records? 

**M: Click on whatever link would take you to test results.** 

P: (_Continues to scroll down page._) Ugh, schedule and manage appts. I'm thinking I would click on My Medications and Allergies, but don't think right. Or else I would review MR. (_Clicks on MR - goes to MR landing page_) Go to your lab and test results - that's what I'll do. (_CLicks_) Lab and test results - show you a complete blood count and everything. Okay! Gives you the details. 

**M: So if wanted to learn more about Blood test restuls, what do?**

P: Click on Lab and test results and go to MHV and find bal and test results. 

**M: Could you clikc into details of blood count? (_P clicks in_). So this is the details of that lab and test result. Where do you think you are right now?** 

P: Still in MHV app. I think of it like this, if it had anything to do with my health and wellbeing, it's MHV app. That's the app I would use. Anything else - I think that's a differnet app, like copayment, it will take you out of MHV. 

# Task 2b: Medical Records to Secure Messaging

_P scrolls down lab and test result page_

P: says "Need help understandig  your results" and says "Compose a message." I would use this right here. 

**M: Can you compose a message?** 

P: Yes (_Clicks_). 

# Task 3: Appointments

_P clicks undo from Compose Message page; clicks back_

P: I woudl go back to MHV and check upcoming appts. I'm trying to click back to it. (_Keeps using back button until gets to landing page; scrolls up and down; clicks back again until out of landing page, back to Copay task; lands on My VA; scrolls up and down; back to Appts_)

P: I would go back to Appts! I'm in appts. 

**M: What do now to check where to go for next appt?**

P: I would scroll down the list bc says date/time, say Friday the 6th. Just click on Details. 

**M: _directs to PC appt where link works. Link doesn't work._ What expec to find if click on detials?**

P: Already says I'm going to Portalnd VA medical Center. Should tell me room number, what informatoin appt is aboutu, the time to be there, and anything I should bring with me. A full understanding of waht I'm going in there for.

**Understanding Requests**

P: Requests? Maybe I need help with a wheelchair? Maybe something came up and you requested assistance. Say for instance, a wheelchair, you need help with that. 

**M: What do you expect to see if click on Requests?** 

P: expect to see a list of things that I can request. I could request a wheelchair or anything that would help me get to that appt. That should be under request. Or requests or cancellation, things like that. 

# Task 4: Copay & Claims

(_From Appts section. Clicks back to My VA_)

P: Well, on this thing here, it says "outstanding debts", 2 overmapyment debts, t2 copay bills. It says review payment history - would probably go in there and see if can get help there. (_Scrolls down_) I would just check my payment history to see if owe Copay or not. It says "Manage your VA bills". 

**M: Could you go in tehre and see if owe any payments?** 

P: Okay  (_Clicks link_). Says "Sent for collection". (_On Your current copay balances_)

**M: Could you show me how you could pay for copay bills?**

P: (_SCrolls down_) Uhhh. It says "Pay your full balance or request financial help" - woudl clikc on "Detals" and see what says. Wnat me to dot hat? 

**M: Yes.** 

P: Says balance is $300, payment due July 9th. Would press Request financial hep if needed, or just make payment. (_Goes to Pay.gov; reads contnet nad scrolls down to "Continue the form; clicks "Continue the form", reads contnet of this form._)

**M: You don't have to fill out. Thanks for following through form. Where od you think you are righ tnow? On a different website than earlier?**

P: I tapped on "VA medical Care copayment" and took me to that page. Want me to go back? 

**M: Is this website different?**

P: No says Veteran iformatoin, account number. Same as MHV? I don't think it's the same but has something to do with it. Takes you to financial page. MHV is basically about your meds and upcoming appts and stuff. There's nothing financial on MHV page. BUt on this page, there's something financial. 

**M: If you can go back. Great, now that back here. (_Transitions into MR task_)**

# Priority Groups

**Anything else?**

P: I know where to find things on this app (MHV). So it just takes time to get used to it and understand. If you're looking for information, you can find it here.
