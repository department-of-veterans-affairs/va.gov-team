(_Didn't hear_)

# Task 1: AVS task

P: First I would go to sign in.

**M: Could yo show me how you would do that/**

_P signs in._ I'd go to login.gov, it signs me in. 

**M reminds that prototype.**

P: I have to use my phone to memorize logins and passcodes. So I'd come down here to healthcare - talking aout having chronic issue. (_Clicks messges_) Review messages (_On SM landing page, scrolls up and down._) Let's see, just going down throught hese just to see if there's anything. So just, go to your inbox? 

**M: What are you looking for on the message page?**

_P lands on inbox somehow - didn't see how. Got lost, and ended up on appts page somehow. Prototype malfunction? Has to reload and login, goes back to My VA_) 

P: So said to see what discussed wtih care provider? (_Goes to HC, then review messages_) Was reading "What to know as you try out this tool," I usually go to bototm of the page to make sure I"m not missing anything. Not my generation. Go to my Inbox, in my inbox, see have option to filter categories. If recently done, just put in the date, would weed out all other messages and get to appt. 

**M: Do you expect to find next steps in care in message?**

P: If that was the case, it says "your lab results, kidney disease, medicatoin inquiry..." (_Reads appts._) 

**M: this is prototype, might not find exact contnet. What term/ keywords looking for?**

P: Asking me if it was related to next appt and the keywords looking for is "Appt". So that's why I see "Appt preparing for visit," but that's.... Say the COVID booster, that shows an attachment. That's what I'm thinking anyway. Would be appt. 

**M: Let's try something else. Mention Appts - besides find in message, do you think you could get to appts from this page?**

P: From this page? I'm going all tehw ay down the bottom again. So menu (_cliks Menu_) and... VA Benefits and Healthcare is what I'm looking for, open that up (_srolls menu_). What I"m used to is on the MHV site at the bottom for healthcare, have my upcoming appts. Not seeing that on here. (_Clicks on In this section, finds Appts, goes to Appt landing page._) 

**M rereads task.**

P: So you look at details? That's what i'm thinking. Click on detals and tells you when the appt will be, what time, where. Which team the purple team, phone number if need to change info.

**M: So this si upcoming appt, haven't seen this doctor yet. You're trying to find an appt that already been to. Do you think you're still expected to see that on here? What would yo udo?**

P: Go back up to "In this section", and Messages, maybe? I'm looking for upcoming appt for this? I'm not really sure. Appts would clikc on that again (_on Appts landing page_), so start scheduling (_Scrolls down past appts_). 

**M: So those are all upcoming appts.**

P: oh past, I"m sorry, so this past appts? (_Clicks on Past_).

**M: only first appt works. What do form here?**

P: Go to details (_clicks on detials_). View AVS (_clicks; reads content_). That gives me the info I need right there, right? That's what I'm thinking. 

**M: You think this would be where what doctor decided fro your care?**

P: Um... yes, it gives you what diagnosed with, vitals (_scrolls down, reads content_). TO me as go down to bottom of page and look around, gives them medication that ordered, procedures coming up, scheduled procedures. 

**M: Sho wme how to get back out to larger Appts section?**

_Didn't see what P clicked on but got o Appts page_

**M: What does requests mean?**

P: Say if wanting to see doctor if you're requesting an appt, that's what it means to me. If clicked on, think would give email type to request to talk to provider or callback. That is what I think it would me. 

**M: Expect to take actions.**

P: Yeah, for your request. 

**Expect AVS in details link or scroll down to AVS page?**

**Blue Button**

# Task 2a: Medical Records

_P goes to menu, clicks on VA bEnefits and Healthcare, seems to be reading, scrolls down._ I don't see a way to get back to MHV from here. It signed me out again.

**M: What trying to do now?**

P: Trying to get back to MHV page. (_Scrolls down._) ThenI would go to My prescriptions. Home? (_Clicks on hamburger_). I would go in the left build here. (_Scrolls home page. Sighs._) Let me see... Let me read these down here (_looks at top pages links, reads content. Continues to scrolls to Explore healthcare, clikcs on Healthcare, scrolls down._) I was looking to see on the healthcare where I would find my prescription information. (_looking on Top pages section again, trying to click._) 

**M: Link doesn't work. Let's brainstorm and try again. (_repeats task_). From home page where can find blood test results?**

P: As I"m looking through bottom here (_Explore healthcare benefits_) This is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for the information on the lab test. So from the home page, I would think that it would be under healthcare. Open that up (_in menu_), I see health care, disability, education and training, blah blah blah. (_clicks healthacre_) So this is more of a health page, then a your results page. 

**M instructs to sign back in.**

_P scrolls up and down My VA._ LOoing for lab results, not seeing a link where can get there. 

**M: Where do you think this page is for? Says My VA at top.**

P: I really don't understand it. I don't know. It's a jumping off place for getting to your VA stuff, but I'm not seeing the rest of, um... It's got claims, healthcare where you're reviewing your messages where we were before. Not seeing where says anything about lab results, unless  you would find them under your healthare messages maybe. Is that where I would find it? That's where I would look. (_Clicks back into messages. Sees In this section again._) Under MR? (_Stays in messages, clicks on Inbox, finds message on lab results._) Not sure that's where I would look for it, was a bit confusing. 

**M: In this prototype, there is a message about your lab results. Let's say if your provider didn't send you the result, where else would you find it on website?**

P: (_IN this section_) So if they didn't send me a notice (_Clicks on MR_) Lab and test results, go to lab/test, see CBC, x-rays. 

**M: Here looking for blood test results.**

_P goes to details of CBC._ Yeah, that was easy. Can see results of white blood count, etc. 

# Task 2b: Medical Records to Secure Messaging

P: I saw it a second ago. Maybe was on the previous page. Where it would say (_reads MR content; clicks In this section_). I saw something a second ago about emailing your provider? (_clicks messages in secondary nav_). 

# Task 3: Appointments

(_P clicks In this section, Appts_) I would (_scrolls down_)... So, if going to specialist, so looking at diff appts, not sure if specialist. (_Clicks PCP appt_) I'd click details, then comes up oin directions. Would tell you exactly where to go.

(_P gets back out to larger appt section - clicked breadcrumb._)

**Understanding Requests**

# Task 4: Copay & Claims

P: I would go back to MHV (_gets to landing page; reads content_) Pay your copay bill? (_clicks_). Um... VA Medical Care Copayment... before you begin, continue ot the form, preview form... yeah, continue to the form, I would pick from that. (_clicks link._) 

**M: Where are you right now? On diff website than before?**

P: Says Pay.gov, yes. yes to being on diff website. I don't know if it's different, appears diff. 

**M: Why think diff? What diff?**

P: Logo here Pay.gov and the Menu section. 

**M: Could you check status for disability claim?**

_P scans MHV landing page_ I'm looking (_reads content_). That's not it. Current benefit copay rates (_reading links at bottom of page_). I'm looking for, I"m trained on other site. On bottom of MHV, go into "What is my rating" or something like that. Let me go back up (_In that section_) No, not there. (_Scrolls down more._) I'm not really seeing it. I see the copay rates, MH services (_reads MY VA health benefits_). Just not seeing the, my rating. 

**M: Do you think that the disability claims should be under health section, which is where you are right now?**

_P clicks Search/Menu_ Yeah cuz it's VA Benefits and Healthcare. (_Reads links under menu_) Disability is what I think it would be in. (_Reads disability links in menu._) I'm sorry, my brain was working in the wrong way, was thinking rating rather than a claim made. (_Clicks check claim status; goes to Check your VA claim status page_). Htis si where you would find this. Would sign in (_goes to Check your claim status page_). So this is the apge you would see where your claim is at. But this is where you would find where the status. 

**M instructiosn to click on Judy. If you could click on My VA and MHV, trying to get sense of those two pages and similarities and diffs.**

P: My VA, comes back up to your... Your service rating, disability rating, claimsa nd appeals. More like... trying ot think of the word. And then I'll go to MHV - MHV is more of appts and messages from provider. My VA is concerning more of the executive type page, I guess, where have more of VA status and, you know. 

**M: If describe two pages to another Veteran, how explain?**

P: ones a website concerning your claimsa nd appeals, the other is more actual physical appts and stuff with your provider. My VA is the, IDK if explaining correctly. On MY VA, saw actual arrow pointing back (_went through profile menu_).

**M: If deisgn this website, how organize?**

P: Rather than things being behind, I know it's hard to design something with everything cuz would be enormous. But rathert han things being hidden behind touchdown menus, would just be options on page. I know would be a huge page. Cuz there's a lot of info on it. 

**M: How organize/categorize differnet benefits?**

P: My opinions ar enot best source. I think the way it's laid out I think I could stumble my way through it if I had to. I don't have a suggestion to make it better, not wired that way. 

# Priority Groups

P: You're made a priority as a Veteran by your healthcare team. I"m sure some have heard of it - I htink I've heard of it but not sure. 

**M:Where expect to find it?** 

P: eitehr in Profile or Service Connection? 

**M: on this page?**

P: yeah, at very top of the page. 

**M: What think woul dbe in Profile?**

P: Personal information? 

**M: Go to MHV?**

(_P tries via Menu. Still can't find how to get to MHV. M has to direct._)

**M: On this page, where expect to find?**

(_P scrolls down, rereads content. I'm looking down here at My VA health benefits. Um, I guess... Looking for basically your status. What priority your at, what benefits you receive. I'm guessing. (_In this section._) Is that what I'm hunting for.
