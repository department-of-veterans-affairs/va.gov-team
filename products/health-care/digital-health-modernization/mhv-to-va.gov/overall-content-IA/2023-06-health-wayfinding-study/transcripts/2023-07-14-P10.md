# Warm-up questions
**What kind of device are you using today?** (_Computer / Tablet / Smartphone_)

Desktop

**What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA?**

All healthcare; dental care; eye care; outpatient behavioral health -> every service they can offer that I've needed, I've used it. Service-connected compensation. 

# Task 1: AVS task

P: Like, to review the records from that doctor? On this page, I'd click on "Get your VA medical records". (_Clicks link in top tasks._)

**M: Where would you find the next steps in your care?**

P: I'd go down to Care notes and summaries. (_Clicks on CN&S_) Then I'd look under Primary Care after visit summary. (Clicks on details); I woudl go to wher eit says "Details" under that doctor (hovering on details for appt). One appt was at 8, another at 11 with the lab. Go down, see "you were diagnoased with, has all yoru vitals. (scrolls down.) And then the medications that were given to you in that appt. (_Finds treatment plan dropdown_) I'd probably look at the treatment plan for the appt, find out what they'd be doing. They have images, lab tests. (Scrolls more.) 

**M: Can you find the next steps from your appt from what you're seeing?**

P: What like the treatment plan? Yes, I can find that. 

P: If I wanted to find nayhting else, I'd probably clikc on "more informatoin" to see what's there.

**M: Get more information about specific appt?**

P: Um... I guess if I was going to have any MRIs done to know about how long I'd be in tehre. NOt sure if post that or not, but woudl be something. E.g., at least an hour, estimated. Kind of like how long a test might take. 

**Expect AVS in details link or scroll down to AVS page?**

_Scrolls down to AVS._

**Blue Button**

_No mention._

# Task 2a: Medical Records

_P hovers over My VA and My HealtheVet tabs_

P: I know I can find it at My HealtheVet. I'm on the My HealtheVet page. 

**M: What can you find test here?**

P: Because I use MHV and that's (something that can be done there). I'd go to "review medical records." (_MR landing page_) Then on MR, I'd look at Lab and test results. First one there is blood count. (_Clicks on details._) All the results from the different blood tests. And if it's high or low, will tell you. 

# Task 2b: Medical Records to Secure Messaging

P: I'd go to "Messages here" under My HelatheVet. Go to Secure Mesasgae site. There's an emblem I don't see... (_Clicked on Compse message._) I'd click on my doctor or dentist, then go down to question about a test (in category), then in heading add "cholesterol test is high" and ask what all that mean? What shoudl I be looking at? Then just send it to him. They get back to you pretty quickly. (_Tells personal story about receiving care quickly._) It's so nice to have that messaging like that. Cna be on phone so long, but these messages get answered so fast. 

# Task 3: Appointments

_P looks at Find a VA location link._

P: I guess you'd have to go through your primary care doctor and get a referral. But you're saying find a location of where that is, where that office is? 

**M: Need to see a specialist at a VAMC never visited before, want to make sure know where going.**

P: I would click on find a VA location. If you knew the doctor's names and that he was at that location. 

**M: So the appt is already booked, you already know the name of the specialist, the appt is happening, just don't know where where it is.**

P: I can look under the appt itself. (_Hovers on Appt in secondary nav._) I guess under the Appts (hovers on detials), I want to see what it says on details. Yeah, here it says the directions and where it's at. 

**M: Able to find where need to go now?**

P: Well... Not really. I mean, it gives the address or what state it's in. I don't see any state in there. Just says Veterans Hospital Rd, but doesn't have if in Pennsylvania or Ohio. I've had to go out to Cleveland OH and I live in Pennsylvaia. But without the directions (_link_) I'm not seeing that here. )_fi click on directions_) Probably how far it is, maybe a couple diff ways to get tehre quickest. that's probably about it. 

**M: If go bakc to larger appts section, how go back?**

P: Back up on ntop, where says "undow". Oh way, never mind - finds breadcrumb. Sometimes I don't focus so well. I ugess I was a little confused. 

**M: What confused a lot.** 

P: Undo button won't be tehre. Just saw the link after that, that's all. 

**M: If see under "start scheduligng button". Upcoming, past requests. What "requests " emans?**

P: Um... I guess if you wanted to change it or request an appt? (_sounds doubtful._) If you wanted to request an appt. 

**M: When say change request, do yourself? Take actions when click on that?**
P: Correct. 

**M: What do you expect to see?**

P: Well, your appt that you have, the date/time/where it's at. Doctor, specialty. If it's mental health or oncology or whatever. 


**M: What would you like to see?**

P: The address and the doctor's names. What their specialties are. 

**Understanding Requests**

# Task 4: Copay & Claims

P: Um, "Back to care and summaries." (_Scans Care and Summary notes page._)

P: Looking to see wehre I would go to be able to view what the charges would be, how I would pay those. (_Continues to scroll, clicks on VA BEnefits and Health care tabs. Hovers over Health care._)

**M: What do you expect to find in menu?**

P: Somewhere I could find that information. I'd think it would be under healthcare. I don't know if it has eligibility... 

**M: Why would you want to see eligibility?**

P: Eligibility will tell you if you would find out (can't here) eligibiltiy. If you're already registered with VA. But to find out what cost would be to apy for that, I'd say they'd help you. But I'm not sure what to look for. Where to find that information, I guess. I've never had to look it up, but. 

**M: Maybe we'll come back tho this. Could you check on status of diability claim?**

P: (Hovers over disability tab in menu.) Trying to click on disability link. I was trying ot go back. 

**M: On this prototype, did you see the left arrow in top right hand corner?**

_P restarts prototype. Back at home page._

**M restates task.**

P: under "Check your claim or appeal" (in Top pages). I would go to "My VA dashboard." 

**M: HOw do you think we can get there from this page?**

P: _P continues to scroll, reads "What if I have more questions?_ I'm trying to find out where to find the appeal. Right now I'm on a page that says "Check you VA claim or appeal status." But I guess you'd have to log in... I would log in, and go to dashboard where says "My VA," scroll down to track claims. 

**M: Can you log in through this page?**

P: You can log in through that green block. (_Logs in._)

**M: Can yout ell me where now and if can see status?**

P: I'm on the Check you Claims Status page. I can scroll down, see admitted in 27th, updated on 30th. They're reviewing it, going to send a letter out. Has all the other claims that were put in also. 

**M: Coming back to other task, check if owe any money for past appts. Where check?**

P: I'd say try "MY VA" (clicks). Then have notification there that says "Manage your debt" (_tries to click_). 

**M: What is purpose of this page?**

P: Looks like it covers few things - like notifications, debt, claims and appeals, healthcare - outstanding debts, there that is. Benefits payments. It looks like it covers quite a few different things. Kind of anice page to have. My VA - looks like pretty much everything you need. 

**M: And how would you find the payments you owe to VA from here?**

P: Ugh, (_seems to be trying ot clikc on notification link_). "Manage your VA debt." 

**M: What would you expec to see if clicked on that link?**

P: Woudl expect to see if broke down into each appt, per day, what have to pay for each. If there's not a link, maybe a li nk to being able to pay it. right from there. Sometimes too many pages and too many places to go - kind of gets overwhelming. If you've got PTSD, depression, anxiety, - sometimes people get really frustrated and its hard to get trhough things. I think this page covers a lot. Even can request travel reimbursemener here. That's great. 

**M: Do you see "2 copay bills?"**

P: Clicks on it. From here, would I would clikc on "Check details and resolve this bill." (_Gets taken to Copay bill page._) And it brings you right to (_Pay.gov_) form. Clicks continue form. 

**M: Where do you think you are? Are you on a diff website than before?**

P: No - I think it's still under VA.gov. Think its all the same. 

**M: What makes you think that?**

P: I see the VA emblem up there, says VA Medical Care Copayment. Doesn't say any outside place - sometimes outside place takes billing. But here looks like all goes through VA. 

_Back button onto your claim or appeal status. Transitions to MR task._

# My VA vs. My healtheVet

**M: If you were to describe these two pages to another Veteran, how explain them?**

P: My VA has things in one spot, including things in MHV. (_Cutting out._) My VA has links and things that stand out more than MHV. The Appts kind of stand out better, your claim for compensation. The other ones have links you have to click on. 

**M: What mean standing out?**

P: I guess, me, having the dates/times stand out more than the links do. That helps, but. But like, if I can see like in the healthcare, it's telling you your next appt, nad the date/time is right there, it stands out more than MHV. But I think having it there, having it there and not having to click so many times is what I'm trying to say. Seems like - I mean, I use MHV and I like it. But I’m starting to see that this VA.gov is looking like a pretty good page (_referring to My VA_). 

**M: There are a lot of benefits/resources on both that can access. If you could design/ organize them, how would you do it?**

P: Um… Having all your info on one page, like this My VA, I would have that set up like that. I guess that to me is like, it makes it a lot easier. It's easier to find things. Yeah MHV (landing page) it's good, but now that I see the other one, doesn’t' stand out as much to me. Everything is there, I just think (My VA) is better. 

**M: more straightforward, you can see..**

P: More tailored for me. Already hitting me, not like a general thing. Like my page when I get on. 

**M: Where would you put the visibiltiy resources in your health?**

P: liket he sevvice connected raiting? Or where in general to find it? On this page (My VA) I like that at the top it tells you your service connection. I Would think if you click on that link, should open up. On like that 40% disability rating. 

**M: You expect to find the disability resources through that?**

P: yes… (_sounds doubtful._) yeah, I would say that it would probably go to that. Your payment is down below, your benefit payment in there. But I like it bc this apge seems like it's more tailored towards me. Or the Veteran. 



# Priority Groups

**M: Heard about VA priority group?**

P: Uhhh… I've heard of it. Is it like, Veterans that are service connected, disabled? 

**M: Is that what you think that means?**

P: that's what I think. Priority. 

**M describes PG.**

P: (_I'd expect to find info n PG_) I would think that… (scrolls down My VA) I would think that it's going to be under "Service connected" (at top of My VA). 

**M: Click on that link?**

P: yeah, open that link and should say what ratings are, and PG or what group in. I think there's 8 of them. 

**M: If don't see bar, wehre expec tot find it?**

P: Um… (_scrolls down_) I would say… I would look under Manage your VA bills (_in copay_). Under there, will tell you that if your in a PG, your copay will be $50 or whatever. Would think would be there. 

**M: If you could clikc on MHV - where find it?**

P: (_scrolls up and down_). Would look under Copay bill again, but I guess it doesn't tell you in there. I guess bc I'm like 90%, so I don't look at it to much. My dad is a Marine Veteran, his PG is diff than mine, so I know a little about it but not a lot. Would be agood thing to have on page so can see what group is. I think if you have wehre you could find your priority group on that, on your My VA page, or have somewhere in there, easy to get to.
