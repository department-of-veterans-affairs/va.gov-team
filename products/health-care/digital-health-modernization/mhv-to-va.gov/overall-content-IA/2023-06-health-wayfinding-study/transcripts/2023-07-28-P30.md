  * P: Disability

# Task 1: AVS

**M: I'd like you to imagine that you recently had a visit with a specialist to talk about a chronic condition. You want to review what was decided. For the next steps in your care. Using this prototype, where would you go for this information?**

P: Well I know like normally I would go to if there's a quick link but I already know through my previous experience. With the old website, you have to sign in first. So I would go to sign in. And then I don't use any of those ones. I always use MHV, cause it's just easier. I use it the most and it's easier to remember. And I don't know if I have access to the other logins. (_sign in and land on My VA, signed in it MHV_) 

**M: What are you looking for here, what words?**

P: I'm looking for reports or tests. (_opened main nav. and clicked on lab and tests result on the main nav._) 

**M: Can you tell me where you are now?**

P: Now it's showing me actual blood draws and things like that, so it's not what I want. I'd go to MR. I don't want to manage them, I don't want to download or share them, so it's care summaries and notes (_scroll on MR landing page_). The admission discharge? not working. (_click AVS and scroll and read_) The reason for the appointment was hypertension. And so these are the thing. So I was diagnosed with so well it looks like I should not smoke and I should definitely take vitamin D. I'm trying to see if it says. Nope, there are just some medications. Oh, treatment plan? Let's try that. I'm gonna get some imaging. Trying to find where are my care instructions. I would think they'd be here because of the treatment plan, but that's more of the doctor's treatment plan in the hospital. It looks like not. What I should do. I don't know where to go from here. That's it. That's all I see.

**M: So do you feel that you've accomplished your goal of seeing that recap of what your doctor told you were your next steps?**

P: No, I don't. Because it's not just like. The patient will now take vitamin D and stop smoking. I feel like it's 50% there because oh I'm going to have a rheumatology consult. And I can see the reasons why, or the diagnosis. Maybe that's leading to the issue. But I was expecting to maybe see a more just. Layman's terms were written out like What the doctor recommended me to do.

**M: So this is a summary of your doctor's recommendations for the next steps in your care. Came out of an interaction you had, right?**

P: Yes, sometimes there's a lot that we go over and it could be more than one thing that I asked him about, and in maybe like 30 min or an hour's time of an appointment. I might not remember everything that they recommended, or that we discussed.

**M: Where would you find that?**

P: I would look for it in my medical notes. In my actual medical record or here where it says care summary notes, cause that sounds like what it would be.

# Task 2: Copay & Disability Claims

**M: Using this website, how would you go doing these things?**

P: I'm still on the page I was looking at my healthcare stuff, so I would maybe just go to the main home link. Cause that would be the fastest way. And then I can check on my appeal, status right here. And then also Let's see if they have it there (_checking the top tasks section of VA.gov home page, then click main nav._) Check disability first, and then I'd sign in "check disability and appeal page. And here are my claims. Let's see how I'm doing. Looking at all claims and appeals. Okay, look at that one. Okay. So that's it. I would see like it's still an initial view. So I'm done checking that. 

**M: You feel like you have accomplished the goals?**

P: Yes, I do.

**M: Ok, let's look at the other goal**

P: Let's go back to the home page (_click VA logo_). It's just easier. I'm looking for payment or debt. 

**M: And where are you now?**

P: Right now I'm at the, I'm at the whole menu and I'm using the dropdown. From the first that I've been using since the beginning. That says VA benefits and healthcare. So maybe it's not going to be there because it's not a benefit. Paying bills, let's see, maybe it's healthcare. Because it's paying my, prescription bill maybe. But I don't see it here either. So I don't think it would be in any of these other ones. Then, I will look down here at this menu of quick links (_mid-section of VA home page_) Nope, not here. Maybe I can go to the My VA. (_click My VA_) Here it is, outstanding debts, that took a while to find. I prefer if there was just a menu option. (_click manage copay and click pay bill_)

**M: Where do you think you are right now?**

P: It says Pay.gov on top, so it's not the same as VA.gov. It looks similar, but the VA part is gone. 

**M: How do you feel about that?**

P: I feel unsure, and question if this is the right site and safe site. I normally straight go to Pay.gov after getting a bill from my mail. 

# Task 3: Lab and test and SM 

P: Ok, let's go to the home page. (_click main nav. and check lab and test results_) Complete blood counts, that looks right. I would go there because I got a blood draw. I don't know what everything means here. I assume I'm ok, it's standard. 

**M: How do you ask your doctor about it?**

P: I would go to MHV (_click MHV_), then inbox, if I don't see many messages from my doctor, I would go compose a message. 

# Task 4: Appointments

P: (_click appointments in secondary nav._) then details, So let's see the details and see if it tells me like what like what's their specialty? Cause we have to find the specialty. Unit within the hospital. So here at least I have like the Here's the address for the hospital, but that might not be helpful enough. They're in the purple clinic. Okay. So I'm going to go to the purple clinic. I could click on directions. But they're probably just directions to the hospital, not to the, it's definitely not going to be to the clinic inside. I expect a map to show up. So it would probably be a, it would probably take me to Google or pop up a Google map within the window, like within the website, and it would ask where I'm. Either it will show just the location itself. Like the pinpoint, the drop of where the hospital is. And just see because sometimes things are more complicated once you get into the hospital. I'm like in my in the Seattle hospital there's an elevator that doesn't go to all the floors so You can't take it up to neurosurgery, like stuff like that. So because of my experience in the past. I would probably call if they haven't called me to set the appointment or confirm the appointment.

**M: Do you think you have accomplished your goal?**

P: So now I feel like I feel like I have 50% like accomplished or maybe like 60% accomplished my goal. Like I know it's at the hospital, already knew that but some purple clinic okay that gives me something to do. Like somewhere to focus on once I get there. But I don't I've never been to a purple clinic so I need to know how to get to Purple Clinic. Okay, so you would call to get further details.

**M: How would you get back to the larger appointments section ?**

P: (_click back to_) I didn't use back button because it sometimes refreshes the page. 

**M: What requests mean?**

P: It means appointments I have requested or my provider has requested, and haven't received or confirmed yet to see them to an issue that I want to see them for. And or it would be for once my provider has put impossibly for a specialty clinic that has not been, confirmed or accepted yet from that specialty clinic. I would expect to see, when I requested it, who I requested it from, and, where that would be at where the appointment would be at.

**M: So if you could design this website, how would you organize the different types of benefits and resources that you've seen here?**

P: Ok, back to the home page. (_scroll to the mid-section of the VA home page with color-coded quick links_) This is the most helpful. I like each one has a different color symbol. It helps distinguish them from each other. It helps the eye to stop and like actually look at it and read the words next to it. Where if all the symbols were the same color, all the icons, my eyes would probably just like skim over them. To be honest, that's really helpful and then if there's something you access a lot then you'll remember like oh the disability ones kind of like this kind of red color. It's also faster than a dropdown menu. It also depends on if you're doing it on a laptop, or a phone, so it can be hard to open. I do normally use my computer and if I'm not at home then I would be using my phone maybe to like access something while I'm at the doctor's office, especially if I'm seeing a specialty care provider because I want to refer them to like a lab I had or a result that I had. 

(_click main nav._) Let me see here. I get that healthcare is a benefit. But I don't know why health care is with the other benefits. That's how I feel about this part. if I'm looking for education, I know. Logically that this says, benefits and healthcare, but I would expect healthcare to have its own because that's such a big benefit. Where like education is just education. But healthcare is also prescriptions, it's labs, it's all that stuff. I mean, we look at healthcare and It's all of these things. Where I feel like the other ones are smaller things. I would look for all of those as just regular BA benefits and I would look at healthcare as a separate bigger benefit that deserves its own menu next to benefits.

**M: Okay, so where would you put, your education benefits or housing? Resources and disability?**

P: My viewpoint of this is probably too biased. I'm done with education and I don't receive pensions and I don't receive anything else. So I come with the bias that I'm only coming here for healthcare. Or to pay my bill but that's still health really to me because I'm paying a bill that I got that's a copay for my health care. So I still think that's great. They can all be in those ones can all be I expect those all to be in one menu. But then next to that, I would expect another dropdown menu that would be just VA healthcare.

**M: Can you click on My VA?**

P: I'd expect to see like. Other benefits here too.


**M: How would you describe My VA and MHV?**

P: So my VA will show you all of the benefits that you have or anything pending, so it will show disability claims and appeals. I wouldn't expect health care to be here, it would just be your appointment and quick stuff, and anything in-depth, you need to go to MHV. It'll show you anything you owe the VA. So all of your debts there, I'm, I would imagine too that, Like if you, something messed up with your benefits, you owe them it would be there too. It shows your next disability payment where you could also change your direct deposit or your address or anything like that or at least get forms for it. And then how to apply for other benefits. So like education and disability. For MHV, it's what I use the most because that's the benefit that access the most often. I got there, and then I can see my appointments. I can request an appointment online without calling because somebody was on the phone. You can write a message to your primary care provider and actually, sometimes your other specialty care team. You can also go and refill your prescriptions, see which ones you have, and it will actually show you, which prescriptions are still active or not. You can track, Also on here you can track. If it's been sent yet and like when to expect delivery, it always takes a week, but you can see if it's on its way. You can also see like your, record so like notes. Labs you can see x-rays, and things like that. And you can download them so you could bring them to another provider like especially if you had someone outside the VA, you can give them access to your medical records through here too. Again, you can pay your bill and then I don't know about this one because I've never done it, but apparently, you get medical supplies.

**M: On high level, MHV is ___ and My VA is ___?**

P: I go to My VA for benefits information and general health care, and MHV for all health care stuff. 

**M: What do you think when you see the main nav. "VA benefits and healthcare"?**

P: Well, first I see benefits and I think of. Disability, I think of education. That's pretty much all I think of.

**M: What would you expect to find?**

P: Everything that is a VA benefit. So I don't things I don't even know of things that I don't even access. I feel like you could probably set up, some of those. I would think you'd be able to set up all those benefits. So it takes you to other web pages where you can apply for those benefits or where you can find the forms to fill out the PDFs and then print in the mail to apply for those benefits. And then also to track those benefits if you already have access to them. I put health care on its own tab next to it. It feels counterintuitive a little bit but it's It feels different than like education and pension stuff. That's all like money. Health care is not money. 

# Priority Group

**M: Have you heard of VA Priority group?**

P: Everything that is a VA benefit. So I don't things I don't even know of things that I don't even access. I feel like you cou

**M: What would you expect to find?**

P: Yes I have in relation to my health care. It affects my copay. I’m in group # for prescriptions, so it affects the coverage I have on my care and everything. 

**M: Where do you expect to find that information?**

P: Top of the page on MHV. I wouldn’t look for it all the time, but expect it to be there and list on my bill. Or under MR, listed there, or on its’ own on top of MR. It’s just information, not a link to access. Under benefits (main nav.), check claims and appeal, could on there too. In my account, if it’s only one place, it's quick about me. 

On MHV, it should show with any category anything that affects me, like prescriptions for me and MR, in a letter I can open and see.
