# Warm-up questions
**What kind of device are you using today?** (_Computer / Tablet / Smartphone_)
**M: So what kind of device are you on?**
P: Computer

**What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA?**
P: Just the healthcare and the disability payments, I guess. I don't know if that's the same.

# Task 1: AVS task
P: Oh. So I'm trying to figure out what I would do next after talking to the doctor pretty much.

**M: Yeah, you had an appointment with your doctor. You kind of came up with like next steps for your care, but you wanna see like the written record of that. The written, you know, I have a hard time remembering what's said to me. I need to see things written down. So we find that using this website.**

P: I have no idea. I click on this that you. (08:10:29)

**M: You can click on that. Some of the links will be, working, but either way, just kinda let me know what you're looking for.**

P: Okay, so like this drop down, did you see that? Okay, so like I would assume I would Look in one of these somewhere.

**M: Why do you think that?**

P: Cause I don't, don't know exactly what I would look up. Cause like, I don't even know what that would be called like your. Cliff notes from your appointment.I don't know what you, what would you call that?

**M: Notes from your appointment make sense.**

P: But yeah, I have no idea. Health care main. Records, tell me. Records?

**M: You look in records.**

P: That's I guess better healthcare.

**M: Feel free to click. I'm honestly not sure which links work and which don't.** 

P: Oh, disability, healthcare. I don't think these bottom ones do. So records is not right. Disability or health care disability. Oh, there it is. Disability. Check your claim or appeal status. No.

**M: Okay, why would you think there?**

P: No, that would be appeal status. That's not right. Some nope, I'm wrong. I would assume. Health care maybe. Oh, I can't. To hit the Healthcare? Yeah, I have no idea. There's refill and track your prescription. Send a message to your care team. Oh, view lab test results maybe? Yeah, that would make more sense. I'm gonna say view lab.

**M: Okay.**

P: Tester results.

**M: Okay. Does that link work again? Sorry if it doesn't. Okay, well that's just kind of good to know.**

P: No.

**M: So you look in lab and test results. And can you tell me why, you would look there?** 

P: Yeah. Stick, cause that was be your appointment. So there would be some results, I guess, from your appointment.

**M: Okay, so you'd get to. You would think that the lab and test results would be kind of linked to your appointment and that way you kind of get your way to the appointment.**

P: Yeah, like even if you didn't have blood drawn and all that stuff, you'd think there'd be like some note like all patient came in that day.

**M: Thank you. So. If, Let's see. Would do you have. An account with via doc of. Okay.**

P: Yeah.

**M: Can you tell me why you haven't? You wouldn't have like signed in.**

P: Why I wouldn't sign in?

**M: Or at what point would you sign in?**

P: Oh, I probably would have already signed in if I'm coming to it. Are signed in as soon as it let me. But usually like when I, I don't know if this is all changed or what, but like last time I did it I had to go through my healthy vet and then it took me to somewhere else and that took me to somewhere else and then eventually take me to where I had to go.

So I'm not used to signing in I guess immediately because I have to jump through like 4 hoops before I even got to where I was going.

**M: Sure. Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you. If you were to sign in at this point, how might you sign in?**

P: That sign in button.

**M: Do you wanna try that?**

P: Right. It doesn't work.

**M: It doesn't work. Oh my goodness, okay. Would you mind clicking the back button? Which again, like in a real website, this would work. So apologies and things for good humor.**

P: That's right. Oh, there it goes. Now I can do it. Yeah, this. I used to go through this. My healthy vet and then it does everything.

**M: Feel free to click on any of those. And so in a, you know, in a real website you'd sign in. So let's imagine that you've signed in. What would you do at this point if you're trying to get to? The notes that are associated with your appointment.**

P: Oh, maybe go to my profile. I don't know this page at all. Either go to your profile or maybe click on my name up here.
