# Task 1: AVS task

P: Well first i would iguess login and go i guess go to va records 

**M: show me how?**

P: Well create account — oh that doesn’t work so I can’t use it?….
I would put my name, my address whatever they need to create it

**M: do you have a va account?**

P: I think they merged, ebenefits and myheealthevet… did they merge together 

**M: but your insticit would be to create an acct as first time?**

I would go to medical record…

**M: does that work?**

P: And then i would just go in and see if I can just download specifically for that day… so if i had to follow specifically for that day 

**M: you want to see what they ssaid specifically**

P: I would go to the primary care notes and summary… _reading page_... ok treatment plan… so I guess ths would kind of tell me what to do maybe 

**M: do you think you would want to see the detail of this appt? If so how would you?**

P: Okk…. oh up here… june 1… it would have the time, the reason… like my kids have duke health and normally it would be listed in tyour past appts so normally it would be there…. Yeah appts…. Appts its right there 


# Task 2: Copays and Claims

P: Menu…. Let me go to menu maybe that will work 

**M: what would you expect to find there?**

P: Maybe messages? There would be a balance?

**M: what is a message to you?**

P: A nurse might send a message, a dr might send a message and a billing person might send a message…. I mean to check you status you go to ebenefits… i don’t know if va has that information 

**M: do you remember the page where you signed in?**

P: So from the main page the va button does nothing… 

**M: expect to do?**

P: ... maybe break down into a menu… maybe search enter “health benefits”... from search va.gov i would put like disability benefits to see any updates 

**M: what does it mean to you, health benefits vs disability benefits**

P: To me its more about your health conditions rn vs claims is more benefits… like if your requestinhg an increase in your disability or education… that would be in the claims side 

**M: how would you sign in fom here?... not working… click home, Jenny gets us out of it**

_[on VA.gov homepage… how would yo u access your info?]_

P: I would menu… sign in.. maybe LOTS OF TROUBLESHOOT] Ah.. education… disability compensation there

**M: what is this page**

P: This is the benefits for hector garcia… he’s at 40%... 2 unread messages… next appointment… its nice it has everything on one page… so basically this is combined all the website into one… this is neat
So before you would have to go mhv to see health stuff, and then you would have to go ebenefits to see a clam… so seeing it all right here is nice… it’s nice having it all just on one page, one website 

**M: so what would yo udo? You would expect to see it in new debt?**

P: Yes 

**M: so what’s the difference between 2 overpay debts and 2 copays, what does that mean to you?**

P: Maybe they paid too much… or the loss of a dependent… or an error on the gov side and they gave to much money and they have to take it back… and copay that’s just a copay you have those

**M: if its money you owe bc you went to an appt where would htat be?**

P: Copay… right here you owe each 300… ok resolve your debt that does not work … 
So the first bill is 300… if yo uclick details and then you hit contine

**M: so where are you now? on pay.gov**

P: On the medical care copayment page

**M: are you still on teh general website yo uwere on?**

P: No i’m on pay.gov… iguess that the website fot the gov to collect money

**M: and how is that different?**

P: Bc it’s pay.gov, not payva.gov so it different 



# Task 3a: Medical Records to Secure Messaging

P: Uh… va medical record… oops… no come on,,, i would sign on 

**M: why would you sign on?**

P: Bc it’s my personal info so you have to log in…. And here lab and test results … its right there

**M: would you do naythign else?**

P: I would go into detail and oh right there results so 5.0 4.5 so I’m not sure if thats better or wose I know that their different (reading test info)... so normally i would the doctor sends here message… so if i want to know if it’s working i would look ath the lab but normally the dr sends a message or if you go into the message and see what the dr  says…ahhhh… ah no that don’t work… if i want to know if the med is working…

**M: for example, soem says high some says low, how would you reach out the dr?**

P:  Would send a message… click send a message…

**M: so you clicked send?**

P: Uhh… inbox works that would be messages from the dr, nurses, it’s right there not working 

**M: are you abel to start a new message?**

P: Yeah you would click the dr name then what it’s about then write teh subject like “follow up on lab results” then right message and click send

# Task 4: Appointments 

P: So i would basically look for the address if ai go to the va and then i go into appts then i.. Let’s try again… oh maybe try find a va location?... maybe go tto va appts… uhm i would say go to where your appts are it would have the address on it

**M: is there anywhere you could find appts? Other then menu?**

P: Mmm…. from the message? From this page? 

**M: yeah you’ve sent the message and now you want to see your appt**

P: Umm i’m not sure maybe you can send … ok inbox… ok we were just in email ok now close email ...I’m sorry I’m a little lost…

**M: no it’s helpful for us to see this…**

P: what happens if you click the sign in?... There’s the appt

**M: if you scroll up would you see… looking at those, myhealthyvet, my va and profile what would you expect?**

P: Well myva looks like it’s combining everything it looks like its combining everything so that would be the best place myhealthy vet would be be medical records and...

**M: let’s slook for the address**

P: Oh theres the address 

**M: how would you get back out to the larger appts section**

P: I would click on jessy it gave some options instead of just being blank… 

**M: what kind of options?**

P: options pertaining to Judy, like maybe her emails, like her information, maybe sign in or singout option or a close option maybe? I would expect something vs nothing

# More My VA vs. My HealtheVet questions

**M: If you could design this website, how would you organize the different types of benefits and resources you see here?**

P: Its set up ok… i would put it like in the menu like the menu would have everything… or the bottom had the resource… i wouldnt change it but keep it as is…. But ilike Judy I would just have profile, like it’s nice having myva and mhv right there but its also nice to have it there too… if she’s in north carolina or florida she would have different state benefits… and if your in texas heres the benefits you would be entitled to… it would be nice 

**M: so like awareness of like where the vet lives?**

P: yeah like where they live 


# Priority Groups

P: Yes, thats your what the va designates yo uin a disability like 100% or something you are designated in your percentage its strange 
.... Umm…. maybe the copay? No thats’ the copay… uh let’s try the copay rate…. Ummm… but like there’s a dept in the va that designates your rate… i thought it would tell you what you have to pay for copay… i was just thinking bc i didn’t see the option for elegibiliyt

**M: so if it influences how much you pay, anywhere else?**

P: Mmm… maybe service member benefit… uh… oh right there to eligibility benefits
