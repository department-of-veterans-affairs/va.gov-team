**What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA?**

Used mortgage benefit years ago, health benefits, him and wife scheduled to be buried by the VA 

# Task 1: AVS task

P: First I would go to sign in 

**M: why?**

P: bc most of the time when i do this kind of site with anybody once you start clicking around it goes to make an account 

_viewing the sign in page options_ 

P: this feels familiar and its easy.  Id use id.me

P: Usually what i’m looking for more than anything else is my appts, to verify my medical records… right now it’s usually prescription.  Thats what i use the most.

**_[M restates task]_**

P: I would find that get your va med records lab and test results_ <click> _now i’m finding this easier… now i’m in medical records, i could go to lat and test results, care notes and summaries i’d assume to review what i talked about with the dr

**M: where would you find the plan for your care? **

P: I think care notes and summaries…___<click on details to see note>__ reading … ___
P: oh ok so as i go down i can see height, weight, i see a complete list and then i can go into complete details 
__….[scanning down]... __your treatment plan from this appointment i think thats what i would do, i can see medication and supplies

**Expect AVS in details link or scroll down to AVS page?**

**Blue Button**

# Task 2a: Medical Records

P: I see in provider notes it says 

**Critical Flag**

# Task 2b: Medical Records to Secure Messaging

P: What I think I would probably do is i would prob go back and i saw on one these page you gould send a message but i don’t see it… i’ll go to details… go to test results… compose a message and hopefully it would go to him 


# Task 3: Appointments

P: I guess… i’m thinking i could go here… oh appointment (in mtv appts left nav)... i would click on appointment… portland… then i would click on directions and a map would pop up…. That would give me like a google maps or something like that

**M: back to appointment**

P: …assuming i want to check on some other appts to check on some other location

**Understanding Requests**

P: Well im not trying to schedule an appointment with request maybe… i’m thinking ive had a headache for the past 2 weeks i’m feeling bad… i don’t have an appt with anybody or know who to have an appointment with id assume i could request explain whats going on and get connected with somebody 



# Task 4: Copay & Claims

P: “Well this _the medical bag_ is where i presently go to find all that information but it doens’t do that now 
 
P: Right now, I’’m at the point where I’m trying to make an appointment and I’m on VA Medical Care Copayment — usually there something tells you when you are leaving a website… look at the browser to see if it opens in another tab… im used to seeing something that says you are leaving the website 
Uses back to go to pay.gov copayment page 

_On pay.gov:_ “i really don’t get the feeling that I will be leaving the va website” 


# Priority Groups

**M: What do you think "VA priority group" refers to?**

P: Since my greatest involvement with the va is just health issues i’d look at it like its people who are very seriously ill are going to take priority over like i broke my finger… refers to the severity of health issues

**M: When a Veteran applies for VA health care, they get assigned to a group that determines how soon the VA signs them up for health care benefits and how much they will have to pay towards the cost of care. A Veterans' priority group can change if their income changes or if their service-connected disability gets worse and they receive a higher disability rating.
With that in mind, where would you expect to find information about your personal priority group on this website?**

P: I would got to myva — oh its kind of where i would expect it … i see it at the top i see my disability rating 

**M:(Direct to MHV on vA.gov landing page) Where would you expect to find information about your personal priority group on this page?**

P: Its odd bc i would expect to see the name of the vet anywhere… from myva i see the blue banner … if that same blue box was at the top of mhv thats where i would expect ti
