# Warm-up questions
**What kind of device are you using today?** (_Computer / Tablet / Smartphone_)
Laptop

**What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA?**
Healthcare benefits, nothing else. 

# Task 1: AVS task

P: I would sign in first. (_Logs in; lands on My VA_). Then I would go to My HealtheVet (_clicks on tab_), then MR I guess (_clicks on MR_), I think Care Notes and summaries is where I would go, I guess. That's where I woudl go (_clicks_). 

**M: How would you read more about what doctor said?**

P: Oh, I would click details (_clicks details, scrolls content, gets to bottom, finds treatment plan, clicks treatment plan, scrolls down through content_) This should give me all the info I need about that appointment. Or this one would give me the info about the appt (_Clicks on "Your appointment on June 1"_). This would be the next steps, I suppose. 

**M: Want or expect to get back to details of appts from this page?**

P: Yeah, I think I should be able to see them at any time, right? There's no way I can memorize all this information. If I didn't think I could come back here at any time and look at this. I might screen printing so have directly. I would hope to not have to do that. (_misunderstands question._) 

**Expect AVS in details link or scroll down to AVS page?**

**Blue Button**

# Task 2a: Medical Records

(_P starting from Copay page, clicks MHV tab, reads MR links, clicks on Review MR, goes to MR landing page, Lab and test link, details of CBC, scrolls down page._) All teh blood lab work. This looks different. 

# Task 2b: Medical Records to Secure Messaging

P: I'd click Compose a message (_clicks link in MR page; gets taken to SM_). 

# Task 3: Appointments

_P clikc MHV tab; hovers over Appts_) Find VA locations, I guess. (_link doesn't work._) 

**M: What expect to see if click on Find VA locations?**

P: um, either a map or a way to type in the location that I know I'm going to. Hopefully would come back and give me the address and map that shows me wher eit is. 

**M: Say don't know the medical center's name.**

P: _Clicks Appts_ I'd have to go look at Appt nad it shows me where appt is. ANd I'd go to details (_clicks details_) and it shows me directions, that's cool. 

**M: Get abck to larger appt section?**

(_P clicks back button._)

**Understanding Requests**

**M: what requests means?**

P: Um... I would think it'd be a way to ask the VA to see a particular specialist. I don't know, haven't see that before. 

**M: What expect to see if click on it?**

P: I don't know waht would be, unless requesting to see specialist. Then would fill in info need to see someone particular? I don't know who that would be for. 

# Task 4: Copay & Claims

P: I hthink I would go back to MHV (_Clicks tab, landing page_), payments, pay your copay bill. But I don't see any place where shows... can comein and pay, but I get my bills paperwise and then I come in here and pay. I've never been able to come in here and look at my bill. NEver been able to find that, can you do that? Cuz I don't see where you can do that. 

**M: What do you normally look for when want to pay it?**

P: I would think it would be right here under payments. Where else would I look? (_Reads content on landin gpage._) None of that makes sense for looking for a bill. Under payments, says I can pay my bill but why can't I see it? 

**M: Maybe we'll come back to this. What about checking on status of diability claim?**

P: I'd go back to My VA (_clicks on My VA_). There we go, Review details (_reads Claim for compensation box. Clicks on Review details; reads content_). So this shows the status. 

**M: This gives you the status info you're looking for?**

P: that looks like the current status showing there. 

**M: Now that successfully found the status of your claim, try to go back and find copay. Where go to find how much money you owe?**

_P clicks back into MHV. THen back to My VA_ P: Oh, here you go, outstanding debts. 2 copay bills. I never seen thsi before! It makes more sense to be in MHV. 

**M: Where go to check if owe payments to VA for past appointments?**

P: If I owe money? Probably here (_Manage VA bills in copay box; gets taken to Copay page_). that shows me what's owed. 

**M: Show me how pay first bill?**

P: Click to resolve bill (_clicks; taken to Coapy bill_). I've never seen this screen before. So that's how you've paid it. That's cool. (_Goes to Pay.gov form._)

**M: Where do you think you are? Diff website?**

P: I'm on Pay.gov. According to this. 

**M: Diff than where were before?**

P: When I pay bill, I go directly to Pay.gov. But only way know how to pay is through paper bill. Unless htis is all new, I've never seen this screen where see all bills are. 

**M: Pay.gov is diff website than where checked bills?**

P: Yes, I think it's a diff site, isn't it? (_Clicks back to VA.gov_). This is My VA, not Pay.gov. This is the VA. Like I've said, I've never seen this before. I was always lookign to see this in MHV. 

# My VA vs. MHV

**M: Those two pages - waht do you think the similarities and diff are?**

P: Well, My VA has all the VA services and MHV is just about my health. I don't know - I could be wrong, but that's the way I see it. 

**M: Describe to another Veteran, how explain two pages?**

P: that's what I would tell them. My VA is all services - if have disability, can find info about that here. Also shows healthcare appts, shows debts, benefits payements, where can apply for benefits. All that overall VA things. MHV is more specific to you, in all of your health needs and health services VA provides fo ryour healthcare. 

**M: If you culd design website, how organize diff benefits nad resources?**

P: only thing I would do diff is put a link here (_under payents in MHV_) to be able to see the bills. Would put (_Outstanding debts, Manage VA debt_) this... What's the diff between Manage VA debt and Manage VA bills? I don't get it. This link (_Copay bills page_) would be very helpful under Payments. Maybe under Appointments - when I 'm thinking about appointments, well... (_Clicks into Appts_)

**M: Sorry - didn't catch that part.**

P: Under Appts, maybe a li nk right here (_in Appts box_), I would separate Schedule and manage appoinments. I would have a link for Scheduling and a link for Managing. That's just me. Everything else is pretty straightforward, I think. 

**M: otehr benefits like education and housing, curious to hear where would you put those resources?**

P: (_in My VA_) down here under Apply for VA benefits? I don't know where you put them after you apply for them. Maybe after you actually get those benefits, they show up on this page too? Do they show up after you start receiving them? 

**M: Would you put them on this page? Or categorize them somehwere else?**

P: It is My VA. Unless you havea  third onen (_another tab_). Then you would have a third page. Instead of My VA nad MHV, might be My Education or something. 

# Priority Groups

P hasn't heard of term. 

P: Priority Group? Uhh, I do not know, I honestly don't have a clue. 

**M explains.**

P: Oh yeah, I remember. But it's been a long time. 

**M: Where would you expect to find that info about your personal PG?**

P: That is something I remember asking why it wasn't on the page. It shoudl be on this page (_My VA_). So that you know that information bc that's importnat to know. how much am I responsible for and how much is the VA responsibel for when it comes to my carea nd benefits. 

**M: Where put that infor?**

P: Well, the priority group is applicable to all VA services, is it not? 

**M: From definition, seems to be... so it is. Every Veteran who applies to healthcare, gets assigned to a grup.**

P: Okay so just to do with healthcare. Should be somehwer eon this page. (_MHV landing apge._) Because it's healthcare. Should be able to see that somehwere here, or maybe even in my profile. 

**M: On top of this page, you're p ointing?**

P: In my profile, that's somehwer eI would look for that info. 

**M: on this page, where put?**

P: I don' tknow, in box of its own, or separate link right here (_hovers over top area_). 

**M: Wouldn't expect to be on My VA?**

P: if PG only healthcare, should be on MHV. If only getting education benefits, then PG has nothing to do with that.
