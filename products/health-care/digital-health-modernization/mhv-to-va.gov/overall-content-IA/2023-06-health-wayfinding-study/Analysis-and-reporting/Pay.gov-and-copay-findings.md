# What we did
## What are the tasks participants need to complete about AVS and Appointments? 
**Copay task:**  You want to see if you owe payments to the VA for past health appointments, and how would you go about paying it?

## What are the questions we asked throughout the task?
As participants navigate through the task, we ask them: 
-	What they are thinking 
-	What terms they would search (if they want to search)
-	What information do they expect to see
-	Why do they click on those links
This is to understand their mental model and to see if there are patterns to what they think and feel when completing health-related activities.

Once participant clicks on the Copay link and is directed to Pay.gov, we ask them to click "Continue" at least once to get them further into the form:
- Where are you right now?
- Are you on a different website than before?
- How do you feel about being on a different website?
- How would you get back to the original website we were on?

## How did we observe?
To ensure we capture what they do/say/feel accurately, besides taking transcribe notes, we also captured them on the [Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1688057183385/892e08ae73c1a90432e0f8bb6cd8a620ee8bf2dc?sender=ueeece9e244394145c84e5173) and labeled them by behaviors, feelings, and flows to show how they navigated while talking out aloud. This strategy allows us to easily review each participant, and find patterns.

## Analysis strategies
We had two sets of data to analyze: observation notes on a Mural board and interview transcripts. Through comparing and bucketing and analyzing, we arrived at findings. Also, with quantitative analysis, we were able to find the repeated patterns and answer the Pay.gov and copay questions. 

# What we learned

- **When they leave VA.gov and go to Pay.gov: Where do they think they are? How do they feel when they realize they are no longer on VA.gov?**
  _Note: 3 failed data collections (due to technical difficulties and time limitations)_

  10 out of 15 participants thought they were on a different website (not VA.gov). When asked where they were, they were all able to identify the Pay.gov website as their location by pointing out the Pay.gov logo, header, and footer area. The rest of the participants (4 out of 15) all assumed they were still on either VA.gov or My HealtheVet because they were not notified that they were being directed to another website. In other words, they all expect to be notified if they are leaving VA.gov. 

  **Quote**
  - _"I would think I'm still on VA.gov. It didn't tell me I was moved (to another website)."_

  Out of the 10 participants who realized they were on a different website, 6 participants told us how they felt about it. They all expressed some levels of discomfort and lack of confidence in the two websites' transition (from VA.gov to Pay.gov).

   **Quotes**
  - _"It's not the best (feeling), and not the worst. It's weird that I had to come to a different site."_
  - _"This bugs me. It should tell me when I leave VA."_
  - _"I'm always unsure at first, and wondering if it's the right site."_ 
  
- **How do they think about/ understand debt vs. copay, and how do users know how much to pay??**
  _Note: "Manage VA debt link" on My VA was not enabled in the prototype. There were 2 failed data collections on this question._

  There are multiple starting points that can lead them to check how much they owe, which are in the main menu, My VA, and MHV. One participant successfully found the pay copay link by navigating to "View all in health care" in the main menu, but there are a few participants who first explored the main menu and couldn't find the information because they said they were looking for terms like "financial, billing, payment" and expecting links with those terms would lead them to the right place.

  10 out of 16 participants found the copay link on My VA. From desk research, users can also access copay bills through "Manage VA debt". Out of the 10 participants who found copay on My VA page, 4 participants wanted to click on the "Manage VA debt" link on My VA at first. Because we didn't enable that link, they then clicked on "Manage VA bill". These 4 participants showed that there is some confusion around debts vs. copay, and they are not sure how to differentiate both. We didn't probe further into what confuses them.

- **How is the payment linked to the bill?**
  _Note: There were 2 failed data collections on this question._

  10 out of 16 participants found the "Manage VA bill" link on My VA, which was the only successful path in this study. Participants checked how much they own and were able to pay the bill through the Pay.gov link on the bill page. 5 out of 16 participants found the "Pay copay bill" link on MHV, and they are aware that they can pay the money through that link. However, one participant called out that they were confused about how much to pay because the link directly sends them to Pay.gov, which is a valuable point. One participant found the pay copay link by navigating to "View all in health care" in the main menu.

  - _"I expect copay to be in health care, not My VA."_
