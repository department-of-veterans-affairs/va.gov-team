### What We Did 


#### **Context** 

These questions about Priority Group were tucked into the larger Health Wayfinding study.  The study as a whole involved 18 interviews with veterans who are frequent MHV users but less frequent users of VA.gov.  However, due to time and technical constraints, not all participants were asked about Priority Group.  These insights are grounded in responses captured from 12 of those interviewed (Participants 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 25).   


#### **What questions/tasks did we ask and when?**

Priority Group questions were asked after participants had navigated 4 key tasks across the MyVA and MHV space.  At this point, participants had spent a significant amount of time using the prototype and had been exposed to the designs. 

_Questions we asked:_.

* Have you heard the term "VA priority group" before?
* What do you think "VA priority group" refers to?
* When a Veteran applies for VA health care, they get assigned to a group that determines how soon the VA signs them up for health care benefits and how much they will have to pay towards the cost of care. A Veterans' priority group can change if their income changes or if their service-connected disability gets worse and they receive a higher disability rating.
    * With that in mind, where would you expect to find information about your personal priority group on this website?
    * (_Direct to MHV on vA.gov landing page_) Where would you expect to find information about your personal priority group on this page?


### What did we learn? 



1. **Awareness of the term “Priority Group'' is low.**  3 of 12 participants recognized the term unprompted.  Those that did recognize the term reflected that they had gone through or spent a significant amount of time going through the disability claims process, which is where they learned the term.

2. **Before hearing the definition, participants equate ‘Priority Group’  with how severe a medical condition is.** Reflecting on the term but before being given an explanation of Priority Group, participants connected it with how important a Veteran is to VA.  Participants expected that importance to be based on how serious one’s medical condition is.

Of the 12 participants who were unfamiliar with the term, they did not associate the term ‘Priority Group’ with anything financial or related to money until they were given the definition of ‘Priority Group’.

3. **After they know what the Priority Group is, participants expected to see it with “my information” or with information about their disability rating.** These places included:
   
    1. Profile, because they associate it with their information like their address, phone number, etc
    2. Medical records, where they might see a document with their rating
    3. VA Healthcare and Benefits, or some place where they manage the documents for their VA benefits because it impacts how much they pay
    4. With wherever they find information about their disability rating, because it is impacted
       
4. **Looking between the MHV and MyVA page, users were unsure of where to put Priority Group information.**  Some participants would put it on MyVA because it felt “more comprehensive” than MHV and most importantly, had the disability rating notification.  Some participants would put it with Medical Records, which happened to be on MHV.  In this case, the connection was more about being with their Medical Records than being with MHV.  

“I would go to MyVA …kind of where i would expect it … I see it at the top [where] I see my disability rating…” – P7
   
“(I would look for it)... after medical supplies and equipment…” - P2
