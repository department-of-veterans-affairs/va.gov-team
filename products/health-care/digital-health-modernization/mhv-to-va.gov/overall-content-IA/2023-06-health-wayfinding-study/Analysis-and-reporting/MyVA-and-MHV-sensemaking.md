## What we did


### Task and questions

These insights are based on observations of participant behavior and how they discussed their thought process across all tasks.  It also includes insights from the post-task questions that reflect on the MHV and MyVA pages after participants have completed the tasks.


### Observation strategies and data analysis 

As part of the observation process, we collected task specific observations on a Mural board as well as collecting transcripts of interviews.  Analysis included some quantification of behaviors (e.g., first 3 clicks analysis; paths taken, proportion of participants who needed facilitator nudges), which gave us a birds eye view, identify preliminary patterns, generate hypotheses for deeper qualitative analysis​.  Analysis also included some qualitative analysis (specifically analytical memoing strategy and constant comparison across transcripts).  


## What we learned

When it comes to how participants make sense of MHV and My VA, we captured 3 main insights.

**Finding #1: ​​**One group of participants expressed that they want everything in one place.  These participants understood and used the links on My VA as a snapshot or gateway to start to access health care benefits, returning to where they started sometimes even when they were already in MHV.

  _“This [My VA] is like a snapshot of everything that would cover me...” – P13_

  _"I see it's [My VA] a jumping off place to for getting the rest of your VA stuff..." - P18_


**Finding #2:**  Another group of participants distinguished their medical care from their other VA benefits.  At the start, for some this meant automatically MHV while others would guess at the Healthcare and Benefits megamenu.  

  _“Normally I would think kind of like on the civilian side... I think of something like MyChart and so that would be my first instinct on the VA side, 
   like, ok where do I find my like MyChart equivalent for VA?” – P23_

  _"I'm looking for something that says After Visit Summary... I think I would go to Benefits and Health care... then I would click on Health care... and 
  then I would go over to Manage your health" - P16_


**Finding #3:**  Participants' distinction between a snapshot of available VA benefits and one place to manage medical care required a greater recognition and awareness of the differences between the My VA and MHV pages writ large. Not all participants got there, and many never got there without help from the facilitator. Participants who did get there were more likely to be aware of the My VA than the MHV page, especially if they signed in and first landed on the My VA page.

  _“MHV is going to deal with your health... and then you have to go to My VA to get all your information about your other benefits...My VA is for everything 
  else but MHV is just for your health.” – P8_

  _"...if it has anything to do with my health and wellbeing it's MHV app... anything else that's I think it's like a different app... like a copayment... 
    it's going take you out of MHV" - P12_
