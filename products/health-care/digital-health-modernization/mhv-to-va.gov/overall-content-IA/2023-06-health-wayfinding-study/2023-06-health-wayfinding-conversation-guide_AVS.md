## Intro - 5-10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Robyn/Jenny/Cara and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, I'll talk a little bit about what we'll be asking you today.  

We are part of a team working on the health sections of the website VA.gov. We’d like to get your feedback on some changes we have made to how you can access your personal health information and benefits on VA.gov. Specifically, we'll be asking you to perform a set of activities that show how you would navigate the VA.gov website to access and manage health-related information and benefits. Most of what we'll be asking you is about your reactions to what you see on the website and where you might expect things to be. We won't ask you for personal information and we'll only ask you very general questions about your own benefits - we'll focus on your thoughts on the changes we've made to the VA.gov website. 

It is worth noting that we will be using what we call a prototype. This is not an actual website. It is a file that we use to explore what the website could look like and get feedback from users like yourself before we make any final changes to the website. This prototype will not work exactly like a website. For example, not all of the links will work and you cannot click the back button in your browser because it will take you away from the prototype. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know. 
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this) or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- Last one - one of the ways that we share findings with our partners across VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not but like to ask ahead of time. I'll also confirm at the end of the interview that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've talked about. 
    - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?** 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)*

2. What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA? 

**Screen sharing instructions**

First, I'd like you to share your screen so I can see how you navigate the site. Do you know how to share your screen? 

_Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:_
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

Thanks for your patience in figuring that out. 

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Wayfinding interview - 50 minutes 

Now I need to share with you a link to the prototype. How would you prefer the link? I could say it out loud for you to put into your browser, or I could put it in the Zoom chat. 

Just as a reminder, this is a prototype, which means that it will behave differently than the actual website. Not all of the links will work. As well, please do not use the back button in your browser as it will take you out of the prototype. There is a back button in the prototype that you can use to go back in the prototype. I'll show you when you open the link. 

_Send link to prototype: [Desktop](https://www.sketch.com/s/7dd70a0f-08de-4b7b-8203-0f3ee49acc3e/prototype/a/A3C4D258-7207-47A2-8530-4ED04E2CBB0F?hotspots=false), [Mobile](https://www.sketch.com/s/7dd70a0f-08de-4b7b-8203-0f3ee49acc3e/prototype/a/2724A3C2-DF18-4FEC-903A-E1886F87E72F?hotspots=false). Show the participant where the prototype back button is._

**_Task 1 - AVS task:_ _Participant should be starting from unauthenticated home page._** Let's imagine that you recently had to visit a specialist to talk about a chronic condition. You want to review what was decided for the next steps in your care. Using this prototype, where do you go for this information? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking as you figure out how to do this on the website. 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant gets stuck because they navigate to a spot where they will be unable to find the AVS_) It looks like you're not finding the information around what was decided for the next steps in your care. What would you do at this point? (_If participant says they would call or use resources outside of VA.gov, ask them again what they would do using only this website._)
- (_If participant is completely stuck and/or getting frustrated_) I'm sorry this has been so confusing, though it's helpful to see that we're maybe not doing a good enough job helping Veterans to find this information. Would you mind (_signing in/ clicking on My HealtheVet tab_)?
- (_Once participant is on My HealtheVet landing page_) Where would you find information about the next steps in your care from here?
- (_If participant still cannot find AVS, direct them to either Appts or MR and continue with interview._) 

_Specific questions about AVS - **must ask**:_ 

_If a participant is in the Appointments section:_ 
- This summary of your doctor's recommendations for the next steps in your care came out of an interaction you had while in an appointment with this doctor. Do you think you would want or expect to be able to get back to the details of that appointment from this page? 
- How would you get back out to the larger appointments section? 
- (_Or, if more appropriate wording, depending on their behavior_): How would you backtrack to where you came from?
- (_If a participant uses breadcrumbs_): Why did you click on those links?
- (_If participant ends up on Appointments landing page_): What do you think will happen if you click on that "Requests" link? 
- _Optional probe_: What do you think "Requests" means here? 
  
_If a participant gets to AVS through Medical Records:_ 
- This summary of your doctor's recommendations for the next steps in your care came out of an interaction you had while in an appointment with this doctor. Do you think you would want or expect to be able to get back to the details of that appointment from this page? 

_Participant should be deep into either Appointments or Medical Records at this point looking at AVS._

**_Task 2 - Copay & Claims task:_** You have two things that you need to do today - see if you owe payments to the VA for past health appointments and check on the status of a disability claim. Using this website, how would you go about doing these things? 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)? 

_Specific questions - **must ask**:_ 

_If a participant goes to My VA:_
- What is this page? 
- What is the purpose of this page? 
- (_If participant went to My HealtheVet landing page_): How is this page different than the other page where you looked at the plan from your doctor for your care? 

_Once participant clicks on the Copay link and is directed to Pay.gov, ask them to click "Continue" at least once to get them further into the form._
- Where are you right now? 
- Are you on a different website than before?
- How do you feel about being on a different website? 
- (_After participant goes one click into Pay.gov form_): Thank you, you don't need to go any further than this. How would you get back to the original website we were on?  

**_Task 3a - Medical Records task:_** Imagine that you were recently put on blood thinner medication. Your doctor ordered blood tests two weeks after you started the medication to make sure that it is working. Where would you look for the results from those blood tests?

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- Why did you (_do that, go there, try that_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)? 

**_Task 3b - Transition from Medical Records to Secure Messaging; participant should be deep into Medication Records navigation at this point:_** Say you're confused by this flag in your result means and you want to ask your doctor about it. Using the resources offered on this website, how would you send them a message? Again, if you could please tell me what you are thinking as you try to do this, it would be very helpful for me. 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- Why did you (_do that, go there, try that_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)? 

**_Task 4 - Appointments task:_** Say you are going to see a specialist in a VA medical center you've never visited before and you want to make sure that you know where you are going. How would you figure that out? 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- Why did you (_do that, go there, try that_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)? 

_Specific questions about Appointments - **must ask**:_ 

- (_If participant uses breadcrumbs_) Why did you click those links? 
- How would you get back out to the larger appointments section? 
- (_Or, if more appropriate wording, depending on their behavior_): How would you backtrack to where you came from?

_Ask these questions if did not ask them in the AVS task:_ 
- (_If participant ends up on Appointments landing page_): What do you think will happen if you click on that "Requests" link? 
- _Optional probe_: What do you think "Requests" means here?

**More My VA vs. My HealtheVet questions**

- If you could design this website, how would you organize the different types of benefits and resources you see here? 
- Where would you put your disability resources and your health resources? What about education benefits? Housing benefits? 
- (_Ask participant to click between My VA and My HealtheVet pages_): If you were to describe these two pages to another Veteran, how would you explain them?

- On Desktop:



* Look at the top left corner.  Do you see “VA Benefits and Health Care”? [once they have identified it] 
    * What comes to mind when you read “VA Benefits and Health Care”? 
    * What would you expect to find there?  
    * What do you think you could do there?
    * If it was up to you, where would you put it?

On Mobile:



* Look at the top left corner.  Do you see “Menu”? 
    * What comes to mind when you see “Menu”?
    * What would you expect to find there?
    * What do you think you could do from “Menu”?

    [have them click Menu]

* Can you tell me what you are looking at? Does it meet what you expected? 
* Do you see “VA Benefits and Health Care”?
    * What comes to mind when you read “VA Benefits and Health Care”? 
    * What would you expect to find there?  
    * What do you think you could do there?
    * If it was up to you, where would you put it?

**Priority Group questions**

Thank you for showing me how you would navigate around this site. Now that you are more familiar, I'd like to ask you a couple of final questions. 

- Have you heard the term "VA priority group" before?
- What do you think "VA priority group" refers to? 
- When a Veteran applies for VA health care, they get assigned to a group that determines how soon the VA signs them up for health care benefits and how much they will have to pay towards the cost of care. A Veterans' priority group can change if their income changes or if their service-connected disability gets worse and they receive a higher disability rating.
   - With that in mind, where would you expect to find information about your personal priority group on this website?
   - (_Direct to MHV on vA.gov landing page_) Where would you expect to find information about your personal priority group on this page?
 
- Is there anything we have not talked about that you would like me to know at this point?

- **I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
- _If participant says yes:_ Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip? 

## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
