# Instructions to notetakers: 
-	Take as close to verbatim notes as you can, but also, don’t worry too much about. Unless notes are **really bad**, don’t recommend going back to clean up. This can be done as needed during analysis phase. Just try to get as much as possible during the session then take a breather until the next. 
-	Indicate in bold when moderator speaks. 
-	Give initials M for moderator and P for participant.
-	Title the notes using the following format: 2023-07-P(#)-device-gender-age.md
-	Indicate in (_italics_) when you’re describing a behavior. E.g., “umm, I think I should do this (_clicks on sign in button_).”
