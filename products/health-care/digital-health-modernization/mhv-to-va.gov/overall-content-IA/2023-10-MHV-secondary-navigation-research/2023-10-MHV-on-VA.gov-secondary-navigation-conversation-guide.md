## Intro - 5-10 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jenny and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you ok with them joining the call? But before we get to them, I'll talk a little bit about what we'll be doing today.  

We are part of a team working on the health sections of the website VA.gov. We’d like to get your feedback on some changes we have made to how you can access your personal health information and benefits on VA.gov. Specifically, we'll be asking you to perform a set of activities that show how you would navigate the VA.gov website to access and manage health-related information and benefits. Most of what we'll be asking you is about your reactions to what you see on the website and where you might expect things to be. 

It is worth noting that we will be using what we call a prototype. This is not an actual website. It is a file that we use to explore what the website could look like and get feedback from users like yourself before we make any final changes to the website. This prototype will not work exactly like a website. For example, not all of the links will work and you cannot click the back button in your browser because it will take you away from the prototype. 

Also, there are a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know. 
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was okay to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this) or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- Last one - one of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not but like to ask ahead of time. I'll also confirm at the end of the interview that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've talked about. 
    - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?** 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. Do you normally use your phone, desktop, or laptop to do health-related activities on VA.gov?
2. Tell me about the last time you used it. When was that? What did you use it for? 
   
**Screen sharing instructions**

First, I'd like you to share your screen so I can see how you navigate the site. Do you know how to share your screen? 

_Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:_
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

Thanks for your patience in figuring that out. 

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Okay, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Interview - 50 minutes 

Great, now the fun part begins. I'd like you to know that I will share a prototype link with you during our chat today. I will put the link in the Zoom chat. 

Just as a reminder, this is a prototype, which means that it will behave differently than the actual website. You will be signed in as a testing user, named Judy. It’s a fake account with fake information, so you won’t see your name and your personal information. Not all of the links will work. As well, please do not use the back button in your browser as it will take you out of the prototype. There is a back button in the prototype that you can use to go back in the prototype. I'll show you when you open the link. 

_Send link to prototype: https://www.sketch.com/s/02430c9f-e4cb-4945-b7bb-6ec2f81a0bd7/prototype/EB6BB9B5-0953-4D49-AFED-CF4F2AAB146B/a/EB6BB9B5-0953-4D49-AFED-CF4F2AAB146B?hotspots=false_

**So, today you are going to perform some healthcare-related activities with this prototype. I will be giving you a couple of healthcare-related activities, and please use this prototype to walk me through how you'd complete the activities.** 

**(Start from the signed-in MHV landing page) Before I give you the task, talk me through what you are seeing on the screen - where does it make you think you are on the site?**

**_Task 1a - MR and SM_** Imagine that you were recently put on blood thinner medication. Your doctor ordered blood tests two weeks after you started the medication to make sure that it is working. How would you go about seeing those results? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking. 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term. What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant gets stuck because they navigate to a spot where they will be unable to find the medical records or lab results_) It looks like you're not finding the information around what was decided for the next steps in your care. What would you do at this point? (_If participant says they would call or use resources outside of VA.gov, ask them again what they would do using only this website._)
- (_If participant is completely stuck and/or getting frustrated_) I'm sorry this has been so confusing, though it's helpful to see that we're maybe not doing a good enough job helping Veterans to find this information. Would you mind (_clicking on the second menu_)?
- (_If participant still cannot find it, direct them to it and continue with the interview._)
- (_If participant is too fast or you didn't see where they tabbed_) I can’t see where you tab on the screen, can you let me know where you tabbed? 

**Must ask:**
- (_Pay attention to_) Where does participant click first, and ask why?
- (_If participant clicks on mega menu_) Why did you click there, and what do you expect to find there?
- (_If participant didn't click on secondary nav._) Did you see it? If so, why didn't you click it, and what would you expect if you clicked?
- (_If participant felt stuck) Where do you expect to find it? Why? 
- What are your thoughts about the amount of time it took you to find the blood result?
- Thinking about this task - is this something you’ve done before - looked up a test result on a va site? tell me about that.

**After participant finishes the task:**
- Thinking about this task - Is this something you’d normally do for managing your health? Tell me more about that.
- What was helpful, and what wasn’t? Why?
- What did you like, and didn’t? Why?
- (_If there’s a pattern, ask this question. If not, ask after all tasks_) I see you used ___(e.g. "in this section" menu, or breadcrumbs, or trying to go to MHV landing page) a lot, tell me more about why you did that?


**_Task 1b - MR and SM_** hen, say you're not sure what the results mean because of the medical terminologies and you want to ask your doctor about it. Using the resources offered on this website, how would you go about doing that? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking

- (_If participant is too fast or you didn't see where they tabbed_) I can’t see where you tab on the screen, can you let me know where you tabbed? 

**Must ask:**
- What would you normally do? 
- (_Pay attention to_) Where does participant click first, and ask why?
- (_If participant clicks on mega menu_) Why did you click there, and what do you expect to find there?
- (_If participant didn't click on secondary nav._) Did you see it? If so, why didn't you click it, and what would you expect if you clicked?
- (_If participant didn't click or didn't see the direct link to ask a question_) Do you expect to be able to directly get to secure message from here?
- Is this something you’ve done before? How did you approach it?

**After participant finishes the task:**
- Thinking about this task - Is this something you’d normally do for managing your health? Tell me more about that.
- What was helpful, and what wasn’t? Why?
- What did you like, and didn’t? Why?
- (_If there’s a pattern, ask this question. If not, ask after all tasks_) I see you used ___(e.g. "in this section" menu, or breadcrumbs, or trying to go to MHV landing page) a lot, tell me more about why you did that?

**_Task 2 - Appointments_** (from where they left off) You need to make a new appointment with your new doctor, but you don't remember their name. You can check their name from your recent appointment visit. How would you would you go about finding their name on this website?

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- Why did you (_do that, go there, try that_)? 
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant is too fast or you didn't see where they tabbed_) I can’t see where you tab on the screen, can you let me know where you tabbed? 

**Must ask:**
- What would you normally do? 
- (_If participant looks for past appointments in the secondary nav._) Do you think you'd find past appointments in the menu, and why?
- (_If participant didn't click on secondary nav._) Did you see it? If so, why didn't you click it, and what would you expect if you clicked?
- (_If participant clicks appointments on the menu_) What do you expect to happen when clicking on appointments?

**_Task 3 - Medications_** (from where they left off) Imagine that you have taken a medication named TACROLIMUS for a while, and you want to check the expiration date for ordering refills for TACROLIMUS. How do you go about doing that from here? 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant is too fast or you didn't see where they tabbed_) I can’t see where you tab on the screen, can you let me know where you tabbed? 

**Must ask:**
- What would you normally do? 
- (_If participant goes back to MHV landing page for medications_) Why did you go back to the MHV landing page?
- (_Pay attention to_) Did they use breadcrumbs?
- (_If participant clicks on mega menu, stop them from continuing_) Why did you click there, and what do you expect to find there?
- (_If participant didn't click on secondary nav._) Did you see it? If so, why didn't you click it, and what would you expect if you clicked?

**After participant finishes the task:**
- Thinking about this task - Is this something you’d normally do for managing your health? Tell me more about that.

**_Task 4 - MR_** (from where they left off) Imagine you have an overseas trip coming up, and you need to download all your vaccines to prove that you're safe to travel. Where would you go to do that?

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- Why did you (_do that, go there, try that_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant can't find it_) Where would you expect to find that? (If still struggle, tell me it's under medical records.)
- (_If participant is too fast or you didn't see where they tabbed_) I can’t see where you tab on the screen, can you let me know where you tabbed?

**Must ask:**
- What would you normally do? 
- (If participant goes back to MHV landing page for appointment) Why did you go back to the MHV landing page? 
- (_Pay attention to_) Where does participant click first, and ask why?
- (_If participant clicks on mega menu_) Why did you click there, and what do you expect to find there?
- (_If participant didn't click on secondary nav._) Did you see it? If so, why didn't you click it, and what would you expect if you clicked?

**OVERALL Qs**
- If participant clicks on the mega menu during any task, don't let them go further, but ask:
   - What do you expect to find there?
   - What do you think the differences are between the main and secondary menus (pointing them out)?
- Overall, how would you rate the experience of completing various health-related tasks? 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, and why? (if they have a hard time recalling, ask them to go back to the prototype and point out where).
- (_Ask participant to go back to Lab and test results_) Open the section navigation and ask
     - Then can you go back to the medical records page, and open the section navigation
     - Now that you have looked at both, can you explain the differences?
     - How would it have helped if you used it earlier, if at all?


## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

**I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
- _If the participant says yes:_ Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want to be shared in a video clip? 

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
