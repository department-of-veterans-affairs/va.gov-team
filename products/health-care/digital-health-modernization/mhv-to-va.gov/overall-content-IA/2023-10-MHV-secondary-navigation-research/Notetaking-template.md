# Health Wayfinding Secondary Navigation Research [MM-DD-2023-P#]

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
M: Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. Do you normally use your phone, desktop, or laptop to do health-related activities on VA.gov?
2. Tell me about the last time you used it. When was that? What did you use it for? 
   
**Screen sharing instructions**

M: First, I'd like you to share your screen so I can see how you navigate the site. Do you know how to share your screen? 

M: In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.


M: Thanks for your patience in figuring that out. 

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Okay, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Interview - 50 minutes 

M: Great, now the fun part begins. I'd like you to know that I will share a prototype link with you during our chat today. I will put the link in the Zoom chat. 

Just as a reminder, this is a prototype, which means that it will behave differently than the actual website. You will be signed in as a testing user, named Judy. It’s a fake account with fake information, so you won’t see your name and your personal information. Not all of the links will work. As well, please do not use the back button in your browser as it will take you out of the prototype. There is a back button in the prototype that you can use to go back in the prototype. I'll show you when you open the link. *[sends link to prototype in Zoom chat]*

M: So, today you are going to perform some healthcare-related activities with this prototype. I will be giving you a couple of healthcare-related activities, and please use this prototype to walk me through how you'd complete the activities.

M: Before I give you the task, talk me through what you are seeing on the screen - where does it make you think you are on the site?

### Task 1a - MR and SM

M: Imagine that you were recently put on blood thinner medication. Your doctor ordered blood tests two weeks after you started the medication to make sure that it is working. How would you go about seeing those results? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking. 

M:  this something you’ve done before - looked up a test result on a VA site? tell me more about the last time you did that.

**After participant finishes the task:**
- What was helpful, and what wasn’t? Why?
- What did you like, and didn’t? Why?
- (_If there’s a pattern, ask this question. If not, ask after all tasks_) I see you used ___(e.g. "in this section" menu, or breadcrumbs, or trying to go to MHV landing page) a lot, tell me more about why you did that?


## Task 1b - MR and SM

M: Let's say that you're not sure what the results mean because of the medical terminologies and you want to ask your doctor about it. Using the resources offered on this website, how would you go about doing that? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking


### Task 2 - Appointments

For the next task, you need to make a new appointment with your new doctor, but you don't remember their name. You can check their name from your recent appointment visit. How would you would you go about finding their name on this website?

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- Why did you (_do that, go there, try that_)? 
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant is too fast or you didn't see where they tabbed_) I can’t see where you tab on the screen, can you let me know where you tabbed? 

**Must ask:**
- What would you normally do? 
- (_If participant looks for past appointments in the secondary nav._) Do you think you'd find past appointments in the menu, and why?
- (_If participant didn't click on secondary nav._) Did you see it? If so, why didn't you click it, and what would you expect if you clicked?
- (_If participant clicks appointments on the menu_) What do you expect to happen when clicking on appointments?
- Is this something you’ve done before? How did you approach it?

**After participant finishes the task:**
- Thinking about this task - Is this something you’d normally do for managing your health? Tell me more about that.
- What was helpful, and what wasn’t? Why?
- What did you like, and didn’t? Why?
- (_If there’s a pattern, ask this question. If not, ask after all tasks_) I see you used ___(e.g. "in this section" menu, or breadcrumbs, or trying to go to MHV landing page) a lot, tell me more about why you did that?
  
### Task 3 - Medications
M: Imagine that you have taken a medication named TACROLIMUS for a while, and you want to check the expiration date for ordering refills for TACROLIMUS. How do you go about doing that from here? 



### Task 4 - MR
M: Imagine you have an overseas trip coming up, and you need to download all your vaccines to prove that you're safe to travel. Where would you go to do that?



### Other Questions: 
- If participant clicks on the mega menu during any task, don't let them go further, but ask:
   - What do you expect to find there?
   - What do you think the differences are between the main and secondary menus (pointing them out)?
- Overall, how would you rate the experience of completing various health-related tasks? 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, and why? (if they have a hard time recalling, ask them to go back to the prototype and point out where).


## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

M: **I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
- _If the participant says yes:_ Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want to be shared in a video clip? 

M: Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

M: If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

M: Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
