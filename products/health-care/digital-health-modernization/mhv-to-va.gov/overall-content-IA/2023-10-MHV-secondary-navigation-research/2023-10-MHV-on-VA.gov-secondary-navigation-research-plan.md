# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov secondary navigation, October/November 2023

## Background

As we move My HealtheVet (MHV) to VA.gov, we want to know if the current VA.gov secondary navigation and breadcrumbs work on MHV on VA.gov and how we could improve navigational strategies if they don't work. This study aims to give us more context as to how Veterans would use the current secondary navigation and breadcrumbs within the MHV on VA.gov when completing health management tasks. 

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	

The goal of this study is to help us better understand how Veterans expect to be able to navigate MHV on VA.gov. This understanding will help us develop the most effective navigational strategy for the product.

### Outcome

This research will inform us how Veterans navigate health tools on MHV on VA.gov to complete health tasks, which give us a better sense of what works and what doesn't with the current secondary navigational strategies (section navigation and breadcrumbs). For what doesn't work, we are able to use the feedback to help us make improvements to the secondary navigational strategies. 

### Research questions

* How does the current VA.gov secondary navigational pattern align with Veterans’ expectations for MHV on VA.gov? 
* In what situations might a Veteran want to navigate back to the MHV on the VA.gov landing page, if they want to go back to the landing page? 
* In what situations might a Veteran want to jump directly from one tool to another? 

### Hypotheses 

* Users want to be able to navigate every part of MHV on VA.gov easily regardless of where they are.
* Mobile users will likely struggle with current secondary navigation because "in this section" is not noticeable.
* Users might have trouble differentiating the primary menu from the secondary menu.
* Users might want to click on "VA.gov" home when they want to get back to the MHV landing page because the MHV landing page link is hidden.
* Users might only rely on secondary (section) navigation and overlook breadcrumbs and direct links on the pages that take them to other tools. 

## Method

### Interviews
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. These interviews will include questions documenting users’ process of navigating to and within My HealtheVet, the mental models they use to find certain information, and their expectations related to health-specific tasks. The interviews will consist of a combination of tasks and direct questions. 

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom.
