# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov secondary navigation, October/November 2023

## Background

As we move My HealtheVet (MHV) to VA.gov, we discover that there are problems with the current VA.gov secondary navigation system. It is not only inaccessible and unintuitive but also doesn't support complex navigations within all the tools of the MHV on VA.gov. This study aims to give us more context to those problems from Veterans' perspectives and understand what aspects of primary and secondary navigations are confusing to Veterans by looking at how they use tools within MHV on VA.gov when completing health management tasks. 

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	

The goal of this study is to help us understand how Veterans use two different types of secondary navigations to complete key health tasks on MHV on VA.gov and what they struggle with each. One is an [existing secondary navigation](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/about-covid-19-vaccine/), and the second one is a new design that shows all the health tools and has a different MHV header. 

### Outcome

This research will inform us of users' pain points when using the current and the new secondary navigation, which give us ideas on how to improve and iterate on the new design so the secondary navigation can be ready when all the tools are available on MHV on VA.gov in Phase 2. 

### Research questions

1. How do participants navigate - within one tool vs. among multiple tools? 
2. What are participants confused about with primary and secondary navigation, if they are? 

### Hypotheses 
- Users want to be able to navigate every part of MHV on VA.gov easily regardless of where they are.
- Mobile users struggle with current secondary navigation because "in this section" is not noticeable and it expands to a long list that is hard to scroll.
- Mobile users don't know the differences between primary and secondary navigation.   

## Method

### Interviews
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. These interviews will include questions documenting usersâ€™ process of navigating to and within My HealtheVet, the mental models they use to find certain information, and their expectations related to health-specific tasks. The interviews will consist of a combination of tasks and direct questions. 

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom.
