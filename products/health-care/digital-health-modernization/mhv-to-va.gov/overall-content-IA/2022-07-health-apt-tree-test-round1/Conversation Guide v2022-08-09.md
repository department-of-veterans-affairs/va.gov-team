### Health Hub Moderated Tree Tests: Conversation Guide

## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about managing healthcare through the VA and observe how you might complete certain tasks online.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 45 min. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- You'll be interacting with an online simulation tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

- - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

## Start recording.

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up

Could you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck ask about location, occupation, military service history)

## Interview
**MODERATOR:** To start, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your usage of VA benefits and digital services.

Are you currently enrolled in the VA healthcare system and use any of those benefits? 

**A. [IF NO]** Where do you get your healthcare from?

Have you previously used any of the digital tools or services on the va.gov website?

**A. [IF YES]** Could you tell me an example or two of the things you've done on the website, and what your experience has been? 

**B. [IF NO]** How do you prefer to interact with the VA, if not on the website?

Part of what we'll be focusing on today is how you get and manage healthcare from the VA, and how we might improve that. Are you familiar with MyHealtheVet? 

**A. [IF YES]** Tell me about some of the things that you've used it for. Was it easy to navigate?

## Transition to Tree Test
**MODERATOR:** Our team has been tasked with thinking through how we might best integrate MyHealtheVet into the VA.gov website and improve the navigation experience for those trying to get and manage their healthcare. In a moment I'll bring up a demo tool to show you what that navigation menu might look like and ask you to complete a few tasks. We'll go over it together to get your feedback. Does that sound good?

**MODERATOR:** As I mentioned, you'll be interacting with a demo tool. It will not look the site that you may be used to interacting with, but will mimic the information topics that you might click to navigate to pages from the top menu. This tool will mimic the top navigation of VA.gov. iIt's still a work in progress, there might be a few mistake or it may not function exactly the way you expect. That's okay! Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

**MODERATOR:** As part of this study, you’ll be asked to complete certain tasks on screen. As you attempt to complete these tasks, I’m going to ask that you try something called "thinking aloud.” I want you to try narrating what you see in front of you and what you might do. An example I like to give, is if someone gave me a task of calling a friend and asked me to think aloud while I do it.

"I'm pulling out my cell phone from my pocket. I see the time on the screen and I swipe up to unlock it. I'm looking for the cell phone icon and then select that. Now I see my contact list and I scroll to my friend's name. I select that, I now see the call button and click that to make a call."
I'm going to send you a link in the zoom chat. Please open it up in a web browser, and then let me know once you see it.

[Pause for confirmation]

Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen on Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together.

## Post Tree Test Follow-up Questions
**MODERATOR:** Now that you’ve completed all of the tasks, I’d like to ask you just a couple of quick follow-up questions. 

- What was the most challenging part about completing the tasks? Why?
- Was there anything good or bad that stood out?
- Did the menu options and content seem organized in a way that made sense to you?
- **[H0 only]** Did you find it helpful that all health care related topics were under “My Health” in the navigation? Did it make sense to include eligibility information and how to apply under this navigation labor or do you think that makes sense to live somewhere else?
- **[H1 only]** Did you find it helpful having the label “My Health” under Health Care? When you read that, what was your immediate thought of what kind of things would be under that label? Did you feel that this was a good organization of this information or would there have been a better way in your opinion? 

## Thank-You and Closing
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Do you have any questions or other comments for me before we sign off?

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
