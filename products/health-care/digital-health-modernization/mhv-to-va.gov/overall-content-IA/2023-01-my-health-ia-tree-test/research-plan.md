# Research Plan for My health IA, January 2023

## Background

Based on the previous tree test findings, the team iterated on the information architecture for the health hub and health apartment. As the team considers how to properly include the Health Apartment on VA.gov to ensure Veterans and Caregivers to get and manage their health care benefits, this research will help inform decisions on the information architecture of the health apartment and how it links to the broader VA.gov structure.

## OCTO Objectives

This effort supports the following OCTO objectives:
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged in users have a personalized experience, with features that saves them time and energy in applying and managing benefits

## Veteran Journey

Veteran tasks fit in the following key points in the Veteran journey:
- Primary – Starting up and Taking care of myself
- Secondary – Putting down roots, Retiring, Aging

## Research Goals

The goal of this research is to gather quantitative insights on the findability of more detailed and deeper tasks within the proposed IA of the My health patient portal experience.  

In these tree tests, we will aim to:

- Evaluate the findability of various information within the "My Health" structure
- Evaluate where participants look for information related to their health records between "Appointments", "Health history", and "Medical records"
 

## Outcome

We will use the insights from this research to validate and refine the information architecture for the health apartment. It will also help identify what additional research needs are and help inform the roadmap for the continued health apartment work.

## Research Questions

Can Veterans navigate the proposed information architecture of the My health patient portal in order to find information and complete tasks related to managing their health?

## Hypotheses

- Veterans look for will easily find travel pay if it is placed with their past appointment in the "Appointments" section.
- Veterans will more easily find their after-visit sumaries with their past appointments in the "Appointments" section than in the "Health history" section with other types of clinical notes.
- Veterans will easily find where to refill their prescriptions in a section labeled "Medications".
- Veterans will easily find historical prescription information under "Medications". 
- Veterans will easily find information on radiology images and reports within the "Lab and test results" section. 
- Veterans will easily find the vaccine history under the "Health history" section. 
- Veterans will easily find basic health data within "Health history".
- Veterans will easily find the option to download their health records under "Medical records". 
- Veterans will easily find how to order hearing aid betteries under "Medical supplies".
- Veterans will easily find how to get a VHIC under the "My health benefits" grouping. 


## Method

This research is designed to validate a more detailed representation of the IA and user flow and to see if key tasks can be completed successfully by participants.

### IA Tree Test (remote, unmoderated)

Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a tree test activity that contains 10 tasks. For each task, the participant will locate in the tree where a specific task can be completed.

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Optimal Workshop.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information (whether the Veteran has used MyHealtheVet before; whether the Veteran uses VA healthcare) on a [folder on the sensitive repo](set up and link). We want to have a meeting with Perigean before recruitment begins to make sure there is no confusion with criteria table and screener questions. 

## Recruitment criteria

We will invite a total of 54 participants for a completion rate of 40 tree tests.

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.

## Appendix A: Tasks

### Tasks 

The prioritized tasks, linked to our testing objective, were carefully curated such that they reflect how Veterans might naturally approach the website. We ensured that the answer wasn't given away by using the same language that’s in the tree itself, and we used plain language to write the tasks. Below, the parentheticals describe the general goal of the task.

**Veteran tasks**
- You drove to see your VA primary care physician and want to get paid back for the cost of gas.
- You saw your primary care provider last month and want to review what was decided for next steps in your care.  
- You need to request a refill for a prescription you get from VA by mail.
- You want to know the name of the prescription that you stopped taking last summer for a skin condition.
- You want to find the results of a recent MRI you had done.
- You need to know when you had your last tetanus shot.
- You want to know what your blood pressure was the last time you had it taken by your primary care physician.
- You want to get a copy of your VA health records for your personal files.
- You need to order new batteries for your hearing aid.
- You recently lost your ID card for your Veteran health care and need to get a new one.
