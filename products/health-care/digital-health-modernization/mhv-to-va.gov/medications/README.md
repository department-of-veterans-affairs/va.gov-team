# MHV on va.gov: Medications Product Outline
---

## Overview
Medications on MHV on VA.gov will provide Veterans with the ability to view, renew, refill, and track their VA based medications regardless of which VA facility they seek care at, as well as the ability to view and confirm non-VA medications. The new application will employ modern technology and user-centered design to ensure that the tool is accessible, straightforward, and simple to use. Moving this product onto the VA.gov platform will also provide a more seamless and consistent experience for the Veteran’s overall health care needs.

## Problem Statement
This is part of a larger initiative to move all Veteran transactions around managing their health care to a central portal, rather than having multiple websites and mobile applications to do the same medication transactions. The current application is associated with prescriptions and prescription refills, but the goal is for Veterans to think of medications they take holistically and give them information they can use to discuss with their provider. The first iteration will take what is available today in the “Prescriptions” part of MHV, but will not include self-entered medication, while VHA resolves a parallel effort looking at clinical screeners and resolving patient-entered data to the health record. 

 ### Users should be able to: 
- View all medications they are taking from VA, community, and private providers? 
 - View relevent information about medications as available, including name, images (or a11y equivalent), descriptions.)  
- Refill eligible VA prescribed medications
 - Track shipments of medication refills
 - Receive notifications of shipments (VA Notify) 
- Renew medications via secure message 
- View, download, and print all EHR-based medications and allergies
- Complete medication reconciliation digitally (possibly via a clinical screener) 
 -  View a pre-visit medications summary that outlines the medications on file for them, and that they can communicate with their provider at their visit about changes to that medication or eventually communicate digtally.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Improve transparency / reduce confusion around medications a Veteran is taking (VA and non-VA): Veterans know how to find a complete list of medications they are prescribed, as well as any relevant details about those medications. 
- Veterans are well informed about the process to refill and renew any VA medications and are able to independently take medication-related actions (refill, track, renew) online. 
- Veterans are well-informed about the status of their medications (when something needs to be refilled or renewed, shipment tracking updates, etc.) 

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Medication section doesn’t provide the user with the same functionality that they have today- causing frustration and dissatisfaction. 
- Veterans are confused about medications they are taking. 
- Misalignment in data and functionality on VA Health and Benefits Application and MHV on va.gov. 

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Enabling users to understand and self-service medication needs leads to more timely care, reduces burden on clinical staff, and increases patient safety.
*With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
- Have one web-based patient portal to enhance and improve for Veterans- rather than spending time and effort with other teams to do the same things in multiple places. 
- Easily accessible and identifiable medications list will alleviate congressional and patient safety questions. 

## Project Timeline & Activities

## Measuring Success-TBD

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_
Need to update these with the new team.

## Assumptions
- MVP will include the functionality available today in MHV Pharmacy- View and Refill Medications
- Renewal of prescriptions requires an integration with the new secure message app.
- Other “Prescriptions” applications have done research that shows what features most Veterans look for in a Medications space
- There is an acceptable alternate a11y pathway for medication images 


## Solution Approach

### MVP
Specific solution is dependent on Research and Discovery of the Medications section.

- Medications List (VA and non-VA meds) including relevant medication details & statuses that can be downloaded and printed
- Cross-link/pull content from Allergies list 
- Content: Short-term pathway for updating the medication list if needed. 
- Medication refill (current funcionality available on MHV/RX Refill App)
- Medication refill tracking 
- Connection to VA Notify for medication refill notifications 
- Connection to Secure Message App for medication renewal 

### Post MVP 
- Digital Medication reconciliation 
- Pre-filling secure messages 
- Oracle Health integration 

### Research & Discovery Phase to be completed by May 2023

- Research and Discovery of Medications Section | [Link to Initiative Brief](#)
- Define MVP and initiatives
- LoFi mockups/wireframes for Veteran research
- Journey Map/Business Process for Prescriptions/Medications
- Design intent
