## Overview
This document lays out the requirements for Medications on VA.gov. It is broken out by the phases. We expect additional functionality to be iteratively added to the tool over time during the phased rollout. 

## MVP Phase 0 
### Use cases
1. Phase 0- landing page to describe the tool and FAQs for the tool. Beyond Phase 1, FAQs about the tool will be put in a general help session for MHV on va.gov. 
2. As a user, I can see a list of all the medications I have on file with the VA. This includes both active medications and inactive/historical medications, and non-VA medications captured by VA staff. For the MVP, this does not include medications that are only on file at Cerner-based VA facilities OR medications self-entered by the Veteran.  
3. As a user, I understand which of my VA prescriptions are fillable, refillable, which need renewed, and which cannot be renewed. 
4. As a user, I can submit fill/refill requests for VA prescriptions that are currently active and understand where the refill is in the process: parked (and therefore have fills left), understand whether they are in the process of being filled, and when the medication has been dispensed. 
5. As a user, I can submit refill requests in line for VA prescriptions that are currently active and have refills left, understand whether they are in the process of being refilled, and when the medication has been dispensed.
6. As a user, I can submit a refill-all active prescription with refills left, confirm that is the transaction needed, and submit,
7. As a user, I know when recently dispensed VA prescriptions have been shipped by CMOP or local VA facility, and I can track their shipment progress and any changes that may occur with the shipment.
8. As a user, I understand what actions I need to take to renew active VA prescriptions that have no refills left. 
9. As a user, I understand what actions I need to take to get a new prescription for inactive medications. 
10. As a user, I am notified when a submitted fill or refill request is unable to filled or refilled, and undestand how to resolve the issue. 
11. As a user, I can view key data about a medication, some of which is outlined in VHA Directive 1164. 
   * Name of drug
   * Strength/dosage of drug
   * Instructions/directions for use (referred to as Indications and SIG)
   * Source of medication information (VA, Non-VA, Remote)
   * NDC (to be used to link to informational content)
   * Non-1164 requirements
     * Date prescription was ordered
     * Who ordered the prescription, and their facility
     * RX #
     * Number of refills left and quantity for each fill
     * Date prescription will expire
11. As a user, I can see a timeline of past fills/refills/renewals for each prescription.
    * For each past fill 
      * Date and time of fill request
      * Date and time requested medication was dispensed
      * Date and time dispensed medication was shipped
      * Assosciated tracking number
      * NDC (to be used to show drug image and description)
      * Any errors
    * For each past refill 
      * Date and time of refill request
      * Date and time requested medication was dispensed
      * Date and time dispensed medication was shipped
      * Assosciated tracking number
      * NDC (to be used to show drug image and description)
      * Any errors
    * For each past renewals
      * Date and time of renewal
      * Person who renewed
12. Use of pagination to show all past medications- not separate space to show meds.

#### Refilling a medication
* When a med is active, a refill is not in process, and there are refills left, a user should be able to request a refill by pressing a button. 
* For the first version of this tool, a user must click refill on each individual meds. There is no bulk med refill functionality. 
* When a prescription refill is in process, remove the ability to refill and provide a pithy explainer that the refill is in process. The button should be replaced by the estimated fill date. 
* Once a med has been dispensed, start the process over again.

#### Renewing a medication
For MVP:
* 15 days before X date (need to decide which one), alert user that a VA prescription has **no** refills left and what actions a user should take to get a VA prescription renewed. 

Post MVP:
* When a med is active, a refill is not in process, and there **no** refills left, a user should be able to request a renewal by pressing an action link. 
* When pressing the action link, initiate a pre-filled secure message to the ordering provider's triage group. In this screen, also provide a number to call AudioCare. A user should be able to edit the triage group name and also add a note.
* Process form or something that shows where the prescription is in the process
