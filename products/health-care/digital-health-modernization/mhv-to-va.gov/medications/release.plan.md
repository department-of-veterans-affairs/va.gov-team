# MHV on va.gov Medications- Release Plan
## Release Context

* _With the Medications release (and other subsequent features from MyHealtheVet) we are following the phase 0-4 approach as determined by the VA.gov leadership team.  The below summarizes the various phases and our plans to release_
* _In Phase 0 "Trusted Users", the application will be in a published state, but can only be found by knowing the URL.  In addition, users must be whitelisted to allow authentication.  Users that are not whitelisted will be redirected back to the MHV experience.  The invited users (a few hundred or less) will be provided an email address to direct feedback to.  There will be no changes to existing links or experiences on either VA.gov or MHV.
* _In Phase 1 "Try Me", a url path with be provided from MHV to the new application on VA.gov.  Users will no longer be invited/whitelisted to try the new experience.  They can also continue to use the MHV application.  Users will be asked to use the feedback feature (unlikely to provide just an email address).
* _In Phase 2 "VA.gov transitions", links will be added to both MHV and VA.gov to allow users to experience the new application.  New users from each site will be direction to this new application first.
* _In Phase 3 "MHV nudge", messaging will be added to MHV about the existing MHV messaging feature being retired on a specific date.  Additional communication about the change will start directing and informing users of the change.
* _In Phase 4 "MHV redirect to apartment", the final redirect of users will occur where all traffic will flow to the new application and the old application will no longer be accessible.

Throughout the phases, a rollout phase checklist is being completed and maintained by the leadership team. https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.planner/_djb2_msteams_prefix_3042355925?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3Anull%2C%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3A9d84a8f4d82445d6b7c9bf2fccfed313%40thread.tacv2%22%7D&groupId=72671e06-8480-4618-8a83-071bbc4e7ea3&tenantId=e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf&allowXTenantAccess=false

## Phase 0: Trusted Users

### Planning:
- Phase 0 will be in two sub-phases to allow for identification and remediation of any major issues by a smaller subset of really close, trusted users. Phase 0a will begin with production deploy and PO testing and expand to 10-20 additional staff Veterans or family members of project staff. Phase 0b will expand the user base to include ~200-300 users that signed up to participate. 
- Desired date range or test duration: November 2023- January 2024
- Desired number of users: 10-20 in Phase 0a and up to 300 for 0b
- The group(s) from which you'll recruit test users: VFS/VSP/DEPO, existing MHV Coordinators and users, list of established testers collected for other parts of the portal
- How you'll recruit test users: Recommendations from MHV leadership and coordinators for phase 0a and a direct message to those users about how and when to test. Phase 0b will be a blast email out from the shared inbox (BCC all users) with a direct follow up from one of the va.gov staff. 
- How you'll give test users access to the product: The production link has no restrictions, but can only be accessed via invite from an email. We are accepting the risk of additional users if our trusted users forward that link to others.
#### Phase 0a Entry Criteria
- All medication/prescription key data elements match across va.gov, MHV Classic, and VA Health and Benefits

#### Phase 0b Entry Criteria
