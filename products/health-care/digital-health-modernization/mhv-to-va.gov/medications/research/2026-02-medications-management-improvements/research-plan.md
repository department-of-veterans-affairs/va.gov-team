# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Enable and support Veteran users in managing their medications from the VA."
  - goal_2: "Inform and evaluate a design solution that helps users find their specific medications (including via filter and sort), understand medication processing phases and implications, and move between information/features to accomplish key tasks."
  - goal_3: "Inform the design solution implemented and illuminate what features the team should prioritize for future iterations."

research_questions:
  - "Based on the design solution, can users understand the VA’s medication processes well enough to complete their key medications tasks?"
  - "Can users accurately locate the information they need about where a medication is in the renew, refill and order process, what next steps are available and how to execute on those?"
  - "How do users move between the different interfaces of the Medications experience? What navigational tactics do users notice and use? How helpful is each one in supporting users in accomplishing their key task?"

hypotheses:
  - "Veterans will make sense of the new Medications experience based on what they’ve experienced before with VA medications, even when the design introduces new steps, labels, or processes."
  - "Veterans will notice that medications move through different phases, but won’t always understand what those phases mean or what they’re supposed to do without clear, plain-language guidance."
  - "Veterans will have an easier time completing tasks when information about what’s happening and what to do next is shown together in a clear, connected way."
  - "Veterans will have trouble finding what they need when medication information and actions are spread across multiple pages or tools instead of feeling like one connected experience."
  - "Veterans will orient themselves by medication name and status first, and will turn to filters, sorting, and navigation tools mainly when the list feels overwhelming."
  - "Clear structure, consistent language, and predictable patterns will help Veterans feel more confident and less hesitant when managing their medications."

expected_outcomes: "The insights that come out of this research will inform the design solution implemented and illuminate what features the team should prioritize for future iterations."

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>

`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**The goals of the Medications experience is to enable and support Veteran users in managing their medications.  This includes ordering, tracking, reviewing and sharing information about their medications from the VA.  Broadly, the goal of this research is to inform and evaluate a design solution that 1) helps users find their specific medications via, among other tactics, filter and sort, 2) understand the phases of medication processing and its implications for them, and 3) move between information and features to accomplish multiple key tasks.  The insights that come out of this research will inform the design solution implemented and illuminate what features the team should prioritize for future iterations.**

`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**VA.gov authenticated experience (Medications)**

`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

`2.` **Broadly, the goal of this research is to inform and evaluate a design solution that 1) helps users find their specific medications via, among other tactics, filter and sort, 2) understand the phases of medication processing and its implications for them, and 3) move between information and features to accomplish multiple key tasks.**

### Research questions
**`1.` Based on the design solution, can users understand the VA’s medication processes well enough to complete their key medications tasks?**
   - a. How do they conceptualize the process based on their previous experience?
   - b. Do they notice the phases of in progress medications? (Request submitted, refill in progress, shipped)? What do they think the phases mean? What options do they see at each point?

**`2.` Can users accurately locate the information they need about where a medication is in the renew, refill and order process, what next steps are available and how to execute on those?**
   - a. If not, where do they struggle? What are the most common stumbling blocks?
   - b. What words and language help users make sense of what is going on with their medication? What words and language confuse them?
   - c. What key words or terms do users look for when trying to find information about refilling medications, tracking medications or printing a list of their medications?

**`3.` How do users move between the different interfaces of the Medications experience? What navigational tactics do users notice and use? How helpful is each one in supporting users in accomplishing their key task? Specifically, how do they respond to the navigational tactics deployed in the design related to:**
   - a. filtering and sorting medications
   - b. page hierarchy
   - c. text based cross - links

### Hypotheses

**`1.` Veterans will make sense of the new Medications experience based on what they’ve experienced before with VA medications, even when the design introduces new steps, labels, or processes.**

**`2.` Veterans will notice that medications move through different phases, but won’t always understand what those phases mean or what they’re supposed to do without clear, plain-language guidance.**

**`3.` Veterans will have an easier time completing tasks when information about what’s happening and what to do next is shown together in a clear, connected way.**

**`4.` Veterans will have trouble finding what they need when medication information and actions are spread across multiple pages or tools instead of feeling like one connected experience.**

**`5.` Veterans will orient themselves by medication name and status first, and will turn to filters, sorting, and navigation tools mainly when the list feels overwhelming.**

**`6.` Clear structure, consistent language, and predictable patterns will help Veterans feel more confident and less hesitant when managing their medications.**
