## Background

### OCTO Priorities

**Objective 1:** Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.  
- **Key Result 1:** CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.

### Veteran Journey
1. Starting up  
2. Taking care of myself  
3. Putting down roots  
4. Retiring  

## Research Goals

### Outcomes
The goals of the Medications experience is to enable and support Veteran users in managing their medications.  This includes ordering, tracking, reviewing and sharing information about their medications from the VA.  Broadly, the goal of this research is to inform and evaluate a design solution that 1) helps users find their specific medications via, among other tactics, filter and sort, 2) understand the phases of medication processing and its implications for them, and 3) move between information and features to accomplish multiple key tasks.  The insights that come out of this research will inform the design solution implemented and illuminate what features the team should prioritize for future iterations. 

## Research Questions
1. Based on the design solution, can users understand the VA’s medication processes well enough to complete their key medications tasks?
   - a. How do they conceptualize the process based on their previous experience?
   - b. Do they notice the phases of in progress medications? (Request submitted, refill in progress, shipped)? What do they think the phases mean? What options do they see at each point?

2. Can users accurately locate the information they need about where a medication is in the renew, refill and order process, what next steps are available and how to execute on those?
   - a. If not, where do they struggle? What are the most common stumbling blocks?
   - b. What words and language help users make sense of what is going on with their medication? What words and language confuse them?
   - c. What key words or terms do users look for when trying to find information about refilling medications, tracking medications or printing a list of their medications?

3. How do users move between the different interfaces of the Medications experience? What navigational tactics do users notice and use? How helpful is each one in supporting users in accomplishing their key task? Specifically, how do they respond to the navigational tactics deployed in the design related to:
   - a. filtering and sorting medications
   - b. page hierarchy
   - c. text based cross - links


## Methodology 
### Location
60 minute video interviews over Zoom.  We will rotate the order in which tasks are asked of participants.

# Recruitment: Medications management improvements study

## Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. We will request a kickoff meeting with Perigean to align on sample needs, diversity targets, and scheduling details.

## Recruitment criteria
• Participants to schedule: 13 Veterans  
• Ideal completed sessions: 9 (minimum)  
• Caregivers: 0  
• Dependents: 0  
• Device requirement: All participants must join from a secure connection on a laptop or desktop  

## Accessibility note
We will **not** be recruiting assistive technology users because the Figma prototype is not fully compatible with assistive technologies and cannot be reliably tested with screen readers or similar tools.

## Primary criteria (must-haves)
• All participants have VA health care as a benefit  
• 8 (minimum) use the VA for their medications  
• 7 have a traumatic brain injury or cognitive disability  
• 7 are over 55 years old  
• 6 are under 55 years old  
• 4 live in a rural area  
• 4 women  
• 3 Black or African American  
• 3 Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin  
• 2 Asian  
• 1 Gay, lesbian, or bisexual  
• 4 have high school diploma as terminal degree  
• 5 have associate’s degree as terminal degree  
• No more than 4 have a bachelor’s or master’s degree as terminal degree

## Screener questions

1. Do you receive VA healthcare benefits?
o Yes (recruit)
o No (not eligible for study)

2. Do you use the VA to get your medications?
o Yes (recruit)
o No (not eligible for study)

3. If you use the VA to get your medications, how often would you guess you place an order for your medications?
o 1–2 times a year
o 3–4 times a year
o 5–12 times a year
o 13 or more times a year
o I don’t get my medications from the VA (do not recruit)

4. Have you ever been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury, PTSD, or cognitive impairment of some sort?
(We ask this because we want to make sure that our tools work for people who live with challenges like these.)
o Yes
o No
o Prefer not to say (this is a new option)

## Timeline

## Kick-off call with Perigean (proposed dates)
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. We request a 30 minute kickoff meeting with Perigean to align on what is needed and desired from the sample. Availability for potential kickoff meeting times with Perigean, depending on their availability is below. More time can be made available based on Perigean’s needs.
