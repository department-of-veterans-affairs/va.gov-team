# Recruitment: Medications management improvements study

• Caregivers: 0  
• Dependents: 0  
• Device requirement: All participants must join from a secure connection on a laptop or desktop

o 13 or more times a year
o I don’t get my medications from the VA (do not recruit)

4. Have you ever been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury, PTSD, or cognitive impairment of some sort?
