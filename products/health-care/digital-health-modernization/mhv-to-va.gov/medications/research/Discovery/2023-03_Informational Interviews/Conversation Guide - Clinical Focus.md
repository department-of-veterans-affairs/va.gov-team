## Intro

Thank you for joining us today! My name is <>. I am a user researcher with the VA within the office of the CTO. I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 

I work primarily on VA.gov and currently Iâ€™m part of a team exploring what it would take to bring MHV products to VA.gov. I work with Coulton, Lauren, and Kay on this project, who you might have heard or worked with them before. We are aware that you have worked with the VA flagship mobile team on the Rx refill project recently, and we definitely plan to sync with them and learn what they know. For this meeting, we will primarily focus on MHV pharmacy and deep dive into the clinical knowledge behind the tool. The purpose of this work is to integrate MHV more tightly with VA.gov so that we are able to deliver a more unified and complete product and service experience to Veterans.

We had a brief preliminary meeting last November. Now that we plan to officially start the medication project, we want to continue working closely with you on this work to make sure we are not only designing the best pharmacy experience for Veterans, but also incorporate you all's knowledge on the requirements of medication data. 

Lastly, a few things I want to mention before we dive in:

This entire session should take about an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. It's not a problem. 

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you? Great! Any questions before we get started?  

## General

Before we dig into some detailed questions, I will start with general questions, then we go from there:

- Can you tell me a bit about what you do at the Office of Pharmacy Benefits Management?
- Where do you expect the complete medication data list live (on MHV and backend storage)?
- Where do patients find their complete list of medications today?

## Requirements

- Rx refill status, prescription status, refill status, what does each of them mean and how they differ from each other? 
- What are the most important statuses for Veterans to see and why? 
- Can Veterans expedite the refill and renewal process for urgent medications?
- What type of medications Veterans can refill and renew online vs. onsite? 
  - Is medication filled or renewed at the same time? If not, what's the different in time? 
- What are the differences in requirements between medications for refills and medications for renewal?
  - Do refill and renewal have the same prescription statuses?
- How long before medications expire or discontinue a user should be notified?
- How long should medication data be available for on MHV? What considers start date and end date?
- Can you list all the use cases for medication data? (e.g. refilling, tracking, revewing)
- What is the reason for allergies shown on the same page as medications list?
- Is the allergies show on the medication list page medication allergies only, or all allergies?
- What are the medication requirements for CHAMPVA patients?
  - What are the similiarities and differences in MHV pharmacy functionality that CHAMPVA patients have access to compare to Veterans?
- When Veterans move or switch facilities, is there anything they need to do to receive correct medications?
  - If so, how would Veterans know that information?

## Constrains

- From a clinical point of view, what are the constraints of medication data on MHV and on My VA?
- What about any limitations for a patient?
  - Are there limitations to how a patient can renew a prescription?
  - Does the limitations for renewal apply to different types of drugs (e.g. controlled vs. not controlled substances)?
  - Are there limitations on other functionalities?
  - How do you think the limitations impact the user experience? Can you give an example?

## Treatment Plan & Pre-visit Summary 

- What is medication treatment plan?
  - What are the use cases?
  - Can patients view and download it on MHV?
- What is pre-visit summary?
  - What are the use cases?
  - Can patients view and download it on MHV?
- Is there any policy that governs what information from these two docs we need to show to users?
- Can we get a complete copy of the medication treatment plan and pre-vist summary?

### Closing

- What do you think the biggest challenges are for medication?
- What changes do you think would improve Veterans' pharmacy experience?
- If you could change any one thing about MHV pharmacy right now, what would it be?
