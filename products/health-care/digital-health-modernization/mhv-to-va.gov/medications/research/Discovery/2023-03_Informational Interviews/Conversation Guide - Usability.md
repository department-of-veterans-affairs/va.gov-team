## Intro

Thank you for joining us today! My name is <>. I am a user researcher with the VA within the office of the CTO. I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 

I work primarily on VA.gov and currently I’m part of a team exploring what it would take to bring MHV products to VA.gov. I work with Coulton, Lauren, and Kay on this project, who you might have heard or worked with them before. For this meeting, I want to hear about everything you know about we will MHV pharmacy and ask some of usability questions since you have worked on that as a <>. The purpose of this work is to integrate MHV more tightly with VA.gov so that we are able to deliver a more unified and complete product and service experience to Veterans.

Lastly, a few things I want to mention before we dive in:

This entire session should take about an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. It's not a problem. 

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you? Great! Any questions before we get started?  

## General

Before we dig into some detailed questions, I will start with general questions, then we will go from there:

- Can you tell me a bit about what you work on for MHV pharmacy (or other medication related tools)? 
- ~~What tasks do Veterans use MHV pharmacy or other medication tools to complete most often today?~~
- ~~For the previous research or usability testings you have done, did you speak with Veterans and caregivers?~~

## Product functionality

- We know about MHV, Rx Refill, and the Health and Benefits app. Are there any other ways that Veterans access their medication data today?
- ~~What actions can Veterans take on their medication list today (e.g., request a refill)?~~
- ~~What are all the different ways Veterans can learn about the status of a medication?~~
  - ~~For medications that are eligible to be refilled~~
  - ~~For medications that have been shipped~~
  - ~~For medications that are expiring and being discontinued~~
- How do Veterans request changes to their medication list today?
- How do Veterans communicate to their providers that some medications aren’t showing up or are wrong on their medication list?
- ~~What are the use cases for Veterans to review and download data for medications that they are no longer taking, or that have been discontinued, expired, or otherwise deactivated?~~

## Design

- What are the biggest issues that patients have with using the various medication-related tools available today?
- What are the biggest issues that clinicians have with the medication tools their patients use at the VA? 
- ~~What accessibility issues are you aware of that exist in the way <> functionality works today?~~
- What are the biggest issues that VA pharmacists have with the medication tools patients are use at the VA? 
- Of the three applications available (MHV, Rx Refill, Mobile), which do you think is the best and why?
- ~~What are the functionalities the app currently provides and plan to in the future?~~
- ~~Can you send us any user research and usability testing reports on <>?~~
- ~~What gap was Flagship Mobile app trying to fill for RxRefill app?~~


## AVS & PVS

- What does a pre-visit summary (PVS) help patients and their providers accomplish?
- What does an after-visit summary (AVS) help patients and their providers accomplish?
- ~~How is the PVS used today for Veterans and Clinians?~~
- ~~How can AVS and PVS help Veterans to have a better experience in their medication management journey?~~
- Is there any legal requirement or policy about AVS and PVS we have to show for medication data on VA.gov? 
- How could we make the PVS better?
- How could we make the AVS better?


### Closing
- Is there any functionality on MHV pharmacy or other medication related tools that are specific to CHAMPVA patients? 
- What are the constraints of medication data you're aware of we should know about? 
- What about legal or policy-based constraints? 
- Help us see around the corner. What do you think is the biggest challenges we will face as we develop medication functionality on VA.gov?
- ~~What changes do you think would improve Veterans' pharmacy experience?~~
- ~~If you could change any one thing about MHV pharmacy right now, what would it be?~~
