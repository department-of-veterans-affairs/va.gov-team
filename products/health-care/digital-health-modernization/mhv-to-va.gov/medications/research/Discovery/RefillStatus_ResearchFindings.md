# **Refill Status Usability Testing December 2022 Findings Report**

**RESEARCH GOALS**

This research was conducted to test new design systems that help Veterans stay up-to-date and informed while using My HealtheVet Pharmacy. The design systems include adjustments in the Refill VA Prescriptions Page chart, Medication Details page, an addition of interactive tags and hyperlinks, as well as updated definitions in the glossary.

The goals of this study are:

- Determine if introduced tags are helpful and intuitive for Veterans.
  - Determine usability of tags, links.
  - Assess user's habits when interacting with elements like tags, glossary, etc.
- Identify any pain points along the refill flow, while completing tasks within the Details page, and exploring the Refill Prescription Page.
  - Are design elements distracting, confusing for users?
- Iterate designs to empower Veterans with the information they need and want.

**RESEARCH QUESTIONS**

_Refilling a prescription_

1. Do Veterans know how to refill a prescription with the new tags and chart layout?

_Testing the new tags_

1. Do Veterans know they can interact with the new tags if there is any confusion?
2. Is the content in the tags helpful to Veterans?
3. Is the pop-up design expected and helpful?

_Finding definitions of unknown statuses_

1. Are Veterans familiar with the glossary at the bottom of the page?
2. Where do Veterans go to find definitions first? (Tags, glossary, or other?)

_Navigating the Glossary_

1. How do Veterans react to using the glossary, whether they have experience with it or not?
2. Are the definitions, specifically new definitions like Active: Parked, easy for Veterans to understand?

_Exploring the Medication Details page_

1. Do Veterans visit the Details page, and if so, why?
2. Do Veterans know what elements to interact with when they have questions about specific tasks? (i.e., what does "Active: Submitted mean?")
3. Are Veterans able to distinguish a Refill Status from a Prescription Status?

_Defining Dates_

1. Do Veterans understand the 5 different dates they may come across during their experience on the Prescription Refill page and Medication Details page?

**METHODOLOGY**

We conducted 10\* in-person tests at the Mount Vernon, Washington VA clinic on December 5th and 6th 2022. Each participant was asked to complete various tasks while using a tablet.

\*Recent snowfall greatly restricted the number of tests we expected to conduct and may have altered the demographics of the study pool.

Task 1: Refilling a prescription.

1. Refill a prescription for Boxitrol.
2. Identify if the user was successful and how they know.

Task 2: Describe the status of a prescription

1. Identify the refill status for Abormin S04.
2. Define that status.

Task 3: Find and understand definitions for new RX statuses such as Active: Parked in the Glossary.

1. Find definition for Active: Parked and report a clear understanding of the definition.

Task 4: Find RX status for Boxitrol.

1. Open Medication Details page for Boxitrol.
2. Describe definition for RX status of Active: Submitted. If unknown, user can open hyperlink pop-up containing the definition.
3. Accurately describe the difference between an RX status and Refill status.

Task 5: Have a clear understanding of the 5 different dates throughout the Refill VA Prescriptions page and Medication Details page.

1. Users are presented with 5 dates (Refill submit date, fill date, expiration date, ordered on, dispensed on) and give their own understanding of what each date means.

**HYPOTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS**

1. The new color-coded tags will accurately inform Veterans of the Refill status of their prescriptions AND indicate interactivity if Veterans have further questions regarding their refill status.
  1. LIKELY TRUE: Most participants referenced the status in the tags and had a good understanding of the status without having to open the tag. However, there were a few instances where users didn't know they could open the tag when they were unsure of what the status meant.
2. The placement of the color tags would indicate which prescriptions were ready for refill, therefore helping Veterans know what the next steps were in obtaining their prescription.
  1. LIKELY TRUE: The design reflected the current production and was not foreign to users. It should be noted that this was not a main task tested.
3. The glossary is confusing and needs to be updated.
  1. DEFINITELY TRUE: 3 out of 11 participants knew the glossary existed and only 2 of the 3 used it before.
4. The updated Medication Details page will provide helpful and more detailed information regarding refill processes and prescription statuses.
  1. MAYBE TRUE: 7 out of 11 participants knew how to open the Medication Details page and 4 of those 7 wished there was more information on the page such as allergies, side effects, etc.
5. The Prescription status on the Medication Details page, as a hyperlink, will be easily noticeable and act the same as tags creating a coherent experience for users to expect.
  1. MAYBE TRUE: 4 out of 11 participants opened the Active: Submitted hyperlink and 7 participants knew the definition without needing help. This lower rate of interaction may be attributed to knowledge of the status without needing to open the hyperlink.
6. The 5 dates Veterans are expected to know are confusing and don't provide Veterans accurate information.
  1. LIKELY TRUE: While 7 out of 11 participants didn't know what the Expiration Date meant (most thought it referred to the expiration of the medicine, not the prescription), only two other dates were difficult to 3 out of 11 – Fill Date and Ordered On.

**KEY FINDINGS**

1. **5 out of 11 participants opened the Refill status tag, while 7 referenced its contents.** Of the 5 who opened the tag, 3 of them mentioned the information icon in the tag hinted that they could click on the tag. This indicates that the content of the tag is helpful, and that users who need more information know what they can interact with to learn more.
2. **Very few participants (3 out of 11) knew of or used the glossary.** 5 participants needed guidance to the glossary and the definition for Active: Parked. Once there, only 4 of 11 had a good understanding of what the definition meant.
3. **On the Medication Details page, 4 out of 11 knew to click on the Active:**** Submitted link to open the definition.** This is not a clear indication that the link design does not work; many users understood what Active: Submitted meant and didn't need further information.
4. **The Expiration Date was incorrectly defined by 7 of 11 participants.** Other dates that were difficult for Veterans were Fill date (3 out 11 didn't know) and Ordered on (also 3 out of 11).

**DETAILS OF FINDINGS**

Universal Issues

1. **Only 3 out of 11 participants knew of or used the glossary.**

Every other user needed guidance to find the glossary and the definition for Active: Parked. Once there, users spent a noticeable amount of time scanning through the contents of the glossary before finding the appropriate definition.

"_To be honest, the minute I see this (glossary) I space out. It's really dry, to be honest….We don't pay attention if it's dark, grey and boring. If you can make it (glossary) better, then more people would see." – P8._

1. **7 of 11 didn't know the correct definition for the Expiration Date; most assumed it was the expiration of the medication, not the prescription.** Most participants answered saying "The expiration date is the date it expires." When pressed for more clarity, the majority of participants said the Expiration date is for the medicine.

"_Expiration date is the shelf life of the drug." – P3._

There was also confusion between the Expiration date and the Fill date, indicating a general confusion of how these dates work together and what is important for Veterans to know.

"_Expiration is when the medication expired I believe…No…Expiration date is my refill date. After that date I can't refill it." – P8._

1. **We wanted to see more users interact with the Refill status tags and Rx status hyperlink, but the number of successful tasks completed don't indicate a problem with the design.** Users seemed more appreciative of the contents in the tags rather than the interactivity the tags provided. Only 5 of 11 opened the Refill status tag, but 7 understood and referenced its contents. Furthermore, response to the tags was positive from both a Veterans and CBOC Coordinators perspective.

"_I really like this, it says what's going on." -P9, a new user who was starting to learn how to refill prescriptions for their partner._

"_I like the tags, that's new… I like how it's telling Veterans what's going on so vets don't have to reach out." – P3, a CBOC Coordinator._

Additional Insights

1. **5 of 11 participants wanted to see more information on the Medication details page.** Unfortunately, it was not established if these users were aware of and used the Medication Details page or if they were seeing it for the first time during these tests. Their response still warrants some attention, we believe, especially as we prepare for the merge with VA.gov – discovering why Veterans may use this page, or if they use it at all, will be helpful for future iterations.
2. **3 participants didn't know the Medication Details page existed.** Two participants mentioned leaving My HealtheVet completely to look up other information that could be found on the Details page. Keeping Veterans on MHV/VA.gov should be a priority.

"_To look for more information on this Boxitrol…I'd open a new window and go to Google on my computer." – P5._

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **Implement tags in Refill VA Prescriptions page and Medication Details page.** The positive response and additional information provided by the tags was greatly appreciated by participants, including coordinators. The tags also follow VA.gov design guidelines, creating a cohesive experience for Veterans as My HealtheVet transitions to VA.gov.
2. **Adjust chart on Refill VA Prescriptions page.** Only two participants mentioned noticing the change, but both were appreciative. The new design is meant to help with the information architecture of the page as well as prioritize what Veterans need to know as they're refilling prescriptions.
3. **Update Medication Details page with proposed designs including Rx status hyperlink and Refill status tags.** While participants didn't explicitly voice excitement about this page, the response to tags in general was positive. Furthermore, as more changes come to the Details page, having a foundational system for keeping Veterans informed with their refills is critical.
4. **Change definitions or number of dates.** Too many participants were confused by the different types of dates during the test, especially with the Expiration date. This could easily become a patient safety issue if Veterans are unsure if they are allowed to (or need to) take a critical medication near an expiration date. Clarity involving dates needs to be prioritized.
