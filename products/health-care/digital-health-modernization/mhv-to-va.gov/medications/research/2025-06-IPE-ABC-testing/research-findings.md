## Research Goals

1. Understand whether the IPE helps Veterans find their medications.
2. Understand whether the IPE encourages Veterans to use the filter component.
3. Understand where the IPE is most effective within the Medications on VA.gov IA (Information Architecture).

## Research Questions

1. Which version of the Medications List page enables Veterans to quickly find specific medications within Medications on VA.gov?  
2. Which version of the Medications List page encourages Veterans to use the filter component?
3. Which version of the Medications List page do Veterans find to be more intuitive and less difficult to use?

## Methodology

We conducted remote unmoderated ABC testing in which participants were asked to complete 3 tasks in Optimal Workshop and answer both Likert scale and open-text questions. There were 3 cohorts of participants with each cohort completing the tasks with the IPE above the filter, the IPE below the filter, or the filter open with no IPE.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **Hypothesis 1: The “filter open” version of the prototype will enable Veterans to find specific medications more easily than the other versions of the prototype.**
- _MOSTLY TRUE: More participants achieved direct success with the filter open design, but perception of ease was mixed._
- **Hypothesis 2: The “filter open” version of the prototype will enable Veterans to use the filter component more than the other versions of the prototype**
- _TRUE: 14 – 17% more participants with the filter open design used the filter immediately in tasks 2 and 3 compared to those with the IPE designs._
- **Hypothesis 3:** **The "filter open" experience option will produce lower times to complete task, higher accuracy rates, and more positive feedback.**
- _MOSTLY FALSE: The differences in time on task among the three designs are mixed and nominal at best. While direct success was higher with the filter open design, the misclick rates among the 3 designs were similar. Positive feedback was mixed among the designs._

## Key Findings

1. **Time on task was very similar among the three designs.**
2. **On tasks 2 and 3 in which the medication was not on the first page, the open filter design showed 87% direct success compared to 70 - 73% in the IPE above and IPE below designs.**
3. **Participants attempted to use the disabled sort in all tasks at approximately the same rate regardless of design.**
4. **The frequency of feedback that included phrases about how the tasks were easy, that the filter helped, and that participants would not change the designs was markedly heavier with the open filter design.**
5. **The "easy" and "very easy" responses to the Likert scale questions assessing difficulty of each task and overall were higher for the design with the IPE above the filter.**

## Details of Findings

### **Finding 1:** **Time on task was very similar among the three designs.**

Among the 3 designs, times for each task ranged from 49 – 66 seconds with an overall average of 59.3 seconds. The only finding of note would be the nominally shorter times on tasks 2 and 3 in which a filter was necessary, indicates that the filter is a time saver.

#### **Finding 2: On tasks 2 and 3 in which the medication was not on the first page, the open filter design showed 87% direct success compared to 70 - 73% in the IPE above and IPE below designs.**

Direct success can only be achieved by using the filter on tasks 2 and 3 while the medication on task 1 can be found by scrolling.

### **Finding 3: Participants attempted to use the disabled sort in all tasks at approximately the same rate regardless of design.**

This usage could be participants’ familiarity with the sort feature that has been in place since Phase 1. The volume of attempts increased from task 1 through task 3 across each design as indicated on the heat maps. 9% of participants across the cohort noted the disabled sort feature in the open text feedback while 16% mentioned alphabetical order in the feedback.

_“I tried to change the sort category to find the inhaler, but it didn’t let me do that.” – P44, Cohort B_

_“I would just have the default be alphabetical order so that way it’s easier to find medications.” – P46, Cohort A_

### **Finding 4:** **The frequency of feedback that included phrases about how the tasks were easy, that the filter helped, and that participants would not change the designs was markedly heavier with the open filter design.**

56% of participants who had the open filter design commented about the ease of the tasks compared to the 48% of IPE above the filter design participants and 49% of IPE below the filter design participants.  
<br/>21% of open filter participants stated that the filter helped them complete their tasks compared to 13% of IPE above the filter and 9% of IPE below the filter participants.

65% of open filter participants answered that they would not change anything in response to the question, “What would you change, if anything?” compared to 40% and 45% of IPE above and IPE below the filter participants, respectively.

This may indicate that the open filter design is more intuitive and less difficult to use than the two IPE designs.

### **Finding 5: The "easy" and "very easy" responses to the Likert scale questions assessing difficulty of each task and overall were higher for the design with the IPE above the filter.**

The delta between the Likert responses of the IPE above filter cohort and the other designs overall is 3.7 - 5% with a 1.4 - 6.2% difference on task 2 and 3.2 - 8.8% difference on task 3. This may indicate that the above filter IPE design is more intuitive and less difficult to use. However statistical significance analysis needs to be conducted on the raw data to reach a firm conclusion.
