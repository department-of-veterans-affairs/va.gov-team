# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medications - Filter (Jan - Feb 2025)

## Background

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We initially built and tested various iterations of Medications in MHV on VA.gov. We conducted usability studies and collected feedback that informed iterations on the website. In a previous round of usability testing, we assessed the new functionality of the filter feature. This study is intended to continue monitoring the product through usage metrics and Veteran feedback.

## Veteran Journey 

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's journey:
- Starting up 
- Taking care of myself
