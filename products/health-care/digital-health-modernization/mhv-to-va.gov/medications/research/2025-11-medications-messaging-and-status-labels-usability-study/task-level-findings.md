# Task-level summary: Medication renewal flow and prescription statuses 

This document provides a task-level synthesis of findings from remote moderated usability testing. It is intended as a supporting reference for the topline findings and offers detailed context on how participants interacted with specific screens, labels, and steps in the medication renewal experience.

Note: Not all participants completed every task. Task-level counts vary due to prototype limitations and staging constraints, which occasionally limited access to specific screens or flows during testing.

## Initial orientation on the Medications list page

All **11 of 11 participants** who completed this task recognized the page as the VA.gov Medications list, even when not all content was immediately visible.

What participants noticed first varied:

- **3 participants** (P1, P9, P10) oriented first to refill-related calls to action such as *“Refill medications”* or *“Start refill request”*  
- **3 participants** (P5, P6, P8) focused first on the medication list or medication names  
- **4 participants** (P4, P5, P12, P14) noticed medication status information early, most often through the expanded filter  
- **1 participant** (P3) recognized the page but did not initially notice the medication list because it appeared below the fold  

No participants explicitly noticed a renewal link during initial page entry. Attention was primarily drawn to refill actions, medication names, or status filters.

*“It’s the medication refill page, or medication list, where I go in and… or other veterans go in to refill their meds.”*  
*“I’m very familiar with this page as far as doing refills.”*

Note: P11 did not complete this task due to prototype limitations.

## Understanding the **Active** status

All **11 of 11 participants** who completed this task understood **Active** to mean a medication that is current and being taken.

Interpretations differed in terms of actionability:

- **7 participants** (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P8, P14) assumed an active medication could be refilled or reordered  
- **4 participants** (P2, P9, P10, P12) interpreted Active as meaning the prescription was current or “in the system,” without assuming refills were available  
- **2 participants** (P4, P6) showed hesitation while explaining their interpretation  

Several participants said that seeing refill counts would make the meaning of *Active* clearer.

*“What I don’t see is whether it has refills.”*  
*“Something’s active, so you have refills.”*  
*“It means you’re taking it right now.”*  
*“If it had # of refills left, that would be the best.”*

Note: P11 did not complete this task due to prototype limitations.

## Understanding the **In Progress** status

All **11 of 11 participants** who completed this task understood **In Progress** to mean that a medication or refill was actively being processed and had not yet shipped.

- **9 participants** (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P8, P9, P12, P14) expected it to be a short, temporary state and said they would follow up if it lasted longer than expected  
- **1 participant** (P10) understood the meaning but did not have a clear expectation for what would happen next  
- **1 participant** (P6) expressed reduced trust in the status based on past experiences  

Most participants used time spent in *In Progress* as a signal for when to take action.

*“Someone is working on it… after it’s done it should be shipped.”*  
*“The pharmacist has the prescription and they’re just waiting to fill it and send it out.”*  
*“Depends how available it is.”*  
*“I don’t trust in-progress… it went on way too long.”*

Note: P11 did not complete this task due to prototype limitations.

## Understanding the **Inactive** status

All **11 of 11 participants** who completed this task interpreted **Inactive** as a medication that is finished, expired, discontinued, or no longer refillable.

- **9 participants** associated Inactive with needing to contact a provider if they wanted the medication again  
- Several participants described inactive medications as older or historical items that remain visible in the list  
- **1 participant** (P1) noticed inconsistent availability of renewal links for inactive medications  

*“You need to call doctor to get a new script.”*  
*“If I need it I need to get back with my provider.”*  
*“I got all these medications I used to take… but they’re still there.”*  
*“I wish I could click on this box on this screen and have it renewed.”*

Note: P11 did not complete this task due to prototype limitations.

## Distinguishing **refill** versus **renewal**

Participants varied in how clearly they distinguished refill from renewal.

- **8 of 13 participants** (P1, P3, P4, P6, P8, P9, P11, P12) clearly differentiated the two concepts  
- **5 participants** (P2, P5, P10, P14, and partially P5) showed uncertainty or used the terms interchangeably  

Participants who differentiated described refill as continuing an existing prescription and renewal as requiring provider review or action.

*“Refill means you have refill medications and can order anytime.”*  
*“Renewal most likely I need a new order for it.”*  
*“…they know a renewal is the entire medication. A refill is, like, oh, they ran out of refills.”*  
*“Because some, some, medications expire.”*

Participants who did not differentiate framed both actions as simply “getting more medication.”

*“Refill and what? [renewal]”*  
*“Could be either one.”*  
*“Refill and renewal is basically the same thing.”*

## Confusion around status behavior rather than label meaning

Most participants did not struggle to understand the basic meaning of the labels themselves. Instead, confusion emerged around how statuses behave, what actions are available, and how to manage older medications.

- **7 of 12 participants** expressed uncertainty related to status behavior  
- Confusion was most often tied to inactive or very old medications  

*“I don’t like to see all those [expired medications] because then it’s convoluted.”*  
*“I didn’t know at what point something goes into the inactive list.”*  
*“Only point of confusion is what ‘Active-non VA’ means.”*

By contrast, **5 participants** described the statuses as straightforward or familiar.

## Discovering the renewal link

Discovery of the renewal link was mixed and strongly shaped by existing habits.

- **7 of 12 participants** noticed the renewal link organically  
- **5 of 12 participants** relied on familiar behaviors instead  

Alternative paths included refilling, Secure Messaging, calling a provider, or scrolling without recognizing the link.

*“That’s… I’ve not seen that before, that’s a new thing for me.”*  
*“I would just send a secure message.”*

---

## Interpreting the modal

Most participants understood the modal as an informational transition to Secure Messaging.

*“It means I’m going to a different screen, but I’m still logged in.”*  
*“Instead of me coming out of the medication and going into the messages, it put me in there.”*

A small number briefly questioned whether it was a warning or error.

---

## Prefilled renewal message

Most participants noticed and valued the prefilled renewal message.

- **10 of 12 participants** explicitly noticed the prefill  
- **9 participants** sent it as-is  
- **3 participants** wanted optional personalization  

*“Oh everything’s already there, I love it.”*  
*“That saves people a lot of time.”*

---

## Confirmation and next steps

Most participants understood their request was sent, but confirmation visibility varied.

- **9 of 12 participants** noticed the success alert  
- **3 participants** sought confirmation elsewhere  

*“It says Message sent.”*  
*“Once the doc approves it, it should appear as in progress.”*

---

## Missing information scenarios

When medication details were missing, confidence dropped and workarounds emerged.

Participants described going back to medication details, copying information, printing pages, or abandoning the flow.

*“There’s nothing to be sent.”*  
*“You don’t know the medication unless you actually have it with you.”*

---

## Overall impressions across tasks

Most participants were able to complete the renewal request and felt confident once it was submitted.

**8 of 12 participants** described the experience as easy or intuitive.

*“It was awesome… easy… simple… to the point.”*  
*“Pretty simple, once you do it a few times.”*

A smaller group described the experience as fully familiar.

*“So far, it’s already familiar.”*  
*“Nothing. No… I love this system. It works very well.”*
