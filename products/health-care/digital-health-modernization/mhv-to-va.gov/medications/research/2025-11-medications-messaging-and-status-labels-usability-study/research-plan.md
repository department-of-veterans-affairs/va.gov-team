**RESEARCH PLAN**


# **Status updates and SM renewal flow user testing**


## Background

We are building a new, online authenticated user flow for prescription renewal requests on My HealtheVet on VA.gov. Currently, to renew a prescription a Veteran has to contact their provider by phone or in person to request a renewal. In an effort to create an in-product option on [VA.gov](VA.gov), as well as create parity for Oracle Health users on My VA Health, we created a new flow wherein a user can send a pre-populated secure message (SM) to their provider to request a renewal of their eligible medication.

We have also created a new set of prescription statuses that will be implemented in both Oracle Health and VistA. The existing VistA statuses have been frequently cited as being confusing to users so we have moved to simplify the statuses hoping to more clearly and simply communicate to users what the status of their medication is.

### OCTO-DE Priorities

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.


### Veteran Journey



* Starting up
* Taking Care of Myself
* Aging
* Dying

## Research goals


### Goals



1. Evaluate whether Veterans understand the meaning of all of the new prescription statuses and if not, which ones cause confusion and/or Veterans think means something else.
2. Evaluate if Veterans can successfully use the renewal flow to request a renewal of their medications and if not where they fail in the intended flow.
3. Identify any pain points or uncertainties the Veterans experience while using the new renewal flow that it is possible to address with the design.


### Outcome

The results of this study will show if the new medication statuses improve Veterans’ understanding of their medications and determine what parts of the medication renewal designs work for users and which parts need to be adapted.  


### Research questions



1. Do users understand the prescription statuses? If not, what do they think the statuses mean? What parts confuse them?
2. Can Veterans successfully and easily request a medication renewal with the new renewal through SM flow on [VA.gov](VA.gov)?
3. What about this experience appeals to and enables users? 
4. What changes would Veterans make to the flow to improve their experience?


### Hypotheses



1. Most Veterans will think the new medication statuses are logical.
2. Some Veterans will equate refill and renewal and be confused.
3. Most Veterans will be able to successfully place a renewal request using the new SM flow.

## Methodology

We will conduct remote moderated usability testing sessions with 10 Veterans using a test user on staging. We will observe the user behavior and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

We will need to set up a staging user that has the conditions:



* Medications feature new statuses
* Has renewable medication(s)
* New SM renewal flow is fully functional

After each session we will:



* Change the password
* Reset the renewal

Primary user tasks:



* Identify or match description of medication status to medication shown in status  
* Request a medication renewal 


### Location

Video interviews over Zoom (or other platform)

## Recruitment


### Recruitment approach

We will ask Perigean to help us recruit participants. We request a kickoff meeting with Perigean to align on what is needed and desired from the sample. Availability for potential kickoff meeting times with Perigean, depending on their availability is below.

**Recruitment criteria**

We would like Veteran users who have VA health care, use MHV on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) to manage their healthcare, and, specifically, use [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) for prescription management. We also want a participant pool that is representative of the Veteran population. A more complete breakdown that is in line with VA Equity Checker can be found in the recruitment ticket.  **Require 10 completed sessions with Veterans, schedule 15 participants.**

**Recruitment rationale \
**These percentages were scaled to a 15-person sample to guide a mix of ages, disabilities, genders, races/ethnicities, and rural perspectives. We’re also planning for a balance of desktop and smartphone users and hope to include a few AT users to help uncover potential accessibility barriers. If any of these are difficult to meet, please reach out and we can discuss.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**



* At least 7 participants able to test on desktop/laptop
* At least 8 participants able to test on smartphone
* At least 8 participants who identify as having a cognitive disability
* At least 8 participants who are 55+ in age
* At least 8 participants who are 54 and under in age
* At least 2 participants who identify as women
* At least 4 participants from rural areas
* No more than 2 can have no prescriptions with the VA
* No more than 3 can not use MHV on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) to manage their prescriptions 

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**



* At least 4 participants with a high school degree but not college
* At least 2 participants who identify as Black or African American
* At least 2 participants who identify as Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish origin
* At least 1 participant who uses a screen reader and 1 who uses screen magnification
