# Task-level insights: Medication renewal flow and status study

This report summarizes findings from a usability study with **12 Veterans** examining recent updates to medication status labels and the medication renewal experience on My HealtheVet (MHV) on VA.gov. The research focused on whether these changes help Veterans understand medication status, successfully request renewals using the Medications and Secure Messaging flow, and where confusion or drop-off occurs. Findings highlight what is working well and where targeted design or content improvements could improve clarity and confidence.

## Part 1: Understanding medication statuses

### What participants noticed first on the Medications list page

When participants first landed on the Medications list page, what they noticed and how they oriented themselves varied.

- **Refill actions (P1, P9, P10):** Some participants immediately focused on calls to action such as “Refill medications” or “Start refill request.”
- **Medication list (P5, P6, P8):** Others oriented first to the medication names and the list itself.
- **Status information (P4, P5, P12, P14):** A smaller group noticed medication statuses early, often through the filter.

**Representative quotes**
- **P2:** “It’s the medication refill page, or medication list, where I go in and… or other veterans go in to refill their meds.”
- **P3:** “I’m very familiar with this page as far as doing refills.”

**Note:** P3 did not initially notice the medication list because it appeared below the fold and required prompting to scroll.

### How participants interpreted the “Active” status

All 11 participants who completed this task understood **Active** to mean a medication that is current and being taken. However, assumptions about what could be done with an active medication varied.

**Assumed refillable (7 participants: P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P8, P14)**
- **P1:** “Something’s active, so you have refills.”
- **P6:** “Active means I can reorder.”
- **P8:** “Active means you’re able to refill it.”

**Understood as current, not necessarily refillable (4 participants: P2, P9, P10, P12)**
- **P2:** “If a medication is active, then you don’t need a refill. It means you’re taking it right now.”

**Confidence and uncertainty**
- **P4:** “Hold on, I may be confused. I’m confused now.”
- **P6:** “The way things have gone on this site… 50/50.”

**What participants wanted**
Several participants said refill counts would reduce ambiguity.
- **P12:** “What I don’t see is whether it has refills.”
- **P12:** “If it had number of refills left, that would be the best.”

### How participants interpreted the “In Progress” status

All 11 participants understood **In Progress** to mean a medication or refill was actively being worked on and had not yet shipped.

**Expected to be temporary (9 participants: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P8, P9, P12, P14)**
- **P1:** “Someone is working on it… after it’s done it should be shipped.”
- **P2:** “The pharmacist has the prescription and they’re just waiting to fill it and send it out.”

**Unclear expectations (P10)**
- **P10:** “It hasn’t been filled yet… depends how available it is.”

**Distrust based on past experience (P6)**
- **P6:** “I don’t trust in-progress in some ways… it went on way too long.”

**How long felt reasonable**
- 2–3 days (P9, P12)
- “A couple of days” (P1, P8)
- Up to a week (P3)
- 10–12 days (P4)

Most participants said they would reach out if the status did not change within their expected timeframe.

---

### How participants interpreted the “Inactive” status

All 11 participants understood **Inactive** to mean a medication that was finished, expired, discontinued, or no longer refillable.

**Linked to provider follow-up (9 participants: P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P8, P9, P12, P14)**
- **P3:** “Inactive means the refills have run out.”
- **P5:** “You need to call doctor to get a new script.”
- **P12:** “If I need it I need to get back with my provider.”

**Confusion and frustration**
- **P1** noticed some inactive medications had renewal links while others did not.
- Several participants were frustrated by very old medications remaining visible:
  - **P5:** “I got all these medications I used to take… many years ago… but they’re still there.”

Some participants wanted to take action directly:
- **P6:** “I wish I could click on this box on this screen and have it renewed.”

---

### Refill vs. renewal understanding

**Clear understanding (8 participants: P1, P3, P4, P6, P8, P9, P11, P12)**
- **P1:** “Refill means you have refill medications and can order anytime. Renewal means you need to send a renewal request to your doctor.”
- **P3:** “Renewal most likely I need a new order for it.”
- **P11:** “A refill is when they ran out of refills. A renewal is the entire medication.”

**Mixed or unclear understanding (5 participants: P2, P5, P10, P14)**
- **P2:** “Refill and what? [renewal]”
- **P10:** “Could be either one… just a different way to word them.”
- **P14:** “Refill and renewal is basically the same thing.”

---

### Where confusion actually came from

Participants were generally comfortable with the labels themselves. Confusion more often came from how statuses behaved in practice.

- **7 participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P9)** had questions about:
  - When medications move between statuses
  - Who receives renewal requests
  - What “In Progress” includes
  - Less familiar labels such as “Active – Non-VA”

Others found the experience straightforward.
- **P14:** “If I can do it, anyone can do it.”

---

### Clutter and organization concerns

Several participants felt overwhelmed by long medication histories.

**Representative quotes**
- **P1:** “I don’t like to see all those expired medications because then it’s convoluted.”
- **P3:** “Would be nice to see what active, inactive… what all that means.”

---

### Accessibility observations

**Dragon (P3)**
- No technical issues selecting elements by voice
- Content below the fold was often missed
- Did not scroll without prompting
- Status descriptions in filters were not read
- Suggested a legend to explain statuses
- Repeated label text caused confusion (“Reason for use not available”)

**JAWS (P11)**
- Valued detailed information: “I like to be informed.”
- Instructional text without links could be missed
- Appreciated prefilled details: “This is beautiful to me.”
- Missed an error alert
- Trusted auto-generated content: “If it’s auto generated, I’m going to leave it alone.”

**Mobile and tablet (P4, P10)**
- **P10:** “Very very difficult to navigate through mobile device, too small to see.”

---

## Part 2: Renewal flow

### Finding the renewal link

Discovery of the renewal link varied widely.

- **6 participants (P1, P3, P5, P6, P8, P9)** noticed it naturally once they reached the medication card.
- **7 participants (P2, P4, P10, P11, P12, P14)** relied on familiar behaviors:
  - Going directly to Secure Messaging
  - Using “Start a refill request”
  - Looking for a phone number

When medications were not found through those paths, several participants left the Medications experience entirely.

---

### Confidence after discovering the link

Even after finding the renewal link, some participants were unsure it was the right action.

- **P1:** “Hopefully it’s my doctor, but it doesn’t tell you.”
- **P2:** “I don’t know who it directs it to.”

---

### Modal and care team selection

Most participants understood the modal as a handoff to Secure Messaging and continued without hesitation.

- **P1:** “It means I’m going to a different screen, but I’m still logged in.”
- **P4:** “Instead of me coming out of the medication and going into the messages, it put me in there.”

Care team selection strategies varied. Some felt confident choosing based on medication type, while others guessed or relied on defaults.

---

### Reaction to the prefilled message

The prefilled message was one of the strongest positive moments in the flow.

- **10 of 12 participants** explicitly noticed and valued it:
  - **P1:** “Oh everything’s already there, I love it.”
  - **P2:** “That saves people a lot of time.”
  - **P9:** “I don’t want to have to copy down stuff.”

Most sent the message as-is or with minimal personalization.

---

### Confirmation and next steps

- **9 participants** noticed the confirmation alert.
- **3 participants** sought reassurance elsewhere, such as checking Sent Messages.

Participants generally relied on prior experience to understand what would happen next.

---

## Part 3: When information was missing

When key medication details were missing from the prefilled message, confidence dropped quickly.

- Most participants did not notice the yellow alert.
- Many inferred something was wrong based on empty fields.
- Participants were unwilling to guess important information.

**Workarounds**
- Returning to medication details
- Copying and pasting information
- Printing medication lists
- Writing explanatory notes

Some participants exited the flow entirely to try again later.

---

## Part 4: Experience-wide insights

### Overall impressions

Despite moments of confusion, **8 of 12 participants** described the experience as easy, simple, or intuitive.

- **P1:** “It was awesome… easy… simple… to the point.”
- **P9:** “Seems very intuitive and very basic.”

### Ongoing opportunities

Participants consistently pointed to:
- Information density and clutter
- Clearer status progression
- Stronger visual emphasis on key actions

---

## Key recommendations

**High priority**
- Make renewal links easier to find
- Reduce competing paths that lead to dead ends
- Clarify what statuses mean and what happens next
- Improve handling of missing information
- Reduce clutter from older inactive medications

**Medium priority**
- Strengthen confirmation signals
- Clarify refill vs. renewal terminology
- Provide guidance when selecting care teams

**Accessibility**
- Improve screen reader flow and alert visibility
- Address mobile navigation challenges

## Methodology note

This study included 12 participants. P11 did not complete Task 1 due to prototype limitations with JAWS. All other participants completed both tasks. One participant used Dragon (P3), one used JAWS (P11), and several used mobile devices.
