#Task-level insights: Medication renewal flow and status study

This report summarizes findings from a usability study with 12 Veterans focused on how they understand medication statuses and how they request medication renewals on VA.gov. Participants used a range of devices and assistive technologies, including Dragon voice control, JAWS screen reader, mobile phones, and tablets.

## Part 1: Understanding Medication Statuses

### First impressions on the Medications list page

When participants first landed on the Medications list page, what they noticed - and how they oriented themselves - varied.

- **Refill actions (P1, P9, P10):** Some participants immediately focused on calls to action like "Refill medications" or "Start refill request."
- **Medication list (P5, P6, P8):** Others oriented first to the medication names and list itself.
- **Status information (P4, P5, P12, P14):** A smaller group noticed medication statuses early, often through the filter.

**Representative quotes:**

- **P2:** "It's the medication refill page, or medication list, where I go in and… or other veterans go in to refill their meds."
- **P3:** "I'm very familiar with this page as far as doing refills."

**Note:** P3 did not initially notice the medication list because it appeared below the fold and required prompting to scroll.

### How participants interpreted the "Active" status

#### What "Active" meant

All 11 participants who completed this task understood **Active** to mean a medication that is current and being taken. However, assumptions about what could be done with an active medication varied.

- **7 participants (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P8, P14)** assumed active medications could be refilled:
  - **P1:** "Something's active, so you have refills."
  - **P6:** "Active means I can reorder."
  - **P8:** "Active means you're able to refill it."

- **4 participants (P2, P9, P10, P12)** understood the medication was current but did not assume refills were available:
  - **P2:** "If a medication is active, then you don't need a refill - it means you're taking it right now."

#### Confidence and uncertainty

While many participants felt reasonably confident, some hesitated or second-guessed themselves:

- **P4:** "Hold on, I may be confused. I'm confused now."
- **P6:** "The way things have gone on this site…50/50."

#### What participants wanted to see

Several participants said refill counts would help remove ambiguity:

- **P12:** "What I don't see is whether it has refills."
- **P12:** "If it had # of refills left, that would be the best."

---

### How participants interpreted the "In Progress" status

#### General understanding

All 11 participants understood **In Progress** to mean a medication or refill was actively being worked on and had not yet shipped.

- **9 participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P8, P9, P12, P14)** expected it to be temporary:
  - **P1:** "Someone is working on it… after it's done it should be shipped."
  - **P2:** "The pharmacist has the prescription and they're just waiting to fill it and send it out."

- **P10** understood the status but was unsure what to expect next:
  - **P10:** "It hasn't been filled yet… Depends how available it is."

- **P6** expressed distrust based on past experiences:
  - **P6:** "I don't trust in-progress in some ways… it went on way too long."

#### How long "In Progress" felt reasonable

Expectations varied:

- 2-3 days (P9, P12)
- "A couple of days" (P1, P8)
- Up to a week (P3)
- 10-12 days (P4)

Most said they would reach out if the status did not change within that window.

---

### How participants interpreted the "Inactive" status

#### What "Inactive" meant

All 11 participants understood **Inactive** as a medication that was finished, expired, discontinued, or no longer refillable.

- **9 participants (P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P8, P9, P12, P14)** connected this status with needing to contact a provider:
  - **P3:** "Inactive means the refills have run out."
  - **P5:** "You need to call doctor to get a new script."
  - **P12:** "If I need it I need to get back with my provider."

#### Confusion and frustration

- **P1** noticed that some inactive medications showed renewal links while others did not, which made next steps unclear.
- Several participants were frustrated that very old medications remained visible:
  - **P5:** "I got all these medications I used to take… many years ago… but they're still there."

Some participants wished inactive medications could be acted on directly:

- **P6:** "I wish I could click on this box on this screen and have it renewed."

---

### Refill vs. renewal: how well participants understood the difference

#### Clear understanding (8 participants)

Participants **P1, P3, P4, P6, P8, P9, P11, P12** clearly distinguished between refills and renewals:

- **P1:** "Refill means you have refill medications and can order anytime. Renewal means… you need to send a renewal request to your doctor."
- **P3:** "Renewal most likely I need a new order for it."
- **P11:** "A refill is… they ran out of refills. A renewal is the entire medication."

#### Mixed or unclear understanding (5 participants)

Participants **P2, P5, P10, P14** sometimes used the terms interchangeably or expressed uncertainty:

- **P2:** "Refill and what? [renewal]"
- **P10:** "Could be either one… Just a different way to word them."
- **P14:** "Refill and renewal is basically the same thing."

---

### Where confusion actually came from

Participants were generally comfortable with the labels themselves. Confusion more often came from how statuses behaved in practice.

- **7 participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P9)** had questions about:
  - When medications move between statuses
  - Who receives renewal requests
  - What "In Progress" includes
  - Less familiar labels like "Active - Non-VA"

Others found the experience straightforward:

- **P14:** "If I can do it, anyone can do it."

---

### Clutter and organization concerns

Several participants felt overwhelmed by long medication histories and older medications remaining visible.

**Representative quotes:**

- **P1:** "I don't like to see all those [expired medications] because then it's convoluted."
- **P3:** "Would be nice to see what active, in-active… what all that means."

---

### Accessibility observations

#### Dragon (P3)

- No technical issues selecting elements by voice
- Content below the fold was often missed
- Did not scroll without prompting
- Status descriptions in filters were not read
- Suggested a legend to explain statuses
- Repeated label text caused confusion ("Reason for use not available")

#### JAWS (P11)

- Valued detailed information: "I like to be informed."
- Instructional text without links could be missed
- Appreciated prefilled details: "This is beautiful to me."
- Missed an error alert
- Trusted auto-generated content: "If it's auto generated, I'm going to leave it alone."

#### Mobile and tablet (P4, P10)

- **P10:** "Very very difficult to navigate through mobile device, too small to see."

---

## Part 2: Renewal Flow

### Finding the renewal link

Discovery of the renewal link varied widely.

- **6 participants (P1, P3, P5, P6, P8, P9)** noticed it naturally once they reached the medication card.
- **7 participants (P2, P4, P10, P11, P12, P14)** did not notice it and relied on familiar behaviors instead, such as:
  - Going directly to Secure Messaging
  - Using "Start a refill request"
  - Looking for a phone number to call

When participants followed familiar paths and could not find their medication, several left the Medications experience entirely.

---

### Questions after discovering the link

Even after noticing the renewal link, some participants were not fully confident it was the right action.

**Representative quotes:**

- **P1:** "Hopefully it's my doctor, but it doesn't tell you."
- **P2:** "I don't know who it directs it to."

---

### Understanding the modal

Most participants understood the modal as a handoff to Secure Messaging and continued without hesitation.

- **P1:** "It means I'm going to a different screen, but I'm still logged in."
- **P4:** "Instead of me coming out of the medication and going into the messages, it put me in there."

Any uncertainty was brief and resolved quickly.

---

### Choosing a care team

Participants selected care teams using different strategies:

- Some felt confident choosing based on medication type
- Others guessed, relied on defaults, or hesitated

Having multiple options was helpful for some, including **P11**.

---

### Reaction to the prefilled message

The prefilled message was one of the strongest positive moments in the flow.

- **10 of 12 participants** explicitly noticed and valued it:
  - **P1:** "Oh everything's already there, I love it."
  - **P2:** "That saves people a lot of time."
  - **P9:** "I don't want to have to copy down stuff."

Most participants sent the message as-is or with only a brief personal note.

---

### Confirmation and next steps

- **9 participants** noticed the green confirmation alert.
- **3 participants** looked elsewhere for reassurance, such as checking Sent messages.

Participants generally relied on past experience to understand what would happen next.

---

## Part 3: When information was missing

When key medication details were missing from the prefilled message, confidence dropped quickly.

- Most participants did not notice the yellow alert
- Many inferred something was wrong based on empty fields

Participants were generally unwilling to guess important information.

### Workarounds and abandonment

Participants described several strategies:
- Returning to medication details
- Copying and pasting information
- Printing medication lists
- Writing explanatory notes

Some participants exited the flow entirely to try again later.

---

## Part 4: Experience-wide insights

### Overall impressions

Despite moments of confusion, **8 of 12 participants** described the experience as easy, simple, or intuitive.

- **P1:** "It was awesome… easy… simple… to the point."
- **P9:** "Seems very intuitive and very basic."

### Ongoing opportunities for improvement

Participants consistently pointed to:
- Information density and clutter
- Clearer status progression
- Stronger visual emphasis on key actions

---

## Key recommendations

### High priority

- Make renewal links easier to find on medication cards
- Reduce competing paths that lead to dead ends
- Better explain what statuses mean and what happens next
- Improve handling of missing information
- Reduce clutter from older, inactive medications

### Medium priority

- Strengthen confirmation signals
- Clarify refill vs. renewal terminology
- Provide more guidance when selecting care teams

### Accessibility-specific

- Improve screen reader flow and alert visibility
- Address mobile navigation challenges

## Methodology note

This study included 12 participants. P11 did not complete Task 1 due to prototype limitations with JAWS. All other participants completed both tasks. One participant used Dragon (P3), one used JAWS (P11), and several used mobile devices.
