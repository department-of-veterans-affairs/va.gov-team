### <a name="background"></a>Background

We are building a new authenticated prescription renewal request flow on VA.gov (via Secure Messaging) to reduce Veterans’ dependence on phone calls and ad-hoc communication for renewals. We are also introducing a new, simplified set of prescription status labels across Oracle Health and VistA to replace existing VistA statuses that are frequently cited as confusing or misleading. We need to understand whether these changes improve Veterans’ ability to understand medication state and manage renewals independently.

The product is situated within authenticated VA.gov, specifically the medications management and Secure Messaging experiences within My HealtheVet on VA.gov. The experience builds on existing My HealtheVet and VA.gov medications and Secure Messaging tools that many Veterans already use. The status labels and the specific renewal flow design are new iterations on existing functionality, not an entirely new product.

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

We conducted remote, moderated usability testing sessions with **12 Veterans** to evaluate how they understand new prescription status labels and use the Secure Messaging–based prescription renewal flow on VA.gov.
Sessions were 60 minutes and used a think-aloud approach, combining a staging environment test user and Figma prototypes to cover both interactions and additional scenarios that could not be reliably tested in staging.

Sessions were divided into two primary parts:

**Part 1: Participants reviewed prescription statuses**  
Participants reviewed medication list screens featuring the new prescription status labels and described what they noticed, how they interpreted each status, and what actions they believed were available. This helped us understand Veterans’ mental models around medication state and where status language or presentation caused confusion or misinterpretation.

**Part 2: Participants attempted to request a prescription renewal**  
Participants attempted to request a medication renewal using the Secure Messaging–based flow, from entry point through confirmation, using a staging test user where the flow was fully functional. A Figma prototype was used to explore additional status and renewal scenarios. This helped us understand whether Veterans could successfully complete the renewal request, where they struggled or hesitated, and what aspects of the flow influenced confidence or uncertainty.

### <a name="goals"></a>Research goals

The goals of this research were to:

1. Evaluate whether Veterans understand the meaning of the new prescription statuses and identify which statuses or label elements cause confusion or misinterpretation.

2. Evaluate whether Veterans can successfully and efficiently use the new Secure Messaging renewal flow on VA.gov to request renewals, and identify where they struggle or drop off.

3. Identify pain points, uncertainties, and other usability issues in the new renewal flow and status messaging that can reasonably be addressed through design and content changes.

### <a name="testing"></a>Screens and paths used in testing

This study used a combination of **live or staging experiences** and **design prototypes** to evaluate user behavior, understanding, and decision-making. Screens and paths are grouped by **design intent**, rather than by tool, to clarify what each version was meant to test.
