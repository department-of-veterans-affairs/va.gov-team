# Observer notes template (simplified): Status updates and SM renewal flow user testing

## Section 1: Set-up
Before we begin, can you tell us a bit about your computer setup (your device, your settings, any assistive technology tools or strategies you use when you're working with VA.gov)?



## Section 2: Participant coaching / Figma prototype

One note before we begin our questions. Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can’t see your screen.  
Does that make sense?



## Section 3: First task (Status comprehension)

Tell me what you see on the page.



What can you tell me about what’s going on with your prescriptions?



What can you tell me about your PEPCID medication? (“active status”)



What can you tell me about your LOPRESSOR medication? (“in progress status”)



What can you tell me about AMOXICILLIN medication? (make med in “inactive status”)



Now, imagine that you take a medication regularly. You notice that you are running out of pills. Using this page, do you think you could get more of your med?



Rash scenario: Imagine that you had a bad rash a couple of years ago. Your doctor gave you a medication and it went away. Now, that rash is back. Do you think that you could find the medication you took on this page? What would you look for?



Ok, now imagine that you have successfully requested a refill for that rash medication. Where would you look for it?



How would you differentiate between a 'refill' and a 'renewal'? Is there a difference between those terms to you?



Is there anything confusing to you about the medications that are out of refills?



### Follow-up questions before moving to Task 2

Were you able to access status information for the medications you looked at?



What did you think of the different prescription statuses, and how they are described?



Does anything about the different statuses feel overwhelming or hard to process?



Have you seen a status like this before on My HealtheVet? How is this similar or different from what you're used to seeing?



How would you like to learn that the words we use to describe statuses have changed, if at all?



[For AT users:] Did any part of reviewing the statuses feel harder because of using a screen reader or speech input?



Anything else about statuses that you’d like to share?



## Section 4: Second task (Request a renewal)

For the second set of questions, I'm going to have you follow the link that I have just pasted into the chat.

### List Page

You have a prescription for SUNSCREEN-30 PABA-FREE COMBINATION LOT that your pharmacy told you is out of refills. What would you do if you needed more of this medication?



Now that you’ve found the renewal link, how would you request more of this medication?



Do you see the words “Request a renewal”? What do you think that means?



### Modal dialog

What do you think this screen is for?



What do you think you should do next?



Do you find this screen to be helpful?



### Care team selection

Who would you select here, and why?



If you weren't sure which provider to choose, what would you do?



### Prefilled Renewal Request Message Content

What do you notice on this page?



Would you edit or add additional information to this message at all?



What would you do next to request more medication?



(AT: Do screen reader users recognize that there is prefilled medication information, and what they need to do with it?)



### Confirmation: medications list page

Where are you now?



How do you know your request was successful?



What do you expect to happen next?



How will you know when your renewal request has been processed?



Imagine you're telling a friend about this experience. Would you tell them this is easy or hard to use? Why?



### Follow-up questions

Did anything in the process feel overwhelming or hard to process?



What, if anything, would you change about this process?



[AT users:] Did any part of the process feel harder because of using a screen reader or speech input?



[AT users:] If you were teaching someone else who uses a screen reader or speech input to do this, what would you warn them about?



### Error scenario / missing info page

"Before we wrap up Task 2, I'd like to show you one more thing.  
Can you please go to the link I have just pasted into the chat: https://tinyurl.com/48smhma5  
Please select one of the care teams and click Continue.  
Imagine you tried to request a renewal for this medication, but when you clicked the link to send a message to request a renewal, you were taken to this page. What would you do next?



Would you go somewhere to find the information that's missing?



## Section 5: Closing questions

Overall, how easy or difficult would you say it was to request a renewal?



Overall, how easy or difficult would you say it was to understand the prescription statuses?



Of everything you looked at today, what would you say was the most confusing to you and why?



Is there anything else you would like to share that we have not covered?
