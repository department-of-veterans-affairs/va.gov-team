# Medications list: what we saw and learned

## Why Veterans use the Medications list
Across sessions, Veterans treated the Medications list as a central hub rather than a page with a single purpose.

- **Start an action (refill or renew)**  
  Several participants oriented first to refill-related calls to action (P1, P9, P10). This reinforced the Medications list as the primary starting point for medication-related tasks.

- **Check status and progress**  
  Veterans looked to the Medications list to understand medication status (filter usage varied.) Some relied on filters, while others relied on scanning the list.  
  Status information was often noticed through filtering (P4, P5, P12), though many participants preferred to scroll rather than apply filters.

- **Look up medication details when blocked**  
 When required information was missing from renewal messages, Veterans used the Medications list to gather prescription details, either directly from the medication card or by clicking into the medication’s details page.  
  > “Click on the little link… copy the script number… leave this area, go into secure messaging, paste it in.” (P11)  
  This behavior was also observed with P2, P6, and P12.

- **Confirm that an action worked**  
 After submitting a renewal, some Veterans went back to the Medications list or Secure Messaging to make sure the request was sent or to see if the medication status had changed (P1, P5, P12).

- **Reference historical or inactive medications**
Veterans used inactive or historical medications as a reference when they needed context or missing information about a prescription, especially during renewal tasks.
Some expected to check inactive medications when details needed for a renewal were not available elsewhere (P2).

## What we learned about filters
- Filters helped some Veterans quickly find medications by status (P2, P5, P9).
- Other Veterans did not use filters and instead scrolled through the list to understand their medications (P1, P6, P8, P10).
- Filters sometimes hid medications Veterans expected to see, which caused brief confusion (P1, P2, P5, P10).
- In the staging environment, the filter list was expanded by default, which made it more noticeable to participants during the study.
- It is unclear whether filters would be noticed or used as frequently if the filter were collapsed by default.

## What we learned about sorting
- Veterans expected medications to be ordered in a clear, logical default way, such as:
  - Alphabetically  
    > “All over the place.” (P10)
  - With current medications first and inactive medications later (P12).
- Some participants did not notice that a sort option existed (P9).
- Clear default ordering mattered more than discoverable sort controls.

## Takeaway
The Medications list functions as a hub for action, tracking, reference, and confirmation. When it did not clearly support the task at hand, Veterans did not try to troubleshoot. Instead, they moved on to a more familiar path.
