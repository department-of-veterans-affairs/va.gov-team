## Insights

*Note: Not all participants completed every task. Task-level counts vary due to prototype and staging constraints that occasionally limited access to specific screens or flows.*

### Insight 1: Prescription statuses were largely understood; refill vs. renewal understanding varied

**Veterans understood what prescription statuses meant, but did not always understand what actions were available or when to take them.**

#### Active

All **11 of 11 participants** understood **Active** as a medication they are currently taking.

- **7 of 11 participants** assumed Active implied refillability
- **4 of 11 participants** viewed Active as informational only
- Several participants wanted clearer signals when no refills remained

“Something’s active, so you have refills.” (P1)  
“What I don’t see is whether it has refills.” (P12)

#### In Progress

All **11 of 11 participants** interpreted **In Progress** as a medication being actively worked on.

- **9 participants** expected it to be short-lived
- **1 participant (P6)** described reduced confidence based on a past experience

“Someone is working on it… after it’s done it should be shipped.” (P1)  
“I don’t trust in-progress… it went on way too long [sharing prior experience].” (P6)

#### Inactive

All **11 of 11 participants** understood **Inactive** as no longer refillable.

- **9 participants** associated Inactive with needing provider follow-up
- Older or duplicate inactive medications increased cognitive load

“You need to call doctor to get a new script.” (P5)  
“I got all these medications I used to take… but they’re still there.” (P5)

#### Refill vs. renewal comprehension was mixed

**Veterans had mixed understanding of the difference between refill and renewal. Some clearly differentiated the two, while others used the terms interchangeably.**

**8 of 13 participants** (P1, P3, P4, P6, P8, P9, P11, P12) clearly differentiated the two concepts. These participants generally described refill as continuing an existing prescription with refills remaining, and renewal as requiring provider review or action once refills had run out or a prescription had expired. Several framed renewal as involving the entire medication rather than an incremental refill.

“Refill means you have refill medications and can order anytime.”  
“Renewal most likely I need a new order for it.”  
“…they know a renewal is the entire medication. A refill is, like, oh, they ran out of refills.”  
“Because some, some, medications expire.”

**5 participants** (P2, P5, P10, P14, and partially P5) showed uncertainty or used the terms interchangeably. Some described renewal as simply “getting more medication,” were unsure who requests were routed to, or stated there was no meaningful difference between the two terms.

“Refill and what? [renewal]”  
“Medication may or may not be active, however, you still may need the medication.”  
“Could be either one.”  
“Refill and renewal is basically the same thing.”

### Insight 2: Renewal link discovery varied and often followed familiar paths

**Veterans did not consistently notice the renewal link and often relied on familiar refill or messaging paths instead.**

Participants varied in how easily they discovered the renewal link, often defaulting to familiar paths first. Discovery of the renewal link was mixed and strongly shaped by participants’ existing mental models for requesting medications.

#### When Veterans found the renewal link

**7 of 12 participants** noticed the renewal link organically once they reached the correct medication card. These participants typically scrolled through the medication list and interpreted the link as a natural next step for getting more medication.

“That’s… I’ve not seen that before, that’s a new thing for me.”  
“It says Send a renewal request message, I don’t think I’ve seen that!”

For these participants, discovery occurred **within the Medications list**, without needing to navigate away from the page.

#### When Veterans did not find the renewal link

**5 of 12 participants** did not initially notice the renewal link and instead relied on familiar, previously learned behaviors to request medications. These participants did not recognize the renewal link as actionable or as something they had used before.

When the renewal link was not immediately visible or recognized, participants commonly:

- Used the **Start a refill request** CTA
- Navigated directly to the **Secure Messaging** tool to send a message outside of the renewal flow
- Looked for a **phone number to call**
- Scrolled the page without recognizing the renewal link as an available action

“I would just send a secure message.”  
“Send a secure message to your care team.”

For several participants, the **Start a refill request** CTA acted as a competing entry point. When the medication did not appear there, this led to confusion and task detours, including navigating away from Medications to message a provider. Some participants treated refill and renewal entry points as interchangeable, relying on past experience rather than cues on the page to determine the correct path.

### Insight 3: Participants had questions about who would receive the renewal request

**Veterans were able to proceed, but did not consistently understand who renewal requests were routed to.**

Most participants proceeded through provider selection, but several expressed questions about who would receive the request.

“Hopefully it’s my doctor, but it doesn’t tell you.” (P1)  
“I don’t know who it directs it to.” (P2)

Participants often relied on medication type to infer the correct care team.

#### Modal supported a clear transition to Secure messaging

**The modal effectively communicated a transition to Secure Messaging and did not prevent participants from continuing the flow.**

Most participants interpreted the modal as informational and proceeded without hesitation.

“It means I’m going to a different screen, but I’m still logged in.”  
“It’s telling me I’m leaving this page.”  
“Instead of me coming out of the medication and going into the messages, it put me in there.”

A small number of participants briefly questioned whether the modal was a warning or error, but still continued.

“I always wonder if it’s just a warning or if I did something wrong.”  
“I appreciate having a message letting me know I’m going to a different page.”

### Insight 4: Prefilled messages supported completion, but missing information caused participants to stumble

**Prefilled messages made the renewal process easier and more efficient; however, missing medication details introduced hesitation and briefly disrupted progress.**

**10 of 12 participants** explicitly noticed and valued the prefilled message.

“Oh everything’s already there, I love it.” (P1)  
“That saves people a lot of time.” (P2)

All **12 participants** reviewed at least part of the prefilled content.

- **9 participants** sent the message as-is  
- **3 participants** wanted optional personalization  

“I’d just send it and be done with it.”  
“Everything is already there.”  
“I would add my phone number for faster processing.”

When required medication details were missing, participants paused and questioned whether they could proceed, creating a brief but noticeable stumble in the flow.

“There’s nothing to be sent.” (P1)  
“You don’t know the medication unless you have it with you.” (P2)

### Insight 5: Confirmation cues were generally noticed and increased confidence, but did not fully resolve uncertainty

**Automation and clear confirmation cues reassured most Veterans that their request was sent; however, some still sought additional reassurance or inferred next steps that did not always align with how the system works.**

**9 of 12 participants** noticed the success alert and recognized it as confirmation that their request was sent.

“It says Message sent.”  
“Just knowing whether the message went through.” (P12)

Several participants described visible confirmation cues—such as the green *“Message sent”* alert—as a clear signal that their request had gone through.

“Seems very intuitive and very basic.”  
“When it says message sent, it went… 99% of the time.”

**3 participants** sought confirmation elsewhere, such as navigating to Secure Messaging to verify the message had been sent.

“I went to messages to confirm it was sent.” (P1)

Even when confirmation cues were noticed, participants often relied on prior experience to infer what would happen next. These expectations did not always match the actual behavior of the renewal flow.

“Once the doc approves it, it should appear as in progress.”  
“It will take up to three days for the status to change.”
