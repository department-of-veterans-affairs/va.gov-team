## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]?

My name is [name]. I'm a researcher working on the VA health portal.

Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:



* **This entire session should take up to 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. We may also end sooner than that, and if we have covered everything I want to cover I'd love to give your time back to you.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* **You'll be interacting with a test environment.** This is a website with test data that may not be what you would expect to find in someone’s medical records. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual medical information or benefits.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_[If yes:]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_[If no:]_ I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

*[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves]*



Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

_[If yes: ]_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*[Start recording.]*



I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

We like to share de-identified clips of these sessions with our teammates and stakeholders so they can see how users interact with our website. Do I have your permission, [name] to use clips from your session?

## Your set-up - 1 minutes

Before we begin, can you tell us a bit about your computer setup (your device, your settings, any assistive technology tools or strategies you use when you're working with VA.gov)?


## Screen share/Remote share - 2 minutes

Have you ever shared your screen before?

Would you like assistance sharing your screen?



_[If no:]_ Go ahead and share your screen for me now. Just note that once you start sharing I will be able to see anything on your desktop, so maybe go ahead and close out any windows that you don't want to share with me.

## Participant coaching & accessing Figma prototype

For the first set of questions, we have created a prototype of the medications experience on VA.gov.

To access this prototype, simply select the link that I just pasted in the Zoom chat.

https://tinyurl.com/4ewwp6f5

Great, you are in! You can scroll up and down this page as you would a webpage and while not all the links are functional, you are able to use the filter to filter the medication list below.

One note before we begin our questions. Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can’t see your screen. Does that make sense?

If you are ready, we can begin.

## First task: Status comprehension

Before we begin, you may notice that these medications are not familiar. This is a test example , but it does scroll like a normal website would. 
Now we'll begin our first set of questions.

1. Tell me what you see on the page.
2. What can you tell me about what’s going on with your prescriptions?
3. What can you tell me about your PEPCID medication? (make med in “**active** status”)
    1. Probe: what does the **active** status mean to you?
        1. On a scale of 1-5 (1 being not confident, 5 being very confident), how confident are you in that answer?
    2. What is going on with your med? (If needed, call attention to status) and probe: 
        1. What do you think happens next for a medication with an **active** status?
        2. How would you feel if you saw this status on an important medication?
4. What can you tell me about your LOPRESSOR medication? (make med in “**in progress** status”)
    1. Probe: what does the **in progress** status mean to you?
        1. On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you in that answer?
    2. What is going on with your med? (If needed, call attention to status) and probe: 
        1. What do you think happens next for a medication with an **in progress** status?
        2. How long would you expect a medication to stay **in progress**?
        3. If you saw this status for several days, what would you think?
    3. How would you feel if you saw this status on an important medication?
5. What can you tell me about AMOXICILLIN medication? (make med in “**inactive** status”)
    1. Probe: what does the **inactive** status mean to you?
        1. On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you in that answer?
    2. What is going on with your med? (If needed, call attention to status) and probe: 
        1. What do you think happens next for your medication?
        2. How would you feel if you saw this status on an important medication?
6. Now, imagine that you take a medication regularly. You notice that you are running out of pills. Using this page, do you think you could get more of your med?
7. Imagine that you had a bad rash a couple of years ago. Your doctor gave you a medication and it went away. Now, that rash is back. Do you think that you could find the medication you took on this page? What would you look for?
    1. [*Notice:] Do they filter? Do they think of status or just date?*
    2. Probe: What status might that medication be in?
8. Ok, now imagine that you have successfully requested a refill for that rash medication. Where would you look for it?
    1. Probe: What status would that medication be in?
9. How would you differentiate between a 'refill' and a 'renewal'? Is there a difference between those terms to you?
10. Is there anything confusing to you about the medications that are out of refills?


*[Things to watch out for:]*

* *Does the participant seem confused by the statuses?*
* *How if at all do they compare it to the current statuses?*

Great, thank you for providing your thoughts on these statuses. Some quick questions before we move onto our next task:



* Were you able to access status information for the medications you looked at?
* What did you think of the different prescription statuses, and how they are described?
* Does anything about the different statuses feel overwhelming or hard to process?
* Have you seen a status like this before on My HealtheVet? How is this similar or different from what you're used to seeing?
* How would you like to learn that the words we use to describe statuses have changed, if at all?
* [For AT users:] Did any part of reviewing the statuses feel harder because of using *[a screen reader] or [speech input]*?
* Anything else about statuses that you’d like to share?

Thank you! Now I’d like you to do something else for me...


## Second Task: Request a renewal

For the second set of questions, I'm going to have you follow the link that I have just pasted into the chat.

https://staging.va.gov/  (See below for instructions on using the prototype if the test user is not working.)

This is the staging environment for VA.gov where we can test out new ideas to make sure they work before we go live. 

I'm now going to have you log in as a test user by taking the following steps:
1. Select the Sign In button (in the upper right corner)
2. Select the ID.me (green) button
3. (Enter or) Paste the following email address into the email text box: emma.smith@id.me
4. (Enter or) Paste the following password into the password text box: Tester1& **Note that this needs to change for each session**
5. There's a fake telephone number in this pop up window. Simply select the "Continue" button to continue
6. Similarly, go ahead and select the "Continue" button here as well
7. Great! You're logged in.

Now we're going to navigate to the medications landing page. To do this:
1. Select My HealtheVet (in the upper right menu)
2. Find the Medications section and select "Review medications."


Excellent. We're now where we need to be.

**Prototype instructions:**
https://tinyurl.com/mwvcamhn

Like the previous task, this is a prototype and it is clickable scrollable a website. We want you to imagine that this is the actual live website.

--

Let's take a minute or two to get familiar with this page.

As you can see, this is not your My HealtheVet account. If you look (in the top right corner) where your name would display, it says Emma which is our test user name. However, we would like you to imagine this is your account with your own data, not someone else’s.

This task is going to have you navigating through a series of pages. We want to hear your thoughts at each step, so I'd like you to pause at the beginning of each new page/step so I can ask you a few questions. 

Ok let's begin with the task:

### List page

**You have a prescription for SUNSCREEN-30 PABA-FREE COMBINATION LOT that your pharmacy told you is out of refills. What would you do if you needed more of this medication?**


* Where would you go to request more of this medication?

*[Let participant finish task with minimal interruption.]*

*[If participant is struggling:]*



* What are you looking for?
* What would you do next?

*Things to watch for:*



* *Does the participant comment on the ease of locating the link?*
* *Does the participant seem pleased/frustrated with where the link is located?*



**Now that you’ve found the renewal link, how would you request more of this medication?**

*[If participant is struggling:]*



* What are you looking for?
* What would you do next?

*[If they couldn’t find the renewal link, navigate participant to the medication with renewal link]:*



**Do you see the words “Request a renewal”? What do you think that means?**
* Where would you expect to find that link?
* What do you expect to happen when you select the link?

### Modal dialog

* What do you think this screen is for?
* What do you think you should do next?
* Do you find this screen to be helpful?

*Things to watch for:*
* *Does the modal cause the user hesitation or confusion about going to messaging?*
* *Does the user click through without taking the time to absorb the information in the modal?*

### Care team selection

* Who would you select here, and why?
* If you weren't sure which provider to choose, what would you do?

_[After answering questions, instruct the user to select DERMATOLOGY]_

*Things to watch for:*
* *Does the user express confusion about selecting a provider?*


### Prefilled Renewal Request Message Content

* What do you notice on this page?
* Would you edit or add additional information to this message at all?
    * If no, why not?
    * If yes, what would you change in the message?
* What would you do next to request more medication?

*Things to watch for:*
* *Does the user edit or change the prefilled medication information?*
* *Do screen reader users recognize that there is prefilled medication information, and what they need to do with it?*


### Confirmation: medications list page

* Where are you now?
* How do you know your request was successful?
* What do you expect to happen next?
* How will you know when your renewal request has been processed?
* Imagine you're telling a friend about this experience. Would you tell them this is easy or hard to use? Why?

*Things to watch for:*
* *Does the user notice the success alert after sending the renewal request?*
* *Does the user know where they are after submitting the renewal request?*

*[After task completion]*

Thank you for completing that task. I have a few follow up questions for you:

* Did anything in the process feel overwhelming or hard to process?
* What, if anything, would you change about this process?
* _[For AT users:]_ Did any part of of the process feel harder because of using *[a screen reader] or [speech input]*?
* _[For AT users:]_ If you were teaching someone else who uses *[a screen reader] or [speech input]* to do this, what would you warn them about?


*[Ask the following questions to all users whether they were able to complete the reqeust or not.]*



* "Before we wrap up Task 2, I'd like to show you one more thing.
1. Can you please go to the link I have just pasted into the chat: https://tinyurl.com/48smhma5
2. Please select one of the care teams and click "Continue"

**Prototype instructions**

Say you're trying to request a renewal of your Zyrtec medication and you click the request a renewal via secure message link on that Zyrtec medication. Go ahead and do that.

--

Imagine you tried to request a renewal for this medication, but when you clicked the link to send a message to request a renewal, you were taken to this page. What would you do next?

*[Let participant finish task with minimal interruption.]*

* Would you go somewhere to find the information that's missing?
  * If so, where would you go?
 
*Things to watch for:*
* *Does the user try to fill in the missing information?*
* *Do they add additional content to the message to compensate for missing information?*
* *Do they seem frustrated?*

Great, thank you for that additional input!

## Closing questions

That wraps up our tasks. I just have a few closing questions for you:

1. Overall, how easy or difficult would you say it was to request a renewal?
2. Overall, how easy or difficult would you say it was to understand the prescription statuses?
3. Of everything you looked at today, what would you say was the most confusing to you and why?
4. Is there anything else you would like to share that we have not covered?

---


## Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
