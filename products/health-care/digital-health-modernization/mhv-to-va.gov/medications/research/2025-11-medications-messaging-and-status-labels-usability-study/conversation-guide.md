## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]?

My name is [name]. I'm a researcher working on the VA health portal.

Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:



* **This entire session should take up to 60 minutes. **I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* **You'll be interacting with a test environment. **This is a website with test data that may not be what you would expect to find in someone’s medical records. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual medical information or benefits.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

*[If yes: ]* Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

*[If no:] * I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

*[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves]*



* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
* *[If yes: ] *Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*[Start recording.]*



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
* We like to share de-identified clips of these sessions with our teammates and stakeholders so they can see how screen reader users interact with our website. Do I have your permission, [name] to use clips from your session?

## Screen share/Remote share - 2 minutes

Have you ever shared your screen before?

Would you like assistance sharing your screen?



* *[if no:]* Go ahead and share your screen for me now.

*[follow protocol for particular OS (Android/iOS)]*

*[iPhone screenshare instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)*

*[Android screenshare instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share)*

## Participant Coaching

Let’s pause right here on this screen.

As you can see, this is not your My HealtheVet account. If you look in the top right corner where your name would appear, it says* [name]. [Name]* is our test user. However, we would like you to imagine this is your account with your own data, not someone else’s.

Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can’t see your screen. Does that make sense?

If you are ready, we can begin.

## First task: Status comprehension

First, we’re going to navigate to the medications page by selecting the medications link in the top menu. 

*From Medications page:*



1. Tell me what you are looking at.
2. What can you tell me about what’s going on with your prescriptions.
3. What can you tell me about x medication? (make med in “**active **status”)
    1. Probe: what does that mean to you?
    2. What is going on with your med? (If needed, call attention to status) and probe: 
    3. What do you think “active” means?
    4. What do you think happens next for your medication?
4. What can you tell me about x medication? (make med in “**in progress** status”)
    5. Probe: what does that mean to you?
    6. What is going on with your med? (If needed, call attention to status) and probe: 
    7. What do you think “in progress” means?
    8. What do you think happens next for your medication?
5. What can you tell me about x medication? (make med in “**inactive** status”)
    9. Probe: what does that mean to you?
    10. What is going on with your med? (If needed, call attention to status) and probe: 
    11. What do you think “inactive” means?
    12. What do you think happens next for your medication?
6. Now, imagine that you take a medication regularly. You notice that you are running out of pills. Using this page, do you think you could get more of your med?
7. Imagine that you had a bad rash a couple of years ago. Your doctor gave you a medication and it went away. Now, that rash is back. Do you think that you could find the medication you took on this page? What would you look for?
    13. Notice: Do they filter? Do they think of status or just date?
    14. Probe: What status might that medication be in?
8. Ok, now imagine that you have successfully requested a refill for that rash medication. Where would you look for it?
    1. Probe: What status would that medication be in?

*Things to watch out for:*



* *Does the participant seem confused by the statuses?*
* *How if at all do they compare it to the current statuses?*

*[After feedback is shared]*

Great, thank you for that feedback. Some quick questions before we move onto our next task



* What did you think of the prescription statuses?
* Do you think these are the same statuses that you currently use on MHV on VA.gov?
* How would you like to learn that statuses have changed, if at all?
* Anything else about statuses that you’d like to share?

Thank you! Now I’d like you to do something else for me..


## Second Task: Request a renewal

You have a prescription for _______ that your pharmacy told you is out of refills. What would you do if you needed more meds?



* Where would you go to request a renewal of this prescription?

*[Let participant finish task with minimal interruption]*

*[If participant is struggling:]*



* What are you looking for?
* What would you do next?

*Things to watch for:*



* *Does the participant comment on the ease of locating the link?*
* *Does the participant seem pleased/frustrated with where the link is located?*

Now that you’ve found the renewal link, how would you request a renewal for this prescription?

*[If participant is struggling:]*



* What are you looking for?
* What would you do next?

*[After task completion]*



* How easy or difficult did you find the process of requesting a renewal?
* What would you change about this process?
* What would you keep about this process?

*[If they couldn’t find the renewal link]* *[navigate participant to the medication with renewal link]:*



* Do you see the words “Request a renewal”? What do you think that means?
* Where would you expect to find that link? 

*[If they weren’t able to successfully request a renewal after finding the link]*



* *[navigate participant to the step where they incorrectly navigated away]*
* What if you saw this page [page with error request] instead when requesting a renewal? What would you do?

*Things to watch for:*



* *Does the modal cause the user hesitation or confusion about going to messaging?*
* *Does the user express confusion about selecting a provider?*
* *Does the user edit or change the prefilled medication information?*
* *Does the user notice the success alert after sending the renewal request?*

## AT Interview – 5 minutes

Our goal in these studies is to make sure we represent the point of view of all users. This is why we are committed to recruiting participants who rely on assistive technology so that we are designing an experience that meets their needs.

We are collecting information on how our participants’ reliance on assistive technology may affect their ability to use My HealtheVet. Would you be willing to answer a couple of questions today?

*[if no]*

That’s no problem.

*[if yes]*



* How long have you been using [AT]?
* How does using [AT] affect your use of websites?

## Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
