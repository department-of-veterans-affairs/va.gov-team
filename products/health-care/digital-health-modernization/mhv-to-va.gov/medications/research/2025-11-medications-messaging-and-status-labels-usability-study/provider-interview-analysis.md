# Provider interviews for secure messaging renewal flow

Date: 10/2025 - 11/2025

## Interviewees
**10/30:** Ashley Hillman
**11/10:** Dr. Ami Shah
**11/12:** Dr. Tyler Galloway
**11/17:** Molly Bruvold and Dr. Jeff Cooney
**11/19:** Dr. Richard Morris

## Research goals
1.	Be able to create a provider service blueprint for receiving a renewal request via SM.
    a. Also include a flow for if the provider receives an incorrect request and needs to “forward” it to the right provider.
2.	Clearly identify the data that providers need in order to “forward” or “reroute” a renewal request that was mistakenly sent to them.
3.	Understand what functionalities exist for providers to send the renewal to the correct care team/provider.

## Research questions
1.	Can you walk us through the current renewal request process? 
    a.	What are the steps? 
    b.	Who is involved in each step (provider, nurse, etc.)?
    c.	Are there any pain points?
2.	How do you receive a secure message? Email? Messaging portal?
3.	What functionality is available to you when you receive an SM?
    a.	Do you have the functionality to “forward” or “reroute” a message to another provider?
4.	If you were to receive a renewal request via SM, what information would you need to determine if/how to renew the prescription?
       a.	If it was rerouted to you from another provider, is there any additional information you would need/want to have for context?
5.	What information do you receive that indicates who the patient is?
       a.	Does this happen within the platform? Or is this via email?

## Findings
**Key finding 1: Include the following additional data fields in the pre-populated message.**
1. The sig (instructions for use)
2. Last fill date

**Key finding 2: VistA providers believe this will slot well into their already high functioning SM renewal flow.**
- They cited few complaints with the current system but noted that this new system should improve clarity ensuring all information is provided in the SM and should decrease call volumes from users who are trying to request renewals via phone.

**Key finding 3: OH providers already have many challenges requesting renewals**
- Misrouting is a major "goose chase" (Galloway). PCOM has to be opened to identify who the previous prescriber was. Information found in PCOM has to be remembered and then manually entered into the system.
- The "pool is always dirty." The process is significantly hindered by the lack of care team information to re-route effectively.
- Renewals are not batched so each one needs to be renewed individually.
- Nurses need to pre-populate the renewal request which then goes to the provider for an electronic signature. It would be preferable if a computer could create the request.
- Noted that audiocare creates the best message requests because it contains all the needed info.
 
**Key finding 4: OH providers had some concerns about the new system.**
- **Potential problems with Veteran selecting the care team:** Ashley Hillman had a major reaction when she learned the Veteran would have to choose the provider for medication renewal.
  - The current, preferred Audiocare system routes reliably to the prescriber who last prescribed it.
- **Community care challenges:** The flow does not provide the necessary contact information for community care, such as a fax number or a reliable electronic contact method, adding complexity to those renewals.
  - **Lack of clarity on prescriber type:** Tyler Galloway needs to know if the provider who prescribed it is _internal versus external/community care_ to determine the correct routing pathway.- 
- **Problematic single emails:** Dr. Ami Shah found it "Really problematic" to get many separate emails for renewals, preferring "one message with all the medications that need review."
- **Extra clicks and nurse work:** For Dr. Shah, opening the email and clicking the message requires 4 or 5 clicks to renew a single medication. She relies on a nurse to organize multiple requests into one message (a task she believes a computer should do), stating that the current method creates "lots of extra work across the board."
- **Medication Status Ambiguity:** Dr. Ami Shah requested definitions of "Active" vs. "inactive" medication status and information on why a medication is not eligible for renewal to streamline her review process.

## Next steps
1. Update pre-populated message to include findings from Key finding 1.
2. Look into adding provider credentials per Tyler Galloway's suggestion
