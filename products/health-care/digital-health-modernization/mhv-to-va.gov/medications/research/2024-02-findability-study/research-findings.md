[Research readout](<https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medications/research/2024-02-findability-study/Rx_Findability_Readout.pdf>)

## Research Goals

The average Veteran has approximately 12 medications. Each time a medication is renewed, a new number is assigned, and a new record is added to the Veteran’s list. The length of a Veteran’s medication list could cause them difficulty in finding a specific medication they wish to refill, track, or review.

1. Identify how Veterans find a medication in My HealtheVet or VAHB-Mobile.
2. Identify how Veterans find information on their medication(s).
3. Identify how Veterans make sense of their medication list(s).
4. Identify how Veterans' experiences with My HealtheVet/VAHB-Mobile and other websites/apps inform their expectations.

## Research Questions

1. What do Veterans expect to see on their Medications page?
2. What type of medication information do Veterans seek?
    1. How do they find the information?
3. What do Veterans do if they cannot find a medication?

## Methodology

We conducted moderated interview sessions in which we asked participants about their experience with finding medication information. We used visuals of the various VA medication refill applications as well as My HealtheVet Pharmacy screenshots as visual anchors. In addition, we conducted a moderated closed card sort activity

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

Hypothesis 1: Most participants will find the current UI of medication findability efficient.

  LIKELY TRUE: Most participants responded posotively about their current experience on MHV Classic or VAHB-Mobile. Only half the participants stated they would add or change anything when asked.

Hypothesis 2: Most participants will state that they find their medications by scrolling through the pages.

UNKNOWN: Most participants did mention "looking through" or "going through" their lists or pages, but they were not directly asked the method.

Hypothesis 3: Most participants will state they would call their providers when they cannot find a medication on their list.

  FALSE: While most participants stated they would contact their providers, only 7 specified that it would be via phone call.

## Key Findings

1. Half the participants (9 of 18) stated they are looking for their medication names when first logging into their medications platform.
2. Many participants (6 of 18) stated they are first looking to see which medications are due for refill when logging into their medications platform.
3. Many participants (7 of 18) included remaining refills as secondary to what they look for in their medications platform.
4. Most (14 of 18) participants placed the 3 active medications with refills available at the top of their card sort.
    1. They further sorted them by the number of refills left with the most on top, and then the last fill date with the most recent at the bottom.
    2. Participant responses were mixed when asked what they expect to see at the top of their medications list. However, the card sort activity, with its visual focus, yielded clear results.
5. Most participants (14 of 18) placed the non-VA active medication after the active medications, followed by expired and discontinued medications.
    1. They further sorted them by the last fill date with the most recent at the top.
    2. Most participants’ responses when asked what they expect to see at the bottom of their medication list aligned with the card sort responses in which expired and discontinued medications were placed at the bottom.
6. All participants (18 of 18) stated they want medications they no longer take or need removed from their medication list.
7. Many participants (6 of 18) reported looking for side effects associated with their medications in the past.
8. Most participants (12 of 18) reported looking to the internet for medication information. Websites included Google, WebMD, Drugs.com, and Mayo Clinic.
9. Most participants (16 of 18) did not report regularly referencing their medication bottle for information about their medications or while using their medications platform.
10. Most participants (12 of 18) stated they would look through their medication list or medication history to find dosage of a medication they hadn’t used in years.
11. Most participants (14 of 18) reported relying on the name when looking for a medication in their medication platform.
12. Most participants (13 of 18) stated they would contact their provider or pharmacist if they had trouble locating a medication on their medication platform.
13. Participants were mixed in their responses when asked if they would add or change anything about their current experience to help them find a medication quickly.

## Details of Findings

1. **Half the participants stated they are looking for their medication names when first logging into their medications platform.**

    9 of 18 participants listed medication name first when asked what they look for first on their medications page.Of that nine, six included other descriptors of their medications after first mentioning medication name.

    _“I’m just looking for the name of the medication I need.” - Participant 4_
  
    _“Once I log in to refill prescriptions, I look specifically for that medication.” – Participant 9_

2. **Many participants stated they are first looking to see which medications are due for refill when logging into their medications platform.**

    6 of 18 participants listed refills due when asked what they look for first on their medications page. Three of those participants included refills left after first mentioning refills due.

    _“What am I looking for first? What’s available for me to refill.” – Participant 8_

    _“The first think I am looking for is whether any are due for refill.” – Participant 23_

3. **Many participants included remaining refills as secondary to what they look for in their medications platform.**

    7 of 18 participants listed refills left second when asked what they look for on their medications page.

    9 of 16 ordered the active medications during the card sort activity by refills left.

    _“That’s mainly what I look for or how many prescriptions are left for that drug.” – Participant 5_

    _”\[I am looking for\] whether the prescription is refillable or how many refills I have left on that.” – Participant 16_

4. **Most participants wanted to see their active refillable medications at the top of their list.**

    14 of 18 participants placed the 3 active medications with refills available at the top of their list during the card sort activity.

    a. They further sorted them by the number of refills left with the most on top, and then the last fill date with the most recent at the bottom.

    b. Participant responses were mixed when asked what they expect to see at the top of their medications list. However, the card sort activity, with its visual focus, yielded clear results.

6. **Most participants placed the non-VA active medication after the active medications, followed by expired and discontinued medications.**

    14 of 18 placed the non-VA active medication after the active medications because of its active status, followed by expired and discontinued medications.

    They stated the expired medications belonged before the discontinued medications because they could be renewed whereas the discontinued could not.

    a. They further sorted them by the last fill date with the most recent at the top.

    b. Most participants’ responses when asked what they expect to see at the bottom of their medication list aligned with the card sort responses in which expired and discontinued medications were placed at the bottom.

8. **All participants stated they want medications they no longer take or need removed from their medication list.**

    18 of 18 participants stated they wanted medications they no longer take removed from their list. Half the participants suggested placing the unused medications in an archive or separate history page or tab while the other half just wanted them removed.

    _“I’d like to see it on the list up until six months since \[I’ve\] used it.” – Participant 24_

    _“They should be put in an archive, a history.” – Participant 19_

11. **Most participants did not report regularly referencing their medication bottle for information about their medications or while using their medications platform.**

    16 of 18 participants did not report regularly referencing their medication bottle outside the initial receipt of a new medication. 8 participants stated they only read information for new medications when they first start taking them, while 3 mentioned reading the paperwork that is included. The 2 participants who do use their medication bottle regularly take their medication directly from the bottle as compared to many who use a pill container.

    _“The ink on \[the bottle\] will sometimes wear out and you can’t really see it anymore. And I’m like, what do I have? I don’t like to keep \[the papers\]. I probably just throw it away… I just Google.” – Participant 20_

   - This included mobile users (19 of 38) for whom scrolling would be extended

 - Many participants (17 of 38) used the sort feature when looking for a specific medication in the list


**Medallia (Foresee) intercept and feedback surveys. Medications related responses from 06/4/20 – 10/31/23. N = 7719**

 - 17 Veterans responded with a request to provide a search function to find medications

 - 13 Veterans responded with a request to provide all medications on one list

**Competitive Analysis of commercial and VA pharmacy products. Commercial pharmacy providers: Cigna, FollowMyHealth, MyChart, Walgreens**
