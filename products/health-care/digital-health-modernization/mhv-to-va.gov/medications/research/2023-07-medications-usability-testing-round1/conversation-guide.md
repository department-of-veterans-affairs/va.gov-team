## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]?

My name is [name]. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know.


I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be selectable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_[If yes: ]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_[If no:]_  I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

_[If yes:]_  Thank you! We very much appreciate you talking with us today.

_[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves]_

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- _[If yes: ]_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_[Start recording.]_

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

How often?

_[If on Desktop/Laptop/Tablet:] _I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get set up, I will give you instructions on what to do.  _[when ready]_ I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen and then you will be able to control my screen. Ready?

_[If on mobile: ]_ Have you shared your screen over Zoom with your phone?

_[If yes: ]_ I dropped the link to the prototype in the chat. Go ahead and pull it up and when you are ready to share, please do so.

_[If no, follow protocol for particular OS (Android/iOS)]_

## **Participant Coaching**

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own. Of course, we are here and using a prototype, so to make it as natural as possible, we set up the American flag at the top to act like a back button on a browser. On one screen you will see an arrow in the top left rather than the flag.

Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can't see your screen. Does that make sense?

_[for MHV users]_ This is going to look slightly familiar, but please remember that this is a new design we are testing and some elements you might expect to be there will not and some you don't expect will.

Are you ready to dive in?

## **First Task: Refill**

Please walk me through how you would refill your Tacrolimus 0.5MG prescription.

_[when the 'refill prescription button' disappears and is replaced with 'We're reviewing the refill request…' appears]_

- Was your refill successfully submitted? What tells you that?
- How did you know you had the correct medication?
- What do you expect to happen next?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant select the correct medication?
- Does the participant go to the details screen?
- Does the participant use the sort feature? Which one?
- Is the participant able to identify how they knew the refill was submitted?

## **Second Task: Prescription status**

_**Renew**_

Please walk me through how you would refill your Furosemide prescription.

_[when participant states that the prescription is too old to refill]_

- What would you do next?

_[when 'How to renew prescriptions' is on screen]_

- Which of these options would you choose? What makes you say that?

_**In process**_

Can you tell me the status of your Dialyvite prescription?

- What do you think "We expect to fill it on July 1, 2023" means?
- When would you expect to receive it? What makes you say that?

_[if they attempt to click into details]_

What did you expect to find in the details screen?

_**Never Filled**_

Are there any prescriptions here that have never been filled?

_**Not refillable**_

Please walk me through how you would refill your Tramadol prescription.

- What do you think "We can't access information abou tthis prescription right now" means?

- Does the participant use the sort feature? Which one?
- Does the participant identify the correct status?
- Does the participant understand the status?

## **Third Task: Shipped + ID + Refill**

Can you tell me the status of your Losartan prescription?

- Let's say you forgot why you're taking Losartan. What would you do to find out?
- When the shipment arrives, what information could you use to confirm that you received the correct prescription?

Let's say you keep your medications in a weekly pill organizer. You drop it on the floor, and they get mixed up. What would you do to identify which of the pills is Losartan?

This medication has been shipped.

- At what point would you submit another refill request? What makes you say that?
- Would you expect to be able to do that from this page?

_[if participant doesn't refill it on their own]_

Go ahead and refill it.

- Was your refill successfully submitted? What tells you that?

**Things to watch for:**

- What did the participant use to identify Losartan?
- When does the participant expect to refill?
- Is the participant able to identify how they knew the refill was submitted?
- Does the participant identify the correct status?
- Does the participant understand the status?

## **Fourth Task: Print/download + instructions**

Let's say you have an upcoming appointment and wanted to bring your medication list with you. Please walk me through how you would do that.

_[if participant chooses 'download']_

- After you download the file, what would you do next?
- What made you choose 'download' rather than 'print'?

- What do you expect the printout/download to contain?
- How would you feel if your printed/downloaded list also contained your allergy list?

Let's say you were printing your medications list and your printer ran out of ink. You are in a rush and just need to know how many Tacrolimus 1MG pills you take per day. Please walk me through how you would find that information.

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant understand that the whole list will print?
- Does the participant choose print or download?
- Did the participant find the instructions?

## **Fifth Task: Refills remaining + multiple refills + supplies**

_[if Tacrolimus 1MG details is not on screen please ask participant to return]_

- How many refills are left?

There is another medication in your list called Tacrolimus 0.5MG.

- Could you please walk me through how you would find out how many refills that one has left?

_[after the participant has identified the number of refills remaining]_

_**Multiple refills**_

- What would you do if you wanted to refill the rest of your current prescriptions right now?

_[after they answer – if they state they would select all refill buttons]_

- Would that include Dextroamphetamine and Darbepoetin? Why/Why not?

The prototype doesn't have all of these buttons set up.
- What would do you expect would happen if you selected all of the buttons?
- What would you do if you changed your mind and wanted to cancel?
- Have you ever changed your mind about filling a certain prescription? Why?

_**Supplies**_

Please scroll down the list to find 'Blood glucose test strips.' These are not medication but supplies that people who need to check their blood sugar use.

- What other types of supplies or non-medication items would you expect to find on this list?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant identify the number of refills left?
- Does the participant look for a 'select all' button?
- Does the participant differentiate between the 'fill' and 'refill'?
- What other items does the participant expect to find on the list?
