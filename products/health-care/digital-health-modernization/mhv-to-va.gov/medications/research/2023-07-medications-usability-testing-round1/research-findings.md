## **Methodology**

We conducted remote moderated usability testing interviews in which we asked users to navigate the prototype. We observed their behavior and asked follow-up prompts as needed. We asked participants to perform the following tasks on the prototype:

**Task 1** : **Find Prescriptions & Refill**

  1. Refill your Tacrolimus 0.5MG prescription.
  2. Expectations when you click on the prescription (details).
  3. Define "Active" vs. "Active parked".

**Task 2: Prescription Status**

1. Refill "too old" prescription.
2. Define "Expired" vs. "Discontinued.
3. Review - "in process".
4. Find "never filled".
5. Review "non-refillable"

**Task 3: Shipped + ID + Refill**

1. Review shipped.
2. Identify image.
3. Refill in details page.

**Task 4: Print/Download + Prescription Instructions**

1. Review print and/or download.
2. Find prescription - reason for use.

**Task 5: Refills left + Multiple Refills & Supplies**

1. Review refills left.
2. Refill multiple prescriptions.
3. Review supplies.

## **Hypotheses and Conclusions**

- _Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will be able to find the information they need to fill/refill their prescriptions.

LIKELY TRUE – Most participants found the information they needed to fill their prescriptions. Most of the Veterans noticed the "request a refill" button and completed this task successfully.

- _Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will understand the statuses of their prescription.

LIKELY FALSE – Most participants did not understand what the statuses of their prescription meant. Most of the participants did not accurately define the statuses attached to their prescriptions, especially these statuses – expired, active-parked, and discontinued.

- _Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will be able to find the information they need to manage and understand their medications.

LIKELY TRUE – Some participants found the information they needed to manage their medications; some participants also indicated some information they would like to see to best manage their prescriptions.

- _Hypothesis 4:_ Some Veterans will confuse 'fill prescription' with 'refill prescription.

DEFINITELY FALSE – Most participants were able to distinguish between the phrase "fill" and "refill" when they noticed it. While some Veterans did not immediately notice the call out, those who did understood its intention.

- _Hypothesis 4:_ Some Veterans will be confused by the connotation of "expired prescription."

LIKELY FALSE – Most participants correctly defined what "Expired" status meant. Although, some participants did not separate refills' availability from the status. The participants who did not correctly define 'expired' mostly associated it with refills being "finished".

## **Key Findings**

**Objective: Understand if Veterans can locate and fill/refill their medications.**

1. **Most participants (13 of 18) successfully located their medication list from the landing page.**
2. **All users (100%) demonstrated the ability to recognize and refill prescriptions once they were on the medication list view page.**
3. **Most participants, (15 of 17) located and refilled prescriptions on the detailed view page.**
4. **Most participants (9 of 15) anticipated the presence of a convenient "fill-all" button or checkbox for multiple prescription refills.**
5. **Some participants (9 of 14) expected an accessible cancellation option.**
6. **Most participants (11 of 15) expressed their intention to include prescriptions never filled while performing a multi-refill.**
7. **Some participants (7 of 17) did not engage with the sort feature.**

**Objective: Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience with understanding the status of their medications.**

1. **Some participants (5 of 18) were uncertain or unaware of whether or not their refill had been submitted.**
2. **Some participants (7 of 18) anticipated receiving an additional notification, through text or email, after their submission.**
3. **Some participants (8 of 14) defined "active" correctly as referring to prescriptions that are yet to expire.**
4. **Most participants (10 of 14) responded with uncertainty, stating "I don't know," when asked about the meaning of "active parked."**
5. **Most participants (9 of 14) incorrectly attributed the term "discontinued" to signify that the VA or manufacturer no longer carried the medication.**
6. **Most participants (8 of 14) correctly defined "expired" as indicating that the prescription required renewal.**
7. **Most participants (16 of 17) accurately identified "shipped" as a refill status, with a noteworthy observation that 4 out of 18 participants did not recognize "expect to fill" as a refill status on list view.**
8. **Most participants (7 of 13) expressed dissatisfaction with the level of information provided on non-refillable prescriptions, particularly on the list view.**
9. **Some participants (6 of 18) could not locate "never filled" prescriptions.**

**Objective: Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience with managing their medications.**

1. **Most participants (16 of 17) interacted with the option to print or download their medication list.**
2. **Some participants (7 of 17) were unable to identify the image on the details page when prompted.**
3. **Half of the participants (9 of 18) did not instinctively click on "learn how to renew".**
4. **Most participants (13 of 17) successfully located the reason for the use of the targeted prescription in the detailed view.**

## **Details of Findings**

### **Objective: Understand if Veterans can locate and fill/refill their medications.**

**1. Most participants located their medication list from the landing page.**

 **13 of 18 of participants demonstrated the capability to easily locate their medication list directly from the landing page.** When asked, these 13 participants were able to directly or without help, access the button to go to their medications list page. This suggests that it is a user-friendly design. The participants who did not find this button on their own were desktop users. One confused the link within the FAQ "Learn how to renew" as the link to refill a medication.

  The average time to find the targeted medication starting from the landing page was 42 seconds.

  "_...it has the link right there. I'd click on 'how to renew the prescriptions"'_

  "_I don't see anything here, but only how to get my prescriptions but not the name..."_
  
**All 5 participants who needed guidance to get to their medications list view were desktop users.** There was no solid evidence in this study to show that the phone design of the "Go to medications" button was somehow better. It is likely that this nuance may be due to the size of the screen. Upon launch of the landing page on a phone, the "go to medications" button is much more apparent and more easily accessible than on a desktop.

**2. All participants identified and refilled prescriptions.**

**All users (100%) exhibited proficiency in identifying and refilling their prescriptions once in the medication list view.** Every participant understood the necessary steps to complete a refill. However, it is important to note that this observation does not address whether they obtained the correct prescription. Nevertheless, all participants effectively refilled the medication they thought they were instructed to find by clicking on the "Request a refill" button.

Task completion times for specific medications were notably swift:

- Furosemide: 14 seconds
- Dailyvite: 9 seconds
- Tramadol: 9 seconds
- Losartan: 8 seconds

**3. Most participants refilled prescriptions in detail view.**

**I5 of 17 participants successfully located and initiated prescription refills from the detail-view page.** When asked to refill prescription on the detail-view page, most of the participants noticed and used the "Request a refill" button located at the top section of the page. The success rate could imply that the detailed view page not only presents information in a comprehensible manner but also facilitates a smooth and trouble-free prescription refill process. The 2 participants who did not complete this task said they did not expect it to be an option within this view.

When asked, "do you expect to be able to refill here (details page)", a participant responded:

"_no, '__cause I thought you could only do it from the list of medications."_

The other participant also responded _"no"_ and proceeded to talk about how he refills his medications via phone.

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Action Link

**4. Some participants expected a "fill-all" or checkbox option multiple refills.**

**9 of 15 participants anticipated the presence of a convenient "fill-all" button or checkbox, streamlining the process for multiple prescription refills.** When asked to refill multiple prescriptions, many participants either verbally expressed the need for a "fill-all" option or a checkbox, or this was observed through their behavior.These participants also expected a "submit all" option at the bottom of the refill page. Being that the current method on the Classic version of this page offers a "checkbox" option, it is likely that this mental model is influenced by previous experience with multiple refills.

The participants who did not verbally (or by observed behavior) express this desire simply agreed that they would fill each prescription by clicking the "refill" button one at a time, while they go down the list.

"_...you have to go to each one and that's a lot to keep up on."_

"_I was hoping there would be a button to let me do all of them"_

"_Fill-all button, I think that would be beneficial..."_

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Action Link

**5. Some participants expected a cancellation option.**

**9 of 14 users expected a means of cancellation, either on the list or detail page.** This feature would be especially useful after accidental submissions or changes of intent. These participants expected a cancellation option in the form of a button that appears after submission or a phone number. Other participants said _"I don't know"_ when asked how they could cancel. Interestingly, it is crucial to note that since none of the participants had ever encountered a situation where they needed to cancel, this observation introduces a nuanced perspective, suggesting that while the desire for a cancellation option is prevalent, the immediacy of addressing this need might not be a top priority.
**No participants had previously encountered the need to cancel a refill submission.**

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Action Link

**6. Some participants will include never-filled prescriptions when refilling multiple.**

**Most participants (11 of 15) expressed their intention to include prescriptions that were never filled when performing a multi-refill.** While some of these participants simply missed the idea that there were medications on the list that had never been filled, others will deliberately add these never filled medications "if they need it". The majority seemed to understand the difference between "fill" and "refill" prescription, but this does not deter their decisions to include never filled.

"_I mean if I saw this message I would go ahead and fill it. It was something I need because it was prescribed"_

"_It says I haven't filled that one yet, so I would hit fill prescription."_

_"When I see that there is something that hasn't been filled, I check it anyway."_

**7. Some participants did not interact with the Sort Feature.**

**7 of 17 participants did not interact with the sort feature throughout the study.** During the course of this study, it was noted that 7 participants did not, duringany task, interact with the sort feature in order to quickly access a prescription.Among the subset of participants (10) who did use the sorting feature, 7 engaged with it after the 3rd tasks. Understanding the specific tasks and contextual factors surrounding the tasks could provide valuable insights into why participants chose whether to or not to interact with the 'sort' feature. It's possible that the complexity or information overload of the tasks was different for each participant, causing some to seek more efficient ways of organizing or accessing the prescriptions and others to get through without using the 'sort' feature.

There were no major differences between interaction for either mobile or desktop users.

### **Objective: Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience with understanding the status of their medications.**

**1. Some participants were uncertain that their refill request was submitted successfully.**

**Some participants did not know that their refill request had been submitted.** After clicking on "request a fill" to submit a refill request, 5 of 18 participants were uncertain about the status of their refill submission or were unaware if the submission had been successfully completed. 4 participants said "I don't know" when asked this follow-up question and 1 participant said "no".

_"I don't see it verified anywhere."_

_"...umm that there must be some kind of issue if they're reviewing it."_

_"The wording, I don't know about the 'reviewing a refill' is good."_

**2. Some participants expressed desire for additional notifications**

**7 of 18 participants expected to receive additional notifications, either via text or email, after submitting their refill requests.** Of these participants, 3 expressed the expectation of receiving notifications upon the shipment of their prescription, indicating that it is en route to them. Additionally, 2 participants anticipated notifications immediately after their prescriptions had been filled. Furthermore, 1 participant specifically looked forward to receiving a notification within the MHV portal, without the need to navigate from the platform.

"_...I'd expect to get an email that says my medication is on the way."_

"_I'd check back again or get an email saying that it's being filled."_

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

**3. Most participants correctly define "active" as a status.**

**8 of 14 participants defined "active" prescriptions that are still valid and can be refilled.** The study revealed that 57% of the participants understood what an "Active" prescription meant as a status of their prescription. They asserted that it meant the prescription was still valid and does not need a doctor's signature to be refilled. The nuance between the participants who correctly defined 'active' as a status and those who didn't was that the other participants defined it based on the refills left. These participants who did not correctly define active' as a status mostly indicated that active meant that refills were remaining on the prescription.

**2 Participants would expect the link describing the status to be more explicit.** One of these participants expressed that the card should"_just tell me what it means_." These participants opened and clicked on the link within the detail page to understand what the status meant.

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

**4. None of the participants defined 'active parked' correctly.**

**No one correctly defined "Active parked".** None of the participants accurately defined what this status meant when asked. 10 of these 14 said they were "unsure" what the status meant and did not provide any definition. This lack of comprehension among the majority of participants regarding the term "active parked" highlights a potential ambiguity or confusion within the context or framework in which this term was introduced or used.
**2 participants assumed that this meant there is an issue with the prescription.**
**2 other participants assumed that "active parked" meant that nothing is wrong with the prescription.**

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

**5. Most participants did not correctly define "Discontinued" Status.**

**9 of 14 participants associated the term "discontinued" with the indication that the medication was no longer carried by the VA or the manufacturer.** A majority, comprising 9 of the 14 participants, associated this term with the belief that the medication was no longer available through either the Veterans Affairs (VA) or the manufacturer. This interpretation suggests a common misunderstanding among participants that "discontinued" implies that the manufacturer ceased production.

**2 participants assumed that this meant the prescription had expired or "fell off".** These participants seemed to have defined "discontinued" similarly to "Expired" status.

**1 participant would ask their care provider what the status meant.**

**Only 2 participants correctly defined "discontinued.** These 2 participants claimed that this status meant that "the provider no longer wants you to take the medication."

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

**6. Most participants correctly defined 'expired' status.**


**The majority defined 'expired" status correctly.** 8 of 14 participants interpreted the "expired" status as representing prescriptions needing renewal. These participants understood that these prescriptions cannot be refilled until they have had it renewed by the prescribing physician. These participants also seemed to have understood that there is a time frame for a prescription to be used before it is considered "Expired" and needs a new authorization written by the prescribing physician.

**2 participants assumed that this means they haven't refilled it in a while.** According to these participants, a prescription that remains unfilled for a prolonged duration is perceived as expired or considered "old." Notably, these individuals did not associate this with the need for prescription reauthorization or renewal.

**1 participant did not know what "expired" status meant.**

In summary, all these findings on statuses uncovers varied interpretations of the terms among participants, ranging from a perception of unavailability to different assumptions about the reasons behind discontinuation, expired, active, and active parked prescriptions. These findings underscore the importance of clear and transparent communication between healthcare providers and patients to ensure a shared understanding of medication-related terminology, therefore, enhancing patient education and engagement in their healthcare journey.

**7. Most participants identified refill statuses.**

**16 of 17 participants accurately recognized "shipped" as a refill status.** The adaptation of the universal image of a truck allowed participants to quickly call out the status of this targeted prescription. The adoption of this symbol, paired with a written interpretation, seemed to have reduced cognitive overload for the participants, allowing them to quickly understand the information presented.

"_Having the little pic of the truck makes it look different, and it says shipped on July 3..."_

**4 out of 18 participants did not identify "expect to fill" as a refill status.** When asked what the status of a prescription that has been submitted for a refill was, these four participants did not specifically refer to the information indicating the refill status; instead, they focused on the remaining number of refills and acknowledged the recent submission of a refill. Various factors could have contributed to this oversight, such as a potential misunderstanding of the term "refill status" as denoting the current state of the prescription rather than indicating the status of the previously submitted refill. It is noteworthy that 14 of the participant population noticed and called out this information.

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

**8. Some participants reacted unfavorably to Non-Refillable Prescriptions.**

**54% or 7 of 13 participants expressed dissatisfaction with the level of information provided on non-refillable prescriptions on the list view card.** Among the 13 participants, 7 individuals expressed a desire for more detailed insights into the reasons behind a prescription being labeled as non-refillable online. Several participants pointed out the limited nature of information provided on the card, suggesting the inclusion of details explaining why a prescription is currently deemed unrefillable "at this time."

**4 participants expressed frustration with unrefillable prescriptions**. When asked, these participants expressed dissatisfaction ~~for the idea~~ that a prescription cannot be refilled online.

"_If I took this on a regular basis I would be frustrated. Now I would have to call the pharm. I would be frustrated."_

"_Doesn't surprise me, nope, it's just a thing. Expecting it to be efficient would be frustrating"_

**9. Some participants could not locate "never-filled" prescriptions.**

**6 of 18 participants faced difficulties in locating "never filled" prescriptions.** These participants missed the information presented on the card that noted that a prescription has never been filled.

Most of the participants independently located the never-filled prescriptions. It is also noteworthy that of this group, 75% correctly scrolled to the top of the list first to successfully find the relevant information.

### **Objective: Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience with managing their medications.**

**1. Most participants interacted with the 'print or download' feature.**

**94% of participants interacted with the print or download option for their medication list**. 16 of 17 participants interacted with the print or download feature when asked about collecting information for an appointment. These participants exhibited efficiency in completing this task, with an average time of just 6 seconds. These participants expressed familiarity and comfort with utilizing the print or download option to gather information for their appointments.

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Cards

**2. Some participants did not find the image on the details Page.**

**41% of participants struggled to identify the image on the details page when prompted.** When participants were prompted to identify how they would ascertain they had received the correct medication, these 7 of 17 participants did not identify that there was an image of the prescription with the details page.

**Some participants expressed preference for image placement.** 24% of participants, who either found the image independently or were prompted, expressed a preference for moving the image up to the "about medication" field or opening the image for improved visibility and user experience. Half of these participants were those who found the image independently and the other half were those who didn't.

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

**3. Half of the participants did not click on the "Learn How to Renew" link.**

**Half of the participants (50%) did not intuitively click on the "learn how to renew" link.** 9 participants did not instinctively click on this crucial link designed to guide users through the medication renewal process. These users expressed how they had done it in the past or expressed frustration with having a prescription unrefillable.

Although, it is important to note that since this testing was within a controlled environment, these users may have avoided clicking on the link before being told to do so.

Interestingly, non-My HealtheVet (MHV) users completely overlooked this link. This subset of participants, who might be less familiar with the platform, did not navigate the designated pathway for understanding the medication renewal process.

**2 participants expressed the desire for a "quick message" Option.** Two participants recommended the integration of a "quick message" feature on the prescription card to improve communication. This feature would enable users to initiate a message directly within the list view of their medication management, eliminating the need to exit the platform first.

"_It's great that the phone number is there but it would be great to message instead."_

"_..._ _have a space that says I need to contact my doctor or send a secure message from this screen that I can't refill my medication."_

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Action Links

**4. Most participants identified the 'reason for use' of a prescription.**

**Most of the participants located the 'reason for use' of targeted prescription.** These 13 of 17 participants successfully found the reason for each prescription's use within the details page. These participants showed they could locate, independently, the reason for a prescription.

LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

## **Additional Insights**

1. **Preference for Auto-Refill Option.** 4 participants expressed a desire for the inclusion of an auto-refill option to simplify prescription refills, highlighting its potential usefulness.
2. **Additional Information in Prescription Details.** Participants expressed a need for more comprehensive information in the prescription details section. These 3 participants expect to see more information such as prescription side effects and other uses linked within the details page.
3. **Quick Tracking Shipment Status.** Two participants emphasized the importance of a "quick track" feature, allowing them to monitor shipment status directly from the list view, without navigating to the details page.
4. **Font and Spacing.** 1 participant expressed the need for bigger font and different use of white space.

## **Recommendations**

- Add line break/padding to draw more attention to the link in the landing page, directing users to "Go to your medications".
  - This will help guide users directly to their medication list without having to scroll through the landing page looking for it.
- Add cancellation information within refill request view.
  - This will allow users the option to cancel their submission request when needed.
- Consider a more distinct way to display "fill" versus "refill" option. Consider rewording fill to say: "Request a new fill".
  - This content change option will allow users to quickly identify new versus old prescriptions and "fill" versus "refill." This is especially necessary for when a Veteran is ready to request the first fill of a prescription or when deciding not to.
- Consider a more familiar success message upon refill submission.
  - This content update will let Veterans confirm that the refill was submitted successfully, while still telling them it is in review. A success icon will also promote Veteran's confidence in the submission.

## **Next Steps**

- Socialize research to team, Health Apartment, and VA research community [Ade Ajayi]
- Incorporate recommendations into final Sketch designs for development team [Lexi Wunder, Harrison Amelang]
- Work with sitewide content on content updates and future research efforts. [Lexi Wunder]
- Conduct additional research [Ade Ajayi and Anne Costello Kennedy]

## **Further research needed**

- Study shows that most users do not correctly define prescription statuses. Consider a future secondary study to understand the value of these statuses and best practices for displaying them.
- Consider a future secondary research study to understand best practices regarding displaying fill-all and checklist option for multiple prescription refill.
- Consider content changes to a prescription that has an unknown status.
- Consider retesting "sort" feature in other studies to identify potential user pain point(s).
  - Consider desktop research on the best way to present sort feature on a website.
- Consider future iteration to improve visibility of images in the detail-view page.
