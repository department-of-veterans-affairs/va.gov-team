# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov Medications – IPE A/B Testing June 2025

---

## Background

Our project is part of the **Digital Health Modernization** strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) is being moved to VA.gov.

We initially built and tested a prototype of Medications in MHV on VA.gov. We conducted usability studies and collected feedback that informed iterations on the website. We also conducted usability studies on a new **in-product education (IPE)** component to evaluate participants’ ability to find specific medications. In this round of A/B testing, we will conduct further testing on the IPE component.

## OCTO-DE Priorities

_Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed._

### Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

- **KR1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
- **KR2:** Reduce the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, toward a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
- **KR3:** Ensure 100% of transactions are either processed correctly or notify the user of an error.

## Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit in the [Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?

- Starting Up
- Taking Care of Myself
- Putting Down Roots
- Retiring
- Aging

---

## Research Goals

- Understand whether the IPE helps Veterans find their medications.
- Understand whether the IPE encourages Veterans to use the filter component.
- Understand where the IPE is most effective within the Medications IA on VA.gov.

---

## Outcome

The results of the study will help determine if the current designs offer the best user experience for Veterans and identify any usability pain points. This will guide future design improvements.

---

## Research Questions

1. Which version of the Medications List helps Veterans find specific medications most efficiently?
2. Which version encourages Veterans to use the filter component?
3. Which version do Veterans find most intuitive and easy to use?

---

## Hypotheses

- **Hypothesis 1:** The “filter open” version enables Veterans to find medications more easily than other versions.
- **Hypothesis 2:** The “filter open” version promotes more frequent use of the filter.
- **Hypothesis 3:** The “filter open” version will yield:
  - Lower task completion times
  - Higher accuracy rates
  - Higher satisfaction scores
  - More positive feedback

---

## Methodology

### Study Type

**Unmoderated prototype testing with post-task questions** via Optimal Workshop.

### Tasks

- Participants complete 2 tasks using 3 different Medications List prototypes.
- Researchers will:
  - Observe navigation
  - Compare task completion times
  - Evaluate satisfaction across conditions

### Prototype Variants

1. IPE component above the filter
2. IPE component below the filter
3. Filter accordion expanded (IPE and sort removed)

---

## Location

Remote testing via Optimal Workshop.
