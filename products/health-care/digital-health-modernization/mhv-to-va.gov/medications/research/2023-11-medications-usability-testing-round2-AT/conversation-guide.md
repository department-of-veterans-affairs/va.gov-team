## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ade. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving the VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know.

_For screen reader sessions only:_

What screen reader will you be using for today's session? _(If they state they will not be using a screen reader, please end the session and notify Perigean.)_

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call.

**SIGHTED USERS**

I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

**AT USERS**

Our accessibility specialist, Angela, is in the waiting room. Before I let her in, I want to let you know that she will be here to help us navigate any accessibility troubles we might have. She will also help us with any screen-reader troubleshooting we may need to do during this time. I'm going to let her into the session and have her introduce herself to you.

(_Let Angela in)_

Angela, do you mind introducing yourself to [PARTICIPANT]?

Thank you.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session and help take notes so that we can accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

- _(If yes, let them in. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")_
- _(NOTETAKER & OBSERVERS JOIN)_ We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] Please turn on your camera and introduce yourself to [PARTICIPANT].
- Could the notetaker and observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? _(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")_

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour (A11Y – 1.5hrs).** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- I will soon be sharing a link with you to the website we will be looking at today using your screen reader. This is a live site; it will behave as expected when you are on a typical website.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** _Start recording to the cloud._
- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions - 5-10 minutes**

_[If yes]_

- How often?
- Do you use it to refill your medications?
  - _[If yes]_ How often?
  - Do you fill multiple medications at a time?
  - _[If yes]_ Can you describe how you do that?

    - Was there anything that hindered or helped you from better understanding your medication?

- Besides refilling your medications, what else do you do on that page?

## **Screen sharing instructions (AT USERS & MOBILE)**

Have you ever shared your screen on Zoom before?

_(If yes – proceed to share link)_

_(If no): Have A11Y walk the participant through screen-sharing._

Our Accessibility specialist will help walk you through how to do this. Do you mind unmuting and walking [PARTICIPANT] through this, Angela/A11Y specialist?

- In the Zoom application on your computer, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer).
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared.)
- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.
- iPad: Broadcast screen
- I just sent you the link to access the platform in our chat. If you don't mind clicking that link to open up the page.

_(Help users navigate to chat when needed – Have A11Y specialist help the participant navigate this if needed)_

- Getting to chat is a similar process as earlier. In the bottom (top in iPad) of your screen, there is a row of bottoms, one of the options should say 'chat,' you may need to click on the 3 dots (on smaller screens) to bring up more options.

_(Once link has been opened)_

- Since this is a live website, we are going to need to log into the account. I am going to walk you through how to do this by providing the username (which is an email) and a password.
- As you are probably aware, there are a few ways to log into your My HealtheVet website, for the sake of this study, please select the option "ID.me" to proceed.
- Whenever you are ready, I will present that login information to you.

_When ready, share the email and password using the military alphabet._

- Go ahead and click sign-in.
- It is going to ask for a 2-step authorization, but we have gone ahead to fill this out for you, so please click continue.
- _On code page –_ Please proceed by clicking continue once again.

_(Have A11Y specialist help the participant share audio from screen reader)_

## **Remote Control sharing instructions (NON-AT USERS)**

- I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. This allows you take control of my screen as if it were yours. The functionality will be similar to how you would use your computer. Does that sound ok?
- _[Share your screen]_. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? _[Give mouse control]_ Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?
  - _[Veteran might need to use a mouse to move around the screen if trackpad does not work.]_

## **Participant Coaching**

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own. Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can't see your screen.

_[for MHV users]_ This is going to look familiar, but please remember that this is a new design we are testing and some elements you might expect to be there will not and some you don't expect will.

Since we are trying to make this experience as realistic as possible, you may notice that the name at the top right is Jamie. If this were your page, it would be your name, but for today you will notice Jamie at the top of your screen.

Are you ready to get started?
