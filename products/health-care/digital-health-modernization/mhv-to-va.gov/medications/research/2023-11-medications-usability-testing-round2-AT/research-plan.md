# **Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medications, November 2023**

## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We initially tested a prototype of the Medications page in MHV on VA.gov and updates were made based on user feedback. In this round of usability testing within a live environment, we will assess (1) whether the updates improve user experiences, and (2) test additional functionality that we were unable to test in round 1, (3) include Veterans who require accessibility provisions and explore further pain points.

## **OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online.
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

## **Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## **Research Goals**

1. Understand if design updates made to the following areas improve Veterans' experience with managing their medications:
    1. Fill / refill medications
    2. Status of medications
    3. Medication management
    4. Other content updates
2. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience with managing their medications.
3. Identify any barriers that may prevent Veterans who use screen-readers and text-magnifiers from completing their medication management goals.
4. Identify any barriers that may prevent Veterans who have mild to severe Cognitive Disabilities from completing their medication management goals.

## **Outcome**

The results of this study will help us determine if our updated designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to manage and view their medications. This will inform any further iterations of the design before the Phase 1 launch.

## **Research questions**

1. Do Veterans understand the purpose of the Medications landing page?
    1. How do Veterans expect to use this page?
2. Are Veterans able to find the information they need to fill/refill their prescriptions?
    1. Are Veterans able to successfully locate and request a refill for their medications?
    2. What are their expectations after a medication has been submitted for refill?
    3. What, if any, are Veterans expectations regarding being notified about their medications?
    4. What are Veterans' attitudes regarding the cancellation option?
3. Are Veterans able to understand the statuses of their prescriptions?
    1. Do Veterans understand the difference between expired and discontinued medication?
    2. Are Veterans able to identify which medication has never been filled?
4. Are Veterans able to find the information they need to manage and understand their prescriptions?
    1. Do Veterans understand the information provided on tracking a shipped medication?
5. Do Veterans use the 'sort' feature to find a medication not readily on their list.
    1. How do Veterans expect to find a medication if they do not recall the name?
    2. What are Veterans' attitudes towards finding a medication?
6. Do Veterans understand how they can request multiple refills on this page?
    1. How do Veterans expect to fill multiple medications?

## **Hypothesis**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will be able to find the information they need to fill/refill their medications.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will understand the statuses of their medications.

_Hypothesis 3:_  Most Veterans will be able to find the information they need to manage and understand their medications.

_Hypothesis 4: Most_ Veterans will find never-filled medications.

_Hypothesis 5: Most_ Veterans will use the 'sort' feature to quickly find medications and will express positive feedback towards it.

_Hypothesis 6_: Some Veterans will prefer a "checkbox" option for refilling multiple medications.

## **Methodology**

We will conduct moderated usability testing sessions in which we will ask participants to navigate the live website while we observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed. We will use a prototype for one task with our sighted participants.

### **Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
