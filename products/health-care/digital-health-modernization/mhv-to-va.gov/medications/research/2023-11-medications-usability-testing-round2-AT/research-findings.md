## **Methodology**

We conducted moderated usability testing sessions in which we asked users to navigate the live website while we observed their behavior, and asked follow-up prompts as needed. We asked participants to perform the following tasks on the prototype:

**Task 1: Landing Page**

- Understand Veterans' attitude towards the Landing page.
- Understand how Veterans expect to use the Landing page?

**Task 2: Refill Prescription**

- Refill a prescription.
- Determine if a refill submission was successful.
- Determine next steps after a refill has occurred.

**Task 3: Statuses**

- Define "Expired" vs. "Discontinued".
- Identify Never-filled prescriptions.

**Task 4: Prescription Details**

- Review prescription details.

**Task 5: Find a prescription**

- Identify how to locate a prescription.

**Task 6: Multiple Refill**

- Refill multiple prescriptions on the list.

## **Hypothesis and Conclusions**

- _Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will be able to find the information they need to fill/refill their prescriptions.

DEFINITELY TRUE – Most participants were able to find the information they needed to fill/refill their prescriptions. All participants were able to find the "request a refill" button to submit a refill request within the list view and detail page.

- _Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will understand the statuses of their prescriptions.

LIKELY FALSE – Most participants did not understand what the statuses of their prescriptions meant. 'Discontinued' seemed to be the most challenging status for Participants to understand.

- _Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will be able to understand the information they need to manage their medications.

TRUE – Most participants understood the information presented in the detail page of their prescription and expressed favorable feedback towards the page. Some expressed the desire to see more information including side effects of the prescription.

- _Hypothesis 4:_ Most Veterans will find never-filled prescriptions.

LIKELY TRUE- Some participants were able to find never-filled prescriptions and call out the difference in the button.

- _Hypothesis 5:_ Most Veterans will use the 'sort' feature to quickly find prescriptions and will express positive feedback towards it.

LIKELY FALSE– Less than half of the participants used the 'sort' feature or indicated intention to use it at some point.

- _Hypothesis 6_: Some Veterans will prefer a "checkbox" option for refilling multiple prescriptions.

LIKELY UNTRUE – Only a few participants indicated preference for a "checkbox" option to refill multiple prescriptions.

## **Key Findings**

**Task 1 – About Page**

1. **Most of the participants (9 of 13) correctly acknowledged the purpose of the medications landing page.**
2. **One participant using JAWS, who also self-identified as having a CD, assumed the "Go to your medication now" heading on the 'about page' was the link.**
3. **Two participants, who self-identified as having a cognitive disability, indicated dissatisfaction with the word "tool(s)" used to describe the platform.**
    - One participant who indicated having severe cognitive disability expressed frustration with the landing page.

**Task 2 – Refill Prescription**

1. **Most of the participants (11 of 13) successfully identified the "go to your medications" link in the landing page, when asked to refill a medication.**
2. **Some participants (3 of 13) expected a refill option within the landing page. These were Screen reader users.**
3. **All of the participants (13 of 13) successfully refilled the targeted prescription.**
    - 1 JAWS user refilled targeted prescription within the details view.
4. **Some participants (5 of 13) expressed uncertainty when asked about their prescription submission. Four of these 5 participants self-identified as having a cognitive disability.**
5. **A11Y - JAWS screen reader (SR) transitioned to heading 1 (H1) immediately upon submitting a refill request, without first providing confirmation information.**
6. **Most of the participants indicated that they currently receive notifications regarding the status of their refill requests. The prevailing update commonly reported was related to the shipment of prescribed medications.**
7. **Some participants (3 of 13) provided favorable feedback regarding the functionality of the existing user interface (UI) or similar to confirm a submission was successful - Active: Submitted, while most (6 of 10) indicated preference for receiving email or text notification.**

**Task 3 – Statuses**

1. **Most participants (9 of 12) correctly defined 'expired' as a status.**
    - 2 participants seemed to have separated the status 'expired' from the information presented on the card. Notably, one participant with a cognitive disability accurately defined 'too old to refill' but did not categorize it as 'expired.'
2. **Most participants (9 of 12) did not correctly interpret "discontinued" as a status.**
3. **Most participants (6 of 10) were able to identify and call out the "request the first fill" button when instructed to find "active + never-filled prescription"**
    - No participants indicated, either directly or by observed behavior, ever having the need to identify a never-filled medication using a designated refill button.

**Task 4 – Prescription Details**

1. **Most participants (10 of 11) presented favorable feedback toward the detail page.**
    - Some participants (5 of 11) expressed a desire for additional information regarding their medication, with a particular emphasis on the medication's side effects

**Task 5 – Finding a Prescription**

1. **Some of participants (6 of 13) either utilized or expressed an intention to use the sorting feature to locate a medication on their list.**
    - Scrolling was the most utilized method to find a prescription on the list.
2. **A11Y – Some screen-reader participants (2 of 4) relied on the 'Ctrl + F' function to locate medications within the list, while the remaining users navigated by scrolling.**
    - Interestingly, none of the screen reader participants utilized the sorting feature or expressed an inclination to do so.
    - One sighted participant used ctrl + f to find a medication.
3. **Some participants (4 of 13) indicated the need for a search bar to find their medication by name.**
4. **Some participants (2 of 13) indicated a preference for sorting medications in both ascending and descending alphabetical order. These were phone users.**
5. **Some participants (2 of 13) indicated a preference for having all medications on one page.**

**Task 6 – Refilling multiple prescriptions**

1. **Most participants (7 of 11) expressed positive feedback toward the current method of refilling multiple prescriptions.**
    - Most Screen-Reader participants (3 of 4) and some of participants with Cognitive Disability (3 of 6) expressed positive feedback towards the current design.
    - All infrequent and non-users of MHV for prescription refill favored the current design.
    - Of all 5 participants who are current users of the classic design, 2 preferred the select-method, 2 participants favored the current design, and 1 participant expressed indifference.
2. **Some participants (2 of 13) suggested having a confirmation option as an extra step when refilling multiple prescriptions.**

## **Details of Findings**

**Task 1 – About Page**

1. **Most of the participants (9 of 13) correctly acknowledged the purpose of the medications landing page.** Most of the participants were able to understand the purpose of the about page, including its use for learning more about prescriptions and getting their questions answered from the FAQs. However, four participants, who were sighted users, when asked, only indicated its relevance to prescription refill management.

    In general, this page appeared quite intuitive to most users who were able to identify its use.

    Screen reader users all correctly identified the purpose of this page. This could be attributed to the natural navigation afforded by Assistive Technology, which allows them to explore the entire page more comprehensively compared to their sighted counterparts.

    "_I might look at this stuff as a refresher..."_

    "_...the content in it was pretty clear..."_

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Accordions

1. **Two participants, who self-identified as having a cognitive disability, indicated dissatisfaction with the word "tool(s)" used to describe the platform.** These users expressed discontentment with the use of the word "tools" used to describe the platform in the "about page". Both of these users identified as having a cognitive disability.

    One of these users, aged 67, expressed that "older guys" do not use words like this to describe a digital content, but mechanical materials. The other user admitted that the word "tools" was used too many times, "twisting her brains all around."

    "…_why do they call it a tool?", "...I don't know why they call it a tool"_

    "_...tools, this word throws the old guys sometimes."_

1. **One of these participants also expressed frustration with the content on the landing page.** This participant, who self-identified as having a severe cognitive disability expressed that the content (_"the wording"_) in the landing page was "_too much_" and it "_just doesn't make_ sense".

    "_They're just adding too many words in there and it's twisting your brains around. "_

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

1. **One participant using JAWS, who also self-identified as having a CD assumed the "Go to your medication now" heading on the 'about page' was the link.** When requested to renew a prescription, the participant navigated to the correct section labeled "Go to your medications now." However, the participant misunderstood this header as the intended link to access medications, whereas the intended link was below this; the participant sought clarification before proceeding.

    "_Yes, I did (expect that to be a link), was it not?" -_ AT3

**Task 2 – Refill Prescription**

1. **Eleven of the 13 participants successfully identified the "go to your medications" link in the landing page, when asked to refill a medication.** When asked to go refill a prescription, 85% of the participants identified the link and, without prompts, found the list of prescriptions.
2. **The average time for doing this across all the participants was 1 minute and 13 seconds.** Participants using screen readers, on average, took about 3 minutes and 7 seconds to find the list of prescriptions. Two of the 4 users with screen readers did not successfully complete this task without prompting. There were no significant differences between other users, either on a mobile device or desktop.
This is a positive insight based on the recommendation from the previous research study.

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SFTW: Screenreader, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Action Link

2. **Some participants expected a refill option within the about page.** Three participants expected to find the list of medications within the 'about page'. These were Screen reader users. These participants either directly searched for "refill" or verbally expressed their intent to find a refill list within the page. One of these participants expressed intent to find "refill" on the page, but independently proceeded to click the "go to medication" link.

    Only one of these users was an active user of the current classic design of MHV. This observation brings to question how these users perceive the about page being the landing page for their prescription management platform.

    "_Well, I was looking for the word refill, or the name of the medication, but it did not..."_

    "_I was expecting that link, but the question was refill the medication..."_

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SFTW: Screenreader, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Action Link

3. **100% of users successfully refilled the targeted prescription.** When they found the targeted prescription, all participants successfully and, without prompting, clicked on the "request a refill" button to submit a refill request.

4. **One participant, who was a screen-reader user, JAWS, refilled in the detail page**. This participant found the prescription link and opened the detail-view of the prescription before proceeding to refill. The participant indicated that this is a way to make sure she is refilling the correct prescription.

    "_(I opened it because) the headings seem clear to me that this is within this medication, so this must be the action for this medication"_ – AT1

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SFTW: Screenreader, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Card

1. **Five of 13 participants expressed uncertainty when asked about the status of their refill submission.** After submitting a refill, these participants did not seem to have understood that the confirmation message asserted that the submission was successful. When asked if it was, these participants expressed uncertainty.

1. **Four of these 5 participants self-identified as having a cognitive disability.** Most of these participants identified as having moderate to severe cognitive disability.
2. **Four of these participants were sighted users.**
    
    "_If I didn't know what I know, I would be saying, 'did that get put through?" -_ P2

    "_I cannot tell."_ - AT3

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SFTW: Screenreader, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Card

1. **A11Y - JAWS screen reader (SR) transitioned to heading 1 (H1) immediately upon submitting a refill request, without first providing confirmation information.** This research finding highlights a critical accessibility issue related to the JAWS screen reader during the submission of a refill request. Specifically, the screen reader transitions to heading 1 (H1) immediately after the refill request is submitted, without fully providing confirmation information or maintaining focus on the area. This behavior poses a significant challenge for users who rely on screen readers to navigate and understand web content. In the case of multiple refills, this may pose a significant pain point for the Veteran.

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SFTW: Screenreader, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Card

1. **When asked, most of the participants indicated that they currently receive notifications regarding the status of their refill requests.** These participants indicated an expectation for email notification about the status of their submitted refill request. The majority indicated that they currently receive some form of notification, the prevailing update commonly reported was related to the shipment of prescription.

  1. **Three participants provided favorable feedback regarding the functionality of the existing user interface (UI)** or similar, to confirm a submission was successful **-**"your request has been received..." and the 'Active: Submitted' status later updated upon refresh.
  
  2. **Six of 10 participants asked indicated preference for receiving email or text notification.**

     LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

**Task 3 – Statuses**

1. **Nine of 12 participants correctly defined expired as a status.** More than half of the participants defined expired as a status to mean a prescription is no longer valid and needs to be renewed by the prescribing physician.

1. **Two participants seemed to have separated the status 'expired' from the information presented on the card.** When asked to find the status of an expired prescription, these Two participants did not call out "expired" as the status but "too old to refill." It is important to note that these two were sighted users. This finding may prove that some users experience a disconnect between the status which, in the list view, is bolded above the status description.
2. **Notably, one participant with a cognitive disability accurately defined "too old to refill" but did not categorize it as "expired.**" While this participant correctly defined "too old to refill", the participant did not define "expired". In fact, when asked about 'expired' as a status, this participant expressed not having noticed such status.

    "_Let me see, I haven't seen that "this medication has expired" (anywhere) -_ P4

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SFTW: Screenreader, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

1. **Only some (3 of 12) participants correctly interpreted "discontinued" as a status.** Most of the participants defined "discontinued" as a prescription that is no longer carried by the pharmacy or one that has been discontinued by the manufacturer.

    These misinterpretations of statuses within the prescription list view assert previous research findings that most participants do not understand or appear to be affected by the significance of these statuses within the list view of their prescriptions. This finding also maintains that there is often a disconnection between the status and the status description under it.

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SFTW: Screenreader, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Card

1. **Most participants (6 of 10) were able to identify and call out the "request the first fill" button when instructed to find "active + never-filled prescription".** During the testing conducted within a live environment, participants were tasked with identifying prescriptions that had never been filled and were currently active, despite the presence of various refill and prescription statuses in the displayed list. Out of the 10 participants, 6 successfully located prescriptions meeting these criteria. Additionally, they independently noticed and highlighted the distinction in the associated button.

1. **No participants indicated, either directly or by observed behavior, ever having the need to identify a never-filled medication using a designated refill button.** Although 6 of 10 participants called out this button, none of the participants expressed or indicated the need for this distinction between the buttons.

    "_It (the button) is not a distinction I would even worry about."_

**Task 4 – Prescription Details**

1. **The detail page received predominantly favorable feedback from most (9 of 11) of participants.** When participants were asked to go through the detail page that included tracking information for a prescription that had been shipped, 91% of the participants agreed that the page met their expectations. These participants expressed positive feedback for the tracking information that was presented and the opportunity to see detailed information about the expected delivery of the shipment.

    Sighted participants who noticed the image of the prescription within the detail-view page, expressed positive feedback towards this.

1. **All Screen-reader participants expressed positive feedback towards the detail page.** These participants had the natural opportunity to tab through the content of the page in its entirety. All of these participants affirmed that this page met their expectations, with some indicating that it "surpasses" what they had expected.

    "_This is way more than I thought I would see." -_ AT3

    "_... If anything, it exceeded (my expectations)."_ - AT4

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SFTW: Screenreader, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

1. **FIve of 11 participants expressed a desire for additional information regarding their medication, with a particular emphasis on the medication's side effect.** While majority expressed favorable feedback towards the detail page, 5 of 11 participants expressed a desire for more information about the description; these participants mostly emphasized their desire for information about the side effects of the prescription.

    This finding is also consistent with feedback received in the Medallia survey feedback at the same time of this study.

    "_...because I take more than one med, I want to be aware of the side effects..."_

**Task 5 – Finding a Prescription**

1. **Some of participants (6 of 13) either utilized or expressed an intention to use the sorting feature to locate a medication on their list.** Participants had up to 5 opportunities to find a prescription during the duration of this study. Of the participants, 46% utilized or verbalized their intention to utilize the 'sort' feature to find a prescription at any point during this time. These participants independently noticed the 'sort' feature and used it in their search for a prescription or expressed the intention to use it. None of these participants expressed a negative reaction to the current functionality of the 'sort' feature.

    1. **Two participants utilized the 'sort' feature without clicking on the 'sort button'**. One participant indicated experience with the 'sort' feature auto-populating without having to click on the button.
    2. **Scrolling was the most utilized method to find a prescription on the list.** Most of the participants who did not utilize the 'sort' feature or 'ctrl +f', relied on scrolling to find all prescriptions at every task. Among the 4 participants who exclusively relied on scrolling, 2 were users of screen readers, and they consistently employed this method for each task throughout the study.

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SFTW: Screenreader, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov, DSC: Card

1. **A11Y - 2 of 4 screen-reader users relied on the 'Ctrl + F' function to locate medications**** within the list, while the remaining users navigated by scrolling**. These 2 participants relied exclusively on 'Ctrl +f' to search for prescriptions throughout the study. These participants did not use or express the intention to use the 'sort' feature on the page. When a prescription was on another page, these participants used pagination and then searched using 'Ctrl + f' to find the targeted prescription.

    1. **Interestingly, none of the screen reader users utilized the sorting feature or expressed an inclination to do so.** This could be attributed to the effectiveness of the 'Ctrl + f' function, which half of the screen reader users employed to search for specific prescriptions, while the other half relied on scrolling.
    2. **One sighted user used ctrl + f to find a medication.** This participant, who identified as a 27-year-old man, utilized 'Ctrl + f' by the second task to find the targeted prescription. This participant indicated that this was a typical process for finding information on a page.

    "_If I know the specific name of the product, or the first 4 letters, I will most likely use 'Command + f'."_ - P8

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SFTW: Screenreader, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov,

1. **Some participants (30% or 4 of the 13) indicated the desire for a search bar to find their medication by name.** Most of these participants indicated this desire after the third task of finding a prescription. Half of these participants found and interacted with the 'sort' feature during this study, while others did not use or indicate intention to use the 'sort' feature'. One of these users was a screen-reader user who did not use 'ctrl + f' for finding a prescription at any time during this study.

    "_If you had a search button by name up there, that'll be a big help." -_ P5

    "_...a search bar is what I expected to have on this page... you can have it exclusive to this page..."_ AT3

    LABELS: RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Cognitive Consideration, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SFTW: Screenreader, PRDT: MHV Integration to VA.gov

1. **Two of 13 participants indicated a preference for sorting medications in both ascending and descending alphabetical order.** According to these participants, this approach facilitates the quick retrieval of prescriptions beginning with later letters in the alphabet. Interestingly, these were phone users.

1. **Two of 13 participants indicated a preference for having all medications on one page.** When asked to find a prescription, 2 participants indicated a preference for having all medications on one page. One of these participants expressed that it'll be helpful to have all the medications on a single page with condensed information on the card. This way, clicking on a card can provide a pop-up of further details and clicking on the prescription link will open to a more comprehensive detail page.

    "_...then if you touch the medication, it opens the box and tells you if its active or expired or whatever..."_ - P7

    "_I see it's showing 21 of 31 so it would be helpful to have them all on one page." -_ P8

**Task 6 – Refilling multiple prescriptions**

1. **Seven of 11 participants expressed positive feedback towards the current method of refilling multiple prescriptions.** When asked to submit multiple refills (screen reader users were asked to describe how they would), the majority of the participants indicated positive feedback towards the method presented – that is, clicking "request a refill" one at a time. These were a diverse subset of the participant population.

    1. **Most (3 of 4) Screen-Reader users and some users (3 of 6) with Cognitive Disability expressed positive feedback towards the current design.** Screen-reader users, who rely on auditory output to navigate digital interfaces, provided favorable responses to the current method of refilling multiple prescriptions. This indicates that the interface effectively accommodates their needs, ensuring a seamless and accessible prescription management experience. Although, it is important to note that compared to sighted user groups, screen-reader users were not asked to perform the task of multiple refills. Instead, they were prompted to articulate how they would execute the task based on the existing design. Subsequently, they were asked a follow-up question regarding their reflections on that experience.
    3. Some (3 of 6) users with cognitive disabilities also expressed their satisfaction with the current design. This encompasses a diverse range of cognitive impairments, reflecting the inclusivity and effectiveness of the interface in catering to various user needs.

    1. **All infrequent and non-users of MHV for prescription refill favored the current design.** These were users who are either infrequently using the classic design or have never used MHV to manage their prescriptions. These users all gave positive feedback towards this method of refilling prescriptions, including multiple refills. It is possible that their feedback was influenced by their lack of experience with the "checkbox" method offered by the Classic design.

    1. **Of all 5 participants who are current users of the Classic design, 2 preferred the select-method, 2 participants favored the current design, and 1 participant expressed indifference.** The participants who expressed preference for the "checkbox" method of multiple refills were active users of the Classic design.

1. **Two participants suggested having a confirmation option as an extra step when refilling multiple prescriptions.** While one of these participants favored the current method, they both suggested an extra step when refilling multiple prescriptions. They said this would be a way to confirm the correct prescription is being selected before submitting.

    "_That way you could know what you're about request a refill for." -_ P5

    "_I think each one that I selected to request a refill, you'd get another step that would show the medication and give you the option to request."_ - P11

## **Recommendations**

- **About Page** : Change the "Go to your medications" Heading level 2 to "Go to your medications now."
  - Rephrasing H2 "Go to your medications" and the link to "Go to your medications now" can enhance the user experience for Veterans using Assistive Technologies, making it easier for them to identify the clickable link.
- **Submission confirmation** : Replace submission confirmation with the more familiar success message. Consider an icon to show that submission was successfully completed.
  - This content update will allow Veterans to confirm that the refill was indeed submitted successfully, while still informing them that it is in review. A success icon will also promote Veterans' confidence in the submission.
- **Statuses** : Consider removing status of medications from the cards in the list view.
  - This will help alleviate cognitive overload for Veterans, who do not know or appear to be affected by the information's significance.
- **Detail page** : Consider adding a link to prescription literature from detail page.
  - This will allow Veterans to quickly access medication information. It will also lead them to accurate information that has been approved by VA clinicians rather than potentially harmful information found with a Google search.

## **Next Steps**

- Socialize research to team, Health Apartment, and VA research community [Ade Ajayi]
- Incorporate recommendations into final designs for development team [Lexi Wunder, Harrison Amelang]
- Work with sitewide content on content updates and future research efforts. [Lexi Wunder and Ade Ajayi]
- Conduct additional research [Ade Ajayi, Anne Costello Kennedy]

## **Further research needed**

- Consider further secondary study on multiple refills.
