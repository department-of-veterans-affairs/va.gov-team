3. Understand Veterans’ expectations and preferences for using Medications on Va.gov.

## Research Questions

1. Can Veterans refill individual or multiple medications?
    1. Do Veterans understand the steps to refill medications?
    2. Do Veterans understand what to do when a medication is not refillable?
    3. Do Veterans understand if a refill submission is successful?
2. Can Veterans find information on their medications?
    1. Do Veterans understand the status of their medications?
    2. Can Veterans find information on how to renew medications?
    3. How do Veterans find a specific medication on their list?
    4. What information do Veterans seek?
3. Can Veterans print/download their medication list or an individual medication?
4. What medications-related tasks do Veterans wish to be able to do?

## Methodology

## We conducted moderated usability testing interviews in which we asked users to navigate the prototype, observed their behavior, and asked follow-up prompts.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will successfully refill individual and multiple medications.

TRUE: Most participants (11 of 12) successfully refilled an individual medication and multiple medications.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will respond positively to the updated refill flow.

TRUE: Most participants (11 of 12) responded positively.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will successfully print or download individual and multiple medications.

TRUE: Most participants (8 of 9) were able to successfully print/download an individual medication and all participants (9 of 9) were able to successfully print/download the medication list.

_Hypothesis 4:_ Most Veterans will find information on medications.

TRUE: Most participants (7 of 11) accessed the ‘Learn to renew’ link.

## Key Findings

1. The VoiceOver screen reader on iPad announced incorrect details that were not associated with the specific medication the focus was on.
2. All screen reader dependent participants (4 of 4) expected to find all medications on the ‘Refill prescriptions’ page. Most participants (3 of 4) did not understand that all medications could be found on the ‘Medications’ page.
3. Most participants (11 of 12) were able to refill individual medications and all participants (12 of 12) were able to refill multiple medications.
4. Most participants (10 of 12) were able to confirm the successful submission of their refill requests.
5. Most participants (7 of 11) accessed the ‘Learn to renew’ link on either the card on the medications list or within a medication’s detail screen.
6. Most participants (9 of 11) could differentiate among ‘Active,’ ‘Expired,’ and ‘Discontinued’ medications.
7. All participants (11 of 11) used scrolling (line x line or header x header with screen reader) and some participants (4 of 11) used the ‘sort’ feature when trying to find a specific medication on the list.
    1. Those who used ‘sort’ unprompted were all AT (Assistive Technology) users.
8. Few participants (3 of 11) recognized the default sort order of the medications list and participants were split on their sort preference among ‘Alphabetical by status,’ ‘Alphabetically by name,’ and ‘Last filled first.’
    1. Most participants (6 of 11) missed the ‘Sort’ button after selecting the sort option.
9. Most participants seek information on medication side effects (7 of 9) and dosage/instructions information (5 of 9).
10. All participants (9 of 9) were able to print/download the medication list and most participants (8 of 9) were able to print/download a single medication.
    1. Most participants (8 of 10) prefer to download individual medications or the full list over printing.
    2. Most participants (8 of 10) participants felt that the number of pages for individual medications and the full list was too long.
11. Most participants (8 of 10) reacted positively to the inclusion of ‘Allergies and reactions’ in individual medication and medication list reports, but only a third (4 of 12) could identify where to find that information in My HealtheVet.
12. The medications-related tasks the participants in this study are most interested in is refilling their medications.
    1. Finding information on their medications is a secondary focus.
13. All screen reader dependent participants (4 of 4) were confused by the H4 text “Image” followed by an actual image with the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) code hidden.

## Details of Findings

### **Finding 1: The VoiceOver screen reader on iPad announced incorrect details that were not associated with the specific medication the focus was on.**

The two participants who used VoiceOver on iPad experienced confusion when attempting to find information on a specific medication called Acitretin. The medication card showed that the medication is active with a refill in process and had no additional links besides the header. VoiceOver read, “Acitretin 25MG CAP. Discontinued. If you need more, send a message to your care team. Start a new message, link.”

### **Finding 2: All screen reader-dependent participants expected to find all medications on the ‘Refill prescriptions’ page. Most did not understand that all medications could be found on the ‘Medications’ page.**

4 of 4 participants who use screen readers did not understand that the ‘Refill prescriptions’ page was only meant for refilling available medications. They did notice the ‘Prescriptions you may need to renew’ section but made the assumption that those few medications in addition to those in the refill list comprised the entirety of the medications the test user was prescribed. One participant attempted to return to the ‘Refill prescriptions’ page from the ‘About medications’ page to find Tramadol despite the presence of the ‘Go to your medications list’ action link. Even the one participant with limited sight enough to use a mouse on a large monitor expected all medications to be listed below the refill section.

_“OK, so I have to go back to ‘Refill prescriptions.’” – Participant 09 (VoiceOver)_

_“\[The other medications\] would be right here, right below \[the refillable medications\].” – Participant 12 (JAWS)_

### **Finding 3: Most participants were able to refill individual and multiple medications.**

11 of 12 participants successfully refilled a single medication following the flow from the ‘About medications’ page and 12 of 12 participants successfully refilled multiple medications from the ‘Refill prescriptions’ page. Two screen reader users struggled with the task. One participant who was using an iPad was confused by VoiceOver reading the medication name, prescription number, last filled date, and refills left before announcing the checkbox. Another participant who was using JAWS on a desktop, unchecked the medication he had selected, but was unaware until he tried the ‘Request refill’ button.

11 of 12 participants responded positively to the refill process. Feedback included superlatives that referred to its simplicity and ease. Some compared it to MHV classic citing that the test experience is cleaner and less overwhelming. The one participant who did not respond positively was a screen reader user (JAWS) who experienced an error on the first refill.

The average time on task for refilling a single medication from the ‘About medications’ page for all participants (12 of 12) was 28 seconds with a median of 21 seconds. The 4 participants not dependent on AT completed the task in an average of 20 seconds compared to 34 seconds by the 8 AT users. Screen reader users took the longest with an average of 52 seconds to complete the task. The participant’s device did not seem to make a significant difference in the time on task.

_"That was pretty easy. I mean, it’s easier than the way the current VA website is.” - Participant 05_

_"A lot easier than the way it is set up now...I mean, this was like a two-step process.” - Participant 14_

### **Finding 4: Most participants were able to confirm the successful submission of their refill requests.**

10 of 12 participants were able to confirm the successful submission of their refill requests by referring to the ‘Refills requested’ banner at the top of the page. 2 of the 4 screen reader users missed the success banner initially despite focus being on it immediately after ‘Request refills’ was clicked. One screen reader-dependent participant (VoiceOver on iPad) considered the “two selected’ feedback from the screen reader to be the indicator of submission success. The other participant (JAWS on desktop) didn’t recognize ‘Requested refills’ as a success banner as it did not contain the word “success.” This participant was completely blind and unable to see the checkmark or green styling of the banner. One sighted participant who used no assistive technology, missed the success banner below the alert banner when his second refill threw an error. This error was only available to our sighted participants as it was a mock function of a Figma prototype.

_“It says at the top. I’ve got a green stripe and the check mark that says ‘Refills requested’.” – Participant 06 (Mag)_

_“Usually when I’m on a website and something’s been submitted… it tells you at the top of the screen… ‘submission successful’ or ‘successfully completed’.” – Participant 11 (JAWS)_

### **Finding 5: Most participants accessed the ‘Learn to renew’ link on either the card on the medications list or within a medication’s detail screen.**

7 of 11 participants accessed the ‘Learn to renew’ link on either the card on the medications list or within a medication’s detail screen. The content in the ‘How to renew prescriptions’ accordion on the ‘About medications’ page seemed more of a confirmation of what they already knew rather than new information.

### **Finding 6: Most participants could differentiate among ‘Active,’ ‘Expired,’ and ‘Discontinued’ medications.**

11 of 11 participants understood that ‘Active’ meant that it was a current medication the test user was taking and that they were refillable. This was observed throughout each session when the participants referred to “current” and “refillable” medications.

9 of 11 participants understood that ‘Expired’ medications could be renewed and that ‘Discontinued’ did not. Reasons for discontinuation included a change in medication and the VA no longer carrying the medication. One participant conflated the two statuses when discussing a discontinued medication.

_“Either it’s because there’s another med that is going to replace it or it’s no longer needed.” – Participant 03_

### **Finding 7: All participants used scrolling (line x line or header x header with screen reader) and some participants used the ‘sort’ feature when trying to find a specific medication on the list. Those who used ‘sort’ were all AT (Assistive Technology) users.**

11 of 11 participants used some form of scrolling when trying to find the medication, Tramadol, on the list. Two of the three screen reader users navigated line by line through the cards on the medications list while one navigated header by header.

4 of 11 participants, all of whom were AT users, employed the ‘sort’ feature when trying to find Tramadol. The AT-dependent participant sessions were conducted using staging which had more than 40 medications and thus required 3 pages since the maximum cards per page is 20. Conversely, the participants without vision impairment who used the Figma prototype only had one page of medications.

7 of 7 AT-dependent participants successfully found and used the pagination. However, 3 of the 4 screen-reader dependent participants spent between 26 seconds (navigating by headers) and 140 seconds (navigating by lines) navigating from the top of the page to the bottom of the 20-medication list to reach the pagination. These participants navigated using their keyboard. The other screen reader user had enough vision to navigate by mouse.

### **Finding 8: Few participants recognized the default sort order of the medications list and participants were split on their sort preference among ‘Alphabetical by status,’ ‘Alphabetically by name,’ and ‘Last filled first.’**

3 of 11 participants recognized the default sort order of the medications list without reading it on the page. 3 participants admitted to assuming it was sorted alphabetically by name, but more than 3 were observed using pagination to go to the third page while looking for Tramadol.

5 of 12 participants stated their preference for sorting alphabetically by name is because they do not know the status of their medications or that it is easier to find on the list. 5 of 12 participants preferred sorting alphabetically by status because it would be easy to see what needs to be refilled and to avoid choosing among multiple medications. 2 of 12 participants preferred the ‘Last filled first’ option so they could be informed of the status of refills in progress.

6 of 11 participants missed the ‘Sort’ button after selecting the sort option. Vision did not seem to play a role in who missed the button as 4 of the 6 were sighted. One screen reader dependent user did mention missing things because of his speed.

_“So maybe if it was, you know, blue or brighter or backfilled after you change that, then maybe you would indicate that you got to hit that button.” - Participant 02_

_“All my active ones, all my current prescriptions are at the top so I don’t have to sort through and figure it out ‘cause if they were just alphabetical without having the active, then it would just list everything.” - Participant 05_

### **Finding 9: Most participants seek information on medication side effects and dosage/instructions information.**

7 of 9 participants reported looking in the information inserts or online for information on side effects and adverse reactions to their medications. 5 of 9 participants mentioned seeking dosage and instructions for their medications and 2 of 9 participants cited interactions with food and other medications as the information they seek.

_“\[I am\] making sure that the dosage is right, what I’m supposed to take, and side effects.” – Participant 16_

Labels: Accessibility, SFTW: Screenreader, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired_,_ SPG: Cognitive Consideration

### **Finding 10: All participants were able to print/download the medication list and most participants were able to print/download a single medication.**

10 of 10 participants were able to print/download the medication list and 9 of 10 participants were able to print/download a single medication. Participants expected individual medication reports to include all the information currently in the detail page. Similarly, they expected the list report to include just the information included on the ‘Medications’ page.

The time on task for a participant to find the print/download button on the Medications page averaged 22 seconds in total for both AT and non-AT users. The average time for printing/downloading an individual medication was 16 seconds overall with non-AT users taking 4 times longer than non-AT users with 28 seconds compared to their 7 seconds.

8 of 10 participants prefer to download individual medications or the full list over printing. All participants who prefer downloading would choose PDF as the format. Reasons included familiarity with PDFs, the ability to email their list to a provider, and keeping a record on their computer. One participant stated that she currently copies her medication list into Microsoft Word so she can choose the information important to her and fit it on one page. Reasons for printing included taking a copy for travel, for adaptive sports, to share with a community care provider, and to keep a record in hard copy.

8 of 10 participants felt that the number of pages for individual medications and the full list was too long. Participants expressed surprise to learn that a 20-medication list would be 17 pages long. They made statements that included, “Wow,” “Oh boy,” and “Good God.” Some suggested that the entire list should fit on 2 to 4 pages with one setting the maximum at 10 to 15 for a list of 56 medications.

_"The first time I printed off My HealtheVet, it was like CVS-receipt long, which we all know it’s ,like, stupid long.” - Participant 06_

### **Finding 11: Most participants reacted positively to the inclusion of ‘Allergies and reactions’ in individual medication and medication list reports, but fewer than half could identify where to find that information in My HealtheVet.**

8 of 10 participants, including one with no allergies, responded favorably to the inclusion of allergy information at the end of a medications report. The 2 who did not want the information there acknowledged the importance of the information but didn’t find it necessary on their medication report.

4 of 12 participants correctly identified where in My HealtheVet information on an allergy to a medication can be found. 7 participants expected it to be within ‘Medications’ with some suggesting the information should be at the top of the list or detail pages.

4 participants assumed that if they do not see the information in My HealtheVet, then neither do their providers. For this reason, they felt it important to include allergy information for medications in both reports and in ‘Medications’ on My HealtheVet. (See Additional Finding 1).

_"I love this. I really like this because I’m on eleven different medications. So sometimes...one medication is contraindicated for another.” - Participant 11_

_"Towards the top, it should have your allergies or a link to it before you even start the medication list.” - Participant 12 (JAWS)_

### **Finding 12: The medications-related tasks the participants in this study are most interested in is refilling their medications.**

Refilling medications so they can receive them in a timely manner and avoiding interruption seemed to be the biggest concern of participants. Some expressed frustration with wading through a lengthy list of medications in My HealtheVet to find those that are ready to refill. This was a significant issue for those with low vision. Others mentioned the speed at which they receive medications because community care schedule 2 medications cannot be filled electronically, incorrect prescriptions, and the need for renewals. Three participants mentioned only having 3 refills on their long-term medications meaning they must contact their provider every three months.

Finding information on their medications is a secondary focus for participants. Many expressed the importance of understanding the instructions for their medications including dosage and schedule, in addition to side effects and interactions. (See Finding 9)

_“You have all that information right there \[on the test experience\] and \[I\] don’t have to sift through dozens of stuff.” – Participant 12 (JAWS)_

_“For a while there they were only putting like 3 refills and the quantity of 30. So, every month \[I would\] have to go in there and hit the button.” – Participant 02_

### **Finding 13: All screen reader-dependent participants were confused by the H4 text “Image” followed by an actual image with the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) code hidden.**

4 of 4 screen reader users (2 VoiceOver, 2 JAWS) became confused when navigating the medication detail page for Acitretin when the screen reader announced “Heading level 4, image” but there was no image.

_“Where’s the picture?” - Participant 11 (JAWS)_

## Additional Insights

### **Additional Finding 1: Most participants (5 of 13) seemed to equate the information they see in the My HealtheVet patient portal with what providers can access.**

This was observed when discussing the inclusion of ‘Allergies and reactions’ on any printed/downloaded medication reports as well as when participants were asked where they would expect to find an allergy to a medication. One participant raised it when providing feedback on the inclusion of expired and discontinued medications on the ‘Medications” page.

### **Additional Finding 2: Some participants (3 of 13) requested a search feature to help them find medications by name.**

2 of the 3 participants who made the request mentioned a feature that would allow them to just type in the first few letters and an autofill would pull up the medication they need.

### **Additional Finding 3: Most participants (6 of 8) reported reviewing the informational inserts that come with their medications and all participants (6 of 6) would prefer a digital option.**

The responses among the 6 participants who do view the inserts varied from once in a while, to first time only, to each time a medication comes. One of the two participants who stated they don’t review the inserts said that they don’t look at them because they are too lengthy. That participant, in addition to 5 other participants who were asked about a digital version available on MHV, was excited at the potential feature. Some participants cited their poor eyesight as a reason a digital option would be beneficial, while others mentioned saving trees. Two participants mentioned having the information categorized for easy access.

## Recommendations

- Correct the coding issue in which each card container does not have a unique ID.
  - _This will enable screen readers to announce the correct details associated with a specific medication on a Veterans list._
- Fix the issue in which “-select-“ can be a sort option.
  - _This will prevent a Veteran from accidentally making the selection and becoming confused._
- Strategize a way to make the ‘sort’ button more noticeable to screen reader users. Consider forcing the focus to the ‘sort’ button immediately after a selection is made.
  - _This will prevent screen reader-dependent Veterans from missing the sort button needed to activate the sort order they select._
- Hide the “Image” H4 from screen readers.
  - _This will remove any confusion for screen reader users who hear “image” announced and then their focus jumps to the medication description._
- Strategize a way to orient Veterans to the intent of the ‘Refill prescriptions’ page.
  - _This will help Veterans understand that the purpose for the page is for refilling available medications, not their comprehensive medications list._
- Place a ‘Go to medications list’ link at the top of the page and make it more visible.
  - _This will provide easy access to the ‘Medications’ list page and help remind Veterans that they are on the ‘Refill prescriptions’ page._
- Add pagination to the top of the ‘Medications’ list page.
  - _This will save screen reader-dependent Veterans from having to navigate the entire 20-medication list to utilize the pagination feature._

## Next Steps

_Socialize Research: Anne Costello Kennedy_

_Iterate on Designs: Lexi Wunder and team_

## Further research needed

_Retest sort usage with Veterans without sight impairment by providing an environment with more than 40 medications._

_Test in later phases with Veterans who have been using the new refill flow to see if they would still sort their medication list by status._
