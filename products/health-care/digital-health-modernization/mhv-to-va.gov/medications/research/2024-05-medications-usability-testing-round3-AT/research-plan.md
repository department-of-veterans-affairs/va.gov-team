# **Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medications, May 2024**

## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We conducted testing of the initial MVPs on both prototypes and live environments with a variety of Veterans including those who use assistive technology. This study is to evaluate the multi-fill feature with AT users in addition to other updates made since the last round of testing.

## **OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online.
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

## **Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## **Research Goals**

1. Understand if Veterans can locate and fill/refill their medications.
2. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience with managing their medications.
3. Understand Veterans’ expectations and preferences for using Medications on Va.gov.

## **Outcome**

The results of this study will help us determine if our designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to manage and view their medications. This will inform later iterations of the design.

## **Research questions**

1. Can Veterans refill individual or multiple medications?
    1. Do Veterans understand the steps to refill medications?
    2. Do Veterans understand what to do when a medication is not refillable?
    3. Do Veterans understand if a refill submission is successful?
2. Can Veterans find information on their medications?
    1. Do Veterans understand the status of their medications?
    2. Can Veterans find information on how to renew medications?
    3. How do Veterans find a specific medication on their list?
    4. What information do Veterans seek?
3. Can Veterans print/download their medication list or an individual medication?
4. What medications-related tasks do Veterans wish to be able to do?

## **Hypotheses**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will successfully refill individual and multiple medications.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will respond positively to the updated refill flow.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will successfully print or download individual and multiple medications.

_Hypothesis 4:_ Most Veterans will find information on medications.

## **Methodology**

We will conduct moderated usability testing interviews in which we will ask users to navigate the environment, observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

## **Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
