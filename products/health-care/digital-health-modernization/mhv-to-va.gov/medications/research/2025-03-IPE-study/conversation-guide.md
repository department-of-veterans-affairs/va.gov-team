# Conversation Guide: MHV on VA.gov, Medications, April 2025

&nbsp;

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you \[first name\]?

&nbsp;

My name is \[name\]. I'm a researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to assistive technology users as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- **This entire session should take up to 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a test environment.** This is a website with test data that may not be what you would expect to find in someone’s medical records. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual medical information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_\[If yes: \]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_\[If no:\]_  I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

_\[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves\]_

&nbsp;

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- _\[If yes: \]_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_\[Start recording.\]_

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- We like to share de-identified clips of these sessions with our teammates and stakeholders so they can see how screen reader users interact with our website. Do I have your permission, \[name\] to use clips from your session?

##Screen share/Remote share  - 2 minutes

&nbsp;

Have you ever shared your screen before?

Would you like assistance sharing your screen?

- _\[if no:\]_ Go ahead and share your screen for me now.

_\[follow protocol for particular OS (Android/iOS)\]_

## Participant Coaching

&nbsp;

Let’s pause right here on this screen.

As you can see, this is not your My HealtheVet account. If you look in the top right corner where your name would appear, it says Jamie. Jamie is our test user and it is their account we will be using today.

Today we are trying to learn how someone might use this product if they were on their own.  

&nbsp;Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can’t see your screen. Does that make sense?

If you are ready, we can begin.  

&nbsp;

## First Task: Medications

**_\[Medications list page\]_**

**RX-1 Albuterol**

- Jamie has asthma and has to use an inhaler every once in a while.
- They’re having a flare up and need to renew their expired Albuterol prescription.
  - A as in alpha, L as in lima, B as in bravo, U as in uniform
- How would Jamie find that expired medication on this list?

_\[Let P finish task with minimal interruption\]_

_\[if P is struggling\]_

- What are you looking for?
- What would you do next?

_\[After task completion\]_

- _\[If P dismissed the IPE\]_

## Second Task: Medical Records

**_\[Medical Records landing page\]_**

**MR-1: Download MR**

Jamie wants to download a copy of their past three months of labs. How would they do so from this page?

## AT Interview – 5 minutes

Our goal in these studies is to make sure we represent the point of view of all users. This is why we are committed to recruiting participants who rely on assistive technology so that we are designing an experience that meets their needs.  

We are collecting information on how our participants’ reliance on assistive technology may affect their ability to use My HealtheVet. Would you be willing to answer a couple of questions today?  

&nbsp;

\[if no\]  

That’s no problem.

&nbsp;

\[if yes\]  

- How long have you been using \[AT\]?
- How does using \[AT\] affect your use of websites?
