## Problem
- Today when Veterans refill prescriptions online they get no proactive guidance on where in the refill process a prescription is, how long it will take to get to their doorstep or if there is any delays.  This leads to veterans not getting their prescriptions on time or feeling frusturated by the unknowns.
- Although there are no "silent failures" here there are opporunitites to improve transparency to provide more trust and satisfaction in the VA medications tool.

## Supporting Veteran Painpoint
- There was a report that a patient had submitted a medication refill request to the pharmacy via myHealtheVet. When he had not received the medication, he checked MHV and saw that the prescription had been filled, and therefore thought it had already been sent to him. Refill prescription was transmitted to CMOP. It was not actually sent for several more days, but he did not know to contact the pharmacy to ask for his medications to be expedited because it appeared they had already been sent. It took ~5 more days for them to actually be sent, and he ran out of his medications as a result. He reports that the current language on MHV is unreliable for patients to track the status of their refills. Other patients have had similar complaints recently, and this is a patient safety issue as this particular veteran ran out of his medication.  This particular incidient was an abnormal delay in CMOP processing but the business would like to prioritize transparency into the refill process to support veterans in refilling on MHV.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Users understand the refill process and what happens after they submit a refill request online.
- Users can find out where their refill is in the process and what to do if they need it sooner.
- Users get alerted if their refill is taking longer than expected and what to do if they need it sooner.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Users have more confusion around the status on their prescription.
- Users don't understand the refill process or where their refill request is.
- 
## Desired Business Outcomes
- Less patient safety risks by providing improved transparency to the user so they can take a different action if they need a prescription sooner.
- Less pharmacy calls or secure messages to providers or pharmacy because of improved user transparency. 

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Increased pharmacy calls or in person visits.
- Increased patient safety risks or a decrease in user satisfaction.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Veterans will overlook this information or not comprehend the process due to its complexity.
  - 
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Veterans may think it is an interactive component.
   
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - We may not have visibility into the process for all types of refills ie. phone, provider issued, etc.
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - MHV legacy and VAHB won't have these updates and their may be user or internal confusion into the process.  
  - May need training and additional education for helpcenters and MHVC.

### What're you building
- Process list (similar to e-commerce platforms) to set user expectations around the steps from refill request to the prescription showing up at the door.
- Improved communication into the process on the refill page to provide clarity before a Veteran makes a request.
- Improved communication of what step of the process a refill is in on the prescription details page.
- Increased transparency on the list page when something is taking longer than expected and steps for a veteran to take if they need a prescription sooner.

#### Go-to-market 
- Communicate to MHV Coordinators.
- Plan to launch prior to March 15 deadline to improve user experience after Milestone 1.
