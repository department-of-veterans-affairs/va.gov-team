## Functional (How it works)
| Date | Decision Maker(s) | Description of Decision | Rationale |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
|3/8/24| Kaitlin, Tanner, Lexi, Tony, Vitalii, Gerard|All means of printing (Control P, File Print or the Print button) will produce the same printed document.  It will include all meds + extra details and the allergy list.|Users should get the same printed view independent of what means they use to print.|
|3/8/24|Kaitlin, Tanner, Lexi, Tony, Vitalii, Gerard| If the allergy API fails we will provide the user with an alert on the page giving them the option to cancel print or continue without allergies. If a user prints using Control P or File Print we will not be able to display this error. The printed page will have messaging around allergies not being shown due to an error and to check back later or contact your provider. If the medication API fails we will not allow the user to continue to print and will generate an error.| Allergies is critical information to a medication list.  A user needs to understand that their allergy information is missing before they continue with their print but we should not prevent them from being able to print what they already see.  If medications fail the printed page is no longer useful to the user so we should prevent them from continuing. |
