*Note: This section outlines a smaller feature that extends or enhances the overall product, building on what is described in our core [Secure Messaging on VA.gov Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secure-messaging/product). This is an adapted version of the [Initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md), pared down to match the smaller feature sizing.

## Feature outline: Remove SM tool landing page
Date created: August 2024

### Problem or opportunity statement
We want to improve the in-tool navigation by simplifying the tool IA hierarchy and making its structure is more obvious and traversable.

Currently, the tool has a landing page with FAQs which was useful for orienting closed and open-alpha adopters (i.e. Phases 0 and 1) + outlining early stage feedback via a unique email versus the feedback button; however, the tool is progressing past open-beta, and the landing page now causes extra steps for users to start reading their messages as well as complicating the information architecture.


### What we're building or changing
* We will remove the landing page so that when Veterans enter the tool either from the health apt landing page, a new message notification, or from the health apt secondary nav, they will be landed directly in their inbox which enables them to start critical flows ASAP.
* We are exploring how the FAQs might be moved to unauth pages or to other pages in the tool that are more timing and context appropriate.
* We are exploring refactoring the in-tool nav UI so that it's more obvious how to access all the pages in the tool, especially in a mobile context.

### Expected outcome
Veterans will more easily find and navigate in-tool pages to access the messages and conversations they want. We expect this to result in a reduction of Medallia feedback centered around not being able to find certain pages.


### Launch timeline
We hope to launch this during PI17 (October - December 2024)
