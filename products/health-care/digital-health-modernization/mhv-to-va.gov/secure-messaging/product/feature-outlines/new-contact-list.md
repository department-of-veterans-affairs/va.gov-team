*Note: This section outlines a smaller feature that extends or enhances the overall product, building on what is described in our core [Secure Messaging on VA.gov Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secure-messaging/product). This is an adapted version of the [Initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md), pared down to match the smaller feature sizing.

## Feature outline: New contact list to manage care teams on VA.gov
Date created: August 2024

### Problem or opportunity statement
Messages on My HealtheVet has a preference called "My Secure Messaging Contact List" which allows Veterans to toggle the visibility of a recipient/care team in their new message dropdown. This was added because some Veterans found their contact list to have too many teams listed which was unhelpful and made it harder to find the teams they wanted to message. Before the feature was added, coordinators would misuse the block association function to remove recipients from the dropdown. Currently, Messages on VA.gov does not have this functionality so Veterans must go back to the classic tool to utilize it which interrupts their experience on VA.gov.

### What we're building or changing
* A contact list page for Messages on VA.gov which will allow Veterans to toggle the visibility of specific recipients/care teams.
* Adding increased functionality for Veterans to toggle the visibility of an entire "system" which is useful in cases like "snowbirds" where certain groups are only useful at specific times. A "System" is an anchor VAMC + its associated clinics / health facilities.

### Expected outcome
* A new contact list page on VA.gov which will reduce the amount of Veterans going back to My HealtheVet from the "Start a new message" page.

### Launch timeline
We hope to launch this during PI16 in late September 2024 (9/17 - 10/1)
