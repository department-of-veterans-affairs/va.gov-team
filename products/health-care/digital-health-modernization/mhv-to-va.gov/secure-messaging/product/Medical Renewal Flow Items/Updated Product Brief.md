 ## Product Outline: Medical Renewal Flow Via SM (VA.Gov MVP)
  Updated- 10/21/25

##  Overview 

Today, an automatic renewal button on the medication portal is not  possible for online medications renewal. 

This is due to the the Medications API limitations of not having a direct established correlation between the meds provider and the SM provider in both systems. This correlation is necessary to send the renewal request to the provider through SM.

**User Goal**: Renew Medications Online for Vista (December 2025-MVP). Note: Post MVP will be Vista and OH Users.


## Problem/User Story
As a Veteran with an expired medication, I need to have a clear way to request an online renewal for **VA.gov only.**

### Use Case

**Use Case**: User has an expired prescription and opens up an secure message that is pre-filled to request a prescription renewal.

-We need a digital way to submit renewal requests for medications.

-We need the ability for users/vets to send a secure message to a doctor, requesting a refill.


### Requirement for RX  Renewal

Vista Users

**Active Refills**:  For Active Refills, the user is eligible for renewal if 1. The user has no refills remaining 2. The user have a refills in progress with no refills remaining  2. the user has submitted for an active refill with no refills remaining

**Expire Refills** For In-active or Expired Refills, the user is eligible for renewal if 1.The prescription expiration is less than 120 days expired 

## Outcome Summary 
 This renewal flow will apply to Vista Users & applicable Data **only.**

**Note**: As a fast follow or Post MVP Approach, SM team plans to include both Vista and OH Data.
A Medication status would trigger and lead to a renewal. Vista and OH have different statuses that medications hold (ex. inactive vs. discontinued).

### Implemenation

For VA.Gov- Web: 

We are implementing a Link to Secure Messaging "Start a new message" page that will contain pre-filled details based on the info for the given prescription from MHV Medications API (integrated with OH system for OH RX's)

Note: Implementation will not apply to the Mobile App for MVP
