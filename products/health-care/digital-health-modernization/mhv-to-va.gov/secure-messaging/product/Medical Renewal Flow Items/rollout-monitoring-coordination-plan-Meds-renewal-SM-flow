## Med Renewal → Secure Messaging Flow (Meds + SM) Rollout Monitoring Coordination Plan

This document supplements the existing **RX Renewal Flow – MVP Release Plan** and outlines shared monitoring responsibilities, UX and engineering roles, required pre-launch tasks, and post-launch coordination for the medication renewal workflow that routes Veterans from the Medications tool into Secure Messaging.

---

## 1. Overview of the Meds Renewal SM Flow

The new renewal flow guides Veterans through both Medications and Secure Messaging:

1. Veteran views their medication list in Medications  
2. Renewal-eligible medications display a link:  
   **“Send secure message to renew this medication”**  
3. Veteran clicks the link and is taken to the **SM interstitial**  
4. Veteran selects a **care team**  
5. Veteran sees a **prefilled renewal message** in the SM editor  
6. Veteran sends the message

Because the journey spans two products, **monitoring, URLs, documentation, and rollout responsibilities should be shared**.

## 2. Monitoring Responsibilities

### 2.1 UX Monitoring (Medallia + Qualitative)  
- **Meds UX**
- **SM UX**  

UX will monitor qualitative feedback and user-journey issues using Medallia/VSignals.

#### Meds 
Monitor the experience *before* a Veteran enters Secure Messaging:
- Renewal link visibility and accuracy  
- Confusion between renewal vs refill  
- Any difficulty starting the renewal flow  
- Transition issues into Secure Messaging  
- Veteran comments indicating unclear or missing renewal options  

#### SM   
Monitor the experience *after* the Veteran enters Secure Messaging:
- Interstitial behavior  
- Care team selection issues  
- Missing or incorrect prefilled content  
- Drop-offs inside SM  
- Message-send confusion or errors  
- Veteran feedback specific to SM  

#### UX escalation process  
If UX identifies issues:
1. Determine whether issue occurred in **Meds** or **SM**  
2. Flag to the appropriate engineering team  
3. Engineering validates in Datadog/logs  
4. PM + Eng Lead determine severity and rollout action

---

### 2.2 Engineering Monitoring (Datadog + Technical Logging)
- Meds Engineering  
- SM Engineering  

Engineering monitors backend and system health through Datadog and log analysis.

#### Meds Engineering responsibilities  
Monitor everything at the start of the journey:
- Renewal link rendering  
- Correct eligibility behavior (renewal vs refill)  
- Errors launching the SM flow  
- Incorrect routing into SM  

#### SM Engineering responsibilities  
Monitor the behavior inside SM:
- Interstitial load errors  
- Care team API failures  
- Prefill load issues  
- Draft creation issues  
- Message send errors  
- SM backend/API failures  

#### Engineering escalation  
1. Validate errors in logs  
2. Identify whether issue is in Meds or SM  
3. Follow severity-based rollback steps defined in the main Release Plan  
4. Coordinate with UX + PM to resolve

## 3. Pre-Launch Tasks

### 3.1 Collect URLs for VSignals / Medallia Configuration  
To enable Medallia feedback collection, UX requires all new URLs. *The updated Product Guide must be included in the VSP/Contact Center Team’s intake request when submitting the new URLs for VSignals.*

#### Needed from Meds Engineering:
- Renewal link destination URLs  
- Any new/updated Medications pages involved in the renewal flow  

#### Needed from SM Engineering:
- SM interstitial URL  
- Care team selection URL  
- Prefilled message URL  
- Any new SM endpoints introduced for the renewal flow  

**Once URLs are provided:**  
- [ ] Submit VSignals/Contact Center intake ticket  
- [ ] Request new URLs be added to Medallia routing  
- [ ] Confirm updates are completed  
- [ ] Validate feedback flow post-launch  

---

### 3.2 Product Guide Updates (Both Tools)

#### Medications Product Guide Updates  
- Description of new renewal link  
- Renewal vs refill eligibility logic  
- Screenshots and link placement  
- Expected Veteran journey from Meds → SM  
- Known limitations (e.g., no available care team)  
- Integration points with SM  

#### Secure Messaging Product Guide Updates  
- Overview of receiving medication renewal requests  
- Updates to SM interstitial behavior  
- Care team selection details  
- Prefill logic (included/excluded data)  
- Expected Veteran flow inside SM  
- Error states/known issues  
- Integration notes with Meds  

#### Shared Documentation  
Both guides should include:
- Outline of this cross-tool workflow  
- Shared monitoring responsibilities  
- Links to dashboards (GA4, Datadog, Medallia/VSignals)  
- Staged rollout details

## 5. Success Criteria  
(To be finalized with Engineering)

Examples of potential metrics (TBD)
- DataDog API TBD  
- DataDog RUM Metrics
- Medallia sentiment changes
