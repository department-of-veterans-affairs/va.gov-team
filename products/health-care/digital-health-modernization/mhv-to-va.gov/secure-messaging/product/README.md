## Overview
Secure Messaging on VA.gov will provide Veterans with the same ability to securely contact their VA health care providers as on MyHealtheVet (MHV) today The new application will employ modern technology and user-centered design to ensure that the tool is accessible, straightforward, and simple to use.  Moving this product out of MyHealtheVet and into the VA.gov landscape will also provide a more seamless and consistent experience than was possible on two distinct web sites.

## Problem Statement
In addition to the inefficiency and confusion of sending Veterans to multiple sites across the VA to manage their needs, Secure Messaging on VA.gov was researched and developed > 15 years ago and remains largely unchanged from UI, IA, accessibility, and technology perspectives.  When originally developed, it was purposefully designed not to be an email system, but recent usability studies show that most users expect it to behave like other email applications they are familiar with, such as Gmail and Outlook.  Furthermore, some of the rationale and decisions that drove the MHV secure messaging design may no longer be valid or timely today, and therefore should be re-examined and challenged where appropriate.  

## Opportunities
How might we leverage user-centered design strategies, modern tech, and VA.gov design system and components to create a more intutive, user-friendly, and performant secure messaging experience that exists today?

-Extensive research and user interviews (including stakeholder interviews) have been conducted to learn about Veteran pain points and expectations
-VA.gov Design Library standards have been applied to the designs to ensure consistent experiences across VA.gov
-Usability testing and modifications have been made (and are being made continuously to fine tune the experience
 
## User Outcomes
### Desired User Outcomes

- Users have a secure messaging application whose function is more consistent with their email-derived mental models
- Users are able to perform most, if not all, of the functions provided in a typical email application
- Users no longer need to move between two different web sites (VA.gov and MHV) to perform various health care-related tasks
- User confidence and satisfaction increase as a result of a more consistent, reliable, and performant application
- Users who utilize assistive technology such as screen readers are able to easily use secure messaging

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Users are confused as to why secure messaging is no longer part of MyHealtheVet
- Users have difficulty finding the new secure messaging application on VA.gov
- Users are not be able to perform some of the tasks they were able to perform with the MyHealtheVet secure messaging application
- Users do not have the same level of control over their data as they did in the MyHealtheVet secure messaging application
- Users have to log into VA.gov to use secure messaging after accessing it from MHV

## Business Outcomes
### Desired Business Outcomes

- Support receives fewer support requests related to secure messaging
- VA health care providers have an equal or better experience with the messages generated from the new tool
- The VA's reputation for its ability to understand users' needs improves
- The VA's reputation for its ability to leverage modern technology improves

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Support receives more support requests related to users' inability to locate or use the new tool
- The new tool does not perform as well as the old one, and users become frustrated and lose confidence in the VA
- Health care providers encounter difficulty with the messages generated from the new tool

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of Use                                                      | Service Completion      | Trust/Satisfaction | Health            |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| KPI      | VA.gov secure messaging traffic vs. MHV secure messaging traffic |                         |                    |                   |
| KPI      |                                                                  | Message completion rate |                    |                   |
| KPI      |                                                                  |                         | Medallia score     |                   |
| KPI      |                                                                  |                         |                    | Submission errors |

#### Baseline KPI Values
- MHV Secure Messaging Traffic just before go-live
- VA.gov completion rate after go-live
- Medallia score after go-live
- Number of submission errors

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

-Veterans will prefer interacting with one experience (VA.gov) rather than multiple


## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
  - We will build a tool on VA.gov that has functional parity with the tool on MHV.com.  We have decided to start there because we are replacing an existing tool
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
  - Adding additional functionality will increase an already-lengthy timeline for the overall MHV to VA.gov move.  Decreasing functionality would likely cause dissatisfaction among users.
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
  - Replacing the back-end secure messaging API will not be included in the MVP because the back-end does not need to move at this time.
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
  - Eventually we anticipate replacing the back-end API with the VA Notify API.

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*

- Initiative | [Link to Initiative Brief](#)
- Some possible future features have been identified as candidates to be built in the future.  These will be vetted with product owners and researched prior to prioritizing. Examples:
  -Previewing a downloaded file on screen prior to actually downloading
  -Improved handling of messages when folders are deleted
  -The ability to mass delete and move messages from various message list sections of the applications
  -Allowing an attachment to be saved to a draft message
  -Allowing 'Undo' actions in the application
  -Adding the number of unread messages in each folder to the side navigation panel

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*
- [Link to Release Plan -- TBD](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/release-plan-template.md)
  -This product will be released in the new Phase 0 to Phase 5 approach.  Phase 0 includes only invited users who have the link and can authenticate into messaging.  As additional phases are ready, proper communication and coordination will be completed.

## Launch Dates
- *Target Launch Date*
  - Q1 2023 with Phase 0
- *Actual Launch Date* 
  - tbd
- *What date will you evaluate impact after launch (and when do you expect to have your Impact Review)?*
  - tbd
