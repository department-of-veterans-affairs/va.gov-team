This initiative brief follows the [original Phase 1 brief (GitHub).](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secure-messaging/product/plain-language-TG-initiative/initiative-brief.md)

### Go-to-market 
> *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful? Which groups/orgs are necessary to make this happen?*
- **VISN 1 pilot**: Due to backend data limitations/constraints, starting with pilot for SM users in VISN 1 at the 3 healthcare systems (Boston, Connecticut, and Providence). Users with care teams in these systems have new improved experience on the front end on VA.gov and VAHB.
- **Outreach**: Conduct outreach with MHV Coordinators (staff) at these facilities. Ensure they understand expectations for creating and editing new triage groups using the new standard.
- **After VISN 1 pilot**: After the initial pilot, identify additional user-facing marketing and outreach activities as we scale.
