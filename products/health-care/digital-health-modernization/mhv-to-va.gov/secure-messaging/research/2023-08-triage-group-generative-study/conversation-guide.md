## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]?

My name is Anne. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know.

I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

This entire session should take about 60 minutes.  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

[If yes: ] Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

[If no:]  I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

[If yes:]  Thank you! We very much appreciate you talking with us today.

[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

[If yes: ] Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

[Start recording.]

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions**

- How often do you use My HealtheVet?
- How often do you use Secure Messaging?
  - Are those messages sent to the same providers all the time?
- Could you please tell me the reasons you have sent secure messages in the past?
  - Why did you use secure messaging instead of calling?
- What other activities do you do in My HealtheVet besides sending messages?
- Do you use any VA mobile apps to send messages to your care providers? Can you describe your experience?

## **Task 1: Interview**

I would like to talk to you about the last time you sent a secure message. Specifically, a new message rather than a reply.

_[Compose message screen]_

You were at this screen, and you clicked right here _[point mouse to 'To:' drop down]_ to choose a contact.

- Tell me about your contact list.
- About how many of your healthcare providers do you regularly contact on your list?
- What information did you use to select the correct contact?
- Was it someone you message frequently?

_[if yes:]_

- Have you ever sent a message to someone you hadn't messaged before?
- What information did you use to select the correct contact?
- How did you know you had the right one?

_[if no:]_

- How did you know you had the correct contact?

- Have you ever struggled with choosing the correct contact on your list?

_[if yes:]_

- Can you walk me through what you did to find the right person to send your message to?

## **Task 2: Contact Lists**

Next, I am going to show you two contact lists and ask you some questions about them.

Let's say you are helping a fellow Veteran message their primary care doctor whose name is Dr. Jones.

_[open first drop down]_

- Which of these would you choose?
- What made you choose that one?
- What could you do to ensure that you selected the correct one?

Let's say you were helping a fellow Veteran send a message to their therapist whose name can't remember.

_[open second drop-down]_

- Which of these would you choose?
- What made you choose that one?
- What could you do to ensure that you selected the correct one?

**Category**

When typing a message, which category do you choose?

Have you ever had a hard time knowing which one to pick?

**Learning SM**

Tell me about how you learned how to use Secure Messaging.

- What advice would you give a fellow Veteran who was going to start using Secure Messaging for the first time?

## **Task 3: Card Sort**

Our next activity is called a card sort. It's exactly what it sounds like; you will be sorting cards into categories.

_[pull up card sort]_

On the left we have a list of ways someone might identify their doctor or clinic with examples for each. On the right we have two categories: 'I know this' and 'I don't know this.'

_[demonstrate moving cards into and among categories]_

There are no right or wrong answers and it's perfectly okay to choose 'I don't know.' This is not a test of your memory or knowledge.

**Remote Mouse**

I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get set up, I will give you instructions on what to do. 

[when ready] I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen that says "start remote control of shared screen" and then you will be able to control my screen.

Ready?

## **Start activity**

Before we start, can I answer any questions?

While you sort the cards, if you could think aloud, that would be a big help.

You can begin whenever you are ready.

_[if the Participant seems to be struggling with the two categories]_

If these two categories are too black and white for you, you are welcome to create your own category like this. [demonstrate how to create a new category]

_[when Participant is done sorting]_

**I know this**

Let's talk about the cards in 'I know this'

- Can you share with me how you decided to put these items in this category and not the others?

Could you please sort the cards in the 'I know this' by how well you know them by placing those you know the best on top?

_[when Participant is done sorting]_

- Tell me how you use [first few items] to manage your health.
- How do you use the others?

**Participant as designer**

_[after activity - keep card sort open]_

Thank you for taking the time to explore this with me today. The last task I have for you is to pretend you are the designer and you have the power to make finding contacts in Secure Messaging easier for Veterans. 

 - What information would you choose to help Veterans find the healthcare provider they want to contact?
 - Would you use [info participant listed] for a new provider as well as one a Veteran messages all the time?




## **Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes**

Is there anything you would like to discuss about your Secure Messaging contact list that we haven't already covere

## **Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes**

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
