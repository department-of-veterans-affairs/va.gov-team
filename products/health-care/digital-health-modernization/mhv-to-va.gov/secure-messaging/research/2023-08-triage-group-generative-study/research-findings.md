## Research Goals

1. Understand Veterans' mental models and processes for choosing a triage group from their contact list in Secure Messaging.
2. Understand the identifiers Veterans associate with their healthcare providers.
3. Understand Veterans' experiences with Secure Messaging and how it shapes their interactions with it.

## Research Questions

1. What information do Veterans bring into a Secure Messaging interaction?
2. What types of information do Veterans look for when trying to figure out who to send a secure message to on their provider team(s)?
    1. What kind of information are they looking for to guide their behavior?
    2. What are their processes for deciding?
    3. How do they figure things out if they can't find what they're looking for?
3. What relevant past experiences have shaped Veterans' expectations when sending a message to their providers?
    1. How have Veterans had instructions for sending a message communicated to them in the past?
    2. What issues do Veterans have with understanding triage groups today? What has helped overcome these issues?
    3. How many locations/providers/triage groups are Veterans typically in contact within a given week/month?
    4. Are there particular scenarios that cause greater pain points for Veterans than others?

## Methodology

We conducted interviews in which we asked participants to discuss a recent occasion when they sent a secure message with a visual of the My HealtheVet compose message screen as a stimulus. We also conducted a moderated closed card sort activity.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypothesis 1:_ Many Veterans will not know the names of their providers.

  FALSE: In the card sort activity in which participants were asked to sort identifiers by how well they know them, all participants placed provider name in the "I know this" category.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will be familiar with the location and facility/clinic of their providers.

   LIKELY TRUE: In the card sort activity, 7 of 9 participants sorted the 3 location identifiers into the "I know this" category. One participant was not cooperative during the card sort and their results were excluded.

## Key Findings

1. Most participants prefer Secure Messaging over calling because of the complexity of the VA phone system.
2. Most participants reported regularly messaging one triage group.
3. Many participants mentioned that they do not have access to triage groups they expect to be in their list.
4. Many participants rely on the provider name to identify the correct triage group in their list.
5. Half the participants stated that they did not know what the abbreviations/acronyms/ symbols mean in the triage group names.
    1. Some participants stated that their triage group names have caused confusion because of acronyms, symbols, and abbreviations.
6. Many participants stated that if unsure of which triage group to choose, they would send messages to multiple contacts while some said they would call the VA.
    1. Many participants mentioned having sent messages to the wrong triage group in the past.
7. Most participants reported knowing the appointments, care type, provider name, and location associated with their healthcare providers during the card sort activity.
    1. All participants placed Appointment, Care Type, and Body part in the 'I know this' category.
    2. Most participants placed Clinic Name, Building, City, and Intersection in the 'I know this' category.
    3. Most participants placed Team name in the 'I know this' category.
    4. Most participants placed Nurse name, Neighborhood, and Sign on door in the 'I don't know this' category.
8. Most participants chose 'Care type,' 'Doctor name,' and 'Clinic name' to help Veterans choose their triage group.
    1. Most of the participants who chose 'Care type' mentioned it first or second in their list.
    2. Most of the participants who chose 'Doctor name' mentioned it first or second in their list while the remaining mentioned it last.
    3. Most of the participants who chose 'Clinic name' mentioned it first or second in their list.
9. No participants chose 'Appointment' to help Veterans choose a triage group, but most participants mentioned appointments throughout the sessions.

## Details of Findings

1. **Most participants prefer Secure Messaging over calling.**

**8 of 13 participants stated they use Secure Messaging because of the frustration caused by the complexity of the VA phone system**. Participants cited their inability to reach their desired provider from the main phone number provided by the VA. Complaints included navigating the system, frustration with operators, and time spent on hold.

_"I typically prefer communicating [with Secure Messaging] than playing phone tag."_

2. **Most participants reported regularly messaging one triage group.**

**9 of 12 participants contact the same provider** despite being associated with 3 to 15 triage groups. Among those, 6 stated their messaging is mostly with their primary care provider. Other participants stated the groups they message are based on circumstances. Two mentioned messaging their community care providers during the session.

3. **Many participants mentioned that they do not have access to triage groups they expect to be in their list.**

**5 of 12 participants stated they were unable to contact a specific provider because they did not appear in their contact list.** Some were looking to contact a specialist about a temporary or new medical issue. Others stated that contacts disappeared from their contact list.

_"I learned that other medical providers need to give you permission to email [them]. Not knowing that was a little challenging because of course you want to get the message to the right person instead of going through two or three layers."_

4. **Many participants rely on the provider name to identify the correct triage group in their list.**

**5 of 12 participants stated the provider name in the triage group name is how they identify the correct one.** Some mentioned that the triage group would be at the top of their list referring to the naming convention of adding two asterisks (\*\*) at the beginning of primary care provider groups. One participant uses the team name, another uses clinic name, and the remaining participants were not able to state how they identify the correct contact.

_"The name is in there. When I go into the system and click on that dropdown box, the name will come up."_

5. **Half the participants stated that they did not know what the abbreviations/acronyms/ symbols mean in the triage group names.**

**6 of 12 participants could not identify the meaning of the abbreviations/acronyms/symbols** in a task (Task 1 in image) in which they were asked to choose a triage group from a list with multiple instances of the same name. This was especially prevalent with the task (Task 2 image) in which no name was provided.

**4 of 12 participants stated that their triage group names have caused confusion because of acronyms, symbols, and abbreviations.** They said they had to be told which triage groups to use.

_"If it was simpler, I would use it more."_

6. **Many participants stated that if unsure of which triage group to choose, they would send messages to multiple contacts.**

**5 of 12 participants would send messages to two or more contacts in their list** requesting that the recipients forward the message to the correct provider if they were unsure which triage group to choose. Two participants stated they would specifically look for an admin triage group to message.

**5 of 12 participants mentioned having sent messages to the wrong triage group in the past.**

_"At one time I was sending secure messages to a different clinic than the one I intended to because at the time I didn't actually understand that the first letter was for the clinic and the city it was located in."_

7. **Most participants reported knowing the appointments, care type, provider name, and location associated with their healthcare providers during the card sort activity.**

**11 of 11 participants placed Appointment, Care Type, and Body part in the 'I know this' category.** Half of the participants sorted 'Appointment' and 'Care Type' in the top half of their list when asked to place those they know best near the top.

**9 of 11 participants placed Clinic Name, Building, City, and Intersection in the 'I know this' category.** All participants who knew Clinic name placed it in the top half of their list when asked to place those they know best near the top. Five of them placed it in the top 3. Seven of those who knew the building name, and 5 of those who knew city placed it in the top half.

**7 of 11 participants placed Team name in the 'I know this' category.** Only 3 sorted it into those they know best. However, during the task in which they were asked to choose a primary care triage group, 5 of 12 used the word 'team' to identify the correct one.

**7 of 11 participants placed 'Nurse name', 6 of 11 participants placed 'Neighborhood', and 'Sign on door' in the 'I don't know this' category**.

8. **Most participants chose 'Care type,' 'Doctor name,' and 'Clinic name' to help Veterans choose their triage group.**

**7 of 11 participants chose 'Care type' to help Veterans choose their triage group.** Four of those seven mentioned it first or second in their list.

_"I would definitely use 'Care type'."_

**7 of 11 participants chose 'Doctor name' to help Veterans choose their triage group.** Four of those seven mentioned it first or second in their list.

_"I would say the most important thing is probably, the physician. The doctor's name would be top priority."_

**7 of 11 participants chose 'Clinic name' to help Veterans choose their triage group.** Six of those seven mentioned it first or second in their list, and four of those also included other location identifiers in their list.

_"Identifying the location is essential."_

9. **No participants chose 'Appointment' to help Veterans choose a triage group, but most participants mentioned appointments throughout the sessions.**

**11 of 12 participants mentioned appointment at one point during the session and 11 of 11 participants placed 'Appointment' into the "I know this' category during the card sort, but 0 of 12 participants chose 'Appointment' to help Veterans choose a triage group.**

_"I get emails telling me I have an appointment. I get a letter in the mail. If I had those two things in hand, I'd know which doctor [the triage group] goes to."_

## Recommendation

- Include care type, provider name, location, and previous or upcoming appointment dates in Secure Messaging contact lists.

  _This will give Veterans multiple identifiers to ensure they have the correct contact when messaging a provider._
