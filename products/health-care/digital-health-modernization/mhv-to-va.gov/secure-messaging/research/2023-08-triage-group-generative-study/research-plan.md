# **Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Triage Group Naming generative research, August 2023**

## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. This study will explore the needs and expectations of Veterans when selecting triage groups in Secure Messaging. 

You can read more about our Digital Health Modernization strategy [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product).

## **OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online.
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

## **Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## **Research Goals**

1. Understand Veterans' mental models and processes for choosing a triage group from their contact list in Secure Messaging.
2. Understand the identifiers Veterans associate with their healthcare providers.
3. Understand Veterans' experiences with Secure Messaging and how it shapes their interactions with it.

## **Outcome**

The results of this study will help us identify Veterans' mental model and processes in choosing their triage groups This will inform future research and possible design solutions.

## **Research questions**

1. What information do Veterans bring into a Secure Messaging interaction?
2. What types of information do Veterans look for when trying to figure out who to send a secure message to on their provider team(s)?

    1. What kind of information are they looking for to guide their behavior?
    2. What are their processes for deciding?
    3. How do they figure things out if they can't find what they're looking for?
1. What relevant past experiences have shaped Veterans' expectations when sending a message to their providers?
    1. How have Veterans had instructions for sending a message communicated to them in the past?
    2. What issues do Veterans have with understanding triage groups today? What has helped overcome these issues?
    3. How many locations/providers/triage groups are Veterans typically in contact within a given week/month?
    4. Are there particular scenarios that cause greater pain points for Veterans than others?

## **Hypothesis**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Many Veterans will not know the names of their providers.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will be familiar with the location and facility/clinic of their providers.

## **Methodology**

We will conduct interviews in which we will ask participants to discuss a recent occasion when they sent a secure message with a visual of the My HealtheVet compose message screen as a stimulus. We will also conduct a moderated closed card sort activity.

## **Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
