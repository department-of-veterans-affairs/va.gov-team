# Questions for MHV Coordinators
March 2022

# Goals
- Validate early assumptions that informed our Proof of Concept designs for MHV on VA.gov, learnings will inform later iterations of designs
- Establish relationship with MHV coordinators for future conversations to inform future topics such as communication strategies, outreach messaging, and training materials for coordinators once  

# Methods
- Speak with MHV UCD team to understand baseline info, determine what past research already exists, and reduce duplicative research asks
- Informal conversation with MHV coordinators to learn what they assist Veterans with the most when it comes to MHV
- Future: Have MHV coordinators help us pilot the MVP of MHV on VA.gov, shadow them as they assist Veterans using the MVP to access MHV or signup for healthcare benefits on MHV

## Potential questions to ask MHV Coordinators
- Is there any data available on top tasks / issues that Veterans ask about? 
    Explore help desk tickets. Rich Beaudoin and John Tano, works directly with Theresa on that. 
- Where do Veterans run into trouble?
- Do you help Veterans with health care tasks that don't happen on My HealtheVet? (Examples: appointments, apply for health care, pay copay bills, get travel pay).
- Which tasks do Veterans ask for help with most often?
- Roughly what's the percentage of Veterans who are comfortable doing things online?
- For the Veterans you help, what's the breakdown of these? 
  - Veterans who already have a My HealtheVet account versus don't have one
  - Veterans who already have VA health care versus don't have VA health care 
- What is one thing Veterans want to do online that they can't do today? 
- What is the one thing Veterans don't realize they can do online? 
- For Veterans who send a secure message and select "Education: Request health education information," what are the top 3 things they ask about?
- (For Appointments staff:) What are the top 3 issues or problems that happen when Veterans schedule or request an appointment? 
  - How do you think those issues could be prevented? 
- (For staff answering secure messages:) What are the top 3 issues or problems that happen when Veterans send a message? 
  - How do you think those issues could be prevented? 
- (For Pharmacy staff:) What are the top 3 issues or problems that happen when Veterans try to refill or track a prescription? 
  - How do you think those issues could be prevented? 
- (For staff answering questions related to records:) What are the top 3 issues or problems that happen when Veterans ask for information related to their health record or to labs, test, images, and reports? 
  - How do you think those issues could be prevented? 

## Notes from conversation with MHV UCD team

- Where do Veterans run into trouble?
Navigation, and terminology. Terminology is probably biggest issue we see during user testing. Something we work on: keeping terms or designs (e.g. radio buttons on one page) consistent across pages. Too much content can be hard, alerts get skipped. Veterans get frustrated with too much info. Tasks often have high success rates but where we see trouble is in Veterans understanding the terminology, no understanding the terms is most common reason tasks fail. Medications lists = MHV has lots of self entered info, Veterans often don't understand it's for them but think it's for providers to enter. A few users will hover their cursor over instructions but won't read it. Can send over mocs on how Rx refill notifications will look to make those consistent with the VA notifications. 

Have talked with MHV C's about the admin portal, as well as help desk people. Talked more to them about their side of the system, versus what the Veteran sees. Sometime hard for MHV C's to find the right person's profile. Help desk has a two minute resolution limit, so they also struggle with not being able to find the right person when searching (Veterans might have accidentally created multiple accounts for instance). Coordinators are trying to match people via MPI to help them with upgrading their account from basic to basic matched to premium - which is how they can assess their healthcare info on MHV). Based on convos, probably mostly existing users versus signing up people who are new to MHV.
