# **Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Secure Messaging, September 2023**

**Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) is being moved to VA.gov. In November 2022, we developed and tested a prototype of what Secure Messaging in MHV on VA.gov could look like on desktop and on a mobile device. Updates were made based on user feedback. In this round of usability testing within a live environment, we will assess (1) whether the updates improve user experiences, and (2) test additional functionality that we were unable to test in round 2, and (3) include Veterans who require accessibility provisions.

**OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

**Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

**Research Goals**

The goals of this study are to:

- Identify major usability or content issues with the current state of secure messaging in MHV on VA.gov.
- Identify major usability issues with messaging, message threads, filtering messages, and draft components.
- Identify any barriers that may prevent veterans who use screen-readers and text-magnifiers from completing their secure messaging goals.

### **Research questions**

_Landing page:_

- Do Veterans notice FAQs and menu bar? What are their attitudes towards these?

_Sending a message:_

- Patient Safety
  - Do Veterans notice and understand the information about who to call in case of an emergency and how quickly to expect a response from their providers?
- Can Veterans originate secure messages to communicate with their providers?
- Do Veterans understand what it means to 'edit list' of their contacts.

_Message Threads:_

- What are Veterans' expectations about the message threads.
- Can Veterans access unread messages sent individually or within conversations?

_Replying to a message:_

- Can Veterans reply to secure messages to communicate with their providers?
- Do Veterans understand the additional reply and draft functionality?
- Do Veterans understand draft functionality and auto-save?

_Filtering messages:_

- Do Veterans understand that filter box function and how it works? How does this affect their behaviors?
- Do Veterans expect the filter function to search within message attachments and body of threads?

_Continuing a Draft:_

- Can Veterans locate their draft folder and successfully continue a message they'd. previously started?

**Hypothesis**

_Hypothesis 1_: Veterans will understand how to send messages to their healthcare providers.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Veterans will understand how to reply to messages from their healthcare providers and how to remove and attach documents to a message.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Veterans will understand message threads and its functionality.

_Hypothesis 4:_ Veterans will understand how to search for a specific message within a thread and use the filter feature.

_Hypothesis 5:_ Veterans will understand how to access drafted items, continue, and delete them.

## **Method**

We will conduct moderated usability testing interviews with 9 users, in which we will ask users to navigate the live website, while we observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

**Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
