# **Background**

In response to the evolving needs of Veterans, we've been working to improve the Secure Messaging feature in My HealtheVet (MHV) on VA.gov. Our mission is to provide Veterans with a more efficient, inclusive, and accessible platform for accessing health information and communicating securely with their
providers throughout their healthcare journey. This study included a diverse group of Veterans including those who use Assistive Technology and Veterans with Cognitive Disabilities.

# **Research Goals**

Veterans and their caregivers may need to communicate with their healthcare providers to manage their healthcare from the time they are first starting up in their journey through the end of their lives. This may be especially important for those who experience chronic or major illnesses. Veterans vary in their skills and comfort with technology use as well as their health literacy.

The purpose of this research was to:

1. Identify major usability or content issues with the current state of Secure Messaging in MHV on VA.gov.
2. Identify major usability issues with messaging, message threads, filtering messages, and draft components.
3. Identify any barriers that may prevent Veterans who use screen-readers and text-magnifiers from completing their secure messaging goals.

# **Research Questions**

_Landing page:_

- What are Veterans' attitudes towards the landing page?

_Sending a message:_

- Patient Safety

- Do Veterans notice and understand the information about who to call in case of an emergency and how quickly to expect a response from their providers?

- Can Veterans originate secure messages to communicate with their providers?
- Do Veterans understand what it means to 'edit list' of their contacts.

_Message Threads:_

- What are Veterans' expectations about the message threads.
- Can Veterans access unread messages sent individually or within conversations?

_Replying to a message:_

- Can Veterans reply to secure messages to communicate with their providers?
- Do Veterans understand the additional reply and draft functionality?
- Do Veterans understand draft functionality and auto-save?

_Filtering messages:_

- Do Veterans understand that filter box function and how it works? How does this affect their behaviors?
- Do Veterans expect the filter function to search within message attachments and body of threads?

_Continuing a Draft:_

- Can Veterans locate their draft folder and successfully continue a message they'd. previously started?

# **Methodology**

We conducted remote moderated usability testing interviews in which we asked users to navigate the live staging website. We observed their behavior, and asked follow-up prompts as needed. We asked participants to perform the following tasks on the prototype:

Task 1: Landing Page

1. Share any thoughts on the Landing page.

Task 2: Send a Message

1. Compose a message to a specific provider.
2. Delete a draft.
3. Send a message and confirm sent.

Task 3: Message Thread

1. Select a specific message thread.
2. Find a message with an attachment.
3. Identify read vs. unread.

Task 4: Replying to a Message

1. Reply to a message.
2. Attach and remove a document.
3. Save draft.

Task 5: Filter Messages

1. Find a specific message.
2. Use filter.

Task 6: Continue a Draft

1. Open previous message draft.
2. Delete draft.

# **Hypotheses and Conclusions**

1. Veterans will understand how to send messages to their healthcare providers.

    1. DEFINITELY TRUE: All participants successfully sent a message without assistance.
2. Veterans will understand how to reply to messages from their healthcare providers and how to remove and attach documents to a message.

    1. LIKELY TRUE: All participants successfully found the 'reply' button and completed the message. However, 2 blind participants struggled with the document attachment and removal.
3. Veterans will understand message threads and their functionality.

    1. LIKELY TRUE: Most participants successfully identified threads and the messages within them.
4. Veterans will understand how to search for a specific message within a thread and use the filter feature.

    1. LIKELY TRUE: Most participants were able to find a specific message within a thread by using the filter feature.
5. Veterans will understand how to access drafted items, continue, and delete them.

    1. DEFINITELY TRUE: All participants who attempted to continue a draft and then delete it were successful.

# **Details of Findings**

1. **Most participants expressed positive feedback about the Landing page.**

**14 of 17 participants responded positively to the Landing page.** Many cited the simplicity of it, calling it "straightforward" and easy to read. The other 3 participants were neutral in both their comments and observed behavior.

"_I'd say its straightforward."_

2. **All participants composed and sent a Secure Message to a specific provider.**

**17 of 17 participants initiated, composed, and sent a Secure Message to a specific provider.** The average time on task was 20 seconds with desktop users completing the task in 14 seconds compared to mobile users who completed the task in 18 seconds. Screen reader users averaged 41 seconds to complete the task.

**13 of 15 participants recognized that the message was sent successfully.** Those who did not notice the success banner above the H1 did state that they would go to the 'Sent' folder to see that the message was sent.

**6 of 11 participants correctly identified where sent messages could be found.** Among those who could not, they stated "in the saved file" or could not produce a response. All of these participants identified as having a cognitive disability.

_"...in saved file? It'll be in your messages I know that, but I'm not too sure."_

3. **Many participants did not recall the content on the patient safety interstitial.**

**7 of 15 participants were unable to accurately describe the purpose of the interstitial when asked immediately after having been on the screen.** All of these participants were sighted and followed the request to not return to the interstitial. There were three participants, excluded from this finding who immediately returned to the interstitial and read the contents when asked, so it is unknown how much, if any of the content they knew organically.

"_I don't know I honestly didn't read it I just continued to the message."_

"_I didn't pay attention to anything, nothing stood out, there was a bar in the middle and continue to start a message."_

**All of the screen reader users were able to accurately describe the purpose of the interstitial.** This is likely a function of having to read through the content to locate the 'Continue to start message' button rather than skim it as sighted participants could do.

**10 of 13 participants expressed either a positive or neutral attitude toward the interstitial.** 4 of 13 participants made favorable commentswith some focusing on the Veterans Crisis Line link. 6 of 13 participants were not observed to be positive or negative to the interstitial when reviewing the page or answering the follow up question. The 3 participants who responded negatively cited what they perceived as an excess of text on the interstitial.

"â€¦_we cannot go wrong hearing it as many times."_

"_I don't want to look at a wall of text."_

4. **Most participants understood the concept of a message thread.**

**13 of 17 participants understood the concept of a message thread and could identify the number of messages it contained.** Seven participants immediately identified that there were 5 messages in the thread while 6 initially stated they were unsure, but then saw the 5. Two of the three participants who could not identify the number of messages in the thread self-identified as having a cognitive disability.

**12 of 15 participants were able to distinguish between read and unread messages within a thread.** Two of the three participants who were unable to identify unread messages were screen magnifier users while the third self-identified as having a cognitive disability.

One participant who was using the Voiceover screen reader, assumed that there were 2 unread messages when there was only one because the screen reader stated, "unread message graphic, unread message."

"_These are 2 individual unread messages, correct?"_

**10 of 10 participants who were tasked with finding a message with an attachment within a thread were successful.** Some participants requested an alternative method for presenting messages with attachments to align more with their mental model of email.

"_Since we live off email, with email, when you go through a list of emails it tells us which have attachments, and which don't."_

5. **All participants successfully located the 'reply' button.**

6. **Most participants successfully attached and removed a document within a secure message.**

**14 of 16 participants successfully attached a file to a message and then removed it.** The two who were unsuccessful were screen reader users. They struggled with navigating the Windows and iOS dialog box to select a file because the cursor landed on the file name text box. One participant was able to attach a file, but he did not know that it had attached and attempted to attach it again.

"_It didn't upload it because of the file that I chose."_

**6 of 16 participants could not confirm that the document was successfully attached.** The file name appearing was not enough of an indication that the file was attached. Two of the participants who were uncertain self-identified as having a cognitive disability, and one was a screen reader user.

"_I cannot confirm whether or not it was attached successfully or if it's in the middle of uploading it."_

7. **Half the participants used the filter feature while the other half scrolled when asked to find a specific message.**

**7 of 14 participants immediately used the filter feature when asked to find a specific message.** There was no correlation between those who used the filter and any cognitive or visual impairment as compared to the **7 of 14 participants who scrolled first.** However, those who used the filter first had an average age of 49 while those who scrolled first had an average age of 54.

**6 of 14 participants expected to use multiple search terms** in the same way they would use more robust search engines like Google. 3 participants attempted the subject and date while 2 participants attempted the doctor and date. Date was an important search term to the participants.

**6 of 14 participants used the advanced filter feature.** This allowed them to add message category and date to their search.

Limitation: Because we were using the staging environment with a test user, the clinician account name 'COSTELLO, ANNE M' preceded all triage group names. This may have affected how participants approached finding a specific message.

8. **All participants who were asked to open a draft of a previous message were successful.**

9. **Most participants stated they would select the 'Save draft' button when asked about saving their message for later.**

**14 of 16 participants said they would select the 'Save draft' button during Task 1 when asked "How do you know the draft was saved?"**

**8 of 15 participants did not identify the 'Autosave' feature in Task 3.** Seven of those eight were the same participants who had previously stated they would use the 'Save draft'

**9 of 15 participants would still use the 'Save draft' button even after being informed of the autosave feature.** This includes one participant who had answered "autosave" to the question in Task 1 about how they would know their draft was saved.

# **Recommendations**

- Add a dismissible success banner above the file name in the attachments section of new messages/replies.
  - _This will provide Veterans with the type of visual cue they are accustomed to across MHV._
- Keep the 'Save draft' button and modify the autosave message to include 'saved to drafts.'
  - _The button gives Veterans who are unfamiliar with or untrusting of the autosave feature the confidence that their draft has been saved._
  - _By adding 'saved to drafts,' they will know in what folder to look if they return to continue the draft later._

## **A11Y Recommendations**

- Consider improving the accessibility of the 'categories' on the 'Send a Secure Message' page by implementing a labeling system that indicates them as "button 1 of 6" or a similar identifier for better navigation for Voiceover users.
- Consider keeping focus on success message until screen reader/voiceover has read it in its entirety to enhance accessibility.â€‹
- Consider investigating methods to provide screen-readers with a more distinct and effective means of detecting unread messages.

# **Next Steps**

- Socialize research to team, Health Apartment, and VA research community.
- Incorporate recommendations into final designs for development team.
- Work with sitewide content on content updates.
- Conduct additional research.

# **Further research needed**

- Patient Safety Interstitial
