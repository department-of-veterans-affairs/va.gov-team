# Research Goals

Veterans may need to access Secure Messaging on My HealtheVet (MHV) to ask questions of their providers regarding their health and treatment or to request prescription refills. This need exists in the Veteran Journey from starting up through aging. Secure Messaging users vary in technology skills and confidence.

The goals of this study are to:

- Identify major usability or content issues with the current prototype of Secure Messaging on VA.gov.
- Determine usability of components that have not been inducted into the VA.gov Design Library.
- Assess user experiences with updated content that aims to protect Veterans' safety.

# Research Questions

_Finding a message:_

1. Do Veterans understand that the Search function only searches within a particular folder (currently there is no option to search all folders at once)? How does this affect their behaviors?
2. Do Veterans expect the Search function to search within message attachments and threads? How does this affect their behaviors?

_Organizing messages:_

1. Do Veterans understand how to create folders? Rename or delete folders?
2. Do Veterans value the folder functionality?

_Replying to a message:_

1. How do users reply to a message in the updated prototype? Do users understand the additional reply functionality?
2. Do Veterans understand how to attach a file to a message?
3. Do Veterans understand that message drafts are automatically saved?

_Message Threads:_

1. Do Veterans understand that some messages are part of a multimessage conversation?
2. Do Veterans understand which messages have been read and which have not?

_Patient safety:_

1. Do Veterans notice and understand the alert about who to call in case of an emergency and how quickly to expect a response from their providers?

_Untested components:_

1. Do users understand how to use the following non-validated components:

  - Tertiary buttons
  - Toolbar
  - Attach and Remove buttons

# Methodology

We conducted hour-long moderated remote sessions via Zoom from November 1 – 21, 2022. Participants were asked to perform the following tasks on the prototype:

Task 1: Message Threads

1. Identify multimessage conversation
2. Identify read and unread messages in a conversation

Task 2: Replying to a Message

1. Reply to a message
2. Attach and remove a document
3. Delete a draft
4. Identify how a draft is saved

Task 3: Finding a Message

1. Find a specific message
2. Identify where message was found
3. Identify which message elements were searched

Task 4: Organizing a Message

1. Create a folder
2. Change a folder's name
3. Delete a folder

Task 5: Patient Safety

1. Identify important elements on the Compose Message screen

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. With the updated prototype, Veterans will understand how to find messages from their healthcare providers.

i. MAYBE TRUE - While all participants were able to find the message during the task, the limitations of the prototype may have removed any obstacles they may have encountered on a live site.

1. With the updated prototype, Veterans will understand how to reply to messages from their healthcare providers.

1. TRUE - All participants were able to find "reply" in less than 6 seconds. All participants were able to find "send" without assistance.

1. With the updated prototype, Veterans will understand how to add and remove attachments to messages when replying to their healthcare providers.

1. TRUE – All participants were able to attach and remove a document without assistance.

1. With the updated prototype, Veterans will understand how to create, edit, and delete folders from their healthcare providers.

    1. LIKELY TRUE -All but one participant were able to create a folder without assistance in under a minute. All participants, but one were able to edit and delete folders without assistance in under 30 seconds.
2. With the updated prototype, Veterans will understand that messages from their healthcare providers can be part of a multi-message conversation.

    1. TRUE - All participants understood the concept of multi-message conversations.
3. This will not be put at additional risk of adverse outcomes based on the updated patient safety content.

    1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION - In our test, we were reliant on the participant to vocalize what they were seeing. Many participants did not follow the instructions and had to be reminded to think aloud. As a result, there isn't conclusive evidence of what they actually saw. Alternatively, for those who didn't acknowledge the patient safety message, it is possible they did see the message, but did not consider it to be important.

# Key Findings

1. **Most participants (11 of 17) looked for a "Save Draft" button** when asked if they thought their draft would be available later.
  1. **Many participants (8 of 17) did not notice "Your message has been auto-saved"** under the "Send" and "Discard draft" buttons.
2. **Many participants (8 of 17) did not know which folder they searched in,** despite the folder name being under the "Search Results" header.
  1. **Some participants (3 of 17) requested a "Search all" option.**
3. **Many participants (8 of 17) expected the system to search in the body and/or attachments** of messages.
  1. **Many participants (6 of 17) had no idea** what parts of the message were searched.
4. **Further research is needed on the Patient Safety warnings** on the "Compose Message" and "Reply" screens. The data collection method in which participants were asked to identity which parts of the page are important is unreliable.
  1. **Some participants (3 of 17) missed the "call 911" notice.**
  2. **Some participants (5 of 17) missed the "call 988" notice,** while 5 of 15 stated that "crisis" referred to both physical and mental issues.
  3. **Many participants (8 of 17) missed the "urgent questions" notice,** while 4 of the 9 who did see it were dubious about successfully reaching someone via phone.
  4. **Some participants (6 of 17) missed the "3 business days" notice,** but 13 of 17 stated that they currently expect to receive responses within that timeframe.
5. **Most participants (9 of 17) used their mental model of email to understand the product** by directly referring to Secure Messaging as "email" or making indirect comparisons with email.
6. **All participants (17 of 17) understood that a conversation could contain multiple messages.**
7. **Most participants (16 of 17) could differentiate between read and unread messages** based on the font weight and dot icon next to the sender's name.
8. **All participants (17 of 17) successfully replied to a message and attached and removed a document; most participants (16 of 17) understood how to delete a draft.** Most participants (15 of 17) rated the difficulty of these tasks as "easy" or "very easy."
9. **Most participants (16 of 17) successfully created a folder, changed a folder name, and deleted a folder** without assistance. Most participants (15 of 17) rated the difficulty of these tasks as "easy" or "very easy."
10. **Additional testing is required to assess the usability of the search function** due to prototyping limitations that may have skewed the results of this study.

# Details of Findings

1. **Most participants looked for a "Save Draft" button.**

**11 of 17 participants looked for a "Save Draft" button when asked if they thought their draft would be available later.** The cursors of the participants using laptops/desktops were seen hovering near the "Discard Draft" button. Those on smartphones scrolled down near the same button. When asked where they expected to find a "Save Draft" button, participants indicated that area. Three of the participants who looked for the button also understood the auto-save function.

**Many participants (8 of 17) did not notice "Your message has been auto-saved" under the "Send" and "Discard Draft" buttons.** Two participants found the auto-save notice after prompting from the moderator but did not fully understand the function while another participant mentioned auto-save but did not see the notice. The two other participants who didn't acknowledge it hovered their cursors over the green box containing the auto-save notice.

Four participants did not trust that their draft would be saved based on the auto-save notice. Three participants stated they would copy their text to an external source for safekeeping to paste back into the message body later. Another, who seemed to be a tech savvy professional, stated his distrust was based on data loss he experienced in college.

_"I would look for something that says 'save draft' but that doesn't show up.  There's not a button here."_

_"Have another button.  Maybe 'save'."_

_"I'm not seeing that as an option. To save."_

1. **Many participants did not know which folder they searched in.**

**8 of 17 participants did not know which folder they searched in despite the folder name being under the "Search Results" header.** Three participants were confused when the moderator asked them about the folder searched and one did not know that folders were a feature. Three participants stated that they had not searched in a specific folder. One participant attempted to answer the question based on what they saw on the screen saying, "the first one…newest to oldest," which referred to the 'sort' dropdown feature. Another guessed "lab results" based on the context of the message preview.

**3 of 17 participants requested a "Search All" option.** There were no other common factors among these three participants.

"_I don't know. It doesn't say. I didn't know I had folders."_

1. **Many participants expected the system to search within message attachments and threads.**

**8 of 17 participants expected the system to search in the body and/or the attachments of messages.** Three of those eight participants had referred to Secure Messaging as 'email' or drew comparisons to email platforms in previous tasks, while two directly referenced email when explaining their expectations.

**6 of 17 participants had no idea**** which parts of the message were searched, even after the moderator pointed out the highlighted search terms in the subject lines of the messages.** Three of the six were confused by the question despite attempts at clarification. One participant commented that they thought the system would search their medical record.

1. **Further research is needed on the Patient Safety warnings.**

**The data collection method**  **in which**  **participants**  **were asked**  **to**  **identify which parts of**  **the**  **page were important**  **is unreliable****.**17 of 17 participants remained silent for at least 4 seconds after the "Compose Message" screen appeared. The median lag time among the participants was 9 seconds, with 8 of 17 participants waiting 10 seconds or more before speaking. It's unclear if what they articulated represented what they saw during this lag time. Without eye tracking software, we cannot be confident in the data we collected. Because the content in this notice was originally in response to patient safety risk, we suggest continuing this research effort further.

Even though the patient safety notice fills most of the screen on mobile devices, we didn't notice any significant patterns that indicate this made the alert more noticeable on mobile than on desktop. The only exception was the 988 and 3-day response content, which was noticed by all five participants on smartphones. In comparison, among those on desktop/laptop computers, the 988 message was noticed by 7 of 12 participants, and the 3-day response message was noticed by only 5 of 12 participants. Additional research into banner blindness or general selective attention behaviors may help uncover ways to make the alert more noticeable.

**3 of 17 participants missed the "call 911" notice completely.** Two of the three participants missed all patient safety warnings even after the moderator asked about the contents. All participants did understand that emergencies were to be dealt with by calling 911 or at an emergency room rather than via Secure Messaging.

**5 of 17 participants missed the "call 988" notice completely.** 5 of 15 participants who were asked the meaning of "crisis" stated that it involves both physical and mental issues. 4 of the 12 participants who did understand the intended connotation of "crisis" had not heard of 988.

"The very immediate need of medical assistance, whether it's physical or mental."

"A situation that's urgent.  It could be life threatening or a potentially dangerous situation, hazardous, where you have concerns about your mental or physical well-being."

"Needing medical attention pretty much as soon as possible."

**8 of 17 participants missed the "urgent questions" notice.** 4 of the 9 participants who did see it were dubious about successfully reaching someone via phone.

"Urgent? If anyone's ever tried to call the VA... Good luck with that, bud. You're not going to get your doctor on the phone any time soon."

"It's not really an option. You are going to be on hold ...forever and there's no way to talk to anyone besides the dispatch receptionist...when you call."

**6 of 17 participants missed the "3 business days" notice.** When asked what they would tell a fellow Veteran about when to expect a response to a secure message, 5 of those 6 participants said they would tell them fewer than three days.

"It's usually - from past experience - 24 - 48 hours."

"Typically, they respond within a day."

"To me, it's less than 24 hours."

1. **Most participants used their mental model of email to understand the product.**

**9 of 17 participants referred to Secure Messaging as email or made comparisons with how their email services function.** Six of the nine drew comparisons with their current email server when sharing their expectations of Secure Messaging's features and functionality. Three participants specifically referred to Secure Messages as emails.

_"This is ostensibly the same as most any email server inbox so, it's fairly intuitive."_

_"It looks like it's some type of email."_

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging, RESRCH: Usability

1. **All participants understood the concept of message threads.**

**17 of 17 participants understood that a conversation could contain multiple messages.** Various terminology was used including, "back-and-forth," "chain," "thread," and "conversation."

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Most participants could differentiate between read and unread messages.**

**16 of 17 participants could identify messages that were unread based on the font weight and dot icon next to the sender's name.** The remaining participant wasable to infer the difference between read and unread after 'reading' one message and noticing that the blue dot disappeared after closing it.

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging, RESRCH: Usability

1. **All participants successfully replied to a message, attached and detached a file, and most understood how to delete a draft.**

**17 of 17 participants successfully replied to a message, attached and removed a file, and 16 of 17 participants understood how to delete a draft.** The average time on task for replying to a message was 3 seconds, with a mean time of 2 seconds. For attaching a document, the average and median time on task were both 5 seconds. Removing a document was completed by all participants in under one second and the average time to select the "Discard draft" button was 1.7 seconds with a median of 0.5 seconds. Most participants (15 of 17) rated the difficulty these tasks as "easy" or "very easy."

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging, RESRCH: Usability

1. **Most participants were successful in managing folders.**

**16 of 17 participants successfully created a folder, changed a folder name, and deleted a folder without assistance.** The task of creating a folder included locating the "My folders" link in the left navigation bar on desktop, and within the secondary "In the messages section" navigation menu on mobile. The time on task for creating the folder and returning to the "My folders" screen took an average of 16.1 seconds with a median time of 10.5 seconds. Editing a folder took an average of 13.3 seconds with a median of 14 seconds. The time on task for deleting a folder was an average of 7.3 seconds with a median of 5.5 seconds.

15 of 17 participants valued the folder functionality for themselves or others, and one participant was unsure. Most participants (15 of 17) rated the difficulty of these tasks as "easy" or "very easy."

_"That's cool! I like that feature!  That's cool!"_

"_Oh, look at that…I didn't even know that was available!"_

1. **Additional testing is required to assess the usability of the search function.**

**15 of 17 participants were successful in finding the message described in the task without assistance, but it is unclear if this task would be as successful on a staging platform or the live site.** If a participant clicked on the search box, the prototype instantly populated the field with "test results," and the desired message appeared in the list of search results. Sketch's prototyping tools do not allow for text entry which would allow the participant to click into the field without it automatically presenting the results.

Further studies on the live site may uncover pain points and any obstacles in the message search process while providing accurate time on task.

**Additional Insights**

1. **All participants understood the non-validated components.**

**17 of 17 participants successfully used the secondary buttons for attaching a document, editing a folder, deleting a folder, and the tertiary button for removing a document.**

**7 of 17 participants used the "reply" button in the toolbar above the message,** as opposed to the larger reply button below the message **.** Three of those participants were using mobile devices.

1. **Some participants used breadcrumbs to navigate.**

**6 of 17 participants navigated to the Inbox and/or the My folders pages using breadcrumbs.** There doesn't appear to be any specific patterns about the participants, but it should be noted that 3 of 6 were 65 years of age or older, and 3 of 6 participants were using mobile devices.

1. **Some participants attempted to right-click to complete tasks.**

**5 of 17 participants attempted to use the context menu that conventionally appears with a right click at some point during the tasks.** This was most common in the folders task in which the participants were charged with deleting a folder. One participant attempted to use the swipe action on their iPhone to delete.

1. **Some participants referred to their Medical Records during the usability test.**

**5 of 17 participants mentioned their medical records during a task.** During the first task, in which they were asked to communicate their expectations upon opening a message, three participants cited the attachment of 'test results' would also be found in their medical records. During the finding a message task, two other participants assumed that the system would search for the key words in their medical records. One of those participants also stated that each secure message they send becomes part of their medical records, which is generally untrue, though it is possible.

1. **Two participants requested an "urgent" flag when sending Secure Messages.**

2 of 17 participants requested a category option of "urgent," similar to the "high importance" flag in Outlook, to receive a quicker response to their messages.

1. **Age was not a significant factor in the participants' ability to successfully perform the tasks.**

6 of 17 participants were 65 years of age or older. The task success rate among this group was on par with that of those 64 and younger. The only noticeable difference was the time on task recorded for the folder management tasks. It took the 65+ group an average of 17 seconds longer to create a folder, 7 seconds longer to edit a folder name, and 5.6 seconds longer to delete a folder. Conversely, these participants completed the delete draft task 1.4 seconds faster on average than the younger group.

# Recommendations

- Add a "Search folder" drop down next to the Keyword search field on folder landing pages. Include helper text, "(sender, subject line, or category)" above the search field. Place both elements in a gray box titled "Search messages."
  - _The dropdown will help users understand that the system only searches in individual folders, the helper text will indicate the limited fields searched, and the gray box with the title will make it easier to find._
- Include the results count, the search terms, and folder name just below the H1 on the "Search Results" screen. For example, " **8,675,309** results for **"[search terms]"** in **[folder name]."**
  - _The text will show the user what and where they search so they do not need to rely on memory. If the count is high, it could serve as an indication to narrow the results by using the advanced search feature._
- Replace the Advanced Search page function with a collapsible element below the search field.
  - _Creating a collapsible element keeps the user on the same page and will help simplify the IA._
- Add a "Save draft" button between "Send" and "Discard draft." Keep the timestamp with the green check mark. The green box would appear and highlight the timestamp only after the user clicks "Save draft."
  - _Adding the button will provide users the assurance that their work is being saved when the green box highlights the auto-save notice. By preserving the auto-save timestamp, more tech savvy users will be spared the additional step._
- Add a modal in relation to the patient safety notice that appears each time the user clicks "Compose," "Reply," or "Edit draft."
  - Change the current **i** icon to an exclamation mark, and the header to "Don't use messages for emergencies."
    - _The iconography signifies that this is a warning while the plain language directly addresses the purpose of the warning._
  - Highlight, "If you think your life or health are in danger."
    - _This will draw the attention of users even if their intent is to ignore the warning._
  - Change "If you're in crisis..." to, "If you're in suicidal crisis or emotional distress," Add "or chat at 988lifeline.org," after "call 988 then select 1."
    - _This language was taken directly from 988.gov and provides more clarity on the purpose of 988 as compared to 911._
  - Remove the "if you have an urgent question..." statement.
    - _The patient safety warning adequately addresses the use of Secure Messaging._
  - Include "Messages are to be used for non-urgent questions and concerns. When you send a message to your care team, it can take up to 3 days to get a response."
    - _By including the 3 days statement as part of the modal, it is more likely to be read. The addition of the first sentence reinforces that Secure Messaging is for non-urgent matters._
  - Include a button at the bottom of the modal to dismiss the message without an X in the top right.
    - _Placing the only close button on the bottom increases the chance that the messages will be read rather than closed out of habit._
- Change the color of the "When to get help" box to yellow and keep it collapsed.
  - _Yellow will stand out on the page and won't be as potentially triggering as red. Keeping the alert collapsed will free up screen space for the user who would have already seen and acknowledged the warning notice._
