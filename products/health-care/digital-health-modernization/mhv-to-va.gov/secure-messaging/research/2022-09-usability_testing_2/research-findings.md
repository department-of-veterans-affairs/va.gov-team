## Research Goals

### Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We developed and tested a prototype of what Secure Messaging in MHV on VA.gov could look like on desktop and on a mobile device in June and July, 2022 (see [this folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secure-messaging/research/SecureMessaging_Round1_Usability) for more information). Updates were made to the prototype based on user feedback. In this round 2 of usability testing, we will assess (1) whether the updates improved user experiences, and (2) test additional functionality that we were unable to test in round 1.

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

Veterans can manage their health services online
Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
Veteran Journey

### This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

* Starting up
* Taking care of myself
* Retiring
* Aging

### Research Goals
The goals of this study are to:

* Identify major usability or content issues with the current prototype of secure messaging in MHV on VA.gov
* Identify major usability issues with untested components
* Assess user experiences with updated content that aims to protect Veterans' safety


## Research Questions

*Finding a message:*

1.  Do Veterans understand that the Search function only searches within a particular folder? How does this affect their behaviors?
2.  Do Veterans expect the Search function to search within message attachments and threads? How does this affect their behaviors?

*Organizing messages:*

1.  Do Veterans understand how to create folders? Rename or delete folders?
2.  Do Veterans value the folder functionality?

*Replying to a message:*

1.  How do users reply to a message in the updated prototype? Do users understand the additional reply functionality?
2.  Do Veterans understand how to attach a file to a message?
3.  Do veterans understand that message drafts are automatically saved?

*Message Threads:*

1.  Do veterans understand that some messages are part of a multimessage conversation?
2.  Do veterans understand which messages have been read and which have not?

*Patient safety:*

1.  Do Veterans notice and understand the information about who to call in case of an emergency and how quickly to expect a response from their providers?

*Untested components:*

1.  Do users understand how to use the following non-validated components:
    -   Tertiary buttons
    -   Toolbar
    -   Attach and Remove buttons


## Methodology 


We will conduct moderated usability testing interviews with 9 users, in which we will ask users to navigate the prototype, observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
With the updated prototype, Veterans will understand:

-   How to find messages from their healthcare providers
-   How to reply to messages from their healthcare providers
-   How to add and remove attachments to messages from their healthcare providers
-   How to create, edit, and delete folders from their healthcare providers

    This will not be put at additional risk of adverse outcomes based on the updated patient safety content.

## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._
