# Research Plan for HMI team, Secure Messaging, October/November 2022

## Background

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We developed and tested a prototype of what Secure Messaging in MHV on VA.gov could look like on desktop and on a mobile device in June and July, 2022 (see [this folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secure-messaging/research/SecureMessaging_Round1_Usability) for more information). Updates were made to the prototype based on user feedback. In this round 2 of usability testing, we will assess (1) whether the updates improved user experiences, and (2) test additional functionality that we were unable to test in round 1.

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

-   Starting up
-   Taking care of myself
-   Retiring
-   Aging

## Research Goals

The goals of this study are to:

-   Identify major usability or content issues with the current prototype of secure messaging in MHV on VA.gov
-   Identify major usability issues with untested components
-   Assess user experiences with updated content that aims to protect Veterans' safety

### Research questions

*Finding a message:*

1.  Do Veterans understand that the Search function only searches within a particular folder? How does this affect their behaviors?
2.  Do Veterans expect the Search function to search within message attachments and threads? How does this affect their behaviors?

*Organizing messages:*

1.  Do Veterans understand how to create folders? Rename or delete folders?
2.  Do Veterans value the folder functionality?

*Replying to a message:*

1.  How do users reply to a message in the updated prototype? Do users understand the additional reply functionality?
2.  Do Veterans understand how to attach a file to a message?
3.  Do veterans understand that message drafts are automatically saved?

*Message Threads:*

1.  Do veterans understand that some messages are part of a multimessage conversation?
2.  Do veterans understand which messages have been read and which have not?

*Patient safety:*

1.  Do Veterans notice and understand the information about who to call in case of an emergency and how quickly to expect a response from their providers?

*Untested components:*

1.  Do users understand how to use the following non-validated components:
    -   Tertiary buttons
    -   Toolbar
    -   Attach and Remove buttons

### 

### Hypothesis

With the updated prototype, Veterans will understand:

-   How to find messages from their healthcare providers
-   How to reply to messages from their healthcare providers
-   How to add and remove attachments to messages from their healthcare providers
-   How to create, edit, and delete folders from their healthcare providers

    This will not be put at additional risk of adverse outcomes based on the updated patient safety content.

## Method

We will conduct moderated usability testing interviews with 9 users, in which we will ask users to navigate the prototype, observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

**Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.

## Recruitment

**Recruitment approach**

We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information (whether the Veteran has used MyHealtheVet before; whether the Veteran uses VA healthcare) in an encrypted Google Sheet that will be stored on the Ad Hoc Google Drive.

## Recruitment criteria

We will schedule a total of 24 Veterans for an expected completion rate of 18-20 usability tests.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

-   All must have been to a VA health care facility for a medical appointment in the last 12 months
-   At least 12 participants must regularly use Secure Messaging
-   At least 12 participants must not use MyHealtheVet
-   At least 12 participants who are mobile users
-   At least 12 participants who are desktop users

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

-   12 participants over the age of 55 years
-   12 participants with cognitive disabilities
-   6 participants who identify as women
-   4 participants from rural locations
-   4 participants without a college degree
-   4 participants of immigrant origin
-   4 Black participants
-   4 Latinx participants
-   3 Biracial participant
-   2 Asian participant
-   2 Native participant

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.
