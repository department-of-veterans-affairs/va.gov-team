# Research Goals

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Participants to access their health information. As part of this effort, MyHealtheVet (MHV) will be replatformed to VA.gov. We developed a prototype of what Secure Messaging on VA.gov could look like on mobile and desktop devices, which we are testing as part of this research. This study will build off of the results of our [MHV on VA.gov Round 1 Usability Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/initial-mhv-prototype/Round1_Usability/Final_report.md), conducted in April 2022 and our [MHV on VA.gov Round 2 Usability Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/initial-mhv-prototype/Round2_Usability/Final_Report.md), conducted in June 2022. 

The goals of this study are to:
- Identify major usability or content issues with the current Secure Messaging concept
- Understand how Veterans use Secure Messagin

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following objectives:
- Participants can manage their health services online
- Participants and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Participant Journey

This research fits into these points of a Participant's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging


# Research Questions

This research will help us answer:
- Based on the prototype, do Veterans understand not to use secure messaging for emergencies? What would they do in an emergency?
- How do Veterans find and organize their messages?
- Are Veterans able to compose and reply to messages?
- Do they understand who they are corresponding with?


# Methodology 

We conducted nineteen remote hour-long moderated usability studies using a high fidelity Sketch prototype. This round of research included both the mobile and desktop experiences. 


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

- Participants would not use secure messaging in case of an emergency. They would seek immediate medical attention instead.
	- *Definitely True*. Eighteen of the 19 participants said that they would call 911 or go to the emergency room in case of the emergency; 1 said that they would go to urgent care.
- How do Veterans find and organize their messages?
- Are Veterans able to compose and reply to messages?
- Do they understand who they are corresponding with?
	-  *Definitely True*. Participants expected to see their personal data populate if logged in.
- Participants will be able to accomplish a variety of health tasks as designed in this prototype.
	- *Mostly True*. Participants were able to complete the majority of our tasks successfully, but we did identify some areas for improvement with specific tasks and concepts. 
- Participants will be able to smoothly use the proposed navigation for MHV on a mobile device.
	-  *Mostly True*. Participants navigated successfully through the higher levels of the IA but struggled with navigating within specific pages.


# Key Findings

1. Participants would not use secure messaging in case of emergencies. 
2. Participants understood who sent them the message, who would respond, and how long it would take them to receive a reply. 
3. Participants prefer to view their messages in time/date order, from newest to oldest.
4. Participants could find past messages but rarely mentioned the “Expand All Messages” link.
5. Participants want confirmation that their messages have been sent.
6. Participants thought that the messaging experience was simple, which was desirable. 


# Details of Findings 

**1. Participants would not use secure messaging in case of emergencies.** 

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging,

In case of an emergency eighteen said that they would call 911 or go to the emergency room; 1 said that they would go to urgent care. None of the participants mentioned the local VA call center when asked how they would find the number of someone at the VA. Some things they did mention included looking on the VA website, My HealtheVet or on Google, calling the general number, 1-800 number, main line, main number, front desk or operator for their VA location.

**2. Participants understood who sent them the message, who would respond, and how long it would take them to receive a reply.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging,

Most were current, regular users.

> Quote. (P6, Veteran)


**3. Participants prefer to view their messages in time/date order, from newest to oldest.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging,

This matches the functionality currently in the prototype and in Secure Messaging. Other sorting options that participants mentioned included alphabetical by sender’s name (this was the other sorting option included in the prototype), alphabetical by subject and unread messages. 

> Quote. (P1, Veteran) 


**4. Participants could find past messages but rarely mentioned the “Expand All Messages” link.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging,

In the screenshot you can see two links. The users frequently commented on the first link “Older messagesin this conversation” but not on the second “Expand All Messages” link.

> Quote. (P15, Veteran)


**5. Participants want confirmation that their messages have been sent.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging,

Participants also mentioned that after sending a message they would like to go to the messages screen.  

> Quote. (P1, Veteran) 


**6. Participants thought that the messaging experience was simple, which was desirable.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging,

It was desirable because participants said that it was easy to use and easy to learn. They also understood that Secure Messaging would not be as fully featured as other messaging programs.

> I'm not a technical wizard so if it's intuitive to me, Mr Joe Average Senior Citizen, it should be workable by just about everyone. (P8, Veteran)


# Additional Insights

- Participants were confused about where to go in the prototype for messaging help.  Eight of the nineteen did not find the “Messages FAQ” in the menu. Six looked in the VA.gov header or footer, especially at the “Contact Us” link. If they opened the menu they were able to find Messages FAQs.
- The Delete folder functionality did not match participants’ assumptions. About half of the participants would delete their messages and none of those participants would expect their deleted messages to permanently remain in the Deleted folder.
- Participants did not know what the first screen that they came to was called. Instead of Messages they called it the “inbox or “home”.


# Recommendations

* It is unclear if participants’ understanding of the messaging system was based on their previous experience or on the information displayed in or communicated by the prototype. Test with non-users to make sure that participants can understand these things based on context and not their previous experience.
* Several participants requested the ability to forward their messages or copy other providers on their messages. Investigate the business and logistical implications of allowing secure messaging users to forward their messages.
* Participants gave mixed feedback on the “To” dropdown content and edit list functionality so this should be emphasized in future tests.
* Participants rarely mentioned the “in this section” component of search. This should be explored in future rounds of testing to make sure that users know what they are searching.
* Participants didn’t know what the “Messages” screen was called. Include a name for the Messages page in the next round of research in a way that doesn’t require double links in the navigation.
* The functionality of the Delete folder did not match participants’ assumptions. In the next round of testing consider how the design could better match expectations.
* Six of the 19 participants looked for messaging help in the VA.gov header or footer. Investigate how to distinguish between VA.gov content and page/secure messaging content.


# Next Steps

Our next steps are to bring these findings to our design team and iterate on our prototype. We will incorporate these recommendations into our next round of usability testing, which will be focused on messaging again.

## Who we talked to 

**Recruitment criteria**
Our primary criteria was participants who do and do not have VA Healthcare, and who do and do not use MHV on their smartphone. We used a lean but representative approach for most criteria, but overrepresented participants with cognitive disabilities. Our goal was to ensure our designs worked with the participants most likely to have a difficult time interacting with a complex website. Our previous round had included fewer women than we had hoped so we overrepresented women in this round.  We also included a significant number of smart phone users as they would be most likely to use the website on their smart phones once it is released.

We talked to **nineteen participants**.
