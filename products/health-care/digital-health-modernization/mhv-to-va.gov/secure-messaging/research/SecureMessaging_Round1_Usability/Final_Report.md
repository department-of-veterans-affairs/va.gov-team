# Research Goals

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Participants to access their health information. As part of this effort, MyHealtheVet (MHV) will be replatformed to VA.gov. We developed a prototype of what Secure Messaging on VA.gov could look like on mobile and desktop devices, which we are testing as part of this research. This study will build off of the results of our [MHV on VA.gov Round 1 Usability Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/initial-mhv-prototype/Round1_Usability/Final_report.md), conducted in April 2022 and our [MHV on VA.gov Round 2 Usability Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/initial-mhv-prototype/Round2_Usability/Final_Report.md), conducted in June 2022. 

The goals of this study are to:
- Identify major usability or content issues with the current Secure Messaging concept
- Understand how Veterans use Secure Messaging

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following objectives:
- Participants can manage their health services online
- Participants and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Participant Journey

This research fits into these points of a Participant's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging


# Research Questions

This research will help us answer:
- Based on the prototype, do Veterans understand not to use secure messaging for emergencies? What would they do in an emergency?
- How do Veterans find and organize their messages?
- Are Veterans able to compose and reply to messages?
- Do they understand who they are corresponding with?


# Methodology 

We conducted nineteen remote hour-long moderated usability studies using a high fidelity Sketch prototype. This round of research included both the mobile and desktop experiences. 


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

- Participants would not use secure messaging in case of an emergency. They would seek immediate medical attention instead.
	- *Definitely True*. Eighteen of the nineteen participants said that they would call 911 or go to the emergency room in case of the emergency; 1 said that they would go to urgent care.
- Participants find messages by scrolling through their past messages. Participants organize their messages using folders.
	-  *Mostly True*. Participants found messages in different ways which included scrolling as well as searching and sorting. If participants chose to organize their messages they did so using the folders but only a few currently organize their messages in secure messaging. 
- Participants are able to easily compose and reply to messages.
	- *Definitely True*. Participants were able to successfully send messages. 
- Participants who have previously used secure messaging will understand who they are corresponding with but non-secure messaging users may be confused.
	-  *Mostly True*. Nearly all of our participants had previously used secure messaging and did understand that they might send a message to their doctor and receive a response from that doctor, a nurse or another member of the care team; we did not have enough non-users to determine if they understood that different members of the care team may respond to messages.


# Key Findings

1. Participants would not use secure messaging in case of emergencies. 
2. Participants understood who sent them the message, who would respond, and how long it would take them to receive a reply. 
3. Participants prefer to view their messages in time/date order, from newest to oldest.
4. Participants could find past messages but rarely mentioned the “Expand All Messages” link.
5. Participants want confirmation that their messages have been sent.
6. Participants thought that the messaging experience was simple, which was desirable. 


# Details of Findings 

**1. Participants would not use secure messaging in case of emergencies.** 

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging

In case of an emergency eighteen said that they would call 911 or go to the emergency room; 1 said that they would go to urgent care. None of the participants mentioned the local VA call center when asked how they would find the number of someone at the VA. Some things they did mention included looking on the VA website, My HealtheVet or on Google, calling the general number, 1-800 number, main line, main number, front desk or operator for their VA location.


**2. Participants understood who sent them the message, who would respond, and how long it would take them to receive a reply.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging,

All of the participants understood who sent them the message.  4/5 of the participants understood that a member of their care team besides that doctor may respond to their message and at least 2/3 of participants stated that it could take up to 3 days to receive a reply. Most of the participants in this round were current, regular secure messaging users.

> I would expect that they are somewhere on my health care team, maybe my nurse, doctor, staff... . (P16, Veteran)


**3. Participants prefer to view their messages in time/date order, from newest to oldest.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging,

Viewing messages in time/date order matches the functionality currently in the prototype and in Secure Messaging. Other sorting options that participants mentioned included alphabetical by sender’s name (this was the other sorting option included in the prototype), alphabetical by subject, and unread messages. 


**4. Participants could find past messages but rarely mentioned the “Expand All Messages” link.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging,

There are 2 links related to past messages. The users frequently commented on the first link “Older messages in this conversation” but not on the second “Expand All Messages” link.

> I saw on the other page that there were x of 3 so I knew that there would be more . . . It's nice that they're right here. (P20, Veteran)


**5. Participants want confirmation that their messages have been sent.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging,

In addition to confirmation that their message had been sent, participants also mentioned that after sending a message they would like to auto-direct back to the messages screen.  


> Something would pop up and say "Your message was successfully sent". (P3, Veteran) 


**6. Participants thought that the messaging experience was simple, which was desirable.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, MHV: Secure Messaging,

The simple messaging experience was desirable because participants said that it was easy to use and easy to learn. They also understood that Secure Messaging would not be as fully featured as other messaging programs.

> I'm not a technical wizard so if it's intuitive to me, Mr Joe Average Senior Citizen, it should be workable by just about everyone. (P8, Veteran)


# Additional Insights

- Participants were confused about where to go in the prototype for messaging help.  Eight of the nineteen did not find the “Messages FAQ” in the menu. Six looked in the VA.gov header or footer, especially at the “Contact Us” link. If they opened the menu they were able to find Messages FAQs.
- The Delete folder functionality did not match participants’ assumptions. About half of the participants would delete their messages and none of those participants would expect their deleted messages to permanently remain in the Deleted folder.
- Participants did not know what the first screen that they came to was called. Instead of Messages they called it the “inbox or “home”.


# Recommendations

* It is unclear if participants’ understanding of the messaging system was based on their previous experience or on the information displayed in or communicated by the prototype. Test with non-users to make sure that participants can understand these things based on context and not their previous experience.
* Several participants requested the ability to forward their messages or copy other providers on their messages. Investigate the business and logistical implications of allowing secure messaging users to forward their messages.
* Participants gave mixed feedback on the “To” dropdown content and edit list functionality so this should be emphasized in future tests.
* Participants rarely mentioned the “in this section” component of search. This should be explored in future rounds of testing to make sure that users know what they are searching.
* Participants didn’t know what the “Messages” screen was called. Include a name for the Messages page in the next round of research in a way that doesn’t require double links in the navigation.
* The functionality of the Delete folder did not match participants’ assumptions. In the next round of testing consider how the design could better match expectations.
* Six of the nineteen participants looked for messaging help in the VA.gov header or footer. Investigate how to distinguish between VA.gov content and page/secure messaging content.


# Next Steps

Our next steps are to bring these findings to our design team and iterate on our prototype. We will incorporate these recommendations into our next round of usability testing, which will be focused on messaging again.
