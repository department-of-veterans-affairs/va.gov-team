# Research Plan for Secure Messaging team, June 2024

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. MHV provides Veterans with access to their medical records, including the ability to download said records. 

Discovery research was carried out in September, 2022 (see [this folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/research/2022-09-informational-interviews) for more information). This research has helped us to identify and prioritize gaps that we must address via primary research with Veterans to ensure that the Medical Records experience on the redesigned MHV will enable Veterans to complete their top tasks with minimal pain points.

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
The purpose of this research is to gain insight into user needs and goals related to medical records, users' emic understandings of medical records-related terms, and how these needs, goals, and understandings influence their behaviors. 

### Outcome
This research will inform the low fidelity prototype for the medical records redesign on VA.gov. 

### Research questions

1. What terms do Veterans and Caregivers use to describe: medical records, laboratory results, medical test results, medical imaging, radiology, pathology, service-related records from the Department of Defense, admissions & discharge summaries, pre-visit and after-visit summaries, and procedures? 

2. How do Veterans and Caregivers understand the existing medical records-related terminology on MHV and how does that understanding shape their behavior on the website (e.g., where they look for specific information)? 

3. What actions do Veterans and Caregivers need to take with their medical records and for what purposes? 


### Hypotheses
_Hypothesis 1:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will use different terms than those displayed via Blue Button reports for at least some of the medical records-related terms. 

_Hypthesis 2:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will not understand all of the medical records-related terms without support. 

_Hypothesis 3:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will not know what Blue Button, VA Health Summary, and Department of Defense medical records include, nor will know where to find specific information across the three options. 

_Hypothesis 4:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will want to be able to view and share their medical records, while others will want to identify key information to use for other purposes (e.g., to support a disability claim). 

## Method

### Interviews
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. These interviews will include questions about their needs and goals related to medical records, what they expect medical records should include, what terms they use and how they understand existing terms found in the legacy MHV. The interviews will also include a moderated card sorting activity. 


### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information (whether the Veteran has used MyHealtheVet before; whether the Veteran uses VA healthcare) in an encrypted Google Sheet that will be stored on the Ad Hoc Google Drive. 

## Recruitment criteria
We will schedule a total of 24 Veterans for an expected completion rate of 18-20 interviews. 

|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.
