# Research Plan for Secure Messaging team, July 2024

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) is being moved to VA.gov. MHV provides Veterans with the ability to securely message and access previous messages with their healthcare teams. 

A well known pain point for Veterans in the current secure messaging experience lies in the ways in which healthcare providers and teams are named (see previous [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secure-messaging/research/2022-11-triage-group-naming-discovery) and [feedback from MHV Coordinators](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/mhv-coordinator-feedback/quarterly-survey-results)). The Secure Messaging OCTO/OCC team created an updated experience to address this pain point; this experience will be vetted by MHV Coordinators and piloted in July/August. 

Prior to piloting the new experience, we want to confirm with Veterans that the updated experience outperforms the previous in relation to: 
- Task success
- Time to complete task
- Improved satisfaction
- Improve trust with VA digital health services

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
The purpose of this research is to compare the old and new care team selection flows within the secure messaging experience to assess the degree to which the new experience is easier, more efficient, and more intuitive to use for Veterans. 

### Outcome
This research will inform the updated care team selection flow in the secure messaging experience on VA.gov and VAHB. 

### Research questions

1. Which care team selection option enables Veterans to find the correct provider more quickly?
2. Which care team selection option do Veterans find to be more intuitive and less difficult to use?
3. Which care team selection option builds greater trust in the VA with Veterans?
4. Which care team selection option increases satisfactions amongst Veterans in the digital patient portal experience?  


### Hypotheses
_Hypothesis 1:_ A higher proportion of Veterans will select the incorrect care team in the old experience than either of the new experiences. 

_Hypothesis 2:_ The average time to complete tasks will be lower on either of the new experiences. 

_Hypothesis 3:_ A higher proportion of Veterans will find either of the new experiences to be more intuitive and satisfying than the old experience. 

_Hypothesis 4:_ The old experience will produce higher rates of distrust in VA digital services than either of the new experiences. 

_Hypothesis 5:_ The "location first" new experience option will produce lower times to complete task, higher accuracy rates, higher satisfaction scores, and more positive feedback. 

## Method

### Unmoderated study: First-click testing with post-test questions
This unmoderated study will consist of participants completing three tasks with different images of care group names. We will use Optimal Workshop's First-click Testing functionality to: 
- observe how often participants accurately identify a desired care group
- compare time to complete task across options
- assess participants' satisfaction and experience with the different care group options

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Optimal Workshop's Chalkmark: First-click testing tool.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information in an encrypted Excel sheet saved on the VA network Sharepoint drive. 

## Recruitment criteria
This study will consist of 9 cohorts of 9 Veterans per cohort. Recruitment will be ongoing until all cohorts are filled. 

Please exclude mobile users. Please exclude all assistive technology users as we cannot accommodate them in this study. 

Participants in each cohort should be from a different VISN, which include different states. No need to include a participant from each state; a cohort should consist of 9 Veterans from any of the states listed next to each cohort. Please draw from addresses on file to identify Veterans - no need to confirm in screening question. 

- Cohort 1: Massachussetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Maine, or Vermont
- Cohort 2: Georgia, Alabama, or South Carolina
- Cohort 3: South Dakota, Iowa, or Minnesota
- Cohort 4: New York
- Cohort 5: Florida
- Cohort 6: Oregon, Washington, Alaska or Idaho
- Cohort 7: Pennsylvania or Delaware
- Cohort 8: Kentucky or Tennessee
- Cohort 9: Colorado, Wyoming, Oklahoma or Utah

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.
