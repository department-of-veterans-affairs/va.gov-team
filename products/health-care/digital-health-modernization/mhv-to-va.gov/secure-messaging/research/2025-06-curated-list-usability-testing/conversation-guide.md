# Conversation Guide: MHV on VA.gov, Secure Messaging June 2025  

# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\] and \[NOTETAKER NAME\] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about making updates to health care information.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes**. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary**. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?  

- If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
- If yes: Admit observers.
- (If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
- Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  

- Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
- Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?  
    <br/>\[Record answer here\]  
    <br/>If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.  

- _\[Start Recording\]_
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  

- Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?  

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

Have you used Secure Messages on VA.gov?

- If yes: About how often do you use it?
- Have you ever started a message to one doctor and then changed your mind and sent it to a different one?
   - [If they don’t already mention it] What made you change your mind?
- If no, skip to next question.
  
  
Do you use VA Healthcare?
- If yes: What is the name of your Health System or Facility?
   - \[If it’s not clear\] What city is that in?
- If no, skip to screen sharing.

# **Screen share/Remote share - 5 minutes**

_\[If on Desktop/Laptop/Tablet:\]_ I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get set up, I will give you instructions on what to do.  _\[when ready\]_ I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen and then you will be able to control my screen. Ready?

_\[If on mobile: \]_ Have you shared your screen over Zoom with your phone?

_\[If yes: \]_ I dropped the link to the prototype in the chat. Go ahead and pull it up and when you are ready to share, please do so.

_\[If no, follow protocol for particular OS (Android/iOS)\]_

**Participant Coaching**

As you can see, this is not your My HealtheVet account. If you look in the top right corner where your name would appear, it says Jamie. Jamie is our test user, and it is their account we will be using today. Since this is a prototype and not a live website, not everything will be clickable, and it may not behave the way you might expect. Does that make sense?

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own.  

Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can’t see your screen. Does that make sense?

## First Task: RECENT CARE TEAMS - 5 minutes

\[INBOX\]

 Our test user Jamie wants to ask Dr. Owens a question about some recent lab results.

- I’m going to give you instructions for this task and then tell you when to start, okay?
- I would like you to talk me through how they would do that with this prototype as if we were talking on the phone and I couldn’t see your screen.
- I am going to stay quiet the whole time but will be happy to answer any questions when you are done.
- Are you ready?
- Please begin.

\[INTERSTITIAL\]

_\[Do not interrupt participant unless they get completely stuck\]_

\[RECENT CARE TEAMS\]

_\[If participants hesitate\]_

Jamie wants to send a message to Dr. Owens.

\[START MESSAGE\]

Let’s pause here.

How would you describe the experience of selecting Dr. Owens for this message compared how you would select a provider on your own account?

- What confused you, if anything?
- What did you find helpful, if anything?

\[If participant mentioned something specific on previous pages - ask for more information.]

\[Follow-up prompts\]

- What makes you say that?
- What would you change about that?

Jamie wants to ask Dr. Owens about a recent lab result. Can you walk me through selecting the category you would choose for this message? [Dropdown is static] Because this is a prototype, it's not clickable - so just tell me what you would do next.

\How would you describe the experience of selecting the category for this message compared how you would select a category on your own account?

- What confused you, if anything?

  \[To clear the combo box, the Participant needs to click in the text box\]

\[Let the participant struggle a bit before interfering\]

- \[If they start typing in the combo box\] Let’s pause for a moment. Because this is a prototype, it may not work as expected. If this were a live site, what would you type?
- Have you had experience with lookups like this before?
- Click on Dr. Owens to clear out the box.
- Go ahead and type w-a-l for me.
- \[If the participant skips the health care system\] Can you tell me why you chose to go to that selection box, first?


- Let’s pause here again.
- How would you describe the experience of selecting Dr. Wallace?
  - What confused you, if anything?
  - What did you find helpful, if anything?

Let’s look at the “Select your care team box. I noticed you used \[the dropdown/typed xyz\]

  - \[If they don’t notice "A different care team"\] Is there anything on this page that could help you?

\[SELECT CARE TEAM\]

\[They will not find the care team here. Let them struggle a little bit.\]

- \[If they pause\] Tell me what you are thinking right now.
- What would you do next?
- \[If they are not seeing the “Update your contact list” link\] Is there anything on this page that would help you?

- Before you select the care team – Last time you used \[scroll/type\]. This time, I would like you to use \[type/scroll\].

\[If the participant experienced an error already in the session\]

Thank you. We can stop here.

### Things to watch for

- Does the participant use the “I can’t find my care team” link?
- Does the participant understand the content on Can’t find your care team?


## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes

- Today we saw both care teams and care systems. Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?
  
- Tell me about your experience today?

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
    <br/>If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?  

## **Cognitive Disability Interview – <5 minutes**  

Thank you for taking the time to get through all those tasks with me today and answering all our questions. It has been super helpful.

Our goal in these studies is to make sure we represent the point of view of all Veterans. This is why we are committed to recruiting participants with cognitive disabilities so that we are designing an experience that meets their needs.

In your screener, you answered yes when asked about a cognitive disability.  

- Could you confirm if this is correct information?

_\[if no\]_

We will be sure to make that correction. Thank you.

_\[if yes, continue\]_

We are collecting information on how Veterans’ cognitive disabilities may affect their ability to use My HealtheVet. Would you be willing to answer a couple of questions today?

_\[if no\]_

That’s no problem.

_\[if yes\]_

- Would you mind sharing a little about how your cognitive disability affects your use of My HealtheVet or other websites?
- Can you share an example of a time when you struggled with My HealtheVet because of your disability?

## Thank-You and Closing - <1 minute

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.
