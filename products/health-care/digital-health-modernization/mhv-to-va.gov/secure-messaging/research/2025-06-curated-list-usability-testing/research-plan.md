# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Secure Messages, June 2025 

## Background 🏗️
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) is being moved to VA.gov. 

MHV provides Veterans with the ability to securely message and access previous messages with their healthcare teams.

Secure Messaging requires a Veteran to be authenticated.
  
Many Veterans are familiar with this tool as it was launched in November of 2023. With the passing of Milestones 1 and 2, there is an influx of Veterans using this product for the first time.

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.


`Objective 1:  VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

**Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.

## Research Goals 🥅	

### Goals

`1.` **Assess Veterans’ ability to find and select the correct care team for messaging.**

`2.` **Evaluate how Veterans understand and interact with contact list features.**

`3.` **Understand how Veterans respond when they can’t find the contact they need.** 
  
### Outcome

**The results of this study will help us determine if our designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to compose secure messages and help to identify any pain points. The findings will inform future iterations of designs.** 

---

### Research questions

**`1.`Can Veterans successfully use the new curated list flow to message their intended care team?**

**`2.`Do Veterans notice the contact list link and successfully use the contact list page to select the appropriate care teams for messaging?**

**`3.`Can Veterans effectively use the combo box to find and select the appropriate care team?**

**`4.`Do Veterans notice, understand, and appropriately use the ‘If you can’t find your care team’ content and related links?**

**`5.`When Veterans don’t see their intended recipient in the recent list, can they successfully identify and select the correct contact?**



### Hypotheses

 
**Hypothesis 1:
Most Veterans will be able to use the new curated list flow to identify and message the appropriate care team without confusion.** 

 
**Hypothesis 2:
Many Veterans will recognize the combo box as a searchable input field and expect to use it like a search engine.** 

**Hypothesis 3:
Most Veterans will not notice the “If you can’t find your care team” link.** 

**Hypothesis 4:
When Veterans don’t see their desired recipient in the recent contacts list, most will correctly use the “Select a different recipient” option to proceed.**

**Hypothesis 5:
Most Veterans will not notice the contact list link.**


  
## Methodology  🛠️

We will be conducting moderated usability testing sessions in which we will ask users to navigate a prototype while we observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.
