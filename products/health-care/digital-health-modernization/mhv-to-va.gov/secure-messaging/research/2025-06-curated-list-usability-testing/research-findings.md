## Research Goals

- Assess Veterans’ ability to find and select the correct care team for messaging.
- Evaluate how Veterans understand and interact with contact list features.
- Understand how Veterans respond when they can’t find the contact they need.

## Research Questions

- Can Veterans successfully use the new curated list flow to message their intended care team?
- Do Veterans notice the contact list link and successfully use the contact list page to select the appropriate care teams for messaging?
- Can Veterans effectively use the combo box to find and select the appropriate care team?
- Do Veterans notice, understand, and appropriately use the ‘If you can’t find your care team’ content and related links?
- When Veterans don’t see their intended recipient in the recent list, can they successfully identify and select the correct contact?

## Methodology

We conducted remote moderated usability testing sessions in which we asked users to navigate a prototype while we observed their behavior, and asked follow-up prompts.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **Hypothesis 1: Most Veterans will be able to use the new curated list flow to identify and message the appropriate care team without confusion.**
- _TRUE: All participants successfully identified and continued to message the test care team without assistance._
- **Hypothesis 2: Many Veterans will recognize the combo box as a searchable input field and expect to use it like a search engine.**
- _FALSE: Only 2 participants noticed the input function and those two used it as expected._
- **Hypothesis 3: Most Veterans will not notice the “if you can’t find your care team link.”**
- _FALSE: Most participants (6 of 9) selected the link between tasks 3 and 4._
- **Hypothesis 4: When Veterans don’t see their desired recipient in the contact list, most will correctly select “A different care team” option to proceed.**
- _TRUE: All participants selected this option as needed for tasks 2, 3, and 4._
- **Most Veterans will not notice the contacts list link.**
- _MOSTLY TRUE: Most participants (5 of 9) selected the “If you can’t find your care team” link when Dr. McDaniels did not appear in their contact list._

## Key Findings

1. **All participants (8 of 8) successfully found the intended care team on the Recent Care Teams list.**
2. **All participants (9 of 9) successfully identified and selected a contact that was not in the Recent Care Team list.**
3. **All participants (9 of 9) successfully selected Dr. Wallace and Dr. McDaniels using the combo box.**
4. **Most participants (7 of 9) used the dropdown to select the care team in both tasks involving the combo box.**
5. **Few participants (2 of 9) identified the additional function of the combo box after employing type or dropdown.**
6. **Most participants (5 of 9) selected “What to do if you can’t find your care team” when Dr. McDaniels did not appear in the combo box.**
7. **All participants (8 of 8) successfully updated the contact list to include Dr. McDaniels.**
8. **Most participants (5 of 7) identified the checkbox when asked how they know their update was successful.**
9. **Most participants (8 of 9) found the Can’t Find Your Care Team page when unable to find Dr. Diamond.**
10. **All participants (8 of 8) would contact their primary care provider, MHV coordinator, or VA facility if they needed a care team added to their contact list.**

## Details of Findings

### **Finding 1:** **All participants successfully found the intended care team on the Recent Care Teams list.**

8 of 8 participants found Dr. Owens on the Recent Care Teams list without assistance. Time on task ranged from 14 seconds to 182 seconds with an average of 68 seconds overall. All participants commented on the ease of the task when asked to describe their experience compared to the current design.

_“That’s relatively easy. It’s all point and click.” – P08_

### **Finding 2:** **All participants successfully identified and selected a contact that was not in the Recent Care Team list.**

9 of 9 participants identified and selected Dr. Wallace in task 2 and Dr. McDaniels in task 3 with ease. Time on task for finding Dr. Wallace ranged from 30 to 96 seconds with an overall average of 72 seconds. Time on task was not collected on Task 3 because of the additional complexity of updating the contact list. When participants were asked post-task 2 if there were anything confusing about selecting Dr. Wallace, they all stated that it was simple or easy.

_“It wasn’t too difficult.” – P09_

### **Finding 3:** **All participants successfully selected Dr. Wallace and Dr. McDaniels using the combo box.**

9 of 9 participants understood the purpose of the combo box and selected the correct care team with ease. All participants cited the simplicity of the process when asked for feedback.

_“Once I started reading it, you know, it was very clear.” – P02_

### **Finding 4: Most participants used the dropdown to select the care team in both tasks involving the combo box.**

7 of 9 participants selected the care team in tasks 2 and 3 with the dropdown functionality of the combo box rather than typing in the name.

### **Finding 5: Few participants identified the additional function of the combo box after employing type or dropdown.**

2 of 9 participants immediately noted that the combo box also offers a type function when asked after task 2. Both participants had used the dropdown function to select Dr. Wallace. The 2 participants who used the type function did not indicate that they noticed the dropdown feature despite the down arrow on the right side of the text field.

_“Literally just reading that you can start typing it.” – P09_

### **Finding 6: Most participants selected “What to do if you can’t find your care team” when Dr. McDaniels did not appear in the combo box.**

5 of 9 participants selected “What to do if you can’t find your care team” when they were unable to locate Dr. McDaniels in the combo box rather than the expected “Update your contact list link.” This could be attributed to the position of the links. The “What to do…” link is directly below the combo box with a line of text separating it from the “Update…” link.

### **Finding 7:** **All participants successfully updated the contact list to include Dr. McDaniels.**

8 of 8 participants successfully added Dr. McDaniels to their contact list, saved, and selected the care team from the combo box. The 5 participants who selected the “What to do if you can’t find your care team” link initially were able to easily access the contact list from the link on the Can’t Find Your Care Team page. When asked to describe the experience, most participants cited the ease of updating the contact list. One participant, who had chosen the “What to do…” link stated it was challenging because they had to do a lot of reading to get to the contact list.

_“It was pretty easy. It’s straightforward.” – P07_

### **Finding 8: Most participants identified the checkbox when asked how they know their update was successful.**

4 of 7 participants referred to the filled checkbox next to Dr. McDaniels on the contact list when asked how they knew the list had been updated. The other three participants cited the success banner at the top of the page.

_“I would assume that with the box check next to their name, that that would mean it, but I would confirm by going back to that message and seeing if they were an option.” – P10_

### **Finding 9: Most participants found the Can’t Find Your Care Team page when unable to find Dr. Diamond.**

8 of 9 participants successfully located the Can’t Find Your Care Team page when unable to find Dr. Diamond in the combo box or on the Contact List page. Four participants initially selected the “Update your contact list” link to see if Dr. Diamond was available to add like Dr. McDaniels had been in the previous task. 3 of those 4 were able to find the “What to do if you can’t find your care team” link on the Select Care Team page.

### **Finding 10: All participants would contact their primary care provider, MHV coordinator, or VA facility if they needed a care team added to their contact list.**

4 of 8 participants stated they would contact their primary care provider either via secure message or phone if they needed a care team added to their contact list. The other 4 participants said they would contact their MHV coordinator or their VA facility to have a care team added.

_“I’d probably… go back and write my primary and ask them if they have a phone record or can refer me.” – P06_

## Additional Insights

### **Additional Finding 1: Most participants (6 of 9) used the “Select a different care team” link to change the care team for task 2.**

This may be attributed to the participants having the category dropdown open which drew attention to the link.

## Recommendations

1. Explore ways to help Veterans distinguish the purpose of the “What to do if you can’t find your care team” and “Update your contact list.” Consider having the “What to do…” link take Veterans to the Contact List with an additional CTA to continue to Can’t Find Your Care Team.
2. This will allow Veterans to check their available contacts before having to read the Can’t Find Your Care Team content.
3. This is especially important for Veterans with cognitive disabilities and/or PTSD who can become overwhelmed by too much text/information.
4. Conduct Assistive Technology (AT) testing on the curated list flow, combo box, and update contact list features.
5. It is imperative that these features are tested by Veterans who are dependent upon screen readers, magnification (400%+), and voice command to ensure their usability.

## Further research needed

AT testing needs to be completed. See Recommendation #2.
