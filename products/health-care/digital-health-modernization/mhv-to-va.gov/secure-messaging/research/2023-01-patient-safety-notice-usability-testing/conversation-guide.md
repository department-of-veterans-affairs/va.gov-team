## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]?

My name is Anne. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure our resources meet their needs.

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_If yes:_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_If no:_ I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

For this feedback session, we're here to test our design for the safety message that appears before a Veteran writes a new message or replies to a secure message in My Health_e_Vet. Our goal is to make sure the safety message is effective, and your input will help us with that.

Part of the safety message deals with mental health and might be a sensitive subject for some. I won't be asking you anything personal about your mental health, but we will be discussing symptoms and support resources.

Are you comfortable discussing mental health symptoms and support resources?

_If no:_ Is there anything I can do to make you feel more comfortable? _[Get verbal confirmation or end session.]_

_If yes:_ If you have experienced any mental health issues or are close to someone who has, conversations in this session might remind you of these past experiences.

Are you comfortable proceeding with this session?

_If no:_ Is there anything I can do to make you feel more comfortable? _[Get verbal confirmation or end session.]_

_If yes:_ Thank you! We very much appreciate you talking with us today. Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes:  **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Do you use My Health_e_Vet?

_If yes:_ How often? How do you feel about it?

Do you use Secure Messaging?

_If yes:_ How often? How do you feel about it?

What type of device are you using today?

_If on Desktop/Laptop/Tablet:_ I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get setup, I will give you instructions on what to do. _[when ready]_ I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen and then you will be able to control my screen. Ready?

_If on mobile:_ Have you shared your screen over Zoom with your phone?

_If yes:_ I dropped the link to the prototype in the chat. Go ahead and pull it up and when you are ready to share, please do so.

_[If no, follow protocol for particular OS (Android/iOS)]_

## First Task: Interrupted Flow - 5 minutes 

Our tasks today will be very simple, so please try to not get distracted by the other options on the page.

I am going to give you a little bit of background and then instructions. It would be a big help if you could wait until I say "go" before beginning the task.

Let's say you were just at your doctor's office, and you forgot to ask a question about one of your medications.

When I say "go" I would like for you to pretend we are on the phone, and I cannot see your screen. I would like for you to tell me what you are seeing on your screen and share out loud what you are thinking while you are completing the task.

I will not be able to respond to you for this task, so save any questions for after I say "stop."

What questions can I answer?

Remember, you are writing a message to your doctor, we are on the phone, and I won't be responding, so say what you are seeing and thinking.

Are you ready?

Go.

_[When participant reaches "Compose message" page]:_ Stop.

Thank you for completing that. I have some follow up questions.

- How do you feel about that page that we saw before this one, the one with Only use messages for non-urgent needs? What makes you say that?
- On a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 is very confusing, 2 is confusing, 3 is neutral, 4 is not really confusing, 5 is not at all confusing please rate your feelings about seeing that page when you selected "Start a new message"? How did you decide on that score?
- How would you describe the purpose of that page?

Thank you. Please scroll down and click "Send."

**Things to watch for:**

- How does the participant react to interstitial?
- Does the interstitial cause confusion or disorientation?
- Mouse movements/hover states as the participant views the interstitial.

## Second Task: Interstitial - 15 minutes

We are going to spend some time on this screen.

Today we are testing whether the content of this page is clear. We are not testing you or your understanding. If something you see on this page is not clear, please say so, because it gives us the opportunity to improve the content for other Veterans like you.

What questions can I answer before we get started?

**Header**

Let's start at the top. What do you think is meant by "Only use messages for non-urgent needs"?

- Can you share an example of something that is non-urgent?

Would you please click on the word "only" for me? Tell me how you feel about the phrase now that it says, "Don't use messages for non-urgent needs"? What makes you say that?

If you would like to look at the other version, you can click on the word "don't" to go back.

- Which wording do you think is more effective? What makes you say that?

**911 message**

The next line says If you think your life or health is in danger, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

- What do you think is meant by "life or health is in danger"?
- Can you share an example of a time when someone’s life or health is in danger?
- What do you think would happen if you clicked on that link that says, "Call 911"? What makes you say that?
- Do you think this statement and link is valuable? What makes you say that?

Thank you. Let's move on to the next line.

**VCL message**

This one says, "If you feel hopeless and need to talk to someone right now, our Veterans Crisis Line offers confidential support anytime day or night."

- What do you think is meant by "If you feel hopeless"
- Can you share an example of someone feeling hopeless?
- What do you think would happen if you clicked on that link that says, "Connect with the Veterans Crisis Line"? What makes you say that?

Go ahead and click the link.

Please tell me what you are looking at on this screen and any thoughts that come to mind.

- If a Veteran came to this page and read "If you are a Veteran in crisis or concerned about one," and they were unsure about what that means. What might they do to get more information?
- _[If the participant mentions the Veteranscrisisline.net]_ What do you think would happen if you clicked on that link? What makes you say that?

When you are ready, please close this screen.

- Do you think this statement about feeling hopeless and link is valuable? What makes you say that?

I would like to share some situations in which someone may or may not need to use the Veterans Crisis Line instead of sending a message. After I read each one I would like you to tell me which would be more appropriate.

- Can I answer any questions before we start?
- Are you feeling comfortable with this activity?
- _[If no]: Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?_
_[If no]: Thank you for letting me know. We can skip this part._

_[If yes]:_

- Person 1 is angry that they were left on hold for 20 minutes with the help desk only to be told they had to call a different number. Should they send a message or connect with the Veterans Crisis Line?
- Person 2 has lost interest in all that they love to do and nothing they do to try to relieve their emotional pain seems to help. Should they send a message or connect with the Veterans Crisis Line?

Thank you for those answers.

- _[If participant seems affected by topic, ask]:_ We are finished with the mental health section. Would you like to take a quick break before we move on?
- _[If yes]:_ Let's turn our cameras off for a few minutes and take a break and then we can see how we feel. _[Reevaluate and proceed accordingly]_
- _[If no]:_ Are you feeling ready to move on?
- _[If yes]:_ Okay, we are almost finished with the session. If you think you need a break, please let me know.
- _[If no]:_ We are almost finished. Would you like to end the session now? _[Refer to Protocol and Emergency Exit plans]_

**Urgent questions & 3-day response**

Let's look at the next line. This one says, "If you have an urgent question for your VA care team, call your VA health facility."

- What do you think is meant by "If you have an urgent question"?
- Can you share an example of an urgent question?
- Do you think this statement and link is valuable? What makes you say that?

I would like to share some situations like we did earlier, but these are medical. I am going to say them as if I were seeking your advice about whether I should use secure messaging. If you think I should use secure messaging, say yes. If not, say no.

- I need to cancel an appointment scheduled for tomorrow.
- I have outpatient surgery coming up in a few weeks and they want me to stop taking fish oil, but I forgot when to stop.

If I were to use secure messaging, when should I expect a response? What makes you say that?

[If Participant is unsure/incorrect, ask:] is there anything on this page that might tell you?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant notice the Veterancrisisline.net link?
- Does the participant notice "Your care team may take up to 3 days to reply."?
- Does the participant understand when to seek more immediate help rather than use secure messaging.
- Does the participant value the safety message and links provided?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
