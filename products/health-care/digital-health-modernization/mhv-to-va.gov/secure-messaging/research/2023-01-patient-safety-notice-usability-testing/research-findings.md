## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We developed and tested a prototype of what Secure Messaging in MHV on VA.gov could look like on desktop and on a mobile device in June and July 2022 then iterated on the designs and conducted a second round of testing in November 2022. During the round 2 usability testing of Secure Messaging, we found that participants did not notice some or all the patient safety message. We also found that 1/3 of participants who were asked did not understand the connotation of "crisis" in the 988 sentence.

## **OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

## **Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## **Research Goals**

The goals of this study are to:

- Identify Veterans' tolerance for the interstitial screen.
- Identify any usability issues with the patient safety message flow.
- Measure Veterans' understanding of when using Secure Messaging is appropriate.
- Measure Veterans' understanding of the mental health help available.

## **Research Questions**

1. How will Veterans react to the new compose/reply/edit draft flow? Will the interstitial page be identified as a pain point?
2. Does the new flow improve the likelihood that the safety message will be noticed and read? How much time do Veterans spend on the interstitial before advancing?
3. Does the safety message help Veterans understand when secure messaging is not the appropriate communication method?

  - How do Veterans interpret "Only use messages for non-urgent needs"?
  - What circumstances do Veterans consider an urgent question?

4. Do Veterans value the links to 911 and the VCL?
5. How will Veterans tolerate the original patient safety banner and informational dropdown in addition to the interstitial?
6. Do Veteran require the inclusion of the word "secure" to feel confident that the VA is keeping messages secure?

## **Methodology**

We conducted hour-long moderated remote sessions via Zoom from January 27 – February 7, 2023.

Participants were asked to perform the following tasks on the prototype:

Task 1: Interrupted Flow​

Select "Start a new message," Read content and find "Continue to start a new message" on the interstitial and reach the Compose message screen.​

​Task 2: Interstitial​

Provide feedback on content, identify urgent vs. non - urgent needs, identify expected time for a response.​
​

Task 3: Secure Message​

Measure confidence in VA keeping messages secure.​

​
Task 4: Patient Safety Banner​

Identify tolerance of original banner in addition to the interstitial.

## **Hypotheses and Conclusions**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Veterans will tolerate the new flow with the interstitial page.

LIKELY TRUE: Most participants were either positive or neutral about the interrupted flow. Those who did cite pain points later softened after continuing through the session and better understanding its purpose.

_Hypothesis 2:_ The patient safety message placed within the flow on a separate page will increase the likelihood that it will be noticed and read.

TRUE: All participants viewed and understood the patient safety message.

_Hypothesis 3:_ The safety message will help Veterans understand when to seek more immediate help than what Secure Messaging provides.

_Hypothesis 4:_ Veterans will value the links to 911, and the VCL. 

LIKELY TRUE: All participants found the VCL link helpful and half of the participants found the 911 link helpful.


## **Key Findings**

1. **All participants (19 of 19) were able to accurately describe the purpose of the interstitial page** when they reached the Compose message screen.
    - **Most participants (13 of 19) read aloud and/or hovered their cursor over the text on the interstitial.**
2. **All participants (19 of 19) were able to identify when secure messaging would be the most appropriate means of communication.**

     -  **Most participants (16 of 18) pointed out the statement, "Your care team may take up to 3 days to reply."**
     -  **All participants (18 of 18) expected that response times would be at least one to two business days** while citing their own positive experiences in receiving responses in much less time.

3. **Participant responses to the statement "If you think your life or health is in danger," and the link to 911 were divided.**

   -  **Many participants (9 of 19) said they feel the statement and link are helpful.**
   - **Many participants (9 of 19) said they feel the statement and link are not helpful,** stating that it is common knowledge and that they hear it too often.

      - 7 of those 9 said the statement is an insult to their intelligence.
      - 2 of 9 did not understand how the link to call would function on a laptop/desktop and based its helpfulness on that.
      - One participant was unsure if the statement and link were helpful.

4. **All participants (19 of 19) said they felt the statement, "If you're in crisis or having thoughts of suicide" and the VCL link are helpful.**
      - Some participants (6 of 19) requested access to a non-crisis mental health line for Veterans.
5. **Many participants (10 of 18) tolerated the interrupted flow.**
6. **Most participants (13 of 19) preferred "Only use messages for non-urgent needs" to "Don't use messages for urgent needs."**
7. **Many participants (10 of 19) cited text and action link sizes as pain points.**
     -  **Several participants (6 of 19) felt the action link for "Continue to message" was too small **and difficult to find on the page.
     -  **Several participants (7 of 19) **stated that the H2 header text was too large. 4 of those 7 were viewing it on mobile and complained of the need to scroll.
8. **Most participants (13 of 16) stated that keeping the banner with the full safety message dropdown on the "Compose message" screen is helpful.**

## **Details of Findings**

1. **All participants viewed the patient safety message and understood its purpose.**

    **19 of 19 were able to accurately describe the purpose of the interstitial page** when they reached the 'Compose message' screen.The descriptions varied from simple statements about safety while others were more in depth and included specifics from the page. The mean time spent on the interstitial page was 22 seconds and the median time was 14 seconds. Desktop users spent an average of 15 seconds longer than mobile users on the page.

    **13 of 19 read aloud and/or hovered their cursor over the text on the interstitial.**

    _"A reminder that the messaging system is not for emergencies."_

    _"To confirm it's non-urgent… If someone is in crisis [to] make sure they are helped expeditiously."_

2. **All participants were able to identify when secure messaging would be the most appropriate means of communication.**

    **19 of 19 were able to identify when secure messaging would be the most appropriate means of communication.**

    **Most participants (16 of 18) pointed out the statement, "Your care team may take up to 3 days to reply."** During this task, participants were asked to review the contents of the page so it is unknown if they would have noticed the statement on their own even though it is the first line of text below the H1 and is bold.

    **All participants (18 of 18) expected that response times would be at least one to two business days** while citing their own positive experiences in receiving responses in much less time. Most stated that response times ranged from just a few hours to 24 hours. Some attributed fast response times to the high quality of the provider.

    "_Depends on what type. If I write about mental health at, like 2 am, they'll respond next day by 8 o'clock."_

3. **Participant responses to the statement "If you think your life or health is in danger," and the link to 911 were divided.**

    **Many participants (9 of 19) said they feel the statement and link are helpful.**

    **Many participants (9 of 19) said they feel the statement and link are not helpful,** stating that it is common knowledge and that they hear it too often. 7 of those 9 said the statement is an insult to their intelligence as they would know not to send a secure message during an emergency. Two participants did not understand that the 911 link could place a call on a desktop/laptop computer and based their response on that.

    **One participant was not sure if the statement and link are helpful.**

    _"I have to scroll past it. It's right there [in] my face and it's like, duh! Do you think I'm stupid?"_

4. **All participants reacted favorably to the Veterans Crisis Line link and modal.**

    **19 of 19 participants said they felt the statement, "If you're in crisis or having thoughts of suicide" and the VCL link are helpful.** Even the participants who had reacted negatively to the interrupted flow initially, acknowledged the need to provide help for Veterans experiencing mental health crises. No participants were triggered by the term "suicide," and many applauded its directness.

    **Some participants (6 of 19) requested access to a non-crisis mental health line for Veterans.**

    _"I think there's a lot of Veterans who are afraid to reach out."_

    _"Naming it right there, 'If you're in crisis or having thoughts of suicide,' allows you to… name what's happening, to be able to give you the strength to [take the] next step."_

5. **Many participants tolerated the interrupted flow.**

    **10 of 18 participants cited no pain points with the interruption.** Five of the ten reacted positively, and 5 of the 10 were neutral, making statements such as, "it was fine," "I'm not upset about it," and "it's something that is part of the process."

    **8 of 18 did cite pain points with the interruption** unprompted while viewing the interstitial and when prompted for feedback by the moderator. 3 of 8 were frustrated with constantly hearing the same message when calling the VA or community health care providers. 2 of 8 wanted to go directly to the compose message screen. 3 of 8 complained about the amount of reading they were required to do prior to beginning their task. These participants each spent 13 seconds or less on the interstitial during the task compared to the median time spent of 13.5 seconds and mean of 21.5 seconds among all participants.

    _"Everybody has to say it on their messages. They all have this spiel they have to say and it's like, my god, I've heard that like 5 million times now and I am just really done with it."_

    _"When I clicked on 'Start a new message'  I wanted to see a text box right away."_

    _"It's a lot to read."_

6. **Most participants preferred "Only use messages for non-urgent needs" to "Don't use messages for urgent needs."**

    **13 of 19 participants stated that "Only use messages for non-urgent needs" was more helpful** than "Don't use messages for urgent needs" because it was a softer, more positive directive. 2 of the 13 felt the contraction "don't" was informal.

7. **Many participants (10 of 19) cited text and action link sizes as pain points.**

    **Several participants (6 of 19) felt the action link for "Continue to start a message" was too small** and difficult to find on the page.

    **Several participants (7 of 19) stated that the H2 header text was too large.** 4 of those 7 were viewing it on mobile and complained of the need to scroll.

    "_It was super tiny compared to everything else."_

8. **Most participants stated that keeping the banner with the full safety message dropdown on the "Compose message" screen is helpful.**

    **Most participants (13 of 16) stated that keeping the banner with the full safety message dropdown on the "Compose message" screen is helpful.** This included 7 participants who had expressed issues with the interstitial and 6 who had stated the 911 notice and link were not helpful.

    "_It's important there, reminding someone before they start typing."_

## **Additional Insights**

**Most participants require reassurance about the security of their messages.**

**No participants (0 of 17) mentioned the absence of the word "secure" in the prototype** or in the moderators' references to the portal during the session. The prototype flow began at the inbox, so it could have been assumed that it was on previous screens.​

**Most participants (12 of 17) stated the inclusion of the word "secure" in the portal is necessary for them to retain confidence.** Those that did not require it stated they were satisfied with the security of the entire site based on the rigorous login process.​

**Many participants (8 of 19) used the term "secure messaging" when referring to the portal.** 5 of those 8 did not know why they used that term and 3 of 8 thought it was on the MHV homepage.

## **Recommendations**

**Keep the interstitial as part of the secure messaging flow with the following requirements and or changes:**

**Interstitial page:**

  - Use "Only use messages for non-urgent needs" as H1 header.
  - Remove H2 headers and redesign for better hierarchy and usability.
  - Place "If you are in crisis…" link before the "If you think your life…" link on the page.
  - Change "Continue to start a message" to a primary button.

**Start a new message screen:**

  - Keep the "Only use for non-urgent needs" banner and informational dropdown.
  - Place "If you are in crisis…" link before the "If you think your life…" link on the informational dropdown.

**Include the word "secure" on the Messaging landing page and in the success banner that follows a sent message.**

## **Next Steps**

Integrate designs into Phase 0.

## **Further research needed**

Test the new designs during Phase 0.

## **Secondary research**

**Suicide rates for Veterans is higher than for non-veteran U.S. adults.** ​

  - Veteran suicide deaths were almost 3 times greater than for non-veteran U.S. adults in 2020.​
  - Suicide is the #2 leading cause of death for Veterans aged 18 to 44.​
  - Suicide rates in older Veterans are lower, but the suicide numbers (65%) are greater in those 50 and older.

**High-risk symptoms have been shared through secure messaging services.** ​

  - ​In a study conducted at VISN 17, 4.3% of secure messages were about urgent issues.​
  - In a study conducted at the Mayo Clinic, 3.5% of messages contained high-risk symptoms.​
  - Secure messages with thoughts of depression, self-harm, and suicidal ideation have been sent within 30 days of death by suicide, an ER visit, or hospitalization for mental health.

**Attending to language is imperative to designing for users with cognitive disabilities.** ​

  - ​Follow VA.gov Content Standards for using plain language.​

  - Divide processes into logical essential steps with progress indicators.​
  - Provide cues and reminders to reduce cognitive load.

**Banner blindness, a form of selective attention, is overcome with element similarity.** ​

  - ​Following Gestalt principles with the patient safety message will help them get noticed.​

  - Elements related to a users' goals will be seen.​
  - "What seems to matter most to noticing is the unexpected object's similarity along the critical dimension that defines the attention set."  ​
  - Ads are commonly placed on the top and right side of webpages, so elements there get ignored.

**Additional clicks do not necessarily reduce usability.** ​

  - ​The problem is not the clicks, but the decisions they require.​

  - "A path with 5 easy clicks is vastly superior to one with 3 clicks."​
  - The purpose of each click is to make the user's task easier for them.
