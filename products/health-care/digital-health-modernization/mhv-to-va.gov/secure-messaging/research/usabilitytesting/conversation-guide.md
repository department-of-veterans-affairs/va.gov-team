## Moderator logistics
### 2-3 days before the session

### Day of the session
*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in 
Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Mute your Slack notifications.*

*Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*



### Starting the session

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to show you some ideas related to viewing and sending messages.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a Demo.** This is a demo and not a live website, parts may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Just let me know what you'd expect to happen in that case. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5-10 minutes

- What device are you using to talk to us today?
- Have you used My HealtheVet? If Yes, how often do you use it? What do you use it for? How do you access it (phone, tablet, laptop, etc)?
- Do you ever send messages in My HealtheVet? What kind of messages do you send? Do you feel comfortable sending that information? Is there anything that you aren't comfortable sending in messages? What makes you comfortable/uncomfortable?

## A/B Testing: Patient safety - 5 minutes

*Anne - Here is where we can test out how much patients notice the patient safety messaging. Suggested approach: (1) show briefly (5 secs) an image of the message in reply flow and ask what they noticed; (2) show the message and ask how participants understand it and what they would do with that information.*


## First Task: Replying to a message - 10 minutes

Let's say you received a message from your doctor and you need to respond to them. How would you write back to them? 

*If participant is unable to find a message to reply to:*

- Where would you look for a message from your doctor? *(If participant continues to be confused, instruct them to click on "Messaages" in the left navigation.)*

*If participant gets confused about picking a message from the list of possible messages, instruct them to choose a particular message. We are not concerned with whether they find a message, but rather with the reply flow.*

*After participant clicks "Reply":*

- If you needed to send them a document, how would you do that?
- If you accidentally attached the wrong document and needed to get rid of it and attach a different document, how would you do that?  
- If you wanted to save this message before you sent it to your doctor, how would you do that? 
- If you decided that you didn't want to respond at that moment and needed to get rid of the message, how would you do that? 

### Things to watch for:

- Which "Reply" option does the participant use - the toolbar or the button? 
- Does the participant notice the "Save draft" and "Delete draft" buttons? 
- Does the participant understand how to use the Attach and Remove buttons? 

## Second Task: Finding a message - 10 minutes

*Create tasks that has participant using the advanced search function to locate messages in folders or within attachments or threads.* 

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Third Task: Organizing messages - 5-10 minutes

*Create tasks that has participant using folder functionality.*  

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
- What are your thoughts about what we looked at today?
- Any other things that would be good for us to know?


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

*If still need participants, include the following request.*

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
