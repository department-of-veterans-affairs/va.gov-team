## Design (How it looks)

|  12/20/2022    |      Carnetta Scruggs, Patty Henry, Bhanu Goparaju             |  For the MVP, users will not be able to reply to messages after 45 days of inactivity on their end. This functionality applies to both new replies, and replies that were saved into the drafts folder prior to the 45-day expiration date. This behavior will mimic MHV Legacy for the SM MVP, though research and ideation will be required as we iterate further.                         | Legacy allows the user to copy/paste draft messages into a new message, which is acceptable for the time being. However, a more accessible, user friendly solution should be explored through Veteran research.          |
