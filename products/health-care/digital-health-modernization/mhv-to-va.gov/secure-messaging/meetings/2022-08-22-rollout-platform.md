## Notes
- Will we go through the collaboration cycle
- First time deploying a new app to VA.gov.  Engineers for ByLight are also new to VA.gov, so will need perhaps a little more guidance than teams who have someone already familiar.
- Are there any particular questions we have?
	- Take advantage of office hours.  Have them treat the Platform website as a how-to guide.  All the information should be there, but escalate to them if we can't find it.  That should be their main source of information.
	- If we have any estimates on traffic, send it over. 
- User experience that Andrea is used to is that you are automatically taken to the new experience. 
	- When we do the new user flows, we don't do a great job of documenting that.  We should publicize the user flows.
- Talk with Nick Sourteros & Joe Niquette about Identity.
