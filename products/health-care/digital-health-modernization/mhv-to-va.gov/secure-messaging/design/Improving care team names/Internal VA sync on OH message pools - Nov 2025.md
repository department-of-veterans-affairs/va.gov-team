# Internal VA sync on OH message pools - Nov 2025
This doc summarizes a follow-up discussion after the 11/12 transition session. You can review notes from that meeting [in GitHub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secure-messaging/design/Improving%20care%20team%20names/VA.gov%20transition%20sessions%2C%20OH%20message%20pools%20-%20Nov%202025.md).

## Takeaways
- **Message pool guidance**: We developed message pool names with more familiar language to clinic staff.
- **Plain language improvements**: We should review current message pool names to determine how we can make them more patient-friendly, since we won't be displaying a separate patient-friendly name.
- **Internal-only pools**: We could add some indication that a message pool should be internal-only (example: special character like an asterisk).
- **VA.gov experience**: Patients will see all pools on VA.gov, but they'll be able to filter the long list down by healthcare system.
- **Updating list of programs**: Ann Arbor had more programs than those listed in the original guidance doc. We're adding more message pools for Ann Arbor right now. 
   - We could potentially anticipate more program names as more facilities transition to OH and start developing message pools. 

## Next steps 
- Align on how we'll hide internal-only message pools on VA.gov at the next call (Thursday 11/20)
- Review message pools for more patient-friendly guidance
- Pivot VistA pilot to align with the message pool guidance instead of the patient display name guidance
