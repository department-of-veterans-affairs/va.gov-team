## Question and responses
Sylvia Palmer sent coordinators these three questions on 7/31. Two coordinators responded via email so far.

### What makes it hard to create and manage message pools? 
- Coordinator A: Ticketing process is cumbersome. I would like to be able to manage the pools as needed without submitting a ticket each time.  
- Coordinator A: The constant rotation of providers; connecting provider names with PACTS.
   - Note: PACTS are Patient-Aligned Care Teams.
-	Coordinator B: Not having an updated current list of ALL pools for my location. (Other can put in a ticket request to open pools, so we don’t always know about all the pools) 
-	Coordinator B: The Discern Reporting system is VERY cumbersome and not always accurate, therefore makes it hard to manage pools
-	Coordinator B: There is no set template on how to build a pool(s) across all VAs. It makes it difficult on the Cerner side if we all request differently and they have to reach out to us instead of just creating the pool(s). That causes more lapse in time and frustration especially if you cannot reach the coordinator or the person requesting the ticket
-	Coordinator B: There is no template at the local level for fellow VA employees to request a pool for their department. Some of them reach out to us via teams, e-mail, or even a phone call. Not a set way to track the requests and reply that their request has been completed. Some of us utilize a LEAF program. 

### What would make it easier to create and manage message pools?
- Coordinator A: I would like to manage my own messaging pools and not have to submit tickets 
- Coordinator A: Being responsible for submitting tickets for non-veteran facing pools.  
- Coordinator A: Less pools; create pools that are necessary for patient care and other services needed.
- Coordinator B: If we can have the opportunity to create and manage all the message pools for each location then it would be ideal for each VA to have a process to request the needed pools. It would also be ideal to have an easy way to remove staff from pools during the deprovisioning. 
-	Coordinator B: To have a reporting system that is not cumbersome and is 1 report that we can pull for escalated messages.
-	Coordinator B: Have a team that can help out with this for example the ISC team, coordinators usually are one single person doing multiple jobs at their VA location and they don't always have the time or the ability to babysit multiple pools and handle multiple requests. It would be ideal if we had a team

### What, to your knowledge, has been difficult for Veterans when trying to message their doctors on My VA Health?
- Coordinator A: For my location the PACT names. Veterans don’t know PACT assignment.
   - Note: PACTS are Patient-Aligned Care Teams. 
- Coordinator A: Too many messaging pools 
- Coordinator A: Pharmacy renewal, there may be no pools in dropdown menu and they don’t read type in “two or more characters” to locate pool 
- Coordinator A: Fear of trying it. It looks complicated and they are timid using it. 
- Coordinator B: Veterans have no way of knowing who their Care Team is in the patient portal. 
-	Coordinator B: The search isn't only isolated to the VA that the veteran is assigned to unfortunately they can see all “go live” sites that causes more frustration and can be extremely overwhelming. 
-	Coordinator B: The sign in process in general is overwhelming, cumbersome, and confusing for most of our veterans. The fact that they get ID.Me, Login.gov, VA.gov,  My VA Health and MyHealthyeVet all mixed up. The veterans sometimes don't understand how each one of those work together in order for them to get to the patient portal just to send a message in the first place.

- What makes the ticketing process challenging right now?
- What guidance do you have on building a pool, if any, right now?
- Around what percentage of pools you create would you say are non-Veteran facing? And about what percentage is Veteran-facing?
