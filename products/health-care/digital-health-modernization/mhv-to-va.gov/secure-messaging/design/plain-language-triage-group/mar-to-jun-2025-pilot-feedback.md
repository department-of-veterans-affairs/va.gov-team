## Feedback
These are the main types of feedback we got:
- **Staff process**: Related to business processes to create, update, and delete triage group names
- **Character limit**: Related to triage group names exceeding the character limit 
- **Group and subgroup options**: Related to options in the `Group Type:` and `Sub-Group Type:` fields
- **Facility options**: Related to options in the `Medical Center or Clinic (location):` field

### Staff process
Takeaway: SM admins (MHV coordinators) who create, update, and delete triage group names need to transition to new business processes

New processes include: 
- Removing providers from triage groups after providers leave a position/facility
- Deleting triage groups after lead providers leave a position/facility
- Creating names using sentence case
- Not adding hyphens or underscores to team names

### Character limit
Takeaway: SM admins can't always spell out acronyms because then the triage group name will exceed the character limit.

Here's an example:
- Name with spelled-out acronym: Providence VA Medical Center | Mental health | Mental health Intensive case management (MHICM)/Community Residential Care Program (CRC)/Veterans Justice  Outreach (VJ0)
- Name with acronym: Providence VA Medical Center | Mental health | MHICM/CRC/VJO
  
### Facility options
Takeaway: SM admins don't always find the facility they're looking for.

SM admins have worked around this issue by adding more details to the free-text team name. Here's an example:
- Ideal name: Bedford VA Clinic | Gastroenterology
- Workaround: VA Boston Health Care | Gastroenterology | at Bedford VA

### Group and subgroup options
Takeaway: SM admins don't always find a group or subgroup that fits. 

Here are some examples: 
- [Subgroup] Audiology and Speech Pathology: Audiology and speech are two different teams.
   - Suggestion: split into two subgroups.
- [Subgroup] MOVE! Weight Management Program for Veterans: This is a common program at multiple facilities.
   - Suggestion: Add subgroup.
- [Group or subgroup] Clinical resource hub (CRH): This exists at multiple facilities. SM admins are entering this inconsistently in the free-text team name right now.
   - Suggestion: Add group or subgroup

## Recommendations
- **Staff process**: Make documentation for SM admins to reference when they're working with the triage group names. Develop business processes to support SM admins through onboarding or troubleshooting.
- **Character limit**: Allow use of acronyms when necessary. If using acronyms, pair with other identifier in the free text team name (like provider name). Then patients can search for the triage group name with another keyword.
- **Group and subgroup options**: Develop intake process for new options or to update existing options.
- **Facility options**: Continue to allow free text team name field in case the VA Facilities API doesn't display the correct facilities.
