#### Error Logging

- **Datadog Integration:** Ensure Datadog is properly integrated into both vets-api and vets-website. Datadog will capture any runtime errors, performance issues, or exceptions in the application.
- **Error Alerts:** Set up Datadog alerts to notify the team via email or Slack when critical errors occur or when error rates exceed a predefined threshold.
- **Error Types and Frequencies:** Regularly review error logs to identify common or recurring issues. Pay special attention to error types, frequencies, and the severity of impacts on users.

#### Performance Metrics

- **Datadog Monitoring:** Utilize Datadog to monitor the application's performance. Track metrics like response times, server load, and API call frequencies.
- **Thresholds and Anomalies:** Set performance thresholds in Datadog. Receive alerts when metrics fall outside of these thresholds, indicating potential performance issues.

### Issue Investigation Steps

This section outlines the steps to investigate and resolve issues related to the Medical Supplies Reorder.

#### Initial Assessment

- **Identify the Issue:** Use Datadog alerts to identify the issue. Determine whether it's an API failure, a frontend error, or a performance bottleneck.
- **Impact Analysis:** Assess the impact of the issue. Determine how many users are affected and the severity of the impact on the feature's functionality.

#### Detailed Investigation

- **Log Analysis:** Review Datadog logs to pinpoint the error's origin. Look for stack traces, error messages, and the conditions under which the error occurred.
- **Reproduction:** Attempt to reproduce the issue in a test environment based on the information from Datadog and user reports.
- **Cross-Reference Metrics:** Use Datadog to cross-reference performance metrics around the time the issue occurred. This can help identify if the issue is isolated or part of a larger systemic problem.

#### Resolution and Follow-Up

- **Fix Implementation:** Once the issue is identified and understood, develop a fix. This could involve code changes, configuration updates, or infrastructure adjustments.
- **Testing and Deployment:** Test the fix thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production.
- **Monitoring Post-Fix:** Closely monitor Datadog after deploying the fix to ensure the issue is resolved and no new issues have arisen.
- **Postmortem Analysis:** Conduct a postmortem analysis to understand the root cause and document learnings. Update the playbook accordingly to improve response for future incidents.
