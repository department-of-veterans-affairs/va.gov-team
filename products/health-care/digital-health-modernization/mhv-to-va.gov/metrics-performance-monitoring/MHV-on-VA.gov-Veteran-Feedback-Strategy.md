# MHV on VA.gov Veteran Feedback Strategy
Last Updated: 09/21/2023

# Goal of document: 
To outline a systematic Veteran feedback strategy to be employed across the different MHV applications on VA.gov throughout the phased launches.  

**Note:** The strategy outlined on this page for the different health applications: Appointments, Medications, Medical Records, and Secure Messaging. A different strategy is being developed for monitoring feedback for the MHV on VA.gov portal-level experience.  

## Tools available for feedback and health monitoring of individual products:  

### User behavior & website interactions:

- Google Analytics
- Datadog RUM 

### User satisfaction and feedback:  

- Medallia
- MHV feedback email (Phase 0 only)

## General Steps for Monitoring and Feedback Strategy:  

### Step 1: Define success for each product, what you want to learn while monitoring Veteran feedback, and document your strategy on GitHub

- What are the standard metrics based on predefined OKRs?
- What do you want to learn from qualitative feedback?
- How often are you going to review and analyze different sources of feedback?
- Document feedback strategy in product folder on GitHub 

**Describe the OKRs and standard metrics**

- Describe a general approach to periodically analyzing data from different sources, and what types of questions you expect this analysis to answer
- Describe the cadence of data analysis -> could be monthly or quarterly, for example
- Identify a person who will take responsibility for both setting up access to the relevant tools (see step 2), periodically analyzing data, and sharing out insights
- Document these processes in the product folder on GitHub 

### Step 2: Define who is point person and get necessary team members access to all the relevant tools or sources of data  
_Default point person:_ A Product Manager or Delivery Manager, in partnership as appropriate with Researcher(s).  

- Google Analytics: [read up here](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/getting-started-with-platform-analytics-insights) on getting access and setting it up; use GA data within GA console, or import into Domo as needed;
- [Medallia](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/how-to-use-medallia-data-in-domo): can manually import into Domo
- Domo: dashboard tool for combining Medallia, Google Analytics, and other data sources; request access from Platform Analytics team in same ticket you request Google Analytics access
- MHV feedback email: need to submit an IT ticket; Jasmine Yohannan can help
- Datadog: Access via OKTA, need to submit [request ticket](https://jira.devops.va.gov/servicedesk/customer/portal/1), follow up in #dots-dsva slack channel. Adrian Rollett, Mark Dewey, or Stephen Barrs would be good resources if you want a quick review of how Datadog has been helpful elsewhere.  

### Step 3: Implement monitoring and feedback mechanisms according to a phased schedule 

#### By Phase 0 launch: Trusted users only 

- MHV feedback email: have access, follow process for triaging feedback described in [this document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/metrics-performance-monitoring/Triaging-Veteran-feedback-guidance.md)
- Domo: set up so can link in various data sources
- Google Analytics: set up, but donâ€™t put much stock into results given that will be very small number of users. Mostly test out that have GA set up and everything tagged as desired and data importing into Domo. Have game plan for periodic analysis beginning in Phase 1. _Be sure to set up event triggers in code for key parts of the user interaction (e.g., when a user hits send on a message or orders a refill)_
- Medallia: set up and begin collecting data; import data into Domo
- Datadog & Datadog RUM: (_Optional_) Get access, set up, review regularly to confirm users are successfully able to navigate the product and to quickly surface issues. _Be sure to implement RUM in code. Be sure to implement any application-specific backend monitoring via statsD at the vets-api layer._ 

#### By transition into Phase 1: Veterans invited to "Try me" from Liferay MHV, not yet connected to MHV on VA.gov landing page

- MHV feedback email no longer promoted
- Monitor feedback from various sources, adjust processes as appropriate throughout subsequent phases
