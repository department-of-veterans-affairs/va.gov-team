# Meeting with Patty Henry
Date: June 21, 2023
Attendees: Patty and Florence

## Is it possible for me to get data from HRC-run MHV helpdesk about Veteran issues with the MHV apps?
- The helpdesk gives "us" a usage report every month; it's pretty bare bones, with a grouping of categories and numbers that correspond with those categories
- Thinks I probably won't be able to get access to the more nitty gritty of user issues
- Patty will get in touch with Theresa Hancock to ensure there's no concerns, and if there are none, she will share the HRC monthly report and the customer satisfaction survey report with me via email
- I'm wondering also if Nicole Ortego might be able to answer questions about HRC data and potentially getting more specifics about tickets; App Dynamics is the name of the tool where ticketing happens and more specific details about each ticket lives (Patty believes I won't be able to get access since it's run by a contracting company)

## Customer satisfaction survey
- They use V Signals
- There is a static survey button on every page (for proactive users), and also every certain number of users is automatically offered a survey (for reactive users)
- Kophie Mathis does a report and dashboard on customer satisfaction findings regularly

## Besides MHV helpdesk, Patty recommends I get data from the following:
- My VA health helpdesk (Cerner): contact Kelsi Hampton
- Customer satisfaction survey results: contact Kophie Mathis
- Sylvia Palmer, just a poc who might be of help; she used to be a supervisor at HRC helpdesk and now she is a MHV employee

# Meeting with Susan Haidary
Date: June 5, 2023
Attendees: Susan Haidary, Florence McCafferty, Patrick Bateman

## How do users primarily get support?
- Number 1: Call help desk
- If lucky, user can access coordinator at a CBOT and coordinator gets the info needed to address the issue
- If the issue is technical, it is escalated to tier 3 (POC re: tier 3: Sean Good)

## What are the different contact centers/help desks that serve MHV?
### MHV Help Desk
- POC: Patty Henry
- Run by HRC (Health Resource Center)
- Veterans call into this help desk, as do Coordinators on Veterans' behalf (user issues)
- Concern/issue is associated with a ticket

### "Contact us" form on MHV
- This goes into IRIS system
- No ticketing system when they use this form 

### Secure messaging support
- Help desk does not offer user support around Secure Messaging
- Instead, there is a secure messaging field questions group that communicates via email listserv

### MHV Neighborhood Channel on Teams
- Coordinators helping each other with questions about problems users are running into

### Coordinators
- If users reach out to a coordinator at a CBOT, the coordinator will chase down answers for them
- At this point, we haven't been able to learn how coordinators are tracking or reporting back the issues that they are helping users with 

## Remaining questions
- How can we get access to data from the HRC-run MHV call center? (Patty Henry might be able to answer this question)
- Is it possible for us to get access to the Secure Messaging user support email listserv?
- How do central office folks keep track of what coordinators are hearing from Veterans (specifically about using MHV)?
