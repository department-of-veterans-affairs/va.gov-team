# Feedback can/should be viewed through several lenses:  

Breadth - how common is feedback? Does it take place over time? How much time?  

Depth - how impactful is the content of feedback? Is it pointing to a problem that needs to be addressed quickly, before breadth can occur?  

UX vs. Dev vs. Other issue â€“ can feedback that indicates an underlying problem be explained by UX/learnability of the product? By backend systems or engineering problems? Or else? While not always possible assess what is causing a problem, striving to understand underlying causes will inform potential solutions (even if the solution is to do nothing while Veterans learn a new tool).  

# How to make that happen?  

## Strategies for breadth:  

- Report in proportions -> always include sample size and time frame
- Report over time 

## Strategies for depth:  

- Ensure communication happening w/ business owners and product teams so that if something happens that need to be on the lookout for, are aware
- Listen to important stakeholders (i.e., Design Leads, Product Leads) -> what are they most concerned with? Engage with data through the lens of the primary intended consumers. 

## Strategies for nature of the feedback: 

- Approach feedback with caution; do not respond to a single point of data, but rather wait until feedback has reached a certain breadth to be meaningful.
- Include multiple eyes on feedback when possible
- Surface potential issues to OCTO stakeholders
