# MHV on VA.gov Veteran Feedback: Triaging feedback and strategizing response
Last Updated: 07/18/2023

# Goal of document: 
To outline a strategy to monitor Veteran feedback through the MHV Feedback email (VAmhvfeedback@va.gov) and other feedback mechanisms. This strategy can be applied to any of the health services on MHV on VA.gov (Secure Messaging, Medical Records, Appointments, and Medications). 

## Who is responsible? 
Delivery teams are responsible for monitoring Veteran feedback, in line with their broader feedback strategy, and facilitating the process of triaging what feedback gets acted upon. 

## Steps 
1. Identify if the feedback is a user support issue, product feedback, or other type of feedback.
2. If feedback is determined to be user support issue
  a. create a Jira or ZenHub ticket and route as needed.
  b. Respond to the email saying, "Thank you for submitting this issue. A ticket has been created to address it."
  c. File the issue in the correct outlook folder so others know it has been addressed. 
3. If feedback is determined to be product feedback,
  a. gather that feedback and flag for review the Bylight and OCTO product managers, who will decide whether a ticket needs to be made to address feedback. Product managers can reach out to OCC Product Owners if unsure.
  b. Respond to the email saying "Thank you for submitting this suggestion to improve the {insert name here} application. We will review this along with other suggested improvements."
  c. File the email in the correct folder so others know it has been addressed. 
5. If feedback determined to be "other" (not user support, not product feedback), discuss the feedback in product-specific channel and tag OCTO Product Owners to decide how to route. File the email in the correct folder so others know it has been addressed.

## Additional instructions
- Acknowledge all feedback with a response to thank them for their feedback without making unrealistic promises about a response. Suggested response could be: 

Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate hearing your thoughts and are logging all comments to be reviewed by our team. Please continue to provide feedback or ask questions as they arise in the future. 

- If feedback represents a user support issue, respond as needed.
