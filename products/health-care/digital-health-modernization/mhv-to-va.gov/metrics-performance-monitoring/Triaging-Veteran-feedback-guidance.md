# MHV on VA.gov Veteran Feedback: Triaging feedback and strategizing response
Last Updated: 07/20/2023

# Goal of document: 
To outline a strategy to monitor Veteran feedback through the MHV Feedback email (VAmhvfeedback@va.gov) and other feedback mechanisms. This strategy can be applied to any of the health services on MHV on VA.gov (Secure Messaging, Medical Records, Appointments, and Medications). 

## Who is responsible? 

### Traffic control officer
A single traffic control officer will be responsible for the initial triage and routing of incoming emails. They are solely responsible for any initial response to the feedback and ensuring the responsible delivery or technical supprot team receives receives the feedback.

#### Initial schedule
- 7/20 - 7/27: Patrick Bateman
- 7/28 - 8/4: Lauren Alexanderson
- 8/5 - 8/12: Marci McGuire

#### Default traffic control response
All messages will receive the default response: 

"_Thank you for submitting feedback on My HealtheVet on VA.gov. Your message will be reviewed by our delivery teams for action. Please note a member of our delivery team may follow up with you to gather more information._ 

_Sincerely,_ 

_The My HealtheVet on VA.gov Team_"

### Delivery teams
Delivery teams are responsible for receiving feedback from the traffic control officer and taking the necessary steps to resolove  in line with their broader feedback strategy.

#### Recommended steps for delivery team resolution 
1. Identify if the feedback is a user support issue or product feedback.
2. If feedback is determined to be user support issue:
   1. create a tracking ticket and route to technical support or development team;
   2. facilitate communication with the reporter as necessary; and
   3. notify the traffic control officer that the message has been received and triaged.
3. If feedback is determined to be product feedback:
   1. gather that feedback and flag for review by product managers, who will decide whether a ticket needs to be made to address feedback. Product managers should reach out to OCC Product Owners if unsure; and
   1. notify the traffic control officer that the message has been received and triaged.
5. If feedback cannot be determined to be user support or product feedback, discuss the feedback in product-specific Slack channel, or in #mhv-health-portal-coordination if unsure.
