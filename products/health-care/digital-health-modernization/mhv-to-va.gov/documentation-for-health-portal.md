## <a name="background"></a>Background of the My HealtheVet transition<be>

**Overview**

The My HealtheVet (MHV) project is part of the Health Modernization Initiative at the VA, operating within the Office of the CTO (OCTO). 

The My HealtheVet on VA.gov team’s mission is to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov, migrating from [My HealtheVet classic](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home). 

Research from 2018, repeated in late 2020, shows that Veterans find it difficult to navigate commonplace interactions with VA health care. The VA ecosystem is so complex that veterans feel discouraged from applying for, managing, and maximizing their benefits.

While the team’s core responsibility focuses on the MHV landing page and Secondary Navigation, close collaboration with other teams ensures that Veterans have a seamless experience managing their healthcare in a single place.

### My HealtheVet on VA.gov Landing page

In September 2023, the My HealtheVet on VA.gov landing page was launched ([see more about the landing page here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/landing-page)). 

### Four main health tools 

Using a phased approach, teams have systematically integrated the four major health tools — [Appointments](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling),  [Medications](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medications/README.md), [Secure Messaging](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secure-messaging/product), and [Medical Records](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/README.md) — into My HealtheVet on VA.gov. An "opt-in" experience in production allowed Veterans to access these tools on VA.gov while enabling VA teams to monitor usage, validate performance, and refine the experience. 

### Secondary Navigation

On June 2024, the [Secondary Navigation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secondary-nav/README.md) was launched to enhance Veterans' awareness and navigation of health tools available within My HealtheVet on VA.gov. This improvement aims to reduce the likelihood of Veterans searching for healthcare-related tools in unauthenticated areas of VA.gov, such as the megamenu.

**As of December 2024, all four of the essential health tools are now fully available on VA.gov.** 

## <a name="2025goals"></a>Where are we going? - 2025 goals/key milestones<be>

*Milestones are subject to change* 

**Milestone 1 (3/17/25)**

- Appointments no longer available on MHV. MHV Classic link redirects to appointments on VA.gov.
- All health care links on VA.gov (facility pages, tools pages, My VA, etc.) will direct to the portal
on VA.gov for a consistent experience. Users will be able to “Go back to the previous version of
MHV” via links in the portal, but the user interface will not encourage users to go to MHV Classic.
- No changes to secure message, medications, or medical records on the new or classic MHV
experiences. Users who directly go to MHV Classic will continue to have the same experience.
- Update MHV Classic “Try Me” banners to let users know that coming soon (June 1), users will be re-
directed to VA.gov for secure messaging, medications, and medical records.
- MyVA Health users can still get to MyVA Health from both portals.
