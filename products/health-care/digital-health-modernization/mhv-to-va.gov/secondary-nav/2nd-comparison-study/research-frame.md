# Research framing: Secondary nav comparison study 2.0
## Problems associated with current secondary nav
- Only 4 tools currently fit, even though there are more than 4 tools in the portal, and this number is likely to continue growing
- In recent research, participants mistakenly clicked the MHV header thinking it would bring them back to the nat'l portal (See [adoption study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/research/adoption-study), 11/24)

## Research goal and questions
The purpose of this research is to assess participants' ability to navigate the health portal using** one or more **redesigned secondary navigation designs.

Specifically, we seek to understand:
- Are participants able to easily navigate to various tools within the My HealtheVet portal using the proposed secondary navigation designs?
- How does the two-portal context impact participants' understanding of the secondary nav and each of its options?
- What do participants expect from a "more" label/option in the secondary nav?
- What do participants expect from a "home" label/option in the secondary nav?
- What type of secondary nav header or title helps participants most clearly understand which portal they are currently using?
- If only 2 or 3 tools can be visible at once on the smallest screens (in addition to home and more), which would be best to show to help participants understand where they are?

## Technical needs
To conduct this research, participants will need to:
- Have access to all pages that are currently linked to from the landing page including the national portal's landing page
- Be able to use one or more amended secondary nav(s), including hover state and select state
