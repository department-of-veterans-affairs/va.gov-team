# Research plan for secondary nav expansion study, Jan/Feb 2025

## Background
Insights from MHV’s Adoption study, the Secondary Nav Comparison study, and the MHV Wayfinding study provide evidence that the MHV on VA.gov secondary navigation (abbreviated as “secondary nav” going forward) improves overall user experience of the portal. 

**Specifically, the MHV on VA.gov secondary nav has:**

Improved users’ ability to find the four main health tools (messaging, medical records, medications, and appointments).
Enabled mobile users to have an improved navigational UX that is closer to the desktop UX.
Facilitated users’ understanding of each page of MHV on VA.gov as part of an overall portal where users can manage their health care.

However, these past studies have also identified continued navigational problems within the MHV on VA.gov portal:

Health tasks that are not covered by the main four health tools currently highlighted in the secondary are still too hard to find (i.e. ordering medical supplies, getting reimbursed for travel).
Users coming from the previous portal experience are confused by the My HealtheVet label and link within the secondary nav (which leads to the landing page), expecting it to take them back to the older portal.

This research is intended to start to answer the question: how might we scale the secondary nav to improve on both of these navigational difficulties? 

### OCTO Priorities
This research supports the following OCTO priorities:

1. Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.
2. Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA.
3. Our people are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make sustained impact.

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

### Research Goals
This research aims to evaluate proposed design concepts that introduce modifications to the current MHV secondary nav with participants using both desktop and mobile designs. Moving forward in this document, we will refer to these proposed design concepts as “expanded secondary nav”.

### Outcome
This study will assess how Veterans engage with an expanded secondary nav, focusing specifically on the continued navigational weaknesses present in the portal. Findings from this research will guide the optimization of the navigation structure, identify usability challenges, and offer insights to improve the experience, ultimately making it easier for Veterans to navigate the tools and services they rely on for their health.

### Research questions
* How does an expanded secondary nav impact users’ go-to strategies for finding tools and tasks not obviously found within the 4 main tool secondary nav? 
* What are Veteran’s mental models for where certain health-related tasks should appear in the portal or on VA.gov?
* How do changes to the link and label for the MHV landing page impact users’ expectations for where that link will lead them, as well as users’ interest in clicking it?
* What challenges do users encounter while attempting to use the proposed designs?

### Hypotheses
* The expanded secondary nav will allow Veterans to complete key health tasks more efficiently, with faster access to tools, fewer clicks, and reduced navigation time.
* Even with the expanded secondary nav, Veterans will still expect to complete certain tasks using tools that do not offer those affordances.
* The addition of a “home” label and icon in the secondary nav will make users more interested in clicking the link to arrive at the landing page.
* The addition of a “home” label and icon will also change users’ perception of what they will find on the landing page.

## Method
### Interviews
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. The interviews will focus on evaluative methods, consisting of a combination of tasks and direct questions. Participants will engage with secondary nav designs and the portal overall in prod, meaning that we will need to use the “flipper” to turn on and off different nav experiences to conduct the interviews.

## Recruitment
### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans and we request a 30 min. kickoff meeting with Perigean to clarify recruiting needs.
