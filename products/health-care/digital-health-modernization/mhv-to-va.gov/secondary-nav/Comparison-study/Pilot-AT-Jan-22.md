# Pilot study w AT user (JAWS)

## Participant info
- Jamie Klenetsky Fay
- Accessibility and Content Specialist
- Will be using JAWS to explore prototypes

## Accessibility issues
- Focus in sign on page needs to start with sign in options
- H1 on X-ray results needs to be messaging page: Show how there's a connection between nav and where user has landed
- Horizontal rule was read-out as "separator" in secure messaging
- "Collapsed menu link" in nav indicates there's a submenu when there's not
- Menu tabs over Messages and Medications (should include in tabbing)
- Change "Ankle left 3 views" to say something about "x-rays"
- Hit tab from breadcrumbs on lab and test results and it skips all the other links on the screen (have something at the ankle link)
- Message needs to say to look at xray results
- "Start scheduling" is also not linked to anything, which is why I'm tabbing past it

## Change to questions
- Before you click on anything, how would you describe what this site is (where you are?)
- Ask about home page
- Don't ask about location and where things should be

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
   
1. What experience do you have with VA.gov (or the VA mobile app)?
hasn't used it before
  
2. _If receive VA health care_: Do you have experience with My HealtheVet? _If participant isn't familiar, don't help them remember, just move on_
Also hasn't used it before

## Tasks for Prototype 1 

### Task 0: Messages - 5 mins 

_Participant arrives on secure messaging page with message from doctor open_
-  Before you click on anything, how would you describe what this site is (where you are?)
   - How do you know? 
-  What if anything is surprising about landing here on this page?
I'm surprised I landed on a page called x-ray results. Would expect to land on a page with my messages. "I think it makes sense to land directly in the message based on the text in the email." Notices that no phone number included even though doctor recommends calling her

### Task 1: Find x-ray - 15 mins
_Medical records > Lab and test results > locate x-ray result for scan of left ankle_

- Before you click anything, I want to hear where you might naturally start looking first?
"I think there'd be an attachment. An image or a PDF or something that would tell me the results. Or maybe there'd be a link to a page with results?"

- And what are you looking for?

- Why focus on this ________ (secondary or primary nav) and not the other?

- Let's talk more in detail about this area (the secondary nav):
  
   - Could you walk me through each of the links laid out here?
     "Home is the home page of a section, I guess it's MHV. But I'm not sure why it's there twice...? 
     
   - Where would you expect to be taken if you clicked that link?
     "I think it would list my records but I'm not sure how it would be sorted. But it would give me access to my medical records somehow, which sounds useful."
     
   - What if anything about finding your way around here seems confusing?
    "It's like there's two home links and I don't really get why but otherwise it was fine to tab through."

- Okay, now go ahead and click around as needed to complete the task of viewing your x-ray images and report. _Guide as needed._
  "Lab and test results. It was recent and a result so I would guess it would be here."
  "I didn't hear anything saying x-rays."
  
- _Once participant arrives_: On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding your x-ray results?
   - Why do you give that rating?
     "Assuming you fix the technical issues, it would be a 4, right? But knowing to do it, I'd give it a 2."
     
- Now that you see where to find your x-rays on this site, what are your thoughts about where it's located on this site??
   - Where would you put it?
  I'd want it just to be linked in that original message. But if that's not an option, then this location is fine. 
     
- If you were on the phone with a friend who is also a Veteran and is looking for this site, how would you explain how to get to this site?
  Once you get into MHV in the menu there's a medical records link, so click on the medical records link. 

### Task 2: Make appointment - 5 mins
_Labs and tests result > Appointments_

- For the next task, imagine that you want to make a follow-up appointment with your doctor. Show me how you'd do that using this website.
  "These must be past appointments." "I'm assuming 'Start scheduling' also doesn't link to anything which is why I can't navigate to."
  
- I'm seeing you gravitate towards ______. Why are you going there first?
  
- What are you looking for?
- _Once participant arrives on Appointments_: On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding where you might schedule an appointment?
   - Why do you give that rating?
   - "I thought that was pretty easy, there's an appt tab and it's the first link on the page to make an appt. I would think like a 4 or a 5. Like maybe I would say 'make an appt' instead of what was it? Start scheduling?"
     
- Now that you see where to schedule an appointment on this site, does its location make sense?
   - Where would it make more sense?

### Task 3: Order CPAP supplies from VA - 5 mins 
_Home > Order CPAP supplies_

- The next task is the final one to complete with this version of the site. Please imagine you need to order CPAP supplies to help you breathe when you are sleeping. Where would you go to order those supplies?
  "I have no idea. I'm remembering that I looked at the home page while I was viewing this. I would guess it's probably on the home page somewhere, but if I wasn't familiar with that home page, I'd have no idea."
  Once on homepage: "There's 6 categories and only 4 links."
  
_Once arrived on CPAP supplies page_
   - _If participant clicked link to get "home": _What did you expect to see when you clicked "My HealtheVet" or "home"?
     "I think what I was reviewing the page, I've internalized it as the home page so I went to the home first. Maybe because I'm so inclined to thinking the home page is on the left side."

   - On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding where to order medical supplies?
   - Why do you give that rating?
     
- Now that you see where to order supplies on this site, does its location make sense?
   - Where would it make more sense?


### Prototype 1 closing questions - 2 minutes
We're going to switch over to looking at the other version of the same site. Before we do that:
- Anything you'd like to share that I haven't asked you about?

-----

## Tasks for Prototype 2 

Okay, I'm getting ready to share the second link with you within the Zoom chat, just like last time. And again, just like last time, when you open the link it'll look like a website but it's just a prototype so you won't see your real information on the screens. I'm sending you the link now:
  - Design A: https://codepen.io/figaro/project/live/dec27c9852d5bc105e841a3d0bc989ff
  - Design B: https://codepen.io/figaro/project/live/63418c9f42aaf22d4c8198d968ce91cf
