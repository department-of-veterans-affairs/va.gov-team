## Warm-up questions
Let’s start with a few questions... 
   
1. What experience do you have with VA.gov (or the VA mobile app)?
      a. Frequency (How often do you login?) 
      b. For what purpose?
   
2. _If receive VA health care_: Do you have experience with My HealtheVet? _If participant isn't familiar, don't help them remember, just move on_
      a. Frequency (How often do you login?) 
      b. For what purpose? 

#### Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, first tap anywhere on the screen, then you should see a row of buttons. In the center is a button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

#### Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:
- Hit Alt S (as in Same); the option should come up to select the window you want to share - please choose Basic. 
- Tab over and confirm that what is selected is "entire screen." 
- Tab once more - make sure "share sound" is checked. 
- Tab 4 times over to "share screen" - click activate. 

Great, now I can see your screen! 

Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.  Now let's go to that website. I can post the URL in the chat or just say it to you. Which of you prefer? 

#### Open prototype
- Thanks for your patience in figuring that out together. In a moment I'll share a link with you in the Zoom chat. Just a reminder: the link will open what appears to be a webpage but it's actually just a prototype (aka a fake website). It might not behave exactly as you'd expect a webpage to behave, and you won't see your name or your own personal information. Okay I'm sending the link now. Go ahead and copy and paste the link in your browser.

## Tasks for Prototype 1 

### Task 0: Messages - 5 mins 

Okay looks like you have the prototype open. I want you to start by imagining that you just received this email. Go ahead and read the email text and follow the prompt.

_If needed_Let's suppose you have to go through the sign-in process. You won't have to during this session but let's pretend for the sake of this session. 

_Participant arrives on secure messaging page with message from doctor open_
- What if anything is surprising about landing here on this page? (Or, is that what you would expect from the link in that email text?)
- Before you click on anything, how would you describe where you landed? (Or, what is this website?)
    - If needed: If you didn't have an email linked here, how would you find it?
    - If needed: If you were talking to a friend, how would you explain getting here?
    - How do you know?
   
#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Where does participant think they landed?
- What are sign posts the participant points to?

### Task 1: Find x-ray - 15 mins
_Medical records > Lab and test results > locate x-ray result for scan of left ankle_

- Next, imagine that you want to look at the images and read the report from your x-rays.
- Before you click anything, I want to hear where you might naturally start looking first? 
- And what are you looking for?
- Okay, now go ahead and click around as needed to complete the task of viewing your x-ray images and report. _Guide as needed._

#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Which nav does the participant gravitate towards first?
- What meaning / signficance do they give the different nav options?
- Which links are they wrong about? Which are confusing?
- Does the participant "start over" or "reset"? Where do they go to do that?
- Does the label for "medical records" seem to fit the task for the participant?
- Back button used?
- Breadcrumbs used?

#### Things to note (mobile)
- Does participant notice dropdown nav?
- Does participant understand abbreviations?

### Task 2: Make appointment - 5 mins
_Labs and tests result > Appointments_

- For the next task, imagine that you want to make a follow-up appointment with your doctor. Show me where you'd go to do that.
- I'm seeing you gravitate towards ______. Why are you going there first?
- What are you looking for?

#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Does participant seem more/less confident than last task?
- Desktop: Do they see the Appointments link right away? Or does it take time? / Mobile: Do they go right to the dropdown nav this time?
- Does the participant "start over" or "reset"? Where do they go to do that?
- Back button used?
- Breadcrumbs used?
- Mobile: If user did not know abbreviations, does that seem to cause obstacles?

### Task 3: Order CPAP supplies from VA - 5 mins 
_Home > Order CPAP supplies_

* M: The next task is the final one to complete with this version of the site. Please imagine you need to order CPAP supplies to help you breathe when you are sleeping. Where would you go to order those supplies?
* **P7: I see refills, and medications or allergies might just list what I'm allergic too...and here we go. Medical supplies...CPAP supplies. So I'll click on that and it looks like I can order by phone or by mail.** 
* M: I'm curious if now eploring this page, does it feel like thes ame website, or does it feel like a different site? 
* **P7: Feels like a different site. It's more basic and there are new words. It feels like a site inside of a site.** 
* M: A site within a site?
* **P7: Yeah, and I guess that works for people of all ages.**
* M: And you said you ezpected this to be under Medications. Could yo usay a little bit more about that? 
* **P7: Yeah, I think I thought that, but maybe I just have to get used to it.** 
* **P7: Maybe if they had a tab that said "last visited" and people coul kind of see what they had clicked last and wouldn't have to remember.** 
* M: Totally, cool. Yeah. I really like that idea. Awesome. 
* M: Could you click back on your browser a couple of times? 
* **P7:** *[clicks back to appointments screen]*
* M: I wanted to. circle bakc to the one that we didn't get to. I'm wondering if now that you've moved around the site if that would be easier for you to do now. 
* **P7:** *[Clicks to My HealtheVet home from breadcrumbs and navigate to Lab & test results links]* 
* M: Before we move on, I'm wondering if these are typical tasks for you. Are these things you've done before on a patient portal? 
* **P7: Never done it before at the VA. I don't really use it a lot. I mainly focus on whether or not my benefits are still there. I haven't really done any x-rays or anything like that. I think back in the day I could see medications and stuff, but I don't really take medications anymore. But I would be able to see okay this is what I have and this is how many refills I have left if this one runs out and stuff like that.** 

### Prototype 1 closing questions - 2 minutes

M: You said before that this was a site within a site. Could you say more about that? 
P7: I'm just saying it looks really bland. I'm not saying it has to be Instagram or anything like that. But when you go to ID.me, that's more exciting. This just...it looks like it's going to deliver some bad news. 
M: [Laughs] Yeah, thank you. 
M: When you say it's a site within a site, where do you think you are? Or if I could rephrase that...what's the relationships between this site and VA.gov? 
P7: I think it's just a branch of it. Things just seem crammed in there ... so... just trying to get everything on that one screen. 
M: What's indicating to you that this is a branch of VA.gov? 

M: You mentioned the My HealtheVet. Do you see that kind of arrow pointing down next to it? [referring to nav bar]. What would you guess that arrow means?

P7: [clicks into it, then responds] It just means it’s a dropdown and here you see medications, appointments, medical records.

M: Okay, great. And on a ascale of 1-5 what would you rate the difficult?

P7: You said one is easy?

M: Yeah

P7: I would say 2.

M: Okay, could you tell me why?

P7: I would say it’s pretty easy to get to the stuff, but there is a lot of hidden things in there, that unless you knew how to click on the arrow to get the dropdown or click the menu to see things. I would probably work better with a couple of tabs at the top where I could click on those that might make it easier for people to see. Or maybe even have it in both places. Kind of like Yahoo you just go there and see the sports section. There’s not a lot of dropdowns they are just there.

M: And you are saying that the My HealtheVet there with the dropdown is not so easy for yo uto find.

P7: Yeah, because iwth the arrow it’s hidden. I’ve been on a lot of sites so I kind of know that but someone older may not know that. They’re just going to click the VA button and go somewhere they probably don’t want to go and now they have to find out how to get back to their lab results.

M: Is there anything we didn’t get to that you want to tell me about this site we looked at?

P7: No, that’s pretty good.

M: Okay great, I’m going to put a new link in the Zoom chat for you to look at.

P7: opens link

M: I just want you to walk me through this and tell me what you’re seeing here on this screen. Is anything different or the same?

P7: Okay, it looks about the same. But it looks like there are these icons now at the top. That’ what I’m talking about with these tabs at the top. IT makes it easier if they were to cal lit in and try to find what they’r eloking for. If they call in someone could help them and say “Hey Mr. Smith, cyou see that little pill bottle at the top? You click on that.” That would be much easier for me.

  

M: Okay, great that’s really helpful.

M: For hte next task, I want to see if it is intuitive for you to try and find your x-ray results.

P7: umm…i am assuming I would click on records. [clicks] and that is just a guess. But I think for the average person, I don’t know if that’s my military records from when I was in the service? But maybe it could say records/labs to make it a little easier. That way you don't have to put a whole nother tab of labs.

M: I love how many ideas you’re offering! That’s awesome.

P7: No problem, just want to make it easier. A lot of people, you know they come to the site and how they grew up they didn’t even have color tv. Yo utell them go to the site, go to the site, adn nwo they gotta log in and find all this stuff. That’s why you use these little tabs it makes it way easier for people to find these things. LIke the little calendar. But for hte records yo ucould either keep that or /labs or something like that.

M: Okay, great very helpful.

M: Okay, next task I want you to go where you would schedule an appointment with your doctor.

P7: [clicks appointments in nav bar] I would just go here and click “start scheduling”

M: Okay, great. The last task is ordering those CPAP supplies.

P7: I would go to medicine, and …oh…hmm

M: Yeah, this page isn’t built out in the prototype. If medications didn’t have what you wanted, where would you go?

P7: umm…I could check records…hmmm…nope. [clicks breadcrumb to go back to My HelatheVet home]

P7: [scrolls down on landing page] okay, Medical supplies…and CPAP supplies. That one was a little more difficult because I would have to know to go to that main screen to find that.

M: Okay, yeah - could yo ugo back a few more times?

P7: Uh huh.

M: On this page you clicked that link on the top that says “Back to My HealtheVet” - did yo uknow what to expect when you clicked that?

P7: I thought I was going back to the main hub area where I might be able to find how to get to that. Like just like Yahoo when I go to the main area I can see how to find the sports, th weather.

M: I’m curious if yo ucould scroll up. Yo usee where it says “My HealtheVet” at the top?

P7: uh huh.

M: I’m curious if you think that is a link or not?

P7: To me, no that is not a link.

M: Okay, that’s helpful.

P7: I probably would hyperlink that or make it a button. I just assume the appointments and meds are actual links but the My HealtheVet I would not assume that is an actual link, it’s just the name of that actual tab [probably means bar?] either make it a link or a rectangular button of its own.

M: That makes sense, awesome.

M: Rate difficulty

P7: 1.

M: Why that rating?

P7: It’s a lot faster. And those tabs - before you even showed me I was saying you need tabs for people to be able to recognize that and feel comfortable clicking on it and it’s not going to do any damage. To me it’s a lot faster for me to get to where I needed to go to.

M: Okay, great.

## Interview closing questions - 5 minutes

M: Do you have any other thoughts?

P7: I would say the second one is the best. whatever you do don’t come out with the first one. Definitely the second one. I’m just thinking about hte customer’s experience if htey had to navigate. Or if the yhad to call and get help, the second one is going to give a better experience.

M: Okay, great. ooops I thiknk you’re breaking up a bit.

P7: I’m here.

M: Great.

M: In this version, there are some abbreviations in that bar. I am wondering about your comfort level or familairity iwth those abbreviations.

P7: You talking about the app? the appointments?

M: Mhmm yeah.

M: Are you familiar wit hthat abbreviation?

P7: Yeha, I thin kwith teh calendar that works and I knew what that meant. I’d probably put reocrds/labs as the second one and put messages as the last one.

M: What is the third one?

P7: My meds? yeah my medications like a pill bottle. That’s kind of a universal symbol people could recognize. I’d make that the second one. Because people probably schedule appointments adn get meds more , and then records, and then message.

M: Is meds an abbreviation you’ve herad before?

P7: Yeah that’s recognizable in different places and stuff.

M: Okay, great. I just have a couple more questions here. I want you to image you are talking to a friend who is also a friend who wants to send a message or schedule an appt with their doctor. How would you descsribe to them how to find this site? Assuming they didn’t get the link in their email like you did.

P7: I would tell them they can go to VA.gov or they can do a Google search for My HealtheVet, you know. And then click on that and then to log in that way. And once the yget there, especially if you do this second prototype, they’ll see where they need to go once they get there. That’s the thing that first minute or tow you can’t find what I’m looking for .I keep bringing up Yahoo and I don’t have those tabs or links that I’m looking for, then Im probably not going to visit it. It’s another site I’m not familiar with and it’s too hard to get in. So it will have less viewership.

M: Is there anything else I didn’t ask you about that you’d like to share?

P7: No thats pretty much it. Like I said you guys want to keep striving to improve the site and keeping it simple and inviting colors are good. Even if you made the little meds icon orange instead of white so I could recognize that. Maybe a green and a red or you know, like one of them is the iPhone color and the other is the Android color. Stuff like that…Appointments, maybe you have some lines in there to show that it is a calendar and not a wall plug for your charger…

M: Oh wow I can totally see that now. It could look like a charger!

P7: Little things like that to make it more recognizable. Records is okay, but so people kind of know and can go to that place. Or if you have enough real-estate to add a couple of more icons above this where labs or x-rays or something else you would want to …maybe people don’t know they have to scroll all the way down here to do that.

M: Thank you so much for everything today. [ends interview]
