Screen sharing instructions: 

M: I just want to explain it to you briefly. So I want you to do is just kind of imagine, you know, you're receiving this email in your typical email inbox.

P: Okay.

M: So what you use Gmail or AOL or Yahoo, you're just receiving this email so you can just go ahead and read it and follow the prompt.

P: Okay.

M: And then I'm assuming you've probably seen this screen before. Okay.

P: I've I've looked at some stuff before. As far as records and things like that.

M: Okay.

P: So.

M: Great. So, yeah, you arrived on the site. I would love exactly what you're doing. Just kind of like look around on this one page before clicking anything. And I'd love to hear Claudine like, if it's at all surprising. That you landed here or if this is the type of thing you'd expect. To land on in that link.

P: No, this is something I would expect. Oh, I just. So. I could. Okay, so. Yeah. I'm looking, that what I'm doing is I'm looking at the screen saying, okay, I can't look at the results. There's no option Is that just something that . 

M: I will ask you shortly to go find them. You're totally spot on. I wanted to ask you, you know, like in in our imagination, you received the link in your email, you click that link signed in and then showed up here.

P: Okay.

M: Is that was that weird at all? Was that like the right order of events?

P: It's not weird at all. Yeah. Oh, actually, when, with my healthy vet.

M: Okay, cool.

P: With secure messaging, the the email I get at Gmail just says I have a new message from my doctor. It doesn't tell me. Any other information except to, to log in to that to check my messages. So I don't know that. The information that you sent like the link would. Show up in my Gmail. So I don't think I would be going through my Gmail. I think I'd still need to log in to the Yeah.

M: Okay, okay, awesome. Yeah, that is really helpful information and exactly what I was asking you for. Thank you. Great. And then it seems like you've mentioned this, but I just want to ask really clearly. How would you describe where you've landed?

P: It looks like I've landed in my in well. A message in my index in the secure messaging section.

M: Okay, cool. And that's you said you've used secure messaging. A good number of times. Okay. So, as you already guessed, next I want you to imagine that your, You wanna look at the images from your x-ray?

P: Yeah.

M: And I'm wondering where you would go to do that. So, and just possible, I'd love to hear your thoughts out loud.

P: Okay.

M: So tell me what you're looking for.

P: About the notification. We're getting now when there's a new secure message. There's an option to, you know, if there's an if you have a new message, will notify you via Gmail. It would be. Gmail would give a little more information. Like, cause I sometimes I go in and I'll send several messages to different doctors and when I get a response, I don't know which one it is and I have to go log in and If I knew that it was like this doctor responding or that doctor is funny, but I don't know if that,

M: Interesting. 

P: Yeah. That's just what I would, would think have you really had to know which doctor would actually respond.

M: Yeah, absolutely. That makes a lot of sense to me. Cool, very helpful comment.

P: So if you were looking for those x-ray images, I'm just curious to know what you. What you're looking for to try to find those.

M: I would go back to the, my main screen on my healthy vet and I believe of all the options.

P: There's one for test results or something of that kind of genre.

M: Okay. Okay, great. Yeah, so feel free you can kind of click around to get where you 

P: Okay. I go to medical records. That's test results. Okay, so I see that ABLE left 3 views is probably the one that the messages are going to.


M: Yeah, exactly. That's kind of the intention.


P: Yeah, and then the EKG microbiology, so yeah.

M: Great. Awesome. And then, I'm gonna give you another task. I want you to, that you need to make a follow-up appointment. So where would you go to do that?

P: Let's see. I'm gonna go back to the just link at the top to start like from the beginning and then go to appointment.

M: Okay.

P: At this point. I would start scheduling and. To see if it was available. The email or the message said, tell a health appointment. I've never tried to do a telehealth appointment. Schedule. I mean, the one in the appointments app part. So. This part would be Not appointment, just that. The video appointment part.

M: Okay. Right. Okay. Yep, that makes sense. Okay, now a third task. I want you to imagine that you need to order CPAP supplies to help you breathe when you're sleeping. Where did you go to order those supplies?

P: Well, the only thing I can think of is under medications because it's something that would be prescribed. I believe, but I don't know that. I don't know what CPU would go through as far as like the Medical supplies.

M: Right. Okay, that makes sense. So let me, oh go ahead, what were you gonna say?

P: Okay. Gonna say so the next thing I would probably do is is go into the secure messages And when you do the dropdown.

M: Okay.

P: We are going to send it to. It gives you a list of people you can send messages to. So. I would probably go in there and see if there was anything there for. Can't remember the I don't look at that. Just that prosthetics. I had to do them for a hand split once. I go in there and see if there's anything in there that looks like it.

M: Okay, cool. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool. It's really, it's really interesting to hear your kind of thought process with that.

So thanks for sharing. How about if I were to ask you, to find where you could get reimbursed for travel.

P: Hmm.

M: also known as like travel pay.

P: I do get, I do get that. So for that, I don't, I usually have to go into the VA site itself. And I actually have a shortcut or a link on my. On my main screen that will get me there, but I'm not sure. How that goes through. The healthy vet, cause normally I can't do it through health yet.

M: Hmm, okay. Yeah. So recently, I, it sounds like you maybe haven't done it just like very, very recently, Recently it was added to my healthy vet.

P: No.

M: Oh, okay.

P: Okay, so, the home option that was there and what's maintenance, messages, medications, medical records. Hey, ments, medical supplies. Oh hey, what do you know? Okay. Okay. Okay. There they are. Yeah.

M: Yeah, I thought it was the first. 3 appointments or appointments, messages, medications and. Records. So now there are options like yeah I haven't seen before. So Okay, so I see where the payments are. I like my name, travel reimbursement.

P: Oh, that link might not work because it's This is just the prototype. Okay, cool.

M: Okay, well I just clicked it. So Yeah, I'm curious to hear, you know, earlier you mentioned something about the mind healthy that main page. Would you call this? My healthevet That main page or is there something else you have in mind?

P: If in the, so at the screen I'm looking at. There's a dark blue ribbon that says Sally with the down arrow. Right under that is my healthy vet with a down arrow. I was clicked on my healthy bed.

M: Hmm, okay.

P: I thought that take me back to where I could start. But the 2 new things just aren't don't happen to be listed under that menu or The flies. And travel reimbursement. So those both were on there. That one would work, but So what I did when I couldn't find it, I just hit the home button underneath. It which brings me to the whole list, but. For this short dropdown, it would be nice because other 2 were on.

P: Yeah, totally. And, Why do you think you thought to click home? That's whenever I can't figure something out, I go, over.

M: Yeah, totally.

P: I think that was linked to like my account, my healthy bed account. So I think the phone would be like the overall healthy that. No, it I guess I don't really See the difference? I mean. If you hadn't asked how to do those 2 things I didn't know about. I probably wouldn't have gone to home. So,
Yeah, I don't think I've ever used phone before because I've always had those 4 things I could do. So.

M: Great. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool. 

Alright, I'm just checking my notes to see if there's anything I missed. I have a few questions to kind of wrap up looking at this version of the site before we switch over to the second one.

P: Okay.

M: And so I just wanted to ask you to give me a rating. So on a scale of one to 5, one being easy, 5 being difficult. How would you rate the difficulty of finding what what you're looking for in this site in this version of the site.

P: I'm thinking between 3 and 4 because The menu, the dropdown menu I usually use doesn't have the The travel or the supply. So If I, if it was late in the day and. My rain fog was rolling in. Be able to figure it out. And I would probably. Get really frustrated.

M: Okay. Right, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, great. Is there anything I haven't asked you about With this. Version that you'd like to share.

P: Let me just go through. Let me see that. I know, I think. Cause I'm just going through all the other things on it. And Okay. So, you know, I can't really think of anything else that I would I would do when I go online other than those things. So. No, that. I don't think that's it.

M: Okay, great. So I'm just gonna grab the second link.

P: Okay.

M: And just like last time, I'm gonna put it in the chat. I'll let you know once I sent it.

**gets link**

M: Okay, so, I'm sure some of this looks familiar again since we were just in a similar place.

P: Right.

M: Is anything standing out as being different at all?

P: The main thing is under my healthy vet you have the little icons.

M: Okay.

P: Appointments messages, meds and records. Which is what I'm used to having on my healthy bed. So, but just not in that. I don't like it's a little easier. For me, cause you know. My vision is not great and even with my glasses sometimes I have to squint and I still hit the road.

M: Okay, sure.

P: I like the little icons.

M: Okay, great. That's good to hear. Okay, so just like last time, I'd like you to go about, locating your x-ray images.    

P: And they're not enough on that, where the icons are for extra images. So.

M: Okay.

P: to me it's all down and see if there's anything down there. You know, okay, so. And I'm gonna hit them my healthy bet again. And see where that, okay, that brings me back. Okay. Okay, there we go. Oh my god, I'm not. I get brain fog. I think it's setting in. Records. Yeah. Yeah.

M: And then next again, I'll have you go through to make an appointment. So where would you go to do that?

P: Okay, I would go back up to that. Many of the icons. Appointments. And then, I would go to start. I don't know if it'll work, but I would go to start scheduling. And, Let me do that. Does that one work?

M: Oh no, I don't think it does work. So yeah. And then lastly, where you would go to order.

P: Because I already know that that's available on my healthy vet, but just not listed with the. For original items. Click on the might help you that in Lincoln. Lighter blue ribbon. And then scroll down. To medical supplies and equipment.

M: Okay. And I'm curious, So with this, a version, you get something kind of interesting where At first, you click to go to the My Healthy.

P: Right.

M: Back home page, the page that you're currently on to find, And then it for whatever reason you decided instead to use the the blue bar with the icons. I'm curious kind of how you're making those decisions, you know, to use to use those blue icons or to use the homepage.

P: Yeah. Well, I started just going to my healthy bet and then scrolling down because I had it in my head that records was one of the recently added ones.

M: Oh, okay.

P: Or supplies So, the scrolling I realized, oh shoot, it's already up there. So then I went back to the icon. But I could have gone through it the other way as well. I just. Went back to what would have been the most direct route. By going back to where the icons are

M: Okay, yeah. And then, you also clicked that my healthy vet right under VA. And I was wondering if you're able to describe that all, what about that to you indicates that it's clickable?

P: Well, I just learned over time that A lot of the wording in websites. If you click on it, it'll take you to that. To like some kind of homepage like If I click on the VA, I think it would take me to the VA.

M: Okay.

P: And I've come across the same thing and other. Web sites for other companies. And if I just can't find something, I just. Or if I get too far into the like the menu tree. I just click on that, it'll take me back to. Like a start start page or home page. So that something from experience. Okay. Right. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And then, you know, in this context where you're on my healthy vet doing things like making appointments or looking at your medical records.


M: Would you expect, I'm curious like if you would expect to go to like home on like a mine helping that home versus like a VA home, you know, you mentioned that as kind of like a starting over place to.

P: Yeah. When I clicked in my healthy vet, I, I look at that just being home for. Well, the might help you vet cage that will give me the different options that I can select as far as. Tasks I can do. And at the top of my head, I can't remember, but I think when I first log in. On the site that I use now. And the ribbon across the top that will list like appointments, prescriptions, and you click on one of those because the first page that comes up is kind of a general health information. Oh, just, you know, from past experience. I know I'm gonna go to that page and then I need to click on whatever. Item it is that I want to take care of.

M: Okay, okay, great. That makes sense. Okay. The scale of one to 5, one being easy 5 being difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of, finding what you're looking for on this version.

P: Okay. Well, it those other 2 icons are up there. Or the travel and supplies. Probably like a [missed]

M: Okay, if the other icons were up there.

P: Yeah, because you look at that and you know if you sometimes you've been like Scroll to And the other one will come up. And actually would probably be better if they were all on, because the way my screen is, you know, all 4 are listed across the top. If when this stream came up, all 6 options were up there. With that, scroll to the right or left, that would be very helpful.

M: Okay.

P: I might look at that and just assume those are the only 4 things if I don't think about trying to throw to the right to see if there's anything else.

M: Right. Yeah. Okay, cool. And then. I'm curious to, oh well, I, you, used that kind of, language of, you know, if there were these other icons, it would be a for. What would you read it, you know, with just as it currently is?

P: Probably a 4. I don't know if the icons make it seem less confusing to me, even though they don't have the other 2 And That it just Because since I know the options that are there. And the one I want isn't up there I would just from habit go back to the might healthy bet like on that.

M: What else might come up on that page, to show other things. There might just be a link to or a little.

Yeah, blurb about you know you could also do travel pay through whatever you know something like that so



P: But having them all right up there. In that kind of Really helps. Even without the other 2.
Yeah. Okay. Right. Okay. And then, Yeah, I'd like to hear more kind of like. As your thoughts kind of comparing and contrasting these 2, like now that you've seen both of them. Okay.

M: Do you think of one as easier?

P: Can I go back to the other one?

M: Yeah, I think you should be able to. Well, it looks like you only have one tab, so you might need to go back to the chat to get the other link.

P: Trying to add another tab, but here. So. Oh, got ready to get it.

M: Oh, funny. It must just kind of write over it.

P: I. Yeah, I guess I can't it didn't see the second tab that I opened up.

Okay. To me, the screen is kind of busy and just with a lot of information that I ignore.

M:  Okay.

P:  So. I've got a habit of ignoring it. So. The only thing I would basically go to is the my healthy vet sign in.

M: Absolutely. Anything else on it? Is that a concern?

P: So. And that takes me to the message like the other one did.

Okay. I'm trying to see. Okay, so then this. I was thinking when I clicked that it was gonna take me to the very first one. Let me go back. Okay. So that one takes me to the busy screen. This one takes me. Right. So if I'm So with the with the second one it looks like it takes me straight to the message without having to log in if I click that link. But the first.

M: Oh yeah, mainly just because you work, it's kind of like. Already job of telling you your kind of 


P: So that maybe that's why I also like the second one better because I didn't have to go through. First menu of that what I what I consider the But if that screen would if I hadn't already had a session going.

M: Totally, yeah.

P: If that screen came up first. Yeah, so that's kind of hard to compare because This one is just the way I was already logged in. It's a lot more straightforward. It's right to the and

M:  Let me sense. And I actually, while we're here, I wanna just ask you real quick. In this version, there's some abbreviated. Items in that ribbon, the lighter blue ribbon. And I'm just wondering about your familiarity with those.

P: I always use APPT for appointment, PTS for appointments and. My family's gotten used to it when I send a text.

M: Okay. 

P I have so It's just something I've always used that abbreviation. I think I actually started using it back in the eighties when I worked the vet for a while. Cause that's how we abbreviated appointments there. So. It makes sense to me, but only I've been using it for years, so.

M: Oh, okay.

P: And then meds, I mean, Med's is meds. I mean all this all the Words you have up there, appointments, messages, meds and records. To me, I know what I'm, so. But again, that's just because that's kind of the. The verbal or the abbreviations I've used for a long time. So. I. Like out in the text appointments or medication. So. It's just easier. So I recognize him that way.

M: Okay, cool. That's really helpful. Okay, is there anything I haven't asked you about that you'd want to share with me about anything you've seen here today.

P: Just the bottom part that I'm looking at right now. And BA programs and re services. It just it doesn't show the whole thing. I mean it it gets cut off. On my screen, but it might be the resolution I have. So the Veterans, Services kind of dropped off at the beginning, but I can kind of figure out what.

M: Okay.

P: What they are basically.

M: = But still not ideal.

P: I don't know if there's anything further over to the right because I Leave it over there. Although, oh, there we go. So, okay, so see with the way I chatted, I couldn't see the in crisis talk to someone now. Okay, so that whole column. I could not see on my. Phone. But normally when I can't see something like that on the phone, I can just kind of Scroll to the left and Yeah, I don't. Okay, yeah, so that's good. Now it shows part of it.

M: Hmm, yeah, that is weird. It just must be coded weird. So, We'll have that so it's easier for people kind of zoom in a little bit.

P:  Yeah, cause I'm, I'm, I'm zoomed out as far as I can go to see it. So. But I think this also might be something. Particularly with the settings I have on my phone is sometimes I come across websites that I have to go to the landscape mode. I think, and but not on everyone. So I think it's just like, said maybe the way they're coded and the way my My phone is not up so

M: Yeah, and also, another thing to remember too is this isn't the actual like website. This is just a prototype. So chances are this prototype is coded a little differently the web and then the website and that's what's causing the issues.

P:  Well, that's the thing I, I could think of down there. Everything else. Thank you.

M:  Cool.

P: There. What's under the menu? I click it and there's nothing there. What would be there? Yeah, I was kind of surprised that it didn't open. When you clicked it because I thought it was supposed to. 

M: But let me ask you first, what would you expect to be there?

P: Any other options that aren't listed in that ribbon? It would be, most. Most frequently used or. After by people going on to the to the website.

M: Hmm, yeah.

P: And I just go to the menu to see what other options there are because something we're surprised. Oh, I can do that here too.

M: Right.

P: So, I mean, it might just be a duplicate of the appointments messages in that, but. Yes, I tend to do the menu.

M: Yeah, yeah, so that menu to answer your question. You know, typically when you're using VA.gov on a mobile device and it's getting kind of skinnier in width. This is the menu that has kind of like all the different types of benefits within it. So if you were looking, if you were looking on it, at it on a desktop, it wouldn't say menu, I think it would say like VA benefits and healthcare or something.

P: : Oh, okay.


M: And you could look through there for all the different benefits.

P: Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah.

M: I'm really cool to hear your thoughts about that though, so I'm glad you point it out.

P: Yeah, I just. I mean, sometimes it's, you know, what's already on the screen, so.

And it's just when the menu just list things that are already right there in front of you and your base, if it had other things on there.


P: And I like the way. Okay. Remember the other Great, but. Cause insecure messaging the way I do it now or the way I have done it. In the few months ago. Insecure messaging, you're only in secure messaging. So then you have to exit secure messaging to get back to the healthy. Where all the options are. So I like that I can just go straight up from. You know, reading the email. And then, okay, let me just go up here and click appointments. It's a lot, you know, streamline because it's right. There, I don't have to go looking. Okay, now where do I find that again? Right there. As the secure messaging when I first started using it. Notice, not a standalone one, but you had to. Even when you logged in to the healthy vet website, then you had to get another login to get into your messaging. And then you were while you're in secure messaging. The other page might time out. So. By the time you got by the time I would get finished typing my message, I would lose it because the other the main screen had timed out with. As the message, the secure messaging was on a separate tab. So.

M: Oh, I see. Oh, that sounds so frustrating.

P: Yeah. It was. So. Yeah. Yeah. I bet. And I take a long time to to write things just because my I have to process things and try to. Make sure that they make sense to somebody else reading it? Cause it makes sense to me, but you know. I don't always come across very clearly. So. Just being able to go straight from. The message that Dr. Smith sent. About okay I can look at my test results oh a part of their records okay and then schedule appointment oh right there with appointments That's awesome.

M:  Cool. Great. That's good to hear. Okay, cool.

P: I like that.

M: Well, I'm glad that your Wi-Fi work their whole session because this is so This was really helpful. So thank you so much for taking the time.
And I hope the other rest of your day.
