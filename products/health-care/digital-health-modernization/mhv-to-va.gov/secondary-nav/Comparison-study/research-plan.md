# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov secondary navigation comparison research, January/February 2024

## Background
Findings from [recent wayfinding research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-10-MHV-secondary-navigation-research) on the MHV portal imply the following:
1. MHV users will benefit from navigation that allows them to move between tools;
2. MHV users struggle to notice and make use of secondary navigation when it is condensed into a dropdown.

This study aims to give us a sense of what type of between-tool navigation will be most intuitive for users to notice, access, and make use of when completing health management tasks on mobile and desktop devices.

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online.
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
The purpose of this research is to assess and compare participants' ability to navigate the health portal using two distinct navigation concepts, both on mobile and desktop (total of 4 designs in all). 

### Outcome
This research will inform us on how Veterans use different navigation designs to complete health management tasks and will provide direction on the next iteration of secondary navigation on the My HealtheVet portal. 

### Research questions
* Are participants able to easily navigate to various tools within the My HealtheVet portal using the proposed secondary navigation designs?
* Can participants navigate to health-related tools that are not specifically named within the secondary navigation designs? 
* How does a secondary navigation within the health portal impact participants' understanding of place within the VA.gov digital ecosystem? 
 
### Hypotheses 
* Participants will benefit from a fully visible secondary navigation (as opposed to navigation items condensed into a dropdown) to solve most navigation needs for the My HealtheVet portal. 
* The navigation bar will provide a sense of place within the portal.
* The navigation bar will promote the understanding that the portal is a central location to perform common health-management tasks such as sending messages to their healthcare providers, accessing health records, managing and ordering prescriptions, and booking appointments. 

## Method
### Interviews
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. The interviews will consist of a combination of tasks and direct questions.

## Recruitment
### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans and we request a 30 min. kickoff meeting with Perigean to clarify recruiting needs. 

Possible meeting times for a kick-off: 
* Thursday, Jan 18, 9-1 eastern (ideally) or 2-5 eastern
* Let me know if you need more time options! 

We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information in an encrypted Excel file on the VA Network.
