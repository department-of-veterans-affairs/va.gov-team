This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholders/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes 

Note: We will gather numbers for appropriate findings during final synthesis

## Initial Findings

**Research question 1**

1. Participants’ ability to navigate easily and quickly to the four main tools of the health portal - Medications, Appointments, Secure Messaging, and Medical Records - was significantly improved when they were not required to open a dropdown to navigation on mobile devices. 
<br />

2. Most participants (on mobile) found the persistent navigation/icon design (Prototype B) easier to navigate within the health portal compared to the collapsible menu (Prototype A). 
   - Participants noticed and utilized the persistent navigation/icon design to navigate the health portal. 
   - Participants struggled, for a variety of reasons, with the collapsed navigation (Prototype A). 
     - Some participants did not seem to notice the menu 
     - Some participants did not come back to the menu after engaging with it 
   - A couple of the participants stated that persistent navigation/icon design (Prototype B) was “much improved” and “significantly easier.” 
<br />

3. The majority of participants did not differentiate between desktop designs. However, further analysis is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of using  “Home” (Prototype A) rather than  “My HealtheVet” (Prototype B) as a means of returning to the My HealtheVet landing page. 
<br />

4. Most participants did not recognize the "My HealtheVet" link text as clickable in Prototype B on both mobile and desktop designs which hindered their discovery and exploration of the landing page.
   - Some participants found alternative routes to the MyHealtheVet landing page (e.g. breadcrumbs). 
<br />

5. Some participants utilized the breadcrumb with “Back” text on tool landing pages as a strategy to navigate to the My HealtheVet home landing page. 
   - Most of these participants were able to complete the tasks.
   - This does not seem to affect their ability to succeed in tasks negatively. 
<br />

6. Participants did not seem to notice or be impacted by the use of abbreviations on mobile with the persistent navigation/icon design (Prototype B). 
   - Participants quickly engaged with abbreviated labels with little hesitation. 
   - When asked about the meaning of each icon, all participants correctly identified the tool names and accurately anticipated the types of information associated with each icon. 
   - One participant who utilized assistive technology heard “apps” when reading “appts” but was still able to complete appropriate tasks.  
<br />

**Research Question 2**

7. The navigation bar (on mobile and desktop) contributed to a strong "sense of place” for most participants. 
   - Most participants were aware they were within a health portal.
   - Few participants navigated to the global header as their first instinct to complete tasks with either prototype. 
   - Participants did not clearly distinguish between My HealtheVet and VA.gov 
   - When participants did veer to other navigation options (e.g., main VA.gov menu) they were mostly isolated to mobile sessions (Prototype A) 

**Research Question 3**

8. All participants struggled to complete tasks outside of the health portal/not specifically named within the secondary navigation (e.g., Order CPAP supplies/file a claim for travel reimbursement). 
   - Participants may have perceived the four navigation links as the only options, especially on Prototype B, in which an important 5th option (navigating to the My HealtheVet land page) was not seen as a link. 
   - The association of CPAP supplies with Medications was clear among all participants. Even when participants successfully navigated to the landing page, they did not always scroll to find CPAP supplies, choosing instead to stop at the Medications box.  
   - When Travel pay was introduced as an alternative task, participants did not demonstrate a clear connection to any of the four tools but continued to struggled to complete the task. 

## Other takeaways 

9. All participants attempted to locate CPAP supplies under Medications 
   - Participants associated needing a prescription with CPAP supplies and therefore looked under Medications. 
   - Participants may have also perceived the four navigation links as the only options during the study.  

10. Most participants expected an intermediate landing page (a broader landing page where they could choose where to go) before arriving on a specific secure message.  
    - Several participants seem confused about coming into My HealtheVet through a side door (an email). Further analysis is needed if it was the narrative around the study or the mental model of participants (email from My HealtheVet > landing page experience first).
