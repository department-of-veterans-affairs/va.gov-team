      b. For what purpose? 
   
### Screen sharing instructions - 5-10 minutes**

Thanks for answering those questions. I want to transition us to exploring the different sites together. First I want you to share your screen. Is that something you've done before?

#### Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, first tap anywhere on the screen, then you should see a row of buttons. In the center is a button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

#### Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:
- Hit Alt S (as in Same); the option should come up to select the window you want to share - please choose Basic. 
- Tab over and confirm that what is selected is "entire screen." 
- Tab once more - make sure "share sound" is checked. 
- Tab 4 times over to "share screen" - click activate. 

Great, now I can see your screen! 

Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.  Now let's go to that website. I can post the URL in the chat or just say it to you. Which of you prefer? 

#### Open prototype
- Thanks for your patience in figuring that out together. In a moment I'll share a link with you in the Zoom chat. Just a reminder: the link will open what appears to be a webpage but it's actually just a prototype (aka a fake website). It might not behave exactly as you'd expect a webpage to behave, and you won't see your name or your own personal information. Okay I'm sending the link now. Go ahead and copy and paste the link in your browser.

## Tasks for Prototype 1 

### Task 0: Messages - 5 mins 

Okay looks like you have the prototype open. I want you to start by imagining that you just received this email. Go ahead and read the email text and follow the prompt.

_If needed_Let's suppose you have to go through the sign-in process. You won't have to during this session but let's pretend for the sake of this session. 

_Participant arrives on secure messaging page with message from doctor open_
- What if anything is surprising about landing here on this page? (Or, is that what you would expect from the link in that email text?)
- Before you click on anything, how would you describe where you landed? (Or, what is this website?)
    - If needed: If you didn't have an email linked here, how would you find it?
    - If needed: If you were talking to a friend, how would you explain getting here?
    - How do you know?
   
#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Where does participant think they landed?
- What are sign posts the participant points to?

### Task 1: Find x-ray - 15 mins
_Medical records > Lab and test results > locate x-ray result for scan of left ankle_

- Next, imagine that you want to look at the images and read the report from your x-rays.
- Before you click anything, I want to hear where you might naturally start looking first? 
- And what are you looking for?
- Okay, now go ahead and click around as needed to complete the task of viewing your x-ray images and report. _Guide as needed._

#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Which nav does the participant gravitate towards first?
- What meaning / signficance do they give the different nav options?
- Which links are they wrong about? Which are confusing?
- Does the participant "start over" or "reset"? Where do they go to do that?
- Does the label for "medical records" seem to fit the task for the participant?
- Back button used?
- Breadcrumbs used?

#### Things to note (mobile)
- Does participant notice dropdown nav?
- Does participant understand abbreviations?

### Task 2: Make appointment - 5 mins
_Labs and tests result > Appointments_

- For the next task, imagine that you want to make a follow-up appointment with your doctor. Show me where you'd go to do that.
- I'm seeing you gravitate towards ______. Why are you going there first?
- What are you looking for?

#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Does participant seem more/less confident than last task?
- Desktop: Do they see the Appointments link right away? Or does it take time? / Mobile: Do they go right to the dropdown nav this time?
- Does the participant "start over" or "reset"? Where do they go to do that?
- Back button used?
- Breadcrumbs used?
- Mobile: If user did not know abbreviations, does that seem to cause obstacles?

### Task 3: Order CPAP supplies from VA - 5 mins 
_Home > Order CPAP supplies_

- The next task is the final one to complete with this version of the site. Please imagine you need to order CPAP supplies to help you breathe when you are sleeping. Where would you go to order those supplies?
- _If participant struggles, watch and wait_: Now that you've explored ____ a little bit, what do you think it's for?

- _Once arrived on CPAP supplies page_: How did you know to go there? What did you expect to find?
- Are you still on the same site you started on? How do you know?

#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Does participant seem more/less confident than last task?
- Do they look to the secondary nav right away this time?
- What else does the participant click on or hover over before clicking on the "correct" link?
- Does the participant "start over" or "reset"? Where do they go to do that?
- Back button used?
- Breadcrumbs used?
- Mobile: If user did not know abbreviations, does that seem to cause obstacles?

### Prototype 1 closing questions - 2 minutes
We're going to switch over to looking at the other version of the same site. Before we do that:
- Are these types of tasks things you've done before? Tell me more.
- I noticed that you clicked / didn't click "menu" at the top right. What would you guess that is for? If you did click it, what would you expect to see?
- How about the button or area labeled "Sally"?
- On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding what you were looking for in that site we just explored together?
    - Why that rating? 
- Anything you'd like to share that I haven't asked you about?

## Tasks for Prototype 2 

Okay, I'm getting ready to share the second link with you within the Zoom chat, just like last time. And again, just like last time, when you open the link it'll look like a website but it's just a prototype so you won't see your real information on the screens. I'm sending you the link now:

## Interview closing questions - 5 minutes

Thank you for your patience and for going through those tasks again using this second version of the site. You can close out the web browser and stop sharing your screen. I just have a few final questions to ask you:

- Now that you've seen both of these approaches to managing your healthcare - what are your thoughts about them?
- Did you find one version easier than another to use? Why? What about it?
- If you were talking to a friend that is also a Veteran and wanted to explain to them how to find this site on the web, what would you say?
- If you were talking to a friend that is also a Veteran who wanted to use these tools, how would you describe the relationship between this site and the VA.gov?
- Anything I didn't ask you about that you want to share about your experience?
