# Product Outline: Secondary Navigation for MHV-on-VA.gov

## Outcome Summary
> *Brief statement describing opportunity you're pursuing e.g. "Increase Use of Search Tools on VA.gov." Include measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to affect.*
* Improve Veterans' understanding that health tools are available within MHV-on-VAgov, so that they are less likely to look for health care-related tools in unauthenticated areas of VAgov (e.g. the megamenu).

## Problem

Research has shown two important things about how Veterans use health care tools (eg secure messaging):
1. Veterans are very used to the MHV National Portal and have found ways to navigate it
2. Veterans tend to lose their way when completing tasks within MHV-on-VAgov, straying into unauthenticated areas of VAgov and getting lost.

By the end of Q3, 2024, millions of Veterans will be trying to use the new health care tools on VAgov because the National Portal is being sunsetted. We need to design a more coherent experience for the MHV tools, so that Veterans are able to stay within MHV tools if they want. (But they can still benefit from integration with the rest of VAgov if they choose to.)

Our proposed solution is a secondary nav â€“Â i.e., secondary to the VAgov header/mega-menu.

## Desired User Outcomes

- Users are able to easily find their way among health tools to complete tasks (eg., message a provider, schedule an appointment)
- Users are able to easily access other experiences on VAgov if they want them
- Users understand that they need to get back to the MHV-on-VAgov area if they want to use health tools

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Users look for health care tasks in the mega-menu
- Users go to unauthenticated areas of VAgov without realizing it


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Support load is minimized across transition from MHV national portals (MHV and Oracle) to VAgov â€“Â e.g., call center
- Providers feel transition is sustainable

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Veterans "reject" MHV-on-VAgov (opt out while they still have that option)
- Providers/health care staff exhibit added strain or burnout due to increased burden

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
> ðŸ’¡ *VA.gov products measure success against Ease of use, Service Completion, Trust/Satisfaction, Health.*<sup>1</sup>\
> ðŸ’¡ *Identify balancing metrics to ensure you're not bringing about undesired outcomes.*

- Product KPI | Baseline | Target | Link to data source (e.g. GA, Domo)

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - On mobile, users may not interact with hidden components because they don't notice them
  - On mobile, users may get confused by visual similarity of any hidden menu options
  - On mobile, a persistent navigation at the top of the page could make pages harder to use
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
- **Accessibilty risks**
  - Adding a second navigation structure will introduce challenges for tab order and screen reader order
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: 
    - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements
