# Research Goals

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Participants to access their health information. As part of this effort, MyHealtheVet (MHV) will be replatformed to VA.gov. We developed a prototype of what MHV on VA.gov could look like on mobile devices, which we are testing as part of this research. This study will build off of the results of our [informal user testing](https://github.com/department-of-Participants-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-guerilla-test-12-2021/2021-12-guerilla-research-report.pdf), conducted in December 2021 and our [Round 1 testing with a desktop prototype]( ), conducted in March 2022. 

The goals of this study are to:
- Determine if participants understand the concept of MHV on VA.gov as a centralized place to access healthcare
- Identify major usability or content issues with our current concept of replatforming MHV on VA.gov 
- Evaluate if participants are able to use the current prototype on a mobile device (currently 50% of users access MHV from a mobile device)

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following objectives:
- Participants can manage their health services online
- Participants and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Participant Journey

This research fits into these points of a Participant's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging


# Research Questions

This research will help us answer:
- Will participants understand the concept of a centralized place for their healthcare as shown in this design? 
- How would Participants expect to get to the healthcare information?
- What would they expect to see in their My Health landing page if they were logged in? Not logged in?
- Will participants be able to accomplish the main health tasks related to appointments, secure messaging, pharmacy, and medical records with this design?
- What is the participant perception of how the health apartment would fit into how they manage their health at the VA?
- Can participants smoothly use the proposed navigation for MHV on a mobile device?


# Methodology 

We conducted eleven remote hour-long moderated usability studies using a high fidelity Sketch prototype. This round of research focused on the mobile experience. 


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

- Participants will easily understand the idea of a centralized place where they can access their VA healthcare information.
	- *Mostly True*. Participants understood our prototype to be a centralized place to access their healthcare information, and some understood it would include their other non-healthcare benefits.
- Participants will expect a personalized experience if logged in, such as their specific prescriptions, appointments, or information relevant to their care.
	-  *Definitely True*. Participants expected to see their personal data populate if logged in.
- Participants will be able to accomplish a variety of health tasks as designed in this prototype.
	- *Mostly True*. Participants were able to complete the majority of our tasks successfully, but we did identify some areas for improvement with specific tasks and concepts. 
- Participants will be able to smoothly use the proposed navigation for MHV on a mobile device.
	-  *Mostly True*. Participants navigated successfully through the higher levels of the IA but struggled with navigating within specific pages.


# Key Findings

1. Many participants (5/9) were able to successfully navigate from the primary  page to secondary pages and back using the breadcrumbs; however, they struggled with the navigation within secondary pages. 

2. Participants were able to successfully complete many basic health-related tasks.

3. Participants were confused about certain terms, including "Pending," "Blue Button,” and “Adverse Reactions.”

4. Participants did not find the pre-appointment paperwork under the "Pre-check in" link in the "In This Section" menu.


# Details of Findings 

**1. Many participants (5/9) were able to successfully navigate from the primary page to secondary pages and back using the breadcrumbs; however, they struggled with the navigation within secondary pages.** 

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, DSC: Breadcrumbs

4 participants said they would use the back button. In the previous round of research with a desktop prototype participants were confused by the navigation breadcrumbs but the secondary navigation on the left side of the worked well.

> There is a MyHealtheVet with a back arrow I would click on that. (P1, Veteran)


**2. Participants were able to successfully complete many basic health-related tasks.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, PRDT: Medical-records, MHV: Pharmacy, MHV: Secure Messaging, MHV: Appointments

The tasks they completed include refilling their medications, sending their providers a message, viewing their medical records, making an appointment, and viewing details about an existing appointment. This was true in the desktop (Round 1) and the mobile (Round 2) prototype.

> I would click on the appointment details and get everything I need. (P6, Veteran)


**3. Participants were confused about certain terms, including "Pending," "Blue Button,” and “Adverse Reactions.”**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, DSC: Labels

50% of users knew what Blue Button was depending on if they had used it before; this was similar to the previous round.  None of the participants understood that a Pending appointment is an appointment that has been requested by a Veteran but not yet confirmed by the VA. Of the 5 participants that gave details about what they would expect in the “Allergies and Adverse Reactions” section, 3 expected to see the general potential side effects of medications instead of specific reactions that they have had to a medication.

> Allergies and adverse reactions. I am guessing you can put in the medication, and it would give you the possible adverse reactions. (P1, Veteran) 


**4. Participants did not find the pre-appointment paperwork under the "Pre-check in" link in the "In This Section" menu.**

Labels: PRDT: health-care-apartment, PRDT: health-care-check-in

When asked where they would expect to find the link, participants expected to find it under Appointment Details or in their Messages. In the previous desktop design users also did not expect to find their paperwork under the Pre-check in link, but the link was more discoverable because it was in the side navigation and so more of them saw it.

> [Pre-check-in] could be in the details tab. Right here on the phone I should be able to fill it out. (P15, Veteran)


# Additional Insights

- Most users (10/11) logged in using the embedded sign in/create an account button.  In the previous round of testing with the desktop prototype users saw both options. 
- Some users did not see the difference between health tool content and the VA.gov header, menu, and footer.
- Users understood prescription statuses, such as in process, renew soon, and in transit. In the previous round users struggled with this aspect of the pharmacy tool.
- 9 of 11 participants found or commented on the ability to search messages.  This is an improvement from 6 of 11 participants in the previous round.


# Recommendations

* Explore the feasibility of changing the language on the “In this section” menu to help Veterans know what to expect inside the menu and to help Veterans understand the differences between health navigation and Va.gov navigation.
* Adopt the naming convention of VA.gov and Heath Homepage in the breadcrumbs.
* Coordinate with other teams working on appointment scheduling to find language that is clearer to Veterans than “Pending” appointments.
* Consider what the pre-checkin experience should be going forward.  In both the desktop and mobile prototypes participants expected tools to be linked, for example they expected to see pre-checkin paperwork in their appointment details because the paperwork is related to a specific appointment.
* Continue to pay attention to pharmacy label text in future rounds, participants struggled with it in the desktop prototype but it tested well in the mobile prototype.
* Continue with both the login button and the login link as they tested well on mobile and desktop.



# Next Steps

Our next steps are to bring these findings to our design team and iterate on our prototype. We will incorporate these recommendations into our next round of usability testing, which will be focused on messaging.

## Who we talked to 

**Recruitment criteria**
Our primary criteria was participants who do and do not have VA Healthcare, and who do and do not use MHV on their smartphone. We used a lean but representative approach for most criteria, but overrepresented participants with cognitive disabilities. Our goal was to ensure our designs worked with the participants most likely to have a difficult time interacting with a complex website. Our previous round had included fewer women than we had hoped so we overrepresented women in this round.  We also included a significant number of smart phone users as they would be most likely to use the website on their smart phones once it is released.
