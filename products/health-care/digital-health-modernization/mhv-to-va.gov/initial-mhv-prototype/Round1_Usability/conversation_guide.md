## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauryl and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to show you some early ideas related to accessing and managing your VA healthcare online.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a Demo.** This is a demo and not a live website, parts may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Just let me know what you'd expect to happen in that case. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5-10 minutes
- Do you have healthcare through the VA? How do you interact with your healthcare? How would you like to?
- Do you have other benefits through the VA? How do you manage your benefits? How would you like to manage your benefits?
- Have you used MyHealtheVet? If Yes, how often do you use it? What do you use it for? What would you change about MHV?
- Do you use secure messaging now? What for? How often? What would you change about it?
- [have participant open up a browser] You got an email from the VA that there's a new way to look at all your healthcare needs in one place, but you can't remember what it was called. How would you find it?[if needed, direct participant to open VA.gov homepage] Where would you expect to find it on VA.gov?
