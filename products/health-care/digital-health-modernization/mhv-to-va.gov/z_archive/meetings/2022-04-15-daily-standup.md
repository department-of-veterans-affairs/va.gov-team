	- Working through the issue raised Tue evening on the 10-10 EZ -- Veterans are having trouble submitting the form since about two weeks ago
	- As Stephen and he set up an environment to help resolve the issue, it may have a secondary benefit of producing content that can be used for the MHV standup guide

	- Will continue with scaffolding work
	- Tracey can reach out to Lauren to make her aware of the impact to this initiative if needed
- Marci
	- Met with Tracey earlier to get some background on how the team works together and uses ZenHub currently
	- Putting together "elevator pitch" doc for MHV on VA.gov
- Patrick
	- Got pulled into a VAOS incident yesterday, spent a lot of the afternoon looking into that, then working on a Ruby upgrade on laptop.

## Decisions

- Leave the Scrum ceremony meeting invites as-is for now; they are using Patrick's Zoom.  Should probably be owned by Tracey or Christopher.

## Action Items

- [Christopher] Let Tracey know if you want her to talk with Lauren about the 10-10EZ issue impact to your bandwidth
