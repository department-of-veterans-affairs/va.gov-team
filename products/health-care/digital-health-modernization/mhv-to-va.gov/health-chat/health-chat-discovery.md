# VA Health Chat Discovery
After some initial UX discovery in June 2024 to help the Cartography Team understand where to implement a link to the VA Health Chat, technical discovery took place in July 2024 in order to figure out how we would enable direct SSOe access to the service via the CirrusMD API. Notes about both UX and technical discovery efforts are included herein.

## UX Discovery
People: 
* Kaitlin Fink (OCTO)

### Features of VA Health Chat: 
* Find your closest VA facility
* Schedule an appointment
* Refill a VA prescription
* Send a non-urgent message to your health care team - VA Health Chat does not connect the user directly to their VA care team, instead it is generic help from a staff member at the broader VISN that the facility bubbles up to.

### Support for VA Health Chat across facilities
VA Health Chat is support based on VISN (not at child facility level). There are 18 VISNs at the VA. As of June 2024, all VISNs support VA Health Chat at some level, but not all have 100% coverage on the 4 support areas. 

### Design explorations
Documented in this [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1718075410575/0f29fdbccc61d21bbf524d4769de17a2173e37cd).

### High-level questions & answers: 
<details><summary>Who is POC for CirrusMD API integration?</summary>
Hugo Padilla (OCC) who is best reached on Teams or via email. Copy Patrick Bateman on comms.
</details>

<details><summary>How to determine a user is eligible for Health Chat?</summary>
* Per Hugo Padilla on an email to Patrick June 14, 2024: The VA Health Chat/CirrusMD API can be used to return a list of VA Chat services/plans that are currently available to a particular patient.
* Kaitlin Fink - Unknown what the true definition of a "plan" is. Kaitlin Fink thinks the "plans" are the types a user has access to: Virtual Clinic Visit (Urgent Care), Clinical Triage, Scheduling and Administration, and Pharmacy. The plans are based on what Veterans Integrated Services Network (VISN) they are associated with. The goal is for all VISNs to support all 4 but they aren't there yet. All VISNs have at least one healthchat plan available. It is specific support per VISN not by facility.
</details>

<details><summary>What is the link we will use in the Landing Page to the chat tool?</summary>
Link to browser based chat: https://veteran.apps.va.gov/users/v2/login?redirect_uri=/cirrusmd from public website.
</details>

<details><summary>How to determine at what times the chat is supported?</summary>
* Potentially use the VA Health Chat/CirrusMD API for this.
* Potentially each service/plan has different hours. Which service/plan are we linking to?
  * Carlos Felix- I am thinking the user needs to choose which one as per how the chat works today.
</details>

<details><summary>What is the authentication for the VA Health Chat/CirrusMD API?</summary>
* Per Hugo Padilla on an email to Patrick June 14, 2024: Believe it is Oauth authentication.
* Per Hugo Padilla on an email to Patrick June 14, 2024: the authentication IDs the veteran and hence no ID needs to be passed in to the API to get data.
* Carlos Felix - Looks like the browser based chat uses the same VA authentication from a quick try on the public website.
* Carlos Felix - Per the Health Chat training doc: To use VA Health Chat, the user must be enrolled in VA health care in a location that supports VA Health Chat and have Login.gov, ID.me, DS Logon Level 2 (Premium), or My HealtheVet Premium account credentials. There is no mention of LOA1 or LOA3.
</details>

<details><summary>Is there an existing vets-api service for Health Chat?</summary>
No, a search of the baseline only shows web chat is available.
</details>

<details><summary>Can we get sample response(s) for the VA Health Chat/CirrusMD API?</summary>
TBD
</details>

### Sync with CirrusMD API team
Carlos Felix (Cartography) met with the Health Chat/Cirrus MD team on July 12, 2024.

* Carlos Felix

**Quick summary:**
* There is Health Chat and VA Chatbot. These are two different chats. Currently the chatbot is for pharmacy only, but the long term vision is to have the chatbot is to direct users to the correct Heath Chat channel. Currently in the early stages of development.
Health Chat is available at all VISNs.
* Health Chat uses a filter to look at the appointments in the last 36 months to know if the user is eligible for chat. Health Chat team to share what this filter is. We should be able to look at the user's appointments and use this same filter recipe to determine eligibility.
* Health Chat presents the user a list of channels and their availability. We are likely to not have access to channel operating hours data, but Health Chat team to share any information on how we can get this. Potentially we just initially point the user to the chat and the existing chat system shows what is available to the user.
* Health Chat team to provide us with more documentation, so we can understand more of the chat, how it works, and its API.

### Follow-up with CirrusMD API team
Information about how ChatBot determines if a user is eligible for Health Chat. Note there is a lot of internal checks for open times and sites. **There is currently no API to get open times.** We will have to recreate the site lookups and appointment checks to get similar results, but **this is a duplication that may not be worth maintaining**. 

* Here is what the Cirrus MD team shared with us:
  * To know that a Veteran is eligible to navigate to Health chat the CirrusMD API needs a plan type - and **pharmacy** is the only currently supported plan the API filters for.

* After that, the VHC application:
  * maps site IDs for the patient to channels available in their region
  * pulls data from the PRVS service to know if a veteran has received care at their site in the last 36 months
  * checks that the site is currently within its hours of operation
  * Then the API sends back the available plan(s) via a URL to the chatbot

* **Note**: If a Veteran is active on multiple sites, the URL will not correspond to a single plan, rather they will receive a category link with their active sites. This puts the veteran into VHC on the landing page you see in the video, and lets them choose which site to enter into.

### Technical Q&A w/ Hugo Padilla (OCC)
* Q: The API specifications suggests that with proper authorization and parameters, we can get a list of VA Chat services ("plans") returned that are available to the particular patient. Is this accurate? 
  * A: Yes
* Q: The call defined in the spec requires token-based authentication. Any idea if that is a static token or would we need to go through an oauth-style flow of providing a client secret, getting a scoped token/JWT back, and supplying that token with the request?
  * A: Yes, it's an oauth style flow
* Q: Can't tell from the spec how we specify which patient for which we're looking for VA Chat "plans." Or maybe patient identification is part of the authentication flow?
  * A: Yes, we ID the Veteran and therefore know which plans they should have access to and only present them the plans when they are available to the Veteran.
