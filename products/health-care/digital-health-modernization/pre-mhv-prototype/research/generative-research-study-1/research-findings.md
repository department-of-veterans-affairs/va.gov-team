## Background

Digital Health Modernization (DHM) builds on our [2017 Digital Modernization Strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-gov-relaunch-2018/va-gov-strategy/digitalmodernizationstrategy.pdf) to have a single digital front door — VA.gov — for all VA self-service tools and to design those tools with users.

Several developments, including the introduction of Community Care through the MISSION Act and VA’s transition to the Cerner electronic health record (EHR), have created a health-specific aim: to ensure VA’s patient portal is EHR agnostic and interoperable with outside providers while creating a consistent user experience that serves Veteran’s needs. 

Our team was tasked with conducting generative research to inform our product strategy and roadmap. 

## Research setup

Our objective was to understand how Veterans and caregivers think about and experience VA health care. We situated the research in the context of the My HealtheVet patient portal, other VA benefits, and non-VA health care systems. 

#### Research Questions

* **Mental models and information architecture:** What health-related content and tools outside of the MHV patient portal do users find valuable? What do they need integrated into their experience to support end-to-end workflows?
* **Branding and trust**: What attitudes do Veterans hold toward the MHV brand? Which aspects of the MHV brand generate trust?
* **Patient portal:** How does the current MHV patient portal support user needs? Where are there opportunities to bridge gaps or improve on existing functionality?
* **Sharing health information and tasks:** Who do Veterans need to help them manage their health information and tasks? And how do they want to manage that sharing?

#### Methodology

We conducted remote, semi-structured interviews with 23 Veterans and caregivers to understand their story. 

We then asked participants to walk us through how they would complete a series of health-related tasks. When they described doing something online, we had participants share their screen so we could observe. This allowed us to learn Veterans' and caregivers' systems of wayfinding, authentication methods, and workflows related to health. 

Tasks: 
* Ask your VA care team a question
* Refill a prescription
* Check the date of an upcoming medical exam you have for a disability claim
* Check the date of an appointment for a yearly check up with your VA care team
* Check the date of an appointmetn with a provider outside the VA
* Pay a VA health care bill, such as a copay
* Request reimbursement from the VA for traveling to your health care appointments
* Update the dependents on your VA benefits
* Update health care benefits

#### Recruitment

For this generative study, participants were required to have applied for or currently be enrolled in VA health care. We then recruited based on 3 main criteria: 
1. User role
2. Era of military service/age
3. Use of VA benefits 

During synthesis, we noticed meaningful segmentation based on: 

4. How and when participants enrolled in VA health care
5. Participants' use of non-VA health care and insurance for themselves or dependents
6. Participants identifying as having cognitive impairments (including TBI, PTSD)

## Themes and detailed findings

### Insight 1: Veterans have to navigate multiple health care systems, providers, and insurers to get the care they need.
**Theme 1.1 Complex health care needs.**
The Veteran population has unique and complex health care needs. 

> I’ve been going through the independent living program. They are working on a few things for the house to make things easier. Grab bars for the shower. Because with my TBIs I get dizzy and pass out. – Veteran (P2-C)

> I have to cancel meetings and cannot do stuff because my husband can’t find something he’ll have a seizure. – Caregiver (P1-C)

> "If I wake up and something don't hurt I look for a pulse." – Veteran (P8-B)

**Theme 1.2 Veterans value empathy and communication.** 
In addition to getting quality health services, participants want to feel heard by their providers, and they want proactive and timely communication from the VA about their health needs. 

> "Timely responses with secure messaging and just making sure medication is shipped on time are the two biggest things." – Caregiver (P1-C)

> "Compassion would be one of them. Treating someone like a human being and being understanding." – Veteran (P7-C) 

**Theme 1.3 Lack of timely, personalized care.**  
Veterans and caregivers feel they have to manage their expectations about timeliness and receiving individualized attention because of the high turnover of providers and sheer volume of patients served by the VA. 

> "I want to get better but I feel that in order to do that, I should be seen more than every 6 months." – Veteran (P5-C)

> "Cynical as it may sound, I think it is better to go in with low expectations and be pleasantly surprised rather than expecting a golden parachute of health care." – Veteran (P11-A)

> "I'd rather have two [providers] so I can be seen quick rather than trying to go through the process of going to another town to the VA and dealing with a lot of others than need to be seen as well." – Veteran (P12-A)

> "I think the big takeaway of the VA system is that it is very dependent on which VA you go to." – Veteran (P10-C)  

**Theme 1.4 Most participants had to seek care outside of the VA to meet their health needs.** 
While some were referred out through the Community Care program for speciality services, others leveraged separate insurance to receive timely and personalized care from providers outside the VA. 

Participant experience with non-VA health systems: 
* 16 receive non-VA health care (includes community care)
* 15 participants use other insurance (private/employer-based, Medicare/Medicaid, TRICARE)
  * 10 participants: 1 additional type insurance
  * 4 participants: 2 additional types of insurance
  * 1 participant: 3 additional types of insurance

> "Even with [community care] - I don’t know; when you were allowed to see outside providers – they still had to sign off on it. So I had to get an outside primary doctor just to have them refer me to go see an outside neurologist. I kind of went above their heads." – Veteran (P2-C)

> "It started when our doctor, the really good one, he said you know you still have your Tricare and we both like lightbulb going off moment. We just started going out and it was easy." - Veteran + caregiver (P10-C)

> "They publicly talk about going to who you want...but they said no you have to go off this list." – Veteran (P4-C)

### Insight 2: The VA ecosystem is so complex that Veterans feel discouraged to apply for, manage, and maximize their benefits. 

**Theme 2.1 Veterans are unaware of what benefits are available to them or how to apply.** 
Many participants had to overcome shame in order to identify that they were deserving of VA benefits. 

When participants enrolled in benefits:
* 10 applied during retirement/discharge process
* 8 applied no more than 5 years after retirement
* 3 applied 16-21 years after retirement/discharge

> “I wish when I’d gotten out of the military that my active duty station would have told me… I went over a decade not knowing.” – Veteran (P8-A)

> "My husband is a Marine, always will be a Marine. With his training and what he was taught it was never talk about things. Issues like, you know, PTSD. You just keep moving. You keep going." - Caregiver (P6-C)

> "Being healthy and coming out of the military I didn't want to be a drag on the country." - Veteran (P2-B)

> "I didn't want other Vets to think I am scamming the system." - Veteran (P12-A)

**Theme 2.2 Veterans have to rely on in-person services to access benefits.**
Participants with cognitive impairments removed themselves from the process out of frustration.

> “I tried doing it on my own initially, and it was a goat rope.” - Veteran who used VSO to apply for benefits (P11-A)

> "When I finished my retirement physical I was humbled. They reminded me just how much it hurt and how much I couldn't do." - Veteran (P8-B)

> "In the beginning I did a lot of it when I first got out. It was very frustrating so my wife got involved and that’s how she starting taking over and managing thing to get them taken care of."  - Veteran with cognitive impairment (P7-C)

> "I was 40 percent connected. I never went back to update it for the other surgeries. I am just not ready to deal with. Everyone gets on me for doing that... I probably should because I am service connected so I can get care but I haven’t updated my disability rating to be compensated for it. I mean that was 2011, 2013 and I am still emotional about it." - Veteran (P12-C) 

**Theme 2.3 Veterans are confused about the nuanced ways disability and health care eligibility differ.** 
Participants generally understood that their disability rating determines the types and cost of health care they can get.

> "If you have no disability at all, I don't think you can get care from the VA." – Veteran (P2-B)

> "Yeah, I guess the more disability you have, the better health care you can get.” - Veteran (P2-C)

**Theme 2.4 Veterans are concerned with documenting their service connected disabilities for fear of losing access to care.** 
Veterans think of their health record as a crucial component of their disability benefits.

> “I have had a lot of injuries but did not claim them because of different things. You are taught to suck it up and move on, you just move forwards. It hurts you when you get out because it is not documented.” – Veteran (P7-C)

> “Even though I’m 100% P&T and the VA will treat me for anything, if it isn’t recognized as service connected and things go seriously sideways, there are other benefits that I wouldn’t be eligible for." – Veteran (P11-A)

### Insight 3: Veterans and caregivers don’t go to VA.gov to do health tasks. 

**Theme 3.1 Veterans continue to go to MHV and eBenefits because they are familiar and they have what Veterans need.** 
Participants navigated directly to My HealtheVet to start their health tasks. 

**Theme 3.2 Participants had difficulty with the fragmented experience between MHV, eBenefits, and VA.gov.** 
The fragmented experience is inaccessible for Veterans with cognitive impairments. 

**Theme 3.3 Participants struggled to complete health tasks whenever those tasks took them outside MHV.** 
This included copay, travel pay, and scheduling appointments. 

### Insight 4: The secure sign-in partner options on MHV are not utilized or understood by users.

**Theme 4.1 Because participants did not use the secure sign-in option, they experienced issues when they navigated between VA sites.**
This option was not familiar, visually prominant, or well understood by Veterans. 

> “I always just go with the one that says My HealtheVet. It is easier for me to get to it that way.” – Veteran (P5-C)

> “Why would I use DS Logon if I have the MHV option?” – Veteran (P11-A)

**Theme 4.2 Participants were confused and frustrated by having multiple ways to authenticate for each site.** 
This fragmented experience is inaccessible to Veterans with cognitive impairments. 

> “He knows if he needs help logging in I am usually here.” – Caregiver (P11-C)

> “I think his phone finally saved his password. For a long time he couldn’t get on because he couldn’t remember the password or where to find the password.” – Caregiver (P9-C)

**Theme 4.3 Participants felt their MHV account was secure.**
Most participants cited security when rating their trust in MHV. 

> “I trust it completely.” - Veteran (P9-A)

> "I have never had a question of security." - Veteran (P8-B)

### Insight 5: Veterans trust the My HealtheVet brand because it offers the fastest, easiest method to complete health tasks. 

**Theme 5.1 My HealtheVet has high name recognition, satisfaction, and trust among Veterans and caregivers.** 
Participants found My HealtheVet easy to use and secure. 

> “Your 1-stop shop for everything health care related, once you have your disability rating.” – Veteran (P11-A)

* Participants navigated to the patient portal by searching for some version of “My HealtheVet” or had the page saved on their device. 
* Participants rated their satisfaction in MHV 4.6 / 5 on average.
* Participants rated their trust in MHV 4.5 / 5 trust on average.

**Theme 5.2 Veterans prefer My HealtheVet to phone or in-person alternatives at the VA.**
When rating their satisfaction and trust, participants described MHV in contrast to their other interactions for VA health care. 

> “That is the easiest way to get ahold of them. Otherwise you are sitting on hold from 45 minutes to an hour trying to transfer through the systems.” – Caregiver (P9-C)

> “It is easier and more versatile than to get on a call to ask questions or schedule.” – Caregiver (P11-C)

> “Quicker to do what you need to do. I don't need to be frustrated by talking to the doctor before I can get [medication]. I can just go onto MHV, select the meds I need to refill and it is mailed to me." – Veteran (P5-C)

### Insight 6: The MHV homepage tools reflect users’ top health care tasks. 

**Theme 6.1 Overwhelmingly, participants used and valued MHV for its 4 tools featured on the homepage banner.** 
Pharmacy, Appointments, Messaging, and Health Records tools were the most valuable.

> "Really what I use it for are the 4 big boxes." – Veteran (P9-A)

**Theme 6.2 Participants do not use or find value in self-entered data or resources.** 
Veterans and caregivers felt the transactional tasks were captured on the homepage, and did not explore additional resources.

> “The little blue blocks pretty much categorize every need that you would request from the VA.”– Veteran (P8-A)

> “You are supposed to fill in where you saw the VA. Which VAs you are going to. I don’t know why I would do that.” – Veteran (P10-C) referring to self-entered Treatment Facilities 

**Theme 6.3 Participants felt MHV offered the same or more functionality than other patient portals they had used.** 
Notable features from other patient portals included billing, notifications, calendar integrations, and interoperability with multiple health care systems. 

> "Hers [patient portaal] only shows shots and appointments, mine is more involved." - Veteran (P3-A) referring to the differences between MHV and other patient portals

> MyChart is little more front view friendly. You can login to multiple organizations. So like right now he goes through 3 hospitals systems, and they all have their own logins. But it gives me an alert and if an appointment pops up I can pull it straight from the app into our calendar." - Caregiver (P9-C)

### Insight 7: The lack of visibility into VA medical bills can cause confusion and financial burden to Veterans and caregivers.

**Theme 7.1 Participants rely on their outside health insurance providers and hard copy VA medical bills to decipher their VA health finances.** 
My HealtheVet does not provide visibility, functionality, or pathways to complete tasks for medical bills. 

> “If I lost the letter, I’d be totally lost.”– Veteran (P8-A) referring to a VA medical bill.

> “The one thing that is not on [MHV] is on my [health insurance] website, it shows me when a bill has been submitted and the allowed amount and what the insurance has paid as well as how much I need to pay. This site [MHV] does not show dollar amounts for exams here.” – Veteran (P9-A)

> “I can’t submit this to my FSA because it doesn’t send me an itemized [bill]... I just get these strange letters from the VA.” – Veteran (P10-B)

### Insight 8: The inability to delineate actions between users of a single MHV account causes friction and confusion.

**Theme 8.1 Caregivers have developed workarounds to effectively manage health needs when sharing one MHV account with their Veteran spouse or child.**
Some providers were uncomfortable communicating with the caregiver through secure messaging on the Veteran’s account. 

>“If there is a way to create a separate login with the same permissions without making you feel like you’re the parent logging into the kid’s computer. That’s sometimes how I feel.” – Caregiver (P1-C) 

> “I have to talk to my doctors, they won’t really talk to [my caregiver] I guess. That part falls on me.” – Veteran (P2-C)

> “It is a struggle to get somebody to listen to you. The doctor sees them once every 6 months. I see him every day. I have a unique perspective they don’t have. I am not saying I know more than then but I do and its from a non-clinician aspect.” – Caregiver (P11-C)

## Opportunities
All opportunities map back to the corresponding insight number. 

### Opportunity 1: Make the patient portal experience the constant in an otherwise varied health landscape.
Veterans should have access to their health information online, shown in a holistic, simple, and actionable way.

**Design Principles:** 
* **Accessibility is core to all design decisions.** Everyone should be able to use any tool or application regardless of features or complexity.

* **Write content with an empathetic tone.** We talk person-to-person with our customers, and use language that puts the person first, not the disability, condition, age, gender, or race.

* **Communicate proactively.** Use effective channels all Veterans can access to share health information or events.

### Opportunity 2: Integrate siloed workflows so that Veterans can more easily obtain, access, and maximize their benefits. 
Design IA and content in a way that clearly shows the relationship between health care and disability and helps Veterans make decisions.

**What we are doing:** 
* **Leveraging the authenticated account experience.** [My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/README.md) directs users to the updates and information they need. 

### Opportunity 3: Create a clear path between websites for health tasks. 
Veterans should be taken directly to the information and tools they need, especially when tasks are distributed across multiple websites. 

**What we are doing:**
* **Streamlining health workflows on VA.gov.**
Improving the information architecture on health pages to solve discoverability issues and streamline health workflows. 

**Developing the VA flagship app.**
Integrating health and benefits tools and information as one consistent experience. 

### Opportunity 4: Give Veterans a consistent, consolidated sign-in experience for all VA digital services. 
Veterans should not have to manage multiple credentials and websites to manage their benefits. 

**What we are doing:** 
* Working across OCC, VBA, VHA, and others as the Identity Working Group to implement identity vision. 
* Fixing single sign-on between MHV and VA.gov so Veterans and caregivers can do key tasks easily, starting from either website. 
* Coordinating memo from VHA leadership.
* Getting feedback on proposed identity roadmap (presented 3/18/21). 
* [Doing stakeholder research with MHV coordinators, contact center, and help desk.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/digital-experience-products/issues/296)

### Opportunity 5 & 6: Veteran health outcomes should always be the north star. 
We must help Veterans navigate the fragmented health landscape as we reimagine a future patient experience.

**What we are doing:** 
* **Consolidating the sign-in experience across VA websites.** 
 * Fixing single sign-on between MHV and VA.gov so Veterans and caregivers can do key tasks easily, starting from either website. 
 * Working across OCC, VBA, VHA, and others as the Identity Working Group to implement identity vision.
* **Streamlining health workflows on VA.gov.** Improving the information architecture on health pages to solve discoverability issues and streamline health workflows. 
* **Collaborating across teams.** Building the digital health modernization vision and roadmap as a combined OCTO-OCC-MHV team.

### Opportunity 7: Money matters should not be separate from health tasks. 
Veterans should be able to see financial information in context with their VA health services. 

**What we are doing:** 
* **Add medical copayments to VA.gov debt portal.** 
It’s officially on VA.gov roadmap. 

**What we could do in the future:**
* **Connect health tasks through notifications.** 
Leverage VA.gov’s platform to design usable and useful notifications.

### Opportunity 8: Make user delegation simple. 
Find ways to make it easier for caregivers to manage Veterans’ health. 

**What we are doing:** 
* **Defining user role for dependents in Master Person Index (MPI).**
Making it easy to identify dependents in MPI (part of the Dependent Benefits Letter work). 
* **Updating Terms of Service.**
Working with Legal to change Terms of Service so we can stop closing accounts for non-malicious account-sharing.

**What we could do in the future:** 
* **Simplify delegation tools to increase adoption.**
Conduct service design research to do this.
