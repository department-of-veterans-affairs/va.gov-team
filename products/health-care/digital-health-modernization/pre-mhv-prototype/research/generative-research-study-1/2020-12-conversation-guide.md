# Conversation Guide: Digital Health Modernization Discovery Research

**Session setup**

For this session, we may ask participants to share their screen in order to show us how they manage their health online. The moderator should also be prepared to share her screen and show an authenticated My HealtheVet account for reference and participant feedback.

## Introduction (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Emily and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience with VA health care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

**This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

**We want hear your personal experience and honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to know about it. Understanding your story will help us create better digital products for Veterans [or caregivers] like you, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express. 

**Health can be a personal topic.** I understand that there may be aspects about your health that you do not want to share with us. If you’d rather not answer a question, please just let me know and we can skip it. 

**If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** This is a voluntary session, and you will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** For this session, I will have you share your screen and ask you to show us how you manage benefits online, so this means that the information in your account would be part of the recording. Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of the people on this call. We use them only to confirm that we have captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them a few weeks after the session. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Background (5 minutes)

To get started, I’d like to get a little background information about you, and your experience with the VA.

1. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (Moderator can prompt the participant: where they live, branch of military, work or hobbies). 
2. When did you leave the military?
3. What VA benefits do you receive?
4. Do you have any family members who you claim as dependents? 
4.a. Do your family members receive any benefits from the VA?

6.a. (If yes) What apps do you use? What do you use them for?

## Mental model of health at the VA (20 minutes)

### Things to watch for
- The exact path participants take when sharing their screen
- Mention of VA online tools like VA.gov, My HealtheVet, or eBenefits
- Non-VA online resources
- In-person or non-digital VA resources like the Contact Center, VSOs, etc. 
- Any places where participants express confusion or frustration
- Any feedback that could make this process better

Now I’d like to hear about your experience transitioning from the military to the VA. **(10 minutes)**

4. Since you first became a Veteran, has there been a change in the types of VA benefits you’ve received?
4.a. (If yes) What was the reason behind those changes?
5. How would you explain a “disability rating” to a new Veteran?
6. In your mind, is there a relationship between “disability” and “health care”?
7. When it comes to your health care, what is the most important thing you need from the VA?

Now I’d like to ask you how you manage information and tasks related to your health care. For each one, talk me through the steps you’d take. If there is something that you go online to complete, I may ask you to share your screen so I can see what you would do. **(10 minutes)**
