Listed here are various analytics to help drive research planning. 

### Key facts about VA health care 
(Source: [Ad Hoc's "VA 101"presentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/assets/VA%20101%20-%20External%20-%20Aug%202021.pdf), updated August 2021)
- VA runs the nation's largest integrated health system and only nationalized health care in the U.S., aside from the military and Indian Health Service
- There are 1,255 healthcare facilities, 170 VA Medical Centers (VAMCs), and 18 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs - regional care networks).
- VA health care "serves 9.3M enrolled Veterans each year"
  - *Does this mean that of the enrolled Veterans, 9.3M use VA health care per year? Or there's a total of 9.3M Veterans enrolled?*

### Veteran demographics 
(Source: [Ad Hoc's "VA 101"presentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/assets/VA%20101%20-%20External%20-%20Aug%202021.pdf), updated August 2021)
- In 2018, there were approximately 18M Veterans in the U.S. 
  - 50% received benefits through VA.
  - 36% had ever received VA health care.
- In 2017, the median age of male Veterans was 64, while the median age of female Veteran was 48.
- In 2018, 9% of Veterans were women. 
  - In 2017, 9.6% of users of VA services were women. Of female Veterans, 50% use VA services (compared to 49% utilization for male Veterans).

### VA benefit usage 
(Source: [Ad Hoc's "VA 101"presentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/assets/VA%20101%20-%20External%20-%20Aug%202021.pdf), updated August 2021)

**Benefit enrollment:**
- 9.8M (about 50%) of all Veterans were enrolled in at least 1 VA service.
  - 25% of VA users only received VA health care (and not other benefits).
  - 45% of Veterans used multiple VA benefits.
- The most-used VA benefits are healthcare and disability compensation.
  - 36% of of all Veterans had ever received VA health care.
  - 76% of VA users received health care and/or disability compensation. (Read this and the sub-bullet carefully.)
    - 75% of VA users receiving disability comp also received VA health care. 
- Veterans aged 25-34 and 65+ were most likely to use VA benefits.

**Disability:** 
- In 2018, 24% of Veterans had a service-connected disability (an injury, disease, or disability either caused or aggravated by active duty).
- 707,000 Veterans had a service-connected disability rating of 100%.
- 43% of Post-9/11 veterans had a service-connected disability – significantly higher than Veterans from other periods. Advances in battlefield medicine and rapid evacuations have resulted in more Veterans surviving wounds, but an increase in invisible injuries like Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
- The most common disabilities included hearing loss, PTSD, scars, back and neck pain, and migraines.
- There were 158,000 legally blind veterans, with 7,000 veterans newly blind or visually impaired each year.
- In 2019, 5.38M Veterans and survivors received disability compensation. Benefits include Disability Compensation, DIC (Dependent and Indemnity Compensation, also called Death benefit), and SMC (Special Monthly Comp).

Note: It's likely that there were many more disabled Vets not identified, in part due to military culture.
