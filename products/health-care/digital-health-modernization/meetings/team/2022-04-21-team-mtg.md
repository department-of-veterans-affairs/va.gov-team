## Attendees

- Christopher Froehlich
- Lauryl Zenobi
- Jonathan Nelson
- Megan Graham
- Marci McGuire

## Agenda

- Updates
- Start-Stop-Continue
- Mural for handoff (note - delayed until the rest of the team can attend)


## Notes

### Jonathan demo of the prescriptions page prototype

- Challenge is when he scrolls down, the "In this section" section becomes sticky.  There's some limitation in the Sketch prototype, so the entire header is sticky.
- He synced with Lauryl & Meg, so as long as the study facilitator can walk the participants through, it should not be a problem
- Jonathan wanted to make sure that everyone was comfortable with that approach.
- Lauryl and Megan are fine with the way the prototype behaves.

### Start-Stop-Continue Mural board - [link](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1649964941166/c4947cd6b022f3bece63ae3a6cf649723a777854?sender=u542b335a22a4ae682fe26277)

	#### Start
- Defining what our handoff to HMV will look like
	- A Mural board has been created to start coming up with ideas
- Breaking work down so it can be tracked on a day/week basis
	- Consensus - more structure is better
	- Models what we want the MHV to do when they become a product team
	- Most important thing is modeling good behavior
- Estimating work to facilitate Sprint and longer range planning
	- Everyone is in agreement that estimating work and planning work in Sprints is a good change to make
- Creating more synergy between research and design
	- Attendees weren't sure of the context around this note, but consensus was that if we start doing some of the other things listed, it will naturally improve synergy
	- Put things in the Slack channel more to invite questions, discussion
- Finding ways to cover the many sync meetings without everyone always attending every sync

#### Stop
- Including the whole team in meetings they don't necessarily have to attend
	- Meeting notes on Slack
	- Links to prototypes on Slack
	- Possibly Slack-ups 1-2 days a week
- Two hour-long working meetings each week is a lot
	- Agenda for each meeting
	- End meetings ASAP one we're through the agenda

#### Continue
- Collaborating and sharing with other teams
- Standup notes
- Keeping standups to 15 min 


## Action Items

- Talk with rest of the team about possibly cutting hour-long team meetings down to one a week.
- Use Slack to share info/request feedback when a meeting isn't necessary
