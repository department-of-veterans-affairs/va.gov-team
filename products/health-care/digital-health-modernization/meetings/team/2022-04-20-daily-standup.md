## Updates

- Jonathan
	- Needs to make some tickets
	- Found a way to approximate the sticky element that appears on VA.gov mobile or "smashed" screen in the prototype.  The section will follow, but it includes the breadcrumb and header, which is not entirely like the actual screen.  There's also a bit of a jump that could be disoriented.  He worked with Lauryl, Meg and Mikki and feels like this should be fine.
- Megan
	- Met with Lauryl this morning to review comments on convo guide and research plan; currently incorporating those
	- Lauryl went over how to hand off to Shane/Perigian and is getting Megan added to a slack channel

	- Wrapping things up before she's out; let her know if you need anything
	- Saw that Lauryl had requested adding Megan to VA Mural
- Meg
	- Jonathan and she were in the debt sync since we have medical co-pays. 
	- Has been organizing a meeting with My VA, VA home page and My HealtheVet
