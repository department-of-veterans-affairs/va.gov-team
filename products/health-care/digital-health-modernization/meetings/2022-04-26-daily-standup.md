	- Meg and he worked with Nancy this morning, and her big question was around resource allocation
	- Are the people we are working with for secure messaging dedicated?
		- Lauryl recommended bringing up that question during PI planning
	- Nancy is concerned about the onboarding time (est 5 days).  She's also concerned about how work will also be maintained on MyHealtheVet while this is going on
	- Marci mentioned she has some concern about folks getting squeezed on this team while hand-holding and trying to get the next chunk of work prepped for the MHV team. We'll need to keep that in mind as we plan the next quarter
