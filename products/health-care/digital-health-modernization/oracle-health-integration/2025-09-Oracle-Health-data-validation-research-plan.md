# Research Plan for MHV Monthly Validation Test – September 2025

## Background
The purpose of this monthly validation test is to ensure that the latest features deployed to the My HealtheVet (MHV on VA.gov) and VA Health and Benefits (VAHB) platforms are functioning as intended in a real-world production environment. This testing is conducted after internal QA and lower environment testing and focuses on assessing whether newly released or updated features perform reliably and as expected.

Unlike usability testing, this format resembles user acceptance testing (UAT), where the moderator guides participants through tasks to validate functional correctness. Each month’s session will evaluate a subset of newly deployed features selected based on feature readiness and availability at the time of testing. Feature selection will be finalized at the moderator’s discretion.

## OCTO-DE Priorities
VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA healthcare and benefits.

## Veteran Journey
Taking care of myself – Maintaining my health

## Research Goals

### Goals
Validate that the latest deployed features on MHV and VAHB platforms perform correctly in production and meet basic acceptance criteria.

## Outcome
Any issues identified during the test sessions will be logged and referred to the engineering team for triage and resolution. Findings will inform whether the tested features are ready for broad release to all Veterans.

## Research Questions
-	Do the deployed features function as intended in the production environment?
-	Are there any functional issues, display errors, or unexpected behaviors that could impact a Veteran’s ability to use the feature or could result in a patient safety issue?
-	Are any discrepancies observed between expected and actual behavior or between data presented in the feature vs. the clinician-facing health record?

## Hypotheses
We believe the newly released features will perform reliably in production and meet acceptance criteria for broader rollout.

## Methodology
Moderated validation sessions will be conducted remotely with Veterans using production-deployed features set behind feature flags. Participants will perform predefined tasks related to available features, guided by a moderator. Sessions will focus on verifying feature functionality rather than gathering usability insights. The moderator will document observations and outcomes.

If necessary, clinical or technical staff may observe or participate in sessions to help validate feature behavior or data consistency, depending on the nature of the features being tested.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment Approach
We will recruit 30 Veterans who meet the criteria outlined below. Participants will be selected to reflect diversity in device type, demographics, and healthcare usage patterns.

### Recruitment Criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:
- Veterans: [25-30]
- Caregivers: [0]
- Dependents: [0]
- Ideal Completed Total: [10–15]

### Criteria:
Veterans must have received care from a VAMC that has converted to Oracle Health. This list includes:
- Washington
- Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington
- Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center in Walla Walla, Washington
- VA Central Ohio Health Care System in Columbus, Ohio
- Roseburg VA Health Care System in Roseburg, Oregon
- VA Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center and Clinics in White City, Oregon
- Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago, Illinois

**Additional Necessary Criteria**
- The Veteran must have an active ID.me or login.gov account that they are able to easily access
- The sample must include male and female participants
- The sample must exclude assistive technology users

### Screening Questions:

   - Yes
   - No
→ If No, disqualify from study
 
2. In the past 2 years, have you received care from a VA provider (not community care) at one of the following VA Medical Centers (Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center, Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center, VA Central Ohio Health Care System, Roseburg VA Health Care System, VA Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center and Clinics, Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center)?
   - Yes
   - No
