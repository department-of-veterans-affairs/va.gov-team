### Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Matt and I'll be moderating. One of my colleagues will be taking notes throughout the session. Today we're going to talk about using several key features in your VA Health and Benefits mobile app: secure messaging to communicate with your provider or a group of providers, viewing your lab results and tests, viewing other aspects of your medical record, and viewing your appointments. We may jump around through these topics depending on what exists in your medical record. Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This session will take about 60 minutes.
- During this session, we'll be asking you to share your screen which will show your personal health records. Your participation is completely voluntary. You can stop at any time. You can choose to show us one thing but not another - this is your choice. There will be no repercussions on your VA benefits if you want to stop at any point or don't want to share some information with us.
- Are you comfortable sharing your screen while you navigate your VA health records?
  - [Record Answer]
- I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with a couple of observers joining us?
  - If no: Ask observers to leave.
  - If yes: Admit observers and have them do quick intros, then turn off cameras.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio during this session? We use these recordings to confirm that we have an accurate record of what we learn from you, and refer back to them to make sure we are not misremembering anything. We save these files on the VA network and destroy them after the study is finished.
  - [Record Answer]
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable with me recording this session?
