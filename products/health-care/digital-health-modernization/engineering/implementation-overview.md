# MHV-on-VA.gov Implementation Plan
This document serves to document the overall implementation approach for migrating MHV features to VA.gov. 

## Desired End State

### Why
- Unified experience
- Avoids SSO complexity
- Integration with other VA.gov features (like disability rating, profile, etc)

## Building on VA.gov
- Architecture
  - React Frontend
  - Rails API proxy layer
  - Backing services/API tier built in MHV stack continue to exist. 
 
### Building the frontend - what's involved

### Building the backend proxy - what's involved

### Collaboration cycle 

## Phased Migration Approach
- Feature by feature
- Options for building and deploying but not releasing
- Options for soft launch/phased release
- Pattern for communicating migration to users and eventually retiring deprecated UI entry points.
