# Vets.gov Discovery Sprint Planning: Blue Button

## What is the purpose of this discovery sprint?
 
- To understand how we will put Blue Button on vets.gov
- To understand what is available via the API
- To understand the usefulness of self-entered data
- To understand work that has been planned and/or developed for Blue Button but isn't currently live on MHV

## Preparing for Discovery Sprint
- What we think we know?
     - An API exists
     - Theresa Hancock is the Primary Stakeholder
     - Users can download and view files in .pdf or .txt
     - Users can select date range of data to download
     - Users can select the information to download
     - Currently LOA3 users are only able to view and download health information in addition to self entered data
     - Users have the ability to download self entered medical data 
     
- What don’t we know? 
     - If the API contains all functionality currently live on MHV
     - The value of self-entered data
     - What's been developed and isn't live (and is there an API for it)
     - The plan for viewing and downloading medical images
     - Are there important stakeholders besides the MHV team
     - Will users have to be logged in a LOA3 to use BB (except for self entered data) 
        
      
- How are we going to find out answers?
     - Need to identify people to talk to
          - 1. MHV side: Carnetta S.(main POC), Theresa (lead of MHV)
          - 2. MHV Coordinators- potential questions
          - 3. Dr. Nazi, who Carnetta says knows a lot about BB and possibly the functionality that has been built but not live.  Also may know about images.
          - 4. Ken Graham, MHV API Lead and John Brekke, OIT PM
          - 5. Veterans - potential questions
