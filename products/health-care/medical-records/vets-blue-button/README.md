### What is Blue Button?
Health information about you may be stored in many places, such as doctorsâ€™ offices, hospitals, drug stores and health insurance companies. The Blue Button symbol signifies that an organization has a way for you to access your health records electronically so you can:

Have your medical history available in case of emergency, when traveling, seeking a second opinion, or switching health insurance companies
Plug your health information into apps and tools that help you set and reach personalized health goals.
You have a legal right to receive your personal health information. Look for the Blue Button symbol, and ask your health care providers or health insurance company if they offer you the ability to view online, download, and share your health records.
