Research Goals
--------------

- Understand how Clinicians use and get access to Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data.

- Understand the different roles in the Diabetes Care Pathway care team. 

- Understand the painpoints of the care team and what would make life easier for them.

Methodology
-----------

Remote moderated interviews

Participants
------------

- Endocrinologist - Dr. Sara Markley

- Primary Care Physicians - Dr. Nora Oliver & Nadine Harris

- Clinical Pharmacist Practitioner -  Alecia Oliver

Interview Summary
------------
### Endocrinologist
#### Pain points
- Not too many- she and other endocrinologists have their workflows down already
  - Would only increase speed by like 1 minute
- Comfortable accessing Dexcom’s or Abbott’s clinician dashboards
- Having a quick way to get the data would be a game changer for PCPs

#### Diabetes data they need to see and how they would use it 
-   Looks mostly CGM data - looking at sugar every 5 min (more accurate data), time and range, time and use (i.e. using for 90% of the time). Used to look at A1C levels.
-   Currently pull up the patient’s data in each session- ambulatory glucose profile, cover sheet, avg blood sugar, A1C, time in range, high, low, are they at goal big picture wise.
-   Then will go into the daily records for details, prompting questions with the Veteran.

#### What would make their life easier
>“Would be amazing to have it all be in 1 place”

### PCP
#### Pain points
- No time to take a closer look at things. They only get about 30 minutes with each patient and they have to look at overall health, not just diabetes.
>“PCP finds it difficult because they don't have the extra 5 minutes. Unless there’s a button in CPRS, they are never going to look at the info because it's too many steps. They want the data directly without another login.”
- No additional resources to help.
- Currently to get this information, they ask the patient and rely on what the patient tells them. Some patients will show their graph on their phone.
- Logging into another system is difficult with Workday


#### Diabetes data they need to see and how they would use it 
- Morning sugars, if they get farther, its nice
- When they check, what their readings are, fasting readings, how high it goes 
- Within CGMs, what data points are most important?
  - How have your readings been, over or under 200?
  - A1C
  - Blood glucose 
- Other data besides CGMs that are important
  - Routine labs 
  - PDMP- narcotic prescribing 
  - 6 month check

#### What would make their life easier
- Integration with CPRS
>“I have so many patients on insulin that would benefit from this but no infrastructure/system to review their data. Having something integrated into CPRS would be so helpful.”
>“I think that’s a great idea if we can make it integrated into CPRS somehow.”
- Making the process to look up a patient  easy 
- Create a list/graph with all of the numbers, like a one pager
  - Avg blood glucose, etc. 
  - Data from the CGM - they are supposed to review the CGM data and makes decisions based on that, but need to access it quickly 
    - Need to say that they reviewed it 
- Button to import and/or link the CGM data 

### Pharmacist
#### Pain points
- Had to create her own template in CPRS to assess the patient and come up with a plan
- Having to log into a separate system to get the info is very time consuming
  - Has to do look at multiple views to get the desired data (Medrec and a summary report)
- Every CGM vendor has a separate site to log into to see the data.
  - Difficult to see all of her patients so she saves them in each vendor site.

#### Diabetes data they need to see and how they would use it 
- Data needed to do her job
  - Average glucose
  - GMI- A1C
  - Coefficient of variation
  - Time that CGM is active
  - Time and range report 

- What do you do with this data?
  - Telling patients the adjustment of the meds
>“I like to look at a bit more than just the AGP and TIR to see the full picture and decide how I’d like to adjust meds.”

#### What would make their life easier
>“In an ideal world, if one button could replicate the table that I’ve created for my personal template, that would be ideal.”
- A report to automatically come in.
  - Automatically import to vista imaging
  - If they would go into CPRS and just see the report pop in there like a note. “CGMs data report” 
>“I don't want to have to log into another system“


Recommendations
---------------
- Integration with CPRS is essential for adoption
- Focus on the needs/pain points of PCPs and Pharmacists over Endocrinologists as there is more room for improvement and will lead to a larger impact for them
- Each role (PCP vs Pharmacist) has different needs when viewing diabetes data, so the data views should be catered to each role
  - Displaying the right data in the right format for each role will have a huge impact on their care delivery.
