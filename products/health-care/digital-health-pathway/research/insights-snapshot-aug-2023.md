Insights Snapshot - August 2023

The insights snapshot is a collection of feedback weâ€™ve received on DHP since we kicked off the pilot in March 2023. The DHP launched at four different VAMCs across various programs, and we have continually gathered clinician and Veteran feedback over the the last few months to inform and measure the success of the MVP. We spoke to 26 Veterans and six clinicians since March 2023. 

Who did we interact with over the course of the pilot?
On the Veteran side, 54% of our pilot participants were male, 46% were female, and they ranged in ages from 35 to 65+.
- 29% identified as Black or African American
- 14% identified as Hispanic or Latino
- 48% identified as white
- 9% preferred not to say

We had Veteran participants across four military branches, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. Our clinician participants represented three programs across four VA medical centers, including adaptive sports, whole health, and the WRIISC group.

At the origin of the DHP Pilot, we set three goals and aims to guide the evolution of DHP, and how the pilot could not only prove success with our pilot vendor, Fitbit, but also support the rapid integration of new cases, while delivering perceived value to clinicians and Veterans. For each of the three key pilot aims, we set measures of success and hypotheses to test and validate, in order to measure the resulting outcomes based on clinician and Veteran feedback. Overall, based on qualitiative and quantitative evaluation methods we used throughout the pilot and clinician and Veteran feedback, we successfully achieved our pilot aims.
