## Research Goals

-   Understand the as-is process for clinicians and administrators collecting and analyzing PGD (specifically from Fitbits)
-   Determine pain points and areas of opportunity in the current process

## Methodology

Remote moderated interviews

## Participants

10 total VA clinicians/administrators were interviewed for this study. Eight clinicians were recruited from a list of participants involved or interested in the VA Fitbit program. Two participants were referrals made during interviews.

Participants included:
-   Internist and Whole Health Director 
-   Clinical Psychologist and Whole Health Director
-   Whole Health Doctor & Dietician, VISN co-chair on diabetes
-   Program Manager for Whole Health
-   VA Health Coach
-   Registered Dietician and MOVE coordinator
-   Psychologist specializing in sleep
-   Clinical Psychologist specializing in sleep
-   Clinical Research Psychologist
-   Chief Health Informatics Officer at a VAMC

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

### PGD from Fitbits is a useful way to monitor or adjust care plans and medical interventions.

**Likely true** - Fitbit data in various forms was valued by all participants. Actions taken as a result of access to this data included adjustments to interventions.

### Clinicians and administrators want to view this data and would derive more value from PGD if it was brought into VA.
**Likely true** - Fitbit data today is not accessible at all to clinicians unless a patient volunteers the information through conversation or by showing their device. Clinicians expressed the data would be more valuable to their workflows if it was available in a standardized way across patients. Clinicians also desire to reference VA data, such as health records, alongside activity tracker data. 

### PGD from Fitbits will not create a burden on a clinician's workload.
**Maybe true** - Clinicians expressed varying data needs. An appropriate amount or format of data for one clinician might be considered a burdensome amount of information for another.

## Summary

Clinicians and administrators in this study spoke positively about the use of Fitbits and other activity trackers with patients. The data provided by activity trackers has the potential to enhance a clinician's understanding of a patient's current situation, establish realistic goals, and track progress against those goals. Access to data is limited, preventing clinicians and administrators from unlocking the full potential.

Key themes highlighted below:
1.  Most participants found activity tracker data valuable and were able to identify a wide range of use cases for the data and how it might fit into their workflow.
2.  The amount of data needed varies greatly based on the clinician and patient goals.
3.  Activity trackers provide quantitative data about a Veteran's activity to aid in setting realistic goals. 
4.  Activity tracker data is not accessible to clinicians. The data is most commonly shared through 1 on 1 conversations.
5.  Clinicians do not use data from activity trackers in isolation or make decisions only based on this data. Data from health records, patient conversations, and other PGHD is used alongside activity tracker data to create a complete story.
6.  Activity trackers empower patients with data to be more accountable, aware, and motivated to achieve their goals.
7.  Administrators and researchers would like to use Fitbit data from groups of patients to determine if interventions and programs are effective.

## Key Findings

### Most participants found activity tracker data valuable and were able to identify a wide range of use cases for the data and how it might fit into their workflow.

Activity trackers were viewed as a useful tool in a clinical setting by most participants. The uses identified were wide ranging and reflected the different specialties the participants represented. 

Potential uses of activity tracker data identified by participants include:
-   Proactive mental health alerts and monitoring
-   Achieving weight loss goals
-   Setting and tracking movement and activity goals
-   Diabetes management
-   Understanding sleep patterns
-   Determining the effectiveness of a program or treatment on a group

> "I think any kind of over the counter device like Fitbit is really useful because of patients already using it, or they would enjoy using it because it's empowering and they have access to the data as well. A lot of folks use these devices now and a lot of folks actually enjoy using them. Whereas I send them home with medical grade devices, they're not very stylish." - Sleep specialist

> "The data would be very helpful for us to capture more long term sleep patterns and what's happening with not only sleep, but also daytime activity. There are medical grade devices that we can use, however, they are only good for about two weeks. It does require the patient coming in for the device and dropping it off so we have to rely on folks being local." - Sleep specialist

> "Let's say I'm a Veteran with a Fitbit, a smartphone, and struggling with depression. I'm not sleeping as much as I should, I'm on my phone quite often, and there are other specific biomarkers that you know correlate to increase in depression or suicide ideation. When a threshold is met, a screener for depression should be sent." - Health Administrator

> "How can we get data from other sources to automatically funnel in and fill out the sleep diary?" - Sleep specialist

> "It tells us how active they are, where they need to get to next. It helps with weight loss and diabetes" - Whole Health

> "A lot of time I'm meeting Veterans virtually now so it's not like I can look at their watch. If there was a chart or something that I could pull up and view before we meet to see trends." - Health Coach

### The amount of data needed varies greatly based on the clinician and patient goals.

Too much data for one clinician might be not enough for another. Some participants had a use for raw data and were interested in spending time working with the data while others only needed a summary to quickly reference.

Examples of the granularity of data identified by participants:
-   A mental health specialist may not want to see any data unless certain indicators are present in the data.
-   A Whole Health Physician may want a brief summary of a patient's activity over the past several months to understand the general activity level.
-   A Health Coach may want more detailed data about movement on a daily or weekly basis to help create and track goals with the patient.
-   A sleep specialist may want detailed sleep data over a period of three months to understand sleep patterns.
-   A researcher may want raw data for a large group of patients over the course of a treatment.

> "It could become too overwhelming to see a lot of raw data. In a perfect scenario, there would be some different options for the amount of data based on the role of the individual or team accessing the data." - Whole Health

> "I have a use for raw data, I don't think a clinician does" - Research Psychologist

> "Part of the problem is that we already receive so much information. A summary would be good. I don't have to spend as much time looking through the data to figure out what the outcomes are." - Whole Health

> "I would like to see the data. Some Veterans may be tracking things and not fully understand it or understand how it fits into the greater picture, maybe not even know what they're looking at." - Health Coach

> "I like to look week by week at sleep data over a three month period of time" - Sleep specialist

### Activity trackers provide quantitative data about a Veteran's activity to aid in setting realistic goals. 

What patients describe does not always match the data provided by activity trackers. The activity tracker data provides another angle to understand what the Veteran is experiencing and provides the clinician with a more complete story. With a more complete understanding of the patient's current state, realistic and individualized goals can be set by using the activity tracker data.

> "The data from the Fitbit would be used to create goals together. For example, I see you're averaging 2,000 steps per day, can we make it to 2,500? That sort of thing definitely will be utilized by the health coach." - Whole Health

> "It is so helpful to have real data. When I work with patients they might not know why they are gaining weight and then once you get into the data there is an explanation." - MOVE coordinator

> "Many Veterans are setting step goals or hours of activity. Others are focusing on sleep. It is really interesting to see Veterans who have certain perceptions about their sleep have actual quantitative metrics to look at in comparison to their perceptions and using that data to set a more realistic goal." - Whole Health

### Activity tracker data is not accessible to clinicians. The data is most commonly shared through 1 on 1 conversations.

Clinicians do not have a standardized way to access and view Veteran data from Fitbits or other activity trackers. Veterans are most commonly sharing their data through conversations with their clinician and sometimes through showing their device or phone or by forwarding summary emails. The data shared is not tracked or stored anywhere. Clinicians do not have the opportunity to review the data prior to interfacing with the patient. 

> "The downside is we don't have a nice way to export it. Some of the VA apps allow Veterans to send a CSV file through secure messaging, we don't have that option for Fitbit" - Whole Health

> "The issue is we don't have access to the Fitbit data. We have to find ways to integrate into the CPRS workflow" - Health Administrator

> "I don't like handling someone's phone. When someone says they have Fitbit data, it would be nice if they could print it off or it is somehow transferred into the system. That's where there is a challenge, having access to the data." - Sleep specialist

> "Some patients share the data with me. They share it with me by email which is not the general way they should give it to me. The data has to be more visible to us as providers. For CGMs I'm logging into the cloud to view the data and that is working really well." - Whole Health

> "The data is just shared through discussions." - Health Coach

### Clinicians do not use data from activity trackers in isolation or make decisions only based on this data. Data from health records, patient conversations, and other PGHD is used alongside activity tracker data to create a complete story.

All participants using activity tracker data are using it to build a more complete picture of the patient and their current situation. Decisions are not being made by only referencing activity tracker data. 

> "Let's say we are looking at the A1C that is up and weight. Then we look at the Fitbit activity, and oh, you've been more active over that time, so maybe I need to look at medication. I could see the data rolling into the conversations we are already having." - Whole Health

> "Comparing and contrasting the data based on the biometric data in CPRS like weight would be helpful." - Whole Health

> "I don't think as a clinician it is driving our decisions. It is helping us achieve those shared goals of the patient being more active." - Whole Health

> "I use a sleep log to get their subjective perception. It doesn't always map on with the objective. We don't always want to rely entirely on just what the data is telling us, but we really want to hear from the patient too in terms of what it feels like for you." - Sleep specialist

### Activity trackers empower patients with data to be more accountable, aware, and motivated to achieve their goals. *Note: this is the view of clinicians about patients, this should be further explored with Veteran research.*

Clinicians repeatedly mentioned activity trackers as a way to motivate Veterans to achieve their goals. The data makes patients more accountable and aware of their actions and the impact. 

> "The Fitbit is more motivational for the patient. They see what they do and the results. It makes them more aware. That is why I think the Fitbits have been so helpful, it helps motivate the patients to continue to move or maybe they're seeing weight results or maybe they're doing a challenge with one of their buddies." - Whole Health

> "Every single one [Veteran] has told me it's [Fitbit] a motivation tool that they find they're more aware of making changes." - Health Coach

> "Fitbit creates so much awareness for them to reach their goals and also accountability." - MOVE Coordinator

> "We train our Veterans to use biofeedback to monitor themselves. Anything to provide biofeedback would be in support of what we're currently doing and expand it." - Whole Health

### Administrators and researchers would like to use Fitbit data from groups of patients to determine if interventions and programs are effective.

Some participants in a research or administration role expressed interest in Fitbit data to look at groups of patients. The current state of piecemeal sharing of data between patients and clinicians and the lack of any data being stored prevent this group from making use of the data. 

> "I'm interested in both physiological and psychological markers that can be fed back to individuals to help them deal with their symptoms. And to measure different interventions." - Research Psychologist

> "I have significant interest in sensor and sensor data and we're using data from other devices for a number of our studies including heart rate and heart rate variability and things on phones." - Research Psychologist

> "It would be really useful to have quantifiable data for our program to include in our research. We're looking for data to understand how we effect change. Is our program something that needs to be expanded beyond our pilot?" - Whole Health Program Manager

## Additional Insights

-   Several participants expressed a desire to be able to provide more Fitbits to patients.
-   One participant had received positive feedback from a patient about Fitbit coaching.
-   Several participants mentioned the pain point of logging into multiple systems to access different information.
-   Sleep diaries done in VA apps (Insomnia coach and CBT-i coach) are digital PGHD, but the data is in another system the clinician needs to access.  
-   Several participants mentioned the value of sleep data. However, any sleep data that included classifying types of sleep (ex: deep sleep) was not viewed as valuable.
-   One participant mentioned eScreener and CareCentra as important technologies in the PGHD workflow.
-   Many participants use activity trackers themselves.

## Recommendations

### Increase access to Fitbit data by bringing the data into the VA ecosystem.

-   All participants interviewed found value in access to Fitbit data.
-   None of the participants had a consistent or repeatable way of receiving data from patients.
-   Fitbit data is referenced alongside other data already within VA.

### Identify a specific use case to design a pilot around. 

-   Fitbits and activity tracking devices provide several different types of data that enable a large range of use cases.
-   Participants interviewed expressed significant diversity in data needs and workflows.
-   Potential areas of opportunity identified include: 
    -   Sleep: provide longer term sleep data for analysis by clinician. Medical grade at home sleep devices are less accessible and only last 2-3 weeks. How might Fitbits provide sleep data over a longer period of time?
    -   Sleep: improved sleep diary. Sleep diaries are done via paper or an app (VA Insomnia Coach). How might Fitbits aid in filling out a more accurate and digitized sleep diary?
    -   Whole Health: Whole Health coaches work with patients to define and meet realistic goals. How might Fitbit data help facilitate and motivate realistic goal setting and tracking?
    -   Whole Health / Diabetes: CGMs require the patient to indicate when they eat or exercise. How might Fitbit data be used in conjunction with CGM data to provide this context?
    -   Bariatric Surgery: To qualify for bariatric surgery, patients are often required to lose a certain amount of weight. How might Fitbit data be used by clinicians and patients to help reach this goal?
    -   Mental Health: Fitbit data combined with other patient data could help identify Veterans for proactive outreach by clinicians. How might we bring Fitbit data into VA alongside other relevant data to identify Veterans for outreach outside of scheduled appointments? 
    -   Research: Several participants expressed interest in determining if certain interventions had the desired effect on a group of patients. How might we make Fitbit data available on groups of patients for this research?

### Identify complementary data used along with Fitbit data that may be needed for the specific use case.

-   None of the participants used Fitbit data in isolation to make decisions. Fitbit data always supplemented additional health and patient-generated data.

### Next steps and further research

-   Research with Veterans about their use of activity trackers.
-   This study included a wide variety of specialties with differing use cases. Once a pilot use case is identified, additional research should be conducted with those in that specialty.
