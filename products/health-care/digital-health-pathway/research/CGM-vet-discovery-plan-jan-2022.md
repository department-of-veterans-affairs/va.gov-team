Research Plan for Digital Health Platform (DHP) CGM Discovery January 27, 2022
==============================================================================

Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.

Background
----------

The Digital Health Platform team's mission is to evaluate emerging digital health technologies that clinicians and other stakeholders wish to assess. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are one of these technologies we are looking to learn more about the use of.  

### OCTO Objectives

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support?

Not directly related to OCTO goals associated with [VA.gov](http://va.gov/), but aligns to these two North Star objectives:

-   Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome

-   Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

### Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter? Taking Care of Myself

Research Goals
--------------

What are you trying to learn from this research?

-   Understand how Veterans use continuous glucose monitors.

-   Understand if and how Veterans share their CGM data with their care team. 

-   Understand how comfortable Veterans are sharing continuous glucose monitor data and for what purposes.

### Outcome

This research is intended to expand on previous research to focus specifically on PGD from CGMs including. 

Previous research to reference:\
[A study done by the Lighthouse team\
](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-ux/blob/master/Health%20Research/2020-08-Perception-of-Patient-Generated-Data-with-veterans/PGD%20discovery%20report.pdf)[Fitbit Veteran research by the DHP team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-pathway/research/fitbit-discovery-veteran-report.md)

This is discovery research that will help determine the value of bringing CGM data into VA and identify areas of opportunity for a proof of concept.

### Research questions

-   How do you monitor the blood glucose readings from your CGM?

-   How do you share CGM data with your care team?

-   What are your expectations of VA if you share your data?

-   Are you comfortable sharing your data with VA?

Reference [discussion guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-pathway/research/CGM-vet-discovery-guide-jan-22.md) for full list

### Hypothesis

-   Veterans are already sharing their CGM data with clinicians through the device manufacturer's cloud services. 

-   Veterans are willing to share their CGM data with VA for their own care. 

-   Veterans expect improved care in return for sharing their data.

Method
------

Moderated interview

### Location

Remote over Zoom

### Research materials

Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials -- including this plan -- prior to submitting a recruitment request.

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

Recruitment
-----------

### Recruitment approach

### Recruitment criteria

-   Six Veterans

-   Currently use a continuous glucose monitor such as Abbott Freestyle Libre, Dexcom G6, Medtronic Guardian Sensor 3, Senseonics Eversense

-   Suggested screener question "Do you use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to monitor your blood glucose? Examples of continuous glucose monitor devices include Abbott Freestyle Libre, Dexcom G6, Medtronic Guardian Sensor 3, and Senseonics Eversense."

-   [yes] - qualified

-   [no] - not qualified

-   Variety of ages, genders, locations
