## Where are we with the pilot? 

The pilot has been put on pause as of **08/24/2023**.

- We have onboarded tier 1 (Orlando), tier 2 (Cleveland), tier 3a (SLC), and tier 3b (WRIISC) Veterans.
- We have conducted interviews for Tier 3 Veterans
- We have onboarded all clinicians to the dashboard 

There were plans to send surveys and schedule interviews in September 2023, since it will have been 6 months since the first tier Veterans were onboarded. Questions have been already identified and live in the [interviews/surveys folder in Teams].

> **Note**
> Moving forward, we need to be compliant with the Paperwork Reduction Act so there is more thinking to be done around how many interviews we do at a time and how we frame them.  

## What insights did we gather during the pilot? 

High-level findings gathered from clinicians and Veterans during the pilot can be found [here](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/DHP/Shared%20Documents/General/Fitbit%20MVP%20Pilot/MVP%20%26%20Pilot%20Plan/DHP%20Insights%20Snapshot_August%202023.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=XjGNKx).
