# Research Plan for Project Special Forces Health API/Apple Health App


## Goals
1.	 What product & team are you doing this research for?
This initiative is part of the Office of Information and Technology (OIT)’s Project Special Forces (PSF) Lighthouse program.  Lighthouse, considered the “front door” to VA’s vast data stores, is the department’s (application program interface) API management platform.  The platform that enables VA to securely share data in a standardized format with vetted partners through the use of APIs.   Standards-compliant healthcare APIs, such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), are making it possible for VA to establish a veteran consumer-driven data exchange.  This exchange empowers the veteran to grant share permissions with innovative technology partners and healthcare organizations so they may access and utilize a veteran’s health data in more valuable ways, driving improved patient-centric care and innovation.  
In February 2019, VA announced that it will provide a new capability for Veterans to access their VA health data on Apple iPhones.  This new capability has been made possible through the Lighthouse program (see https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5199).  

2.	Background: Briefly, what is the background of this product?  What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

One of the initial roll-out of the iPhone capability was to allow Veterans to view aggregated information of their allergies, conditions, immunizations, lab results, medications, procedures and vitals in the Health app on their iPhone. The product has gone through a series of user testing including User Acceptance and Beta testing over the past nine months. The objective of this research is to engage additional Veterans to gather feedback about the product before the formal rollout. 

3.	Research questions:  What questions do you hope to answer after completing this research?

The objective of this research is to gather information about the accuracy of information and the responsiveness of the system. More specifically, we want to ensure that: (1) the Veteran is able to sign in to the iPhone’s Health app and view their healthcare information; (2) the healthcare information is accurate; and (3) the system loads up the aggregated health record within 3 seconds.

4.	Hypothesis: What is your Hypothesis for this research?

The hypothesis is to verify that, given instructions on how to access Apple’s Health app, a participant’s VA health information is loaded in timely manner and the information is accurate.

## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning?
•	Sample Methodologies:  Directed interviews; ethnographic interviews; observation; card sorts; tree tests; guerilla usability testing; usability testing with low- or high-fidelity prototypes; user acceptance testing.
•	Also mention: in-person moderated, remote moderated, remote unmoderated
We plan to use a remotely moderated user acceptance testing methodology incorporating a combination of observatory activities are used to obtain information on the interactions between the Veterans and their iPhone Health app.  More specifically, our team will use a combination of user observation, questions, and timed performance tests, to understand the behaviors and the experience (e.g. emotions) of the users during the process.

2.	Why this method?  How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
From our experience, this method is to most effective way to capture experience of the users throughout the process. It provides a range of information about the interaction between the users and the app. The purpose of observing users allows us to see whether some aspect of the product causes users’ difficulties or identify defects in the product. 
3.	Where are you planning to do your research?  If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc.  If online, mention the tool you’ll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)

This research will be conducted in a virtual setting. The virtual will be provided through a series of 30 minutes labs throughout the day where we 1-5 users will to join during any given lab through GoToMeeting.

4.	What will you be testing?  (Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)

We are testing the VA’s Health API Apple capability provided through the native Apple Health Module.

5.	If remote:  What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)

We will use GoToMeeting.  We may supplement with other tools as well – as yet to be determined.



## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria:  What are you looking for in a participant?  (Mention:  Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc.  Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)
We need at least 25 relatively tech-savvy participants, although we would ideally like 50 participants, who meet the following criteria:
1.	Has received healthcare services from a VA provider/medical center within the past 10 years;
2.	Has an ID.me, My HealtheVet or DS logon for use during testing; and 
3.	Has a personal iPhone for use during testing

2.	What is your recruitment strategy?  (If in person, describe how you will find participants.  If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are any other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project.  If you need help, please contact UX lead.)
We are requesting to draw from the existing recruiting contract.
When:
1.	Timeline:  What dates do you plan to do research?  (If you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.)
Multiple sessions over a 2 week period (September 9 through September 19, 2019).  This is time sensitive and must be completed by September 19, 2019.
2.	Prepare:  When will the thing you are testing be ready?
The product is ready for testing now.
3.	Length of Sessions:  How long do you estimate each session will be?  (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.  e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
30 minutes per session
4.	Availability:  if applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?  Please list exact dates and times in Eastern Time.  Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.).  Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.
The sessions will be held from late morning eastern daylight savings time (EDT) to early afternoon to support different Veterans across the different time zones.  
	8am - 8pm 
5.	Pilot:  Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research.  Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?  
We have already piloted our research, starting on January 22, 2019 with an in person user acceptance testing pop-up lab at VACO.  We plan to test the remote sessions prior to September 13, probably on Monday, September 9.  We can pilot the session with on-staff Veterans.
