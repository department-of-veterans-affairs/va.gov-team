# Questions

1. Intro/Purpose/Warm up: 
  - Migrating MHV functionality to vets.gov, powered by the MHV APIs
  - We talked with Carnetta about Blue Button and she mentioned that we should talk with you to get additional information.
  - Specifically interested in where things stand with images.  
  - Theresa said yesterday that Compliance regulations from radiology have been approved and that there will be a June release for imaging?  Will the be nationally?
2.  Can you walk us through how images will be viewed within Blue Button?
     - DOD, VA, CMS collaborated to add Blue Button to each beneficiary portal
     - was text file, added PDF format, now includes CCDA, going to expand to include radiology 
     - radio button for VA images and reports, list of studies to chose from, click on request for the study of interest, system goes to CVICs?  to generate the report
     - can opt-in to receive notification (via email) when image is ready (could take several hours)
     - when the image is ready, the request button changes to "view"->  new window opens, focus is reports tab where can ready the report, and can download.  If click on image, a rendering of image (thumbnails), lower resolution jpegs.  
     - If want to dowload- packaged all the diagnostic dicon images and report into a zip file, can dowload that file.  
     - Can view lower resolution thumbnails through the browser
     - Phase 2- Veteran has copy and can also share them.  Could based sharing environment.  RNA (Radiology National Association) partnered- has mechanism for patient to generate key, view the file
     - New head of radiology so have to meet with him at VACO and meet with subject matter experts
     - Planning a slow roll out... need to monitor load
     - Briefing for cheif of radiology next week
     - Requirements with technical team, June release.  
3.  Will users be able to save and print the image?
4.  Where are the images stored?
    - caching images for 7 days
    - CVIX?  3 analogous clients with the same need- plan to work together.  
5.  Do you think most users are familiar with what Blue Button provides?  
6.  Do you know where the name Blue Button comes from?  Do you think it's well known by users?
    - group of experts coined the term to offer a uniform icon 
    - VA, DOD, ?  had a blue button and opened up the data.  Other depts. have launched X(color) campaign.  People have right to access data 
    - went with simple format
7.  How often do users enter "self-reported information"? Is this heavily used? Is it mandated?
    - Veterans value the access to electronic health record
    - Veterans value the self reported "want to be able to manage all my data"
8.  Are there any aspects of Blue Button that you think work exceptionally well?
    - Value having access to medical data, access to clinicians notes (is this available now)
9.  Are there any aspects of Blue Button that you think could be improved?
    - I would like a list of my providers and their contact information- limited to primary care
    - More timely acess to their information. They want immediate access to their lab results, test results, and notes. Trying to reduce from 3 days to 1. 
    - Branding- patients don't understand that this means easy access to data.  Recommend co-branding.  
    - Redesign now has "health records" navigation makes it more obvious.  Blue button icon is still there so that association begins to happen. 
    - Redesign helps to connect the dots
    - Patients continue to ask for different types of data
10.  Is there anyone else we should talk to? 
     -  
11.  Is an API being developed?
     - not yet in production.  Supects its on the list but not sure
     - IHE (Innovating the healthcare envorinment)  provides requirement oversight.  
12. Other notes:
     - Will not be an option of Blue Button
     - CCDA data was added in 201? 
     - VA health summary = "C32"
       - Doesn't contain notes, etc.
     - going to sunset C32 and will offer CCDA (can't customize or include patient generated data)
     - patients don't have a sense of why interoperability matters
     - 35,000 access C32, will grow quite a bit when grow CCDA
