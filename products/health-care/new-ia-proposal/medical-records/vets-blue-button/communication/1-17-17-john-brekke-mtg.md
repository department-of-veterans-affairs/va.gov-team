# Questions

1.  Intro/Purpose/Warm up: 
  - Migrating MHV functionality to vets.gov, powered by the MHV APIs
  - We talked with Carnetta about Blue Button and she mentioned that we should talk with you to get additional information. 
 Program Manager with MHV on IT side
2.   What do you see as the benefits of Blue Button?
   - Saves the VA cost of having veterans ask for their records, pulled up anytime 
   - If a VA moves then all their medical information is available to them
   - Daughter is in the navy, wrote papers on MHV.  Getting information and sharing.  
   - If Veterans would do self reported it would be even more relevant
   - Non-veteran accounts (spouses) can also add in their information.  
3.   Do you think most users are familiar with what Blue Button provides?  
    - Flyers and information is all over the place in the appointments area
    - Trying to get all veterans that use the VA to use MHV
4.   How often do users enter "self-reported information"? Is this heavily used? If not, how do you think usage could be increased.
    - 10-15% of veterans actually input data- not sure if it's b/c of education  
6.   Are there any aspects of Blue Button that you think could be improved?
    - Blue Button medical imaging.  Made available to all veterans, limited to 50 patients. Right at the edge of being released
    - Currently pully a lot of data from Meadows, now migrating to VIA.  Targeted to be finished in March.  VIA has some work to do on thier side.  
    - Any enhancements to the API?  Kim would know.  
7.   Is there anyone else we should talk to? 
8.   Other notes:
     - minor tweeks going on with BB, not anything major
     - When a user makes a request for data, the User is notified that the data is being refreshed- information goes through Meadows, etc.  May take 12-15 minutes to get the data.  Notification is on the website.  
     - Generating the report- process time.  Ken Graham can provide statistics on time to process report.
