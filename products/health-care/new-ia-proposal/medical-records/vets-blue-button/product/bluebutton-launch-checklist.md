# Vets.gov Product Management Master Checklist

This is a set of actions for product teams to complete both prior to the launch and immediately following launch of a vets.gov product. The goals of the checklist are to 1) ensure product planning and delivery is consistent across products, 2) achieve a repeatable process that is improved with lessons learned on an ongoing basis 

This is a master checklist meant to be tailored for each product by each product lead.  

Teams should be using this checklist after [discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/README.md) for planning purposes. 

- [ ] Send signed charter to stakeholders, including Call Center POC (Brenda Torres-Hill and Sylvia Palmer) and Kelly O. for PM purposes
- [ ] Identify users required to participate in end-to-end testing; set expectations for time commitment and role
- [ ] Create a migration timeline for both content and systems
- [ ] Create a redirect plan 
- [ ] Identify potential downstream backend systems risks and issues as a result of increased usage on vets.gov
- [ ] Communicate downstream risks and potential issues to business owner; update charter as needed to include this information
- [ ] Ensure business owners understand launch implications and are staffed adequately to handle traffic, process changes as a result of our work, and/or and technical back-end issues on VA systems
- [ ] Ensure that business owners communicate to their staff about the changes that will be taking place and if applicable, ensure training on new process occurs
- [ ] Make sure to coordinate with DevOps team
- [ ] Determine if any changes or additions are needed for the terms and conditions or privacy policy
- [ ] Demos to necessary stakeholders (can include users, VSOs, Congress, and unions, etc.)
- [ ] Implement analytics plan and search updates (e.g., integrate Google Analytics)
- [ ] Define change management plan for existing VA systems with VA stakeholders

- [ ] Ensure VA Business owner product team acceptance of pre-launch product including any known issues
- [ ] Coordinate with Sheila Guiterriez, (our vets.gov Call Center POC) as early as possible to prepare VA call centers for launch and provide scripts as needed (videos and prototype presentations are ideal)   
- [ ] Develop a communication plan for announcing the launch internally and externally; coordinate with Martin Taylor (Sec Office) via Kelly
- [ ] Include in communications plan pre-briefing for Veteran Service Organizaitons (VSO) and Congress and coordinate with Kelly; VSOs and Congress must be briefed at least 2 weeks prior to launch.

  - [ ] Have participants co-located if possible
  - [ ] Ensure vets.gov team has access to all systems prior to testing
  - [ ] Designate a lead coordinator to manage testing and track all items to resolution (may be different from team lead); one vets.gov person is accountable for ensuring this task is done completely and successfully prior to launch
