information between health care systems and/or providers. The goal is to:
• Provide a summary of a patient’s essential health and medical care information that can be used for the continued care of the patient 
• Allow for information about the patient in one health system to be exchanged with 
another health system that is providing care to the patient
• Be used by patients within other computer applications or systems that can accept 
this type of file
