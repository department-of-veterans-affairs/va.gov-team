# Problem Statements and Opportunities

_Statements have been wordsmithed and some similar comments have been combined._

Very few answers to our questions about problem statements were framed as such. Most talked about the opportunity to correct the problem. These answers often shied away from direct solutions, but reframed problem statements as vision for the intervention we're hoping to identify.

There were a few statements that identified a problem more clearly:

- We put too much onus on the patient to figure out what they need or what the right modality is for the care.
- Declogging the in-person services. Less waiting:
  - Prim care
  - Emergency Room
- Our system is strapped from a provider and pure numbers.
  - Access is defined as a problem.

# Opportunity Themes

## Un-clogging VA system resources to provide better care

- Rather than focusing on services and tooling, how do we focus on building those things to achieve better outcomes.
- Better health outcomes
- Get Care will improve VA satisfaction
- If we can allow vets to get the care they need from means other than coming in.
  - We've satisfied the need.
  - If we can reduce the need to come in, it will open up spots for people that really need to come in or prefer the traditional care methods.
- Open up slots for the patients that really need to be seen.
- Find ways to have more follow up without increasing the amount of time providers need to spend.
- Freeing up people to focus on the job they should be doing.

## Removing the burden from Veterans

- Guide people to the right resource based on Veteran needs
- People would be able to navigate VA healthcare without lots of trouble.
- Interaction or continue with multiple sources
- Getting it to them efficiently and within the timeframe their expecting.
- Integrated solution where VA is able to provide a lot of different kinds of care because we know what you are and are not able and willing to do to take care of yourself.
- Lets make sure we provide the right modality of care to the Veteran at the moment.
- Fundamentally, for the Veteran it provides them the most appropriate care with the lowest amount of effort on their part.
- The more you can help someone find something based on what they need and their life journey…
- Provide a veteran an easier way to receive care that&#39;s relevant to what they need in a single approach. I can get care in one place. A unified approach for vets to get care from the VA from all modalities.

## Informing Veterans about their choices

- Having a single point of entry
- Want there to be confidence vets know there are new tools they can find to help.
- Singular place to initiate requests for care now or in the future.
- I know I need something. What are my options?
- Trying to figure out what your options are for getting care. What are my options?
- Clarity of where to go
- getting the word out to people who need it.
- From a marketing perspective to get things rolled out nationally

## Empowering Veterans to manage their own health

- Make it easy for vets to manage appts and have access to every kind of information to support that appointment. Thinking beyond one appointment and the whole process.
- another opportunity to look at whether we&#39;re going to have a single source of Veteran
- Best in class way for vets to initiate their care. Get care when and how they need it.
- Put technology in front of those looking for it.
- Changing how vets think about hc, lets try to provide the info they need to better engage in their health journey and not be passive, they should know more that their provider

# Pain Points

## High Call Volume

- Licensed ind providers (LIP): Calls contact center refills, nurses add these LIP because nurse functionality is limited. Nurses can only refer. If you tell me your symptoms you can get care immediately
- Call volume

## Over-utilized Resources

- Lack of funding/bandwidth for MHV Coordinators
- No-shows
- Supporting Walk-ins

## Information Inconsistencies

- MHV and VAOS don't always show the same information about appointments (video visits)
- Inaccurate location data for an appointment
- Healthcare application status is confusing
- Time lost explaining data inconsistencies
- Time wasted tracking down and confirming appointments
- Internal appointments getting exposed to Veteran
- Backend is complicated 160 databases are pulled nightly to keep MHV up to date every night at least one will fail.

## Under-utilized resources

- confusion between Secure Messaging and Crisis Line
- MHV is not for immediate needs
- Knowing which call center to call
- I want something from VA, where do I go?
- Over 1000 phone lines to choose the right one to call

## Clunky Systems

- Registering for MHV has to be done a specific way to get right access
- How to: use secure messaging
- How to: troubleshoot account resets
- Veterans arrive at dead ends: e.g. a facility address
- Getting access to systems is complicated
- Complicated phone trees
- Personalized data in multiple places (VA.gov, MHV and more)
- Secure messaging has glitches
- Slows down MHV Coordinator work to not be able to support password updates.
- We have a smattering of care options, all over, but not organized into one place and we're adding options that we don't have a place for.


# Veteran Characteristics

**8-9 Million Veterans**

## General/All

- Regardless of abilities or disabilities, everyone has access to the same features.
- Most Veterans.
- People in VA healthcare system
- People who want to get into the VA healthcare system
- Income/Education matches the rest of the country

## Demographics

- Older population uses MHV the most
- 66% from Vietnam era
- Late 60s majority
- Average age is around 70
- Not a lot of response from women vets.
- WWII/low tech
- Vietnam/some tech, dependent on family support
- Gulf/No problem with tech

## Role

- Mainly Veterans (not caregivers)
- Veteran family members

## Comfort with technology

- All across the board in technical expertise
- Elderly use digital tools, sometimes with more help from family

## Care needs

- People who have complex health needs
- People who are navigating the system on a regular basis.
- People who need to see someone in the community because it's urgent
- PTSD and other disabilities that might impact their ability to read
- Those with service connected conditions are definitely going to be a type of Veteran who will use this

Access

- Those with no transportation

# Opportunities

## Get Care solution should...

- Vets.gov/Va.gov is a one stop shop
- Help use VA resources more efficiently
- Connect existing resources that aren&#39;t well exposed to Veterans
- Use the same data set, the same logic across systems
- Bust Veteran expectations about what kind of care is possible
- Proactively reaching out to a Veteran if they drop out of a process. (Like calling back if a call is dropped.)
- Link healthcare application status with the rest of logged in care profile.
- The solution should take place wherever is best for Veterans.
- Result in...
  - less call center calls
  - less missed appointments
  - less people disappointed with VA
  - Less man hours dedicated to solving problems
- Make the roles easy to understand about what you can and cannot do and guide the Veteran through that as opposed to them having to figure it out on their own.
- Helping them get care sooner, more efficiently.
- Streamline the process for events triggered by the vet or the vets data
- They should see what's available to them where they go to do their daily activities

## Get Care could allow VA to…

- Link disability and healthcare in ways they haven&#39;t been.
- Gain a better understanding of the Veteran population

## Optimism!

- MHV
  - MHV sets the benchmark
  - MHV has strong brand with Veterans as home for healthcare resources/interactions
  - We should build on the success of MHV to do more than refills.
- There are systems and resources available that we've never had before
- We've arrived at a point where enough resources are available, enough content that it makes sense to build this thing.
- A lot of opportunities to provide access without requiring them to come in for a 15 min appointment.
- When they're getting care, it's efficient and great. And all of the records are here.
- VA is a really unique area to try things.
- Get Care is an opportunity to define clear scope
- Get Care has a platform with the right people, not siloed. we are talking to the right people, not building our thing to the side. We have the right people who are joined together to listen.

## Useful Facts

- The VA is very large and has a lot of resources.
- One of VA's 4 Strategic Goals: Access to care

## Unsorted

- These aren't "my leg got chopped off" kind of things.
- Do Veterans want to manage in one place and does it matter which place?
- Are we ready to take the plunge and make one single source?
- Transparency: Veterans want to see everything about them.
- If a doctor is wasting a whole day waiting for patients to come, why not give them a whole day to serve patients in a different modality.
- I should be able to go to THE VA.gov and anything else I need to get to, I should be able to get to from there.

#Barriers/Friction

## Coordinating with other programs

- Community Care is going to create higher expectations.
- More people may want to be included to drive traffic to their business.
- Self interest in their own product
- We keep throwing rocks in the well they never hear any splash
- Integration of secure messaging with CERNER
- Integration of administrative GUI with CERNER
- People who work on CERNER don't have time for other things.
  - CERNER makes money
  - MHV serves vets
  - Can't really talk about it because we are supposed to be excited about it.
- Consolidation affects jobs, and resources, but those resources could be refocused to build an awesome new thing.
- A lot of different initiatives with similar goals makes it difficult to add another one to it. The message gets lost.
- Be careful about adding to the collage of URLs we already have.

## Asking more of tapped resources

- Another thing that MHV coordinators will need to support
- You have a two lane highway built for one purpose, but now it has 18 wheelers, etc. - Susan

## Transitioning to new tools and systems

- Products/Tools can take so long to complete that they are irrelevant by the time they are done.
- Transition from what it's been to what it is now.
- Movement to move to a new EHR. There is a lot of focus on this already. People are afraid to make too many changes with that looming overhead.
- VA is so big, so many orgs that their solutions overlap with others which can cause confusion for the end users.

## Accounting for variability

- Sites (VAMCs and Clinics) have different things available.
- If we're offering 100 things for the patient to do, we carbon copy those things into a bunch of places. (Data in tools)

## Adopting new processes

- We're still convincing people to login.
- "We can build more tooling, but people will continue to use what they're used to if it still exists?"
- We are applying old software policies and regulations that the VA has developed that make it hard to move quickly.
- The way we operated on things:
  - Trying to develop solutions for either a very small problem with limited population.
  - Or we didn't have the problem and were looking for the problem.

## Existing issues

- Patient Portal is constantly having technical issues

## Having the authority to get it done

- The magnitude of what&#39;s needed and the authority.
- Continuity of Authority
- Orchestrating the implementation

# Defining success

## Artifacts

- If the outcome of this is a design and a prototype.
- The design. How to make it intuitive to Veterans.
- A design based on a lot of interviews with Veterans.
  - Wireframes, ideally interactive.
  - Mockup and put in front of Veterans.

## Direction

- I think it's a noble effort to try to get to the Problem Statement that we want to tackle is
- What is the North star that we're trying to achieve?
- Identifying or developing a solution to the problem.
- Ways, a few major problems we can solve.
- Problems we can solve and make an impact on.
- Identified some new problems and challenges to face.

## A plan

- Strategy.
- What's the next stage if that IS what we're agreeing to do?
- A set of recommendations which have some broad North Star objective and 1, 2 3 specific sequenced things that we can do now that will set us on the path in that direction
- what it will take to do those things.
- Clear recommendations on a couple of things, ordered, why, what the outcome of each would be.
- Clear vision that's agreed to that's what we are moving towards, plus how to move forward
- Agreement on what get care should be with integration points
- Defining an approach to getting care: Outlining workflows

## Resources

- Viable plan and a big sack of money

## Veteran Needs

- Vet satisfaction and utilization.
- People say that they would report that they find it easy to access VA care.
  - "Yes, because we have all of these different alternatives.";
- Motivate veterans to take an active approach to getting care for themselves
- Consummerizing and personalizing care so they can access on their own terms
