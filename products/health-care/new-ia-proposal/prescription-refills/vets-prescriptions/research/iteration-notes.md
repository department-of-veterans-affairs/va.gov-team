# Next Steps

### Dashboard
- Do we need a dashboard?
- How can we make the landing page more inviting?
- What is the first thing you want to do?
- Should we let the Veteran be able to pick prescriptions to refill individually? 
- What's a better name than "Dashboard"?
- Should we include date of next available refill somewhere?

### Medicine Page
- Rx History - Maybe have a dropdown that helps filter by year
- Action at bottom of list?
- Green bar ghost button was missed
- How do we make it clear that something was added to the cart? 
- If a Veteran leaves the page before checkout but has things in their cart, should we point that out?

### Medicine Detail
- Small enough so doesn't feel overwhelming
- Have pill image here

### Tracking Delivery
- Auto refill?
- If you click "refill again," a sign comes up saying that it is already getting delievered
- When redirected to a carrier's page, should we have a redirect message or window saying that you're leaving the page?

### Secure Messaging 
- Have SM on medication detail page to automatically message doctor about that specific medicine. Maybe have a link that says "Message to Refill this Rx"
