# Rx Research
 
## Purpose
For Veterans to easily refill a prescription, track their orders, and request new prescriptions

The purpose of each usability session is to explore:
How easy or hard is it for Veterans to refill a prescription?
Are the labeling and buttons on the medication lists easy or hard to understand?
Is it a better experience for Veterans to refill their prescriptions individually or in a batch?
Are there any missing information for medication details?
 

- What are participants’ first impressions of Vets.gov and page template prototypes?
- How intuitive is the interaction and design of vets.gov and page template prototypes?
- How clear and actionable is the content on vets.gov?
- How easily are participants able to find what they need on vets.gov using page template prototypes?
- What aspects of vets.gov page template prototypes work well? What does not work well? (e.g. layout, design, interaction features, etc.)
- What difficulties (pain points) do participants encounter when using vets.gov and page template prototypes?
 
### Methods:
- Usability testing
- Evaluate time-on-task
- Since we’ll be looking at 2 prototypes, the  order will be alternated to control for ordering bias  

### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)###
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*
 
Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve. 
 
The team wants to evaluate a couple of different websites today. We want to see what works well, and what doesn’t work well. The websites I'll be showing you are drafts — meaning, not everything is working quite yet. If you click on something and it doesn't work, just tell me what you would expect to happen. 
 
In this session, I’ll ask you to look at the sites with me, and give you time to freely explore and have you show me how you would use the sites on your own. This will help us better understand how to make the site as easy to use and helpful as possible.
 
Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work. 
 
  * We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you. 
  * We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. 
  * This entire usability test session should take about one hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task. 
  * We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately. 
  * If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
  * As we're going through the session, I'd like you to think out loud....  
 
You should have received a consent form in your email from us. I'm going to have you share your screen now so that I can review it with you and so that you can sign it. You'll want to click "get started" to start signing the form.
 

##### First Impressions of website (5 minutes)

Take a look at this website. I don’t want you to click anything just yet, but you can scroll if you want to.

- What are your first impressions?
- What do you notice first?
- Who do you think this information is for?
- How does this make you feel?
- What do you like? What do you dislike?
- Where would you want to click first? What would you expect to happen?
- Go ahead and click. Is that what you expected?

##### Task 1a Refilling prescriptions for [batch version](https://marvelapp.com/6if21f6):
Let's say that you have a number of prescriptions from the VA. You have a few that are running low, and you want to order all your refills. Here is a list of prescriptions you need to fill. Using this website, can you show me how you would do that? Let me know when you've completed the task. 

*Note for moderator: Pull up Rx list for participant during the session*

1. Acetaminophen 100mg
2. Atenonol 15mg
3. Lipitor 3mg
4. Synthroid 25mg
