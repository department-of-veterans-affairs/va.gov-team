## Medication

- Average number of medications that any Veteran would be managing = 11.5
- Average number of medications a Veteran would want to refill at once ~5 (getting is confirmed with analytics)
- Medication status can be viewed on Status of Paper Rx, status of refill request (submitted or in progress), whether you should take the medication or not.
- Pharmacy is goverend by guidelines (how to label instructions etc.)
- VA has a pill bottle label that they follow
- Google National Drug control number for Rx numbers. 

**Thoughts**
Do we need to have all statuses (active, pending, suspense, hold, expired, discontinued, non-va, remote meds)?

## Self-Entered vs. VA-Entered vs. Non-VA

**What we know**

What's the difference between a VA medication and a self-added medication?
- Self-entered is for off the counter medications (ex. Water pills, green tea pills, vitamins are common, supplements)
- Non-VA drugs are also off the counter medications entered by somebody at the VAMC. (user case: Veteran is at the VAMC and doctor tells Vet to get tynelol)
- Only different between self-entered and non-va drugs = who entered it
- Currently VA doesn't have access to any self-entered data. Only want to know is if Veterans prints everything and brings it to the doctor. Eventually VA medical community will like access to this to know if anything will conflict with prescription drugs
- The Choice program is tricky one because technically private practices/ doctors are affiliated with the VA. So it's hard to tell something from the choice program is VA-entered or Non-VA. 

**Team thoughts**
- Do we need to add this option?

## Tracking Delivery

**What we know**

Do veterans need to contact manufacturers for prescription?
- If the medication is coming from the VA, all information should probably go to the VA. Very rare for a Veteran to ever reach a manufacturer. This is a question for curreny pharmicists and medication supply. 
Does the VA communicate with the manufacturer?

Contact in this section goes to VA team. 

## Thoughts
Tracking delivery link should redirect to carrier website (Vets.gov and prototype contractor's thoughts).
1. Should there be contact # on this page? 2. If so, should it be the VA?

**Billing**

- Every Veteran has a different subsidy rate (some Veterans get free medication)
- Veterans get mailed a monthly bill
- There is no way to pull the payment when Veterans put medications in their carts. No payment data at individual level. 

**Thoughts** 
- Don't worry about billing -- At checkpoint, just have review of total and address (and possible how many packages to expect). 


## Secure Messaging

**What we know**

What are all the ways secure messaging can be used?
- "I need a brand new Rx."
- Today no automated way of doing this. 
- Needs to be content for "if this is an emergency, call number."
- Dr has 3 buisness days to respond
- Pattern that is happening more recently is Veterans are taking pictures of their symptoms (ex. rash) and sending to doctors
    - "I'm going on a vacation â€“ people send me medication to new address"

- Veterans are expected to read FAQs on their VA Medical Teams
- Veterans never have a 1:1 dialogue with an indiviudal -- they only know once thet get a reply back with an individual's name (clark, nurse, PCP, medical assistant, pharmacist. 
- Teams are pre-inserted by somebody at the VA
- Veterans cannot form their own team but edit the teams by deleting teams that are irrelevant to them. 
- All medical teams are connected to SM. 


**Thoughts**
- The fact that Veterans cannot edit pre-insert their own teams is not a good UX but _what if_ at every section on Vets.gov, the appropriate VA team is pre-set at the point of messaging so that they don't have to go through a list and choose who they have to communicate with. Ex. On Rx section, secure messaging is already directed to Medical Team. 


## Medical history

**What we know**

Is there going to be a time where we will need to refer to their medical history when Veteran is getting Rx/Refill?
- High level, MVH
- VA notes
- Psychiatrist reports
- Lab reports


**Thoughts**
Not in Rx scope. Focus on having a medication history filter. 

## Notifications

**What we know**

When do users get notifications?
- Users get notifications through personal email. 
- Information on tracking/ Confirmation

## Misc

Why else would you need to call your doctor?
- Outside of Rx, medical reports, symptoms 

Do you always fill your Rx onsite if you're at VAMC? 
- It takes around 45 mins - 1 hr to wait for a Rx. Used to be 2-3 hrs
- The loungers/ older Veterans stay around
- Not all medications are available onsite

## Pending Questions:
- Do multiple Rx refills get delivered in 1 package or multiple packages?
- Could we get access to the guideline that VA uses for medications?
- Is there a way to track expected completed date of a medication?


## New Questions: 
- How many specialty clinics are set up?
