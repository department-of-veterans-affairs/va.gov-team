# Design and Research Approach for Rx Refill

Building on the design work conducted in the 2-week discovery sprint, the vets.gov team will take a fast, iterative approach to designing and migrating prescription refills. 

## To date we have:

* Spent time building empathy and understanding user needs related to prescriptions. We talked to ~6 veterans with varying backgrounds at the DC VAMC to understand their process related to refilling prescriptions. 

* Reviewed usability reports and findings from the VA Human-Factors Engineering team<

## Here's what we're doing next:

* Expert review/user experience audit of re-designed prototype

* Usability testing of re-designed prototype

* Rapid prototyping

* Create wireframes and page flows

* Usability testing of prototypes

* Design visual comps
