Date: 4/21/16

Researchers: Mary Ann Brody, Emily Wright-Moore, Gina Kim

## Key Findings

* Secure Messaging is a pain point for Veterans
  * Veterans want to talk to Doctors 
  * This most likely isn't a technical issue but a human issue; Veterans want to talk to doctors more than Doctors to Veterans
  
* Prescription may take up to 21 days to get Rx
  * Online says that it may take up to 21 days to get first prescription
  * One Veteran said it takes him about 3-7 days to receive his px if he is able to log in
  
* Veterans have long list of medical prescription history (ex. Vets who have been out for 20+ years have 100 pages) and have a hard time finding the most relevant medications.
  * Would like something that helps puts everything in alphabetical order
  
* There is currently no option to pick-up medication online; only gets delivered to you

* Program Support at VAMC said when Veterans ask for Rx refill help online, he tells them to go straight to the out-patient pharmacy at the hospital because it is faster

* Horizontal Navigation/ Menu system is confusing on MyHealthEVet

* A Veteran felt skeptical about refilling Rx online because she wouldn't know to differientate different brands of medication or generic versions. 

* Veterans wish to have clear categories for online pharmacy/ Rx refill.
