# MHV Gap Analysis

This analysis happened after seeing labs and test results, self-entered information in blue button, order history and delegation during a myhealthevet demo at Ralph H. Johnson VAMC and call with Heather on Feb, 7, 2017. We went back into myhealthevet and went through every section to make sure we are not missing anything.

- In case of Emergency
Heather mentioned that some Veterans print these out and carry them in their wallets. One lady said it saved her live in an emergency room because it has her allergy information on it.

## Vetsgov Team Debrief
Gina, Elizabeth, Mike and Clare's thoughts

### Concerns
- Findability of self-entered information
- What is the best information a Veteran should have at hand in case of an emergency?
- We need to follow up on order history
- UX for Labs and tests is ideal if there is a separate section for it

### Things to add to consider for Roadmap
- Self-entered data
  - Currently: On Vets.gov, there aren't any self-entered data
  - What if: 
    - Veterans and caregivers can enter that information for emergency situations or to accommodate those who have head trauma or struggle with memory.
    - Enhance Vets.gov profile page so that we can have caregivers information, and whole health record in one spot. 
- Track package/ Order history: 
  - Currently: On Vets.gov, Veterans can currently view order history of each medicine. 
  - What if: Veterans to be able to track their order history and view each package, bulk shipments. 
- Labs and Test
  - Currently: Users can find lab and test results via secure messages from health care teams 
  - What if: There is a separate section to look at lab and test results so that users don't have to shuffle through old messages or rely on health record section
