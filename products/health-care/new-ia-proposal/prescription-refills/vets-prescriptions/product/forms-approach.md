### DRAFT  vets.gov Forms Migration Approach

#### Current State / Challenges
- 531 forms on http://www.va.gov/vaforms/search_action.asp (as of 8/22); lists issue date, revision date, and number of pages.
  - these forms include forms for Veterans, VA employeed, providers, etc.
  - All of the forms are fillable pdfs
  - some of the links go to other web pages where users download a form (Irene getting numbers on this)
  - X number of forms have an "online" option (Irene is workign to find this)
  -  Many of the forms are variations of a base form (e.g., 10-10EZ, 10-10CG, etc.) (irene looking into detail on this)
- VA has a "form manager" for online forms maintenance: Missie Vaccaro; she ensures all forms on VA.gov are maintained as they are updated by OMB; Brian McCarthy also manages forms for VHA forms; message from Brian 8/19) who was frustrated and concerned aobut our approach:
 - "To generally restate some concerns: 1) Paperwork Reduction Act procedures have to be followed.  The screen shot below reflects the official record in ROCIS, the system in which VA coordinates submissions to OMB, was last modified in November 2014.  OGC, reflecting the legal requirements, suggest that any change to a form or the process by which a Veteran provides information to the government must be reviewed by OMB.  POC for these submissions are in my office, Joni Mixon, and in VA, Cynthia Harvey Prior.  2) The privacy act statement must be added to the form.  3) Ownership.  Organizationally I am the Forms Manager for VHA which makes me responsible for this form; I am more than happy to cede this form and any other that VA seeks to have a link directly on their site instead of the official site that is managed by VHA, VBA, NCA, and VA.   I am concerned about the long term ownership of this form; where it will be found officially; who has the ability to make modifications to it; version control; and the requirement to have paper versions available.  Jenny, let me know if I missed any salient points that we addressed in our conversation. https://www.vets.gov/healthcare/apply/ . I am including Missie Vaccaro, VA Forms Manager (003) and Cynthia Harvey Pryor, VA’s PRA Liaison (005) on this email for their information only. Thank you kindly."
-  the paper (PDF) form and the online (Web) need to be in sync now and in the future. For example, if Congress mandates a change in demographic category language, both the paper and online form should be updated with those changes.
- Regardless of who “owns” the form, there should be one place the PDF copy of the form is available. If it will be the vets.gov website, the VA Forms website should be updated to point to vets.gov so we ensure the public is clear on where to go.
- OMB needs formal notification whenever we change a form and they need to review that change. The online system which tracks these changes (ROCIS) indicates there was no recent update in their tracking systems for OMB control number 2900-0091 which corresponds to the health care application. Any change to design, format and/or content needs to be reviewed by OMB. Therefore, even if no form field labels, sequence, etc. were changed in the move from interactive form on old website to new Web forms on vets.gov, OMB needs to be notified.
- VA gets audited on now it handles forms; we have to take this into consideration w/ our approach.
  

### Recommended Approach (Initial DRAFT - needs to be reviewed by team)
1. We want to focus on Veteran-facing forms only.
2. vets.gov decision required - vets.gov will build a user friendly forms interface for Veterans-facing forms only.
  - VA.gov form managers will link to vets.gov for Veteran facing forms for the "online" version.
  - our current approach with the fillable pdf HCA forms does not seem optimal with the CG and AD versions of the 10-10 form; we should look at that from a Veteran experience perspective
2. Interim approach (until migration completed) - keep the forms on va.gov with a link to the "online" version (like with HCA 10-10EZ).
3. No changes to "ownership" for VA forms; continue to have Missie and Brian own this (since the page will remain on VA.gov throughout 2017)
4. Need to define our process to update / maintain the most recent form on vets.gov; propose a 2-prong approach: 
  - make it clear in charters w/ business owners that they need to notify us of any OMB changes / updates to their forms immediately.
  - define a simple process with Brian and Missy to email "vavetsgovteam@va.gov" whenever they make an update to their site with a new form or updated version of a form.  
5. Include Brian and Missy in pre-launch comms about when we are launching new forms on vets.gov so they can make updates to ROCIS sytem and on their forms page; include this item in our pre-launch checklist.
6. Make the web comms leads (Jenny, Jennifer, Jessica) the vets.gov point of contact for questions on vets.gov forms.
7. Make sure Brian and Missy have all the info and Comms about vets.gov; invite them to next thursday comms meeting and we can all present to them and get them onboard as champions!
8. Add the PRA privacy statement to vets.gov forms (see question below on this)
9. Work w/ Missie and Brian to make sure all on same page.
10. Need to understand if Brian and Missie have same or different requirements


#### Questions for Brian and Missie
- do brian or missie know which forms are Veteran-facing?
- how far in advance to we need to let him know about new forms on vets.gov; what do they need to know
- are ALL forms fillable pdfs? some appear to be links to other web pages? and some links don't work (http://contacts.gsa.gov/webforms.nsf/0/B835648D66D1B8F985256A72004C58C2/$file/sf424.pdf) 
- do veterans just fill out and mail, fax, email the pdf file per instructions?  
- what is easiest way to let you know in advance we are launching a new form?  what do you need to know?
- describe the process whereby you are notified to update the form?
- can we work w/ you and missie on a coordination process in the interim--until all forms are migrated?  who else do we need to involve in this process? 
- what else do we need to sync btwn the 2 sites to meet your audit requirements?
- can veterans sign the pdf form using the digital signature pdf? does this matter?
- PRA privacy statements are specific to forms; below is sample for HCA:
   - "PRIVACY ACT NOTICE: The form will be used to determine allowance to compensation benefits (38 U.S.C. 5101). The responses you submit are considered confidential (38 U.S.C. 5701). VA may disclose the information that you provide, including Social Security numbers, outside VA if the disclosure is authorized under the Privacy Act, including the routine uses identified in the VA system of records, 58VA21/22/28, Compensation, Pension, Education, and Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Records - VA, published in the Federal Register. The requested information is considered relevant and necessary to determine maximum benefits under the law. Information submitted is subject to verification through computer matching programs with other agencies. VA may make a "routine use" disclosure for: civil or criminal law enforcement, congressional communications, epidemiological or research studies, the collection of money owed to the United States, litigation in which the United States is a party or has an interest, the administration of VA programs and delivery of VA benefits, verification of identity and status, and personnel administration. Your obligation to respond is required in order to obtain or retain benefits. Information that you furnish may be utilized in computer matching programs with other Federal or State agencies for the purpose of determining your eligibility to receive VA benefits, as well as to collect any amount owed to the United States by virtue of your participation in any benefit program administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Social Security information: You are required to provide the Social Security number requested under 38 U.S.C. 5101(c)(1). VA may disclose Social Security numbers as authorized under the Privacy Act, and, specifically may disclose them for purposes stated above.
