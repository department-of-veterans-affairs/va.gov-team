# MHV Account Requirements to access Vets.gov features

Currently, users must have an existing MHV account in order to access Secure Messaging (SM) or Prescription Refills (Rx) on the vets.gov website.

- MHV advanced accounts can access Rx.
- MHV premium accounts can access SM and Rx.

A user must follow current MHV processes to create an account or upgrade to a premium account in order to use the vets.gov features.


The vets.gov team is working with the MHV team to address these dependencies.
