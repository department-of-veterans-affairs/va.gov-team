At some VAMCs, there are documents created after a visit with a doctor where he/she goes over your meds. It's called an After Visit Summary. It's printed for you to take with you. When it's printed, it includes a whole section on MHV. See text below. At some point, we'll need to figure out how one goes about getting things like this changed  (AVS might not be the only one):

_Access health resources. Track your health. Refill VA prescriptions. Visit www.myhealth.va.gov ! Ask your health care team about in-person authentication and begin ordering medications and viewing appointments through MyHealtheVet. After completing in-person authentication, click on "Secure Messaging" in MyHealtheVet and select "I would like to opt in to secure messaging" in order to send email messages to your providers._
