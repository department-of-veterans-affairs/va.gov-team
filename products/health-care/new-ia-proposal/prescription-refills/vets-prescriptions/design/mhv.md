# Vets.gov Product Specific Operations and Maintenance Plan

Vets.gov Prescriptions Refill and Secure Messaging functionality interfaces with the MHV Rx and SM APIs. This document lays out the operations and maintenance relationship between those systems to support a positive Veteran experience.

The overall relationship between vets.gov and the VA stakeholders and systems will be governed by the relevant vets.gov product charter. This document should not supersede any items already established in the charter.

## Customer Support

Vets.gov is supported by the Health Resource Center (HRC) customer support center, which provides phone, email, and eventually chat support. HRC provides all Tier 1 support for vets.gov features and functionality.

MHV is also supported by HRC. To the extent possible, the existing support procedures for supporting MHV will be reused for similar issues for vets.gov to minimize friction and retraining.

### Trouble Ticketing Software

Vets.gov will use the NSD issue ticketing system to handle user reported issues to HRC with an expected transition to Microsoft Dynamics when it becomes available. Those tickets requiring Tier 2 or higher support will be routed to vets.gov for initial triage. If vets.gov determines the issue lies with another VA system or requires troubleshooting support from another system, they will route the ticket or communicate with that system as defined below.

#### Tier 2 Issues To Route to MHV

Vets.gov relies on MHV for the underlying data and APIs to support its Prescription Refill and Secure messaging functions. HRC will enter issues for MHV using their existing support process for those functions when the issue at hand is not a vets.gov infrastructure or application error. The existing support process will be used to enter and route those tickets.

#### Tier 3+ Issues to MHV

If vets.gov requires support from the MHV sustainment team on operations and maintenance issues, those should be directed via email to the following individuals on the MHV sustainment team:

- Brekke, John L. <John.Brekke@va.gov>
- Hormby, Thomas W. (SMS) <Thomas.Hormby@va.gov>
- Copeman, Richard L.. (SMS) <Richard.Copeman@va.gov>
- Zallar, Kerry (KGS) <Kerry.Zallar@va.gov>
- Graham, Kenneth J. (BYLIGHT) <Kenneth.Graham2@va.gov>
