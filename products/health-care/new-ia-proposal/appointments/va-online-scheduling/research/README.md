### Questions for Further User Research

1. When Veterans think about scheduling a medical appointment, where do they start? (Type of care, provider, location, cc, etc.)
2. At what point(s) in the user flow of VAOS do Veterans expect to be able to see Community Care options? At the start, if they know they're eligible? Once an API triggers that may make them eligible (e.g. drive time or wait time)
3. Do Veterans understand what a requested appointment means? (Is "pending" clearer? Do they know if further action must be taken?)
4. Do Veterans understand telehealth as a type of service (on the same level as PC) or a format of delivery? 
5. Do the new UX/UI improvements to VAOS make sense to users? Are there any pain points?
6. Revisit discovery (user pathways and content comprehension) around new path to VAOS on VA.gov. 
7. How to flag to Veterans if they need to use the Cerner portal?
