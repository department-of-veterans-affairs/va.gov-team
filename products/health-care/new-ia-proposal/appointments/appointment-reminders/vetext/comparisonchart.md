|  | VEText (Twilio) | Annie 2.0 | AudioCare |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- | --------- |
| **Description:** | Cloud based service | Multiple interfaces; can be used on mobile device or desktop |Off the shelf purchased software |
| **Requirements:** | Sign up on Twilio page to create an account. Clinics must then be set-up to prepare the reminder system to send text messages. Once the side is configured, training will take place on how to set up clinics and for reports. |Computerized system currently in local field testing |Local facility manages contract & set-up; may need more funding |
| **Capacity:** | 893K - 3.4M messages/facility/year (in VISN 22)| 33M national projected text messages and protocol messages over 4 years|120,000 for all years |
| **System Talks to VistA/CPRS:** | Yes - talks to VistA as it is built into VistA | No- Annie does not talk to VistA or CPRS |Yes |
| **Compatibility: System talks to GUI/MASS/Cerner:** | GUI - Yes; MASS - Unknown; Cerner - provided the requirements to speak to Twilio | Based on Health Data Repository where clinical information comes from VistA; source for information could be changed to be compatible with listed systems through Application Programming Interface (API) to pull the data.|Not in Scope - could potentially make the system work with whatever systems we have|
| **Documenting whether patient opts-in/opts-out:** | Auto opt-in; working on consent process for enhanced messaging. The system searches for appointments within a certain date and sends a reminder text to all that have a number in VistA for each patient. To opt-out, the patient can reply STOP|Licensed team members to solicit verbal consent and provide documentation in the Annie Portal |No release form (Pittsburgh has developed their own consent)|
| **Auto/manual update - when a new clinic is created in VistA, is the info manually or automatically added to the text messaging reminder system?** | Manual | Automated | Manual |
| **Notification organized by patient/clinic:** | Clinic |Patient; facility-level broadcast messages | Clinic |
| **Cancellation:** | Automatic with some exceptions; glitches with the software may miss some cancellations. | Manual | Manual |
| **Advantages:** | Large batches can be delivered instantly; Some patients prefer this mode of communication; More private vs. voice calling; Don't have to wait on phone to cancel and/or confirm; 2-way communication | Automated reminders - 3 & 1 day(s) before appointment; Stores patient responses for provider view on demand; Optional features beyond appt. reminders; Use on multiple devices; Create a more universal log in | Already being used in the field; Different versions allow local flexibility|
| **Disadvantages:** | Phone reminders better for rebooking; Harder to access veterans who don't own a cell phone; Initial text doesn't specify clinic; Records have to be correct and up to date for patient to get texts. |Non-secure text messages; Effort to document consent; Cannot automatically cancel the appointment; manual cancellation |Add-ons are expensive; Not consistent between facilities |
| **Cost:** | No equipment or software; 1.2 cents to send, 0.7 cents when patient texts back + any subsequent texts. |Fix firm price contract with $928,500-$3.326 M; 1.5 - 3.7 cents; Planned for increased growth in the next few years. Increased charges for increased usage but cost/text will decrease; current contract cannot cover this amount.|$12,990(base), $2,338 (option years 1-4); Total cost: $5,000 (Volume) + $12,990 (base pay for contract including support) = $17,990, $7,338 (option yrs 1-4); Cost and contract Data is based off of Pitt's contract only |
| **Recommendations:** | Make class 1 software. |Because of the clinical protocols, only a licensed practitioner can get a consent from the patient|Multiple facilities queried but only Pitt VA responded with most information. Get more input on facility satisfaction. Currently 5 sites are using AduioCare (14 AudioCare texting licenses; Richmond, Orlando, Pitt, Montrose , & Altoona have hight usage).|
