## Overview

It has been shown that receiving appointment reminders via text message reduces missed appointments, making hospitals more efficient. This is a standard practice in the private sector, but most Veterans today do not receive appointment reminders via text message.  The goal of this project is make medical centers more efficient by reducing missed appointments. 

VA has built two systems to do this; VEText and ANNIE. We plan to look at both systems and recommend a path forward.
