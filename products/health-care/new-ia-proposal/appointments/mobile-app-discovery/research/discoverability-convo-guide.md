## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We are here today to get a better understanding of your experience scheduling an appointment at VA. We'll take a look at some pages together to better understand what parts of the site are easy to use, and what parts are confusing or difficult. 

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.    
- We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
- I’ll be recording the screen activities and audio as we look at the site, so that we capture your experience accurately. Only my screen and our conversation will be recorded--video will not be in use. 
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. *Start audio and screen recording.*

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

## First Task: Where are they starting from - 10 minutes
*Purpose*: We want to learn about existing patient practices to better understand how the user is currently scheduling appointments at VA.

## Second Task: New MHV Logged Out Content - 10 minutes
*Purpose*: We are working on new ways for My HealtheVet to provide information about scheduling primary care appointments online, before the user logs in to help educate them about online scheduling. We want to learn how users perceive the new content, and if they better understand their eligibility and pathways now.

*Prompt*: We’d now like to show you a page that we are working on about scheduling primary care appointments at the VA. Imagine you want to schedule an appointment online, and you found this page on MHV (go to: https://marvelapp.com/25da441/screen/33981632). What we'll be looking at here is a test version of a website, so some things work and some don't, and some things might look a little off such as dates that aren't very realistic. 

Can you walk me through what you can see and do here? Please try to talk through your thoughts, so that we can understand what you’re thinking. 

### Eligibility Criteria Content
- Looking at this page, can you figure out who can use online scheduling?
- Based on what you read, can you describe what is needed to be able to schedule an appointment online?

### Eligibility Understanding
- After reading this do you think you could use the online scheduling? Why/why not?
	- If eligible, what would you do next?
	- If not, did you see anything on this page that would tell you what's next to make an appointment if you can't do so online? How well or poorly does that look like it'll work for you?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $25 gift either as an Amazon Gift Card or through Paypal. Do you have a preference?

Great, is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address we used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? *If no* Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing. 

Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share about this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you're a part of? If so I can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect folks to us.
