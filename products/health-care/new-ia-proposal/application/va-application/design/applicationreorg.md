# Why are these required...
+ gender
+ mother's maiden name
+ preferred facility (can we collect this after eligibility has been determined?) 
+ do we have to ask the preferred facility question exactly the way they ask it currently?  can we just ask if they want to be near their house and match to their address?
+ ethnicity
+ race 
+ medicade eligibility?? _because this would put you in PG 5... it's poorly worded_ 
+ for the child section are we interested in only children, or children AND dependents? _if child's income supports household income, and number of dependents affects financial threshold_
