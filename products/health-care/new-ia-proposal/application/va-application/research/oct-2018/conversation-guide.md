# Conversation Guide for interviews investigating duplicate HCA submissions

## Intro ~ 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Samara and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about applying for healthcare at the VA.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest experience.** We want to improve things at the VA to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*

### Applying for healthcare

1. Do you have VA healthcare?
2. How long have you had VA healthcare?
3. When did you apply for VA healthcare?
4. Can you tell me about the process you went through to apply for VA healthcare?
- (if not obvious) How did you apply — online or via a paper application?
- What challenges did you face in this process?
- Did anyone help you to apply for healthcare?
5. When did you find out that your application had been (accepted/denied)?
- How did the VA let you know?
- How long did this take from after you submitted your application?

### Filling out a second application

1. (if not already obvious) Have you ever submitted another healthcare application?
- (If they don't remember) According to our records, we can see you submitted the healtchare application we were just talking about, but we also see you submitted another healthcare application around [date]. Do you remember doing this?

- *If they still don't remember*
  - Do you have any idea why you might have submitted that application twice?
  - (If they are particularly insistent they did not apply twice) Do you have any idea why our records are showing multiple applications?

2. (If they do remember) Call you tell me why you submitted that application?

- *If they submitted another application to update information* 
  - Why did you submit another application to update [X]?
  - Did someone tell you to update your information this way? 
  - Were there other options you considered to update this information? How else might you do this?
- *If an original application was rejected*
  - How did you find out your original application was rejected?
  - When did you decide to apply again?
  - What made you confident that your second application would be accepted? Was there anything you did differently in the application process?
- *For any other circumstances*
  - Can you tell me more about when you submitted your [first/second] application?
  - What made you think you needed to submit another application?

3. (If they submitted another application for a reason other than an address change/info update) Do you know how you would update your address, preferred facility, and other personal information with the VA?

### Wrap-up

1. In addition to anything we may have already discussed, how can the VA make it easier for veterans to apply for healthcare?
