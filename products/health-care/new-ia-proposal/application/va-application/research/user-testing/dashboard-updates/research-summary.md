### Goals & What We Did

In March 2019, we designed and conducted [testing on updates to the health care application](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/hca-2.0/research/user-testing/mar-2019/research-summary.md). Since then, we have completed additional updates to the dashboard as part of the larger health care application experience. This round of testing evaluated those dashboard changes.

# Methods

### Dates

We conducted user testing between April 10, 2019 – April 15, 2019.

### Participants

We talked to **5 veterans**:

- All participants had VA health care.
- 3 men; 2 women.
- 2 participants under 35; 3 participants 45+
- 2 Army; 2 Navy; 1 Marine Corps
- 2 white participants; 2 black participants; 1 Hispanic/Latino participant

### Tools

We conducted moderated remote usability testing testing via GoToMeeting and [this InVision prototype](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/PRRG9HJSUDF#/screens/356550641_1-_Intro_Screen). 

# Results & Takeaways

### Participants found the updates to the HCA confirmation page to be helpful. 

These updates added copy on where people could check their application status before receiving a decision from the VA, and more clearly outlined what to expect from the VA once a decision has been made. 

### Not all participants knew about the My VA homepage.

About half of participants didn't know about the My VA homepage and had never used the feature before. However, they did appreciate having a place to check personal information.

**Recommendation**: Eventually combine the dashboard and logged-in homepage of VA.gov.

### People found the information in the "Update"  and "Decision" blocks to be helpful.

For the both blocks, this included their health care application status and where to go with questions.

### Participants understood that removing a notification on their application status would not affect the application's current state or decision. 

All participants understood that removing a "Decision" or "Enrolled" notification from their dashboard would not affect the decision that had been made on their health care application; it would just hide this information from view.

### However, participants were mixed on whether they would want to remove decision information at all.

Some participants saw the decision information more as an official record from the VA and less as an electronic notification. Those people said they would not want to remove it from their dashboard.

**Recommendation**: No changes. In the current iteration of the dashboard, it still feels like it makes sense to have these notifications be removable. It doesn't hurt anyone to offer that as an option, and it's certainly up to each user whether they want to leave that information on their dashboard more permanently.

### People want to see what is included in their health care plan and/or what next steps are along with the "Enrolled" notification.

The existing "Enrolled" notification left people without a meaningful next step and felt like an ending point for a flow instead of the beginning of a new one.

**Recommendation**: Include a link to information about what is included in VA health care in the "Enrolled" notification and a link to the "Manage VA Health Care" section of the dashboard.

### The new "Manage your VA Health Care" section of the dashboard met participants' expectations.

This new section of the dashboard consolidates information that's already there — links to secure messaging, prescription information, and appointment scheduling — and it also includes their enrollment information. Participants said this was the information they'd expect to see in a section for managing health care.

**For consideration**: If we update the dashboard design, we may want to consider organizing the dashboard by benefit type.
