# Conversation Guide: HCA duplicates user testing

### [Prototype](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/PRRG9HJSUDF#/screens/356550641_1-_Intro_Screen)

### Project-specific setup

- Have the prototype ready and minimized.
- Screenshare.
- Be ready to share computer and mouse controls

## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Samara and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about applying for benefits. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 – 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **In this session, we will be looking at a prototype.** This means that we are looking at something that looks like a real website, but it functions a bit differently. For example, some links will work while other links won't. This is for the purpose of testing so we can focus on observing specific tasks. Do you have any questions about this or what a prototype is? 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

1. Before we start, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).
2. Do you have VA health care?
- How long have you had VA health care?
- How did you apply? Did you apply online?
3. Have you used VA.gov before? If so, how often?

## First Task: HCA confirmation page (5 minutes)

Alright, let's go to the prototype. (Review intro prompt). Any questions before we get started? OK, you can continue to the prototype.

Today, you'll see you are already logged in as Kim Washington, and we are starting from the health care application introduction page. Feel free to take a look over this page to get yourself oriented. When you are ready, please click "Start the Health Care Application."

Alright, today we don't actually want to walk through the whole application, so we're going to pretend that you have filled out the application and we're going to jump right to the Review Application page.

Now we are on the Review Application page. You can scan through this page, and when you are ready, you can click "Submit Application." (on confirmation) It looks like your application has submitted.

1. Tell me what you see on this page. What is it trying to communicate to you?
2. How do you think the VA will notify you of their decision?
3. If you wanted to check the status of your application prior to the VA letting you know about their decision, how would you do that?

## Second Task: Dashboard — Updates (8 minutes)

Now I'd like you to click the My VA link that is in the main navigation.

This is the personalized homepage that users can see if they are logged in.

1. Have you ever used the My VA personalized homepage on VA.gov? Did you know that this feature was available on VA.gov?

Now I'd like you to scroll down to the Your Applications section:

1. Can you tell me what you are looking at here? (If needed, probe on what they see in each block)

I'd like you to specifically look at the second block that says "Update".

1. Tell me what this block is trying to communicate to you.
2. Is this information helpful or unhelpful to you?
3. What would you do if you had questions about your application?
4. What do you think will happen if you click "Remove Notification?"
  - Would you expect removing the notification to be permanent, or do you think the notification would come back?
  - Do you think removing this notification would affect your application in any way or not?
5. What about this block could be improved?
6. Do you think you would or would not check your personalized dashboard for updates?

## Third Task: Dashboard — Ineligible status (8 minutes)

OK, let's pretend that it's been about a week and you come back to your personalized homepage.

1. Can you tell me what you see at the top of the page?
2. What is this notification trying to communicate?
3. Before clicking anything, what do you think will happen when you click the notification?
4. How do you think you would remove the notification from the dashboard?
  - Would you want this notification to go away permanently, or would you expect to be able to find it later if you removed it?

Alright, lets's click the link in the notification now:

1. Was this what you expected to happen?
2. Tell me what you see here. What is this status trying to communicate to you?
3. What questions do you have?
- How would you get answers to those questions? What would you do if you needed more help?
4. What would you do next if this were real life?
5. Do you think you would want to keep this information on your dashboard or would you want to remove it now or at some point later?
- Do you think removing this notification will have any affect on the decision?
6. How could this decision notification be improved?

## Fourth Task: Dashboard — Enrolled in health care (8 minutes)

OK, we are now going to look at an alternate outcome. This is something you might see instead of the previous screen you just looked at, but you can assume you would have gone through the rest of the stages of the process up until that point (applying for health care, seeing your application is being reviewed). Any questions?

Now we are back on your dashboard and see the same notification that we saw before. Please click that notification for me.

1. Tell me what you see here. What is this status trying to communicate to you?
2. What questions do you have?
- How would you get answers to those questions? What would you do if you needed more help?
3. What would you do next if this were real life?
4. Do you think you would want to keep this information on your dashboard or would you want to remove it now or at some point later?
- Do you think removing this notification will have any affect on the decision?
5. How could this decision notification be improved?

Alright, now I'd like you to scroll down a little further on this same page until you see the section entitled "Manage your VA health care."

1. Tell me what you see here. 
2. Is this the information you would expect to see in this section?
3. Is there anything missing from this section that would be helpful to you?
4. How could this section be improved?

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

1. Overall, how did the experience we looked at today — applying for health care, checking your application status, and finding out your application decision – meet your expectations?
2. Were there ways in which this flow did not meet your expectations? 
3. In addition to anything we already discussed, how could this experience be improved?
4. Do you have any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to send you a $50 thank-you check. This will be sent by (Brian/Shannon from) Perigean, the people that recruited you to talk to us today. They'll work with you to figure out the right place to send it.

Any questions before we sign off?

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
