Series of final feedback sessions with key stakeholders. We will go back through these to prioritize any final changes. 

# STACEY 

### May 19 Feedback
+ Under "Children's Information" there are a few questions that need to be changed to "yes" and "no" from a checkbox (e.g., Was child permanently and totally disabled before the age of 18?)
+ Under "Annual Income" can we change labels to: Gross Annual Income from Employment and Net Income From Your Farm, Ranch, Property or Business? This should remove the need to have definitions at the top of the page and is clearer. This is the language on the 1010EZ as well.
+ When adding a child or an insurer, there is both a "save" button that seems to do the same thing as continue. Would that button be more accurate as "Add Another"?
+ Under "VA Medical Center" should those checkmarks be "yes" "no"?

### Areas to explore in the future

+ conditional // smarter financial disclosure page
    +  two different sets of copy, based on information to date
    +

### Questions
+ Why the requirements for foreign country addresses? How does it map to the ES?
+ Why are they collecting the foreign addresses? 
+ What about RESERVES + NATIONAL GUARD? 
+ If someone served for 20 years in the National Guard, what would they select in the "branch of service" drop-down 
+ How many people will click to learn more, and how many people drop off? 
+ Why are the "qualifying eligibility factors" shorter than the service-list 
+ Why are we asking if they are ELIGIBLE for Medicade? How are they suppose to know that? _Do you have or are you eligible for medicade?_

# CHANGES TO THE ES
