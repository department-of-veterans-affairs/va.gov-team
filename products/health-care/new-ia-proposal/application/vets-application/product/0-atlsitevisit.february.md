# OVERVIEW 
On April 9 + 10 Emily Tavoulareas (Product Lead) went to Atlanta with the following goals:

1.	to build relationships with the VOA team
2.	to demo the prototype of VOA to-date
3.	to better understand the business process / back-office process of the applications

All three goals were accomplished, and the trip felt like a turning point. The first day was spent in candid and in-depth conversations with Nick Bales (program partner), Joan Hall (former program partner), and Laura Prietula (VOA IT/technical lead). The second day was a day of back-to-back meetings, during which Emily and Joe Stewart met the main stakeholders of NEI, the HEC, and the NRC. 

# MAIN OUTCOMES
A lot happened in just 36 hours. The main outcomes of included:
+ Joan is no longer our day-to-day POC / partner
+ Nick Bales is the person we will be working with
+ Emily will have bi-weekly calls/check-ins with Nick
+ We seem to have earned Matt’s trust
+ Emily will have bi-monthly meetings with Matt when he is in DC for HEC meetings with the DepSec
+ Everyone is now clear on what vets.gov is 
+ Everyone is now clear on what the DS is doing with VOA 
+ Emily now has a clear understanding of what “VOA” means to IT, and everything it consists of
+ Our part of the reform effort is ONLY the future-state
+ April delivery will only include:
    + 10-10EZ
    anonymous workflow (no authentication before fall)

# MAIN INSIGHTS
We learned a tremendous amount in just 36 hours. Many of these insights are not necessary actionable (at least right now) but are important to at least understand about the environment we are working in, and the team we are working with. Top-line insights: 

### 1. The reorg underway has created an environment of uncertainty + perceived chaos 
+ There seems to be a tremendous amount of fear. There is a massive reorg underway that seems to be feeding confusion and a sense of impermanence (and whatever the opposite of urgency is). Employees seem to be afraid that the wrong move will mean losing their jobs.
+ There is a lack of clear (perceived) ownership. There seems to be a sense that Matt and Nick are actually not in charge, when leadership obviously doesn’t see it that way. This may be tied to fear, or it may be a result of leadership not having publically announced plans for the reorg and/or Matt and Nicks official roles. This may be a conscious decision made for strategic reasons, but it likely compounds feelings of impermanence. 
    + ACTION: publically clarify role of Matt and Nick
    ACTION: finalize and convey reorg plans 
+ There is high turnover. Since the OIG report came out there has been very high turnover on the team, with leadership positions vacating, filled by actings, and then vacating again. 

### 2. There is actually a plan for change and clear ownership
It’s just not clear to all employees at the organizations that the NEI effort effects. This seems to largely stem from a perception that Matt and NEI are impermanent.

+ Matt’s ultimate goal is Vets.gov as the home of the healthcare application. We have alignment on this. He wants the healthcare application to live on vets.gov, and for it to be the only application. The vision is for it to be digital by default, and for all other versions and workflows to be shut off. 
+ Matt’s priorities come from the DepSec. This means will change frequently. Our job is to be clear and realistic, and to help Nick manage expectations of leadership.  
+ This is a pivotal week for managing expectations. The week following this trip is critical for leadership, as they are making big-picture decisions on timeline and deliverables. We must be clear about what we can deliver and by when, and what the dependencies are. 
    + ACTION: agree with Nick on timeline and brief Marina, Josh Jacobs, Matt, and the DepSec. Reinforce / agree on timeline in the DepSec meeting on 2/17. (done!) 
+ Matt is concerned about the viability of vets.gov. Because of his desire for a single application on vets.gov, Matt has expressed concern about the progress of vets.gov, and whether or not it will actually survive and be used the way we envision it being used—as the one-stop shop for Veterans (as opposed to website 1001). I have explained the plan for Vets.gov, and that authentication is going to be the turning point. 
    + ACTION: keep him updated on vets.gov progress 

### 3. Since 2012, only about 1% of healthcare applications have come through VOA. 
While VOA can easily be called a botched opportunity, it has not contributed directly to the current problem with the healthcare application system at the HEC. It contributed only insofar as it failed to be a viable alternative to the decentralized paper process. 

### 4. The most serious problem is the backend / HEC / Enrollment System. 
There are over 840K applications in the backlog. Over 250K are presumed dead. While these numbers are far more complex, this is a very dangerous narrative for the agency. We will not be working on the backend (this has been in progress for months) but I do think it's worth spelunking and exploring this system so we at the very least understand the process in case we do get called in later in the year...    
   + ACTION: explore sending in a rogue team 

### 5. There are some very real (and risky) dependencies for this product to launch 

+ VOA has everything to do with the HEC and HRC. It doesn’t seem like it initially, but while our work is only focused on the future-state, the problems at the HEC and HRC could prevent the future-state from launching. If they are not ready to absorb new applications on Memorial Day, we cannot launch. 
+ Removing the Wet Signature is an opportunity and a (temporary) risk. If it is removed and the HEC is not prepared to absorb applications, it’s the HEC is going to break. 
    + ACTION: ensure that the HEC is prepared before taking action on the removal of the wet signature. 

# Notes from ATL
We learned a lot about the environment, teams, products and systems involved:

1. [Stakeholders] ()

2. [Applying for healthcare] () (what does this entail?)

3. [VOA] () (what is VOA? what does it process and how?)

4. [The Enrollment System] () (what is the ES, how does it operate, and what's really going on here?)
