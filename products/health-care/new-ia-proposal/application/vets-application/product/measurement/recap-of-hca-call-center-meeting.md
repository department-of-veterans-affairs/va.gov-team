## Recap of HCA call center meeting, July 6 2016
- Below text is a copy of the recap email sent to meeting attendees

Hello everyone,

Thank you for the time to connect this afternoon re: HCA. Below is a recap of our discussion earlier this afternoon and next steps.

Attendees:
- Sheila Gutierrez
- Mary Anne Brody
- Kelly O'Connor
- Irene Lee

Discussion points:
- When a call comes in, representatives note the business and will notate that the call is re: HCA online
- If there is an issue, the representative sends an email to leadership who then notifies vets.gov leadership to notate, as well
- Representatives can indicate whether a call is re: HCA online or HCA technical issues. With technical issues, the representative can further break down and identify the issue, i.e. access issue, error message, etc..
- Representatives have been provided with five (5) additional questions to ask:
  1. What is the URL the veteran is experiencing difficulty with
  2. What were the steps taken leading to the error
  3. State / Country the veteran is calling from
  4. What is the device the veteran is using
  5. What is the internet service provider
- Getting this kind of reporting and detail would be new so a request must be made. If a request is made, duration to develop the reporting is approx one (1) week
- Since launch, the call center has not received any calls re: HCA
- Per Kelly, the vets.gov team requires an internal discussion to assess the value of new reporting and determine whether to make the request
- Recommendation is to request the build for current and on-going HCA management, as well as in anticipation of future product releases

Next steps:
- Kelly to present the  the vets.gov team to determine whether the new reporting would be of value to request the build and provide decision to rest of team
- Irene to create a "wish list" of reporting metrics, such as call volume, types of calls, AHT, average abandonment rate, first call resolution pending vets.gov determination of value of new reporting
