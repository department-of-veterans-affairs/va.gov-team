Facilities call set up for Tuesday

#### Debrief on yesterdays 10-10 gap analysis call
- 2011 form is still in Vista
- current form = 2015
- our work should not be affected by this b/c we are not using the enrollment system or VISTA.
- parallel effort going on to re-jigger the current form (add/delete)
- 10-10 EZ is a paper document 
- employees have proposed changes to the 10-10EZ + EZR 

> Q [joan]: if changes are going to be made to the 10-10, do we really need to go through this whole process? 
> A [emily]: ultimately it's a policy decision, but if it is true that we can abolish the paper form, then we should be able to make whatever changes we want to to the health application on vets.gov
