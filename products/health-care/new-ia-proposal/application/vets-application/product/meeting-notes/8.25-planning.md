#### 8/25 meeting notes

### Background
- HCA solved "sumbission" problem for online health care application (10-10EZ)
  - Previously only 8% of Veterans were able to apply online due to a browser compatibility issue
- The enrollment process is handled by the VA Enrollment System (ES)
- Following launch of HCA in June 2016, online submissions increased from ~62 applications / daily-- up to ~700 / daily (as of August) 
   - As a result, the backend ES began experiencing increased issues and "locking" of close to 50% of submissions 
- The vets.gov team recommended the following in August 2016 to address this problem:
-   Redirected LOCKED records only to another processing system (Forum Mailman) temporarily while the HEC team fixed the ES; 	Rather than send ALL submissions to FORUM, the team will start with locked records first in order to understand more about causes for locks and how FORUM works. 
-   HCA submissions will continue to come in to the Enrollment System (ES) as they do today
-   Manually work through all locked records as quickly as possible
-   Increase resources to fix ES system; vets.gov team offered engineering support, to complete fixes in a 1-2 month timeframe
-   vets.gov team emphasized the risk of over-correction of ALL submissions to another unknown system at that point in time and strongly recommended against it.
-   HEC team did NOT take vets.gov recommendation, and instead redirected ALL submissions to a new system / process (Forum Mailman); as a result this new solution is having issues as well--and has about the same fail rate of 50%.
-     vets.gov team has zero visability into this new solution or the technical root causes.
-     HEC team is not allowing vets.gov team to be involved or guide technical solution at this point
- vets.gov engineers are not providing value add activities.

### Action / Decisions Required
- need to make a decision about vets.gov role going forward since we have completed our fix the "submission" part of health care enrollment. our scope has never included the backend enrollment part of this process.
- need to cooridnate w/ Matt E. on roles and go forward strategy; vets.gov team cannot continue to support the current approach
- need to clarify w/ sloan our role
