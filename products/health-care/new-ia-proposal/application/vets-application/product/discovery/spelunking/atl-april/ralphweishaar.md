high level
----------

  - Mentioned cory kilts again


notes
-----

  - Broken things being sent to the enrolement center
  - Things get put into the VOA system and have to be sent to the Enrolement
    backend.
  - "usability of the software"
  - "Not actually an online application"
  - centralizing the entrypoint through vets.gov
  - "What happens after we launch this"
    - "Turn the other worlflows off"
    - Online app would be the first to kill
    - "whole suite of forms - EZR, etc"
  - decouple application from enrolement
   - where some folks use enrolement to register, rather than VISTA
   - vista every hour pulls data
   - registration is for a single appt
   - enrolement is for healthcare
   - if you register without enroled, they'll be charged the humanitarian rate
  - "What have we missed in the enrolement system"
    - communicating with the vets
  - Things from VBA:
    - Honorable vs Dishonorable
    - "Months of not years"
    - DoD Mental Health care
      - automatically enrolling them in VA healthcare
    - We access data from DOD from
      - VADR

What is misunderstood
---------------------

  - vets perspective
    - which PG they're in
    - income verification process
    - How this relates to the ACA
    - HEC processes enrolements - when they only do about 7%
    - the other 93% are done at facilities **THIS IS A HUGE POINT**
    - done via VISTA
      - "inputting the application"


July
----

  - Everything else is shut down and everything is moved into vets.gov
  - people actually use it
  - "July 5th is the effective data where they can enroll over the phone"
  - HRC will be taking those calls too, as well as an outbound campaign


What is pending?
----------------

  - processing
    - missing financials
    - don't have military service data
  - MVI offloaded that created pending
  - records from VISTA that create pending records
  - VA Employee seeks care at a facility  
  - CNP exams show up as a pending record since they don't apply for enrolement

VBA

```
HINC
eFolder
VIS
BGS / CorpDB
MVI - IPT Working groups - date of death working group
      IPT for health address management
