=====================

First day on site. Got in, Deloite people were in the room. We had to kick
them out (sadsies). Got in around 10:00 AM, after talking at Waffle House
at 9:00.

Josh turned out to be remote in Texas, so we phoned him into the room.

Josh is frustrated by a lack of communication during deploys. Let's get Josh
involved in our deployment pushes. Access to staging to test?
