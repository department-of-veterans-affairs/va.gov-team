#### Review with Corrie (3:30PM) 

- Many veterans would rather have you ask all the questions up front than in stages
	- Mother's maiden name and place of birth is often used for confirming someone's identity
- We ask if you are currently insured for 3rd party billing
- We don't use their responses for what level of connected disability they are, we verify with VBA anyway
	- Instead of asking what % service connected compensable they are, we should instead ask if they are receiving disability benefits from the VA at all
- Instead of "SW Asia Gulf War" can we just say "Persian Gulf"
- Ask Dane: how many people say they are service connected or meet one of the military service requirements but we cannot verify that information for them
- Receiving a VA Pension also automatically makes you eligible for health care (comes from VBA)
- You are truly receiving Medicaid, that means your income is below the threshold and you're elgible for VA health care too
	- We should ask are you receiving Medicaid, not are you eligible for Medicaid
	- Only way to verify Medicaid is to show your card at a VA Health facility
	- If you are receiving Medicaid, it would help if you can scan your card and upload it in the documents
		- The problem with that is it requires people at the HEC to verify each scanned copy of the Medicaid card
- What would be great is if they can't be automatically verified, we send them a notification saying they need to upload a DD214
- Does the enrollment system recognize the form type? Does it know the difference between a 1010ez and a 1010ezr?
- Need copy about homelessness when we ask for address
