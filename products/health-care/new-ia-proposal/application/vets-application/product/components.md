Stuff being currently discussed in future state


## Concierge for care 
Goal = to create an automatic enrollment / before veterans transition out of the military. 

+ Meeting with Susan Kelly at DoD 
+ Desire to direct them to other government resources 

This is a #1 priority from the WH.

+ 5 year window 
+ 3 year window
