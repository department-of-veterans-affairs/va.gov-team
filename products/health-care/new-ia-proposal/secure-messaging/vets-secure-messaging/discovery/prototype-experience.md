## Purpose of this document:

The purpose of the document is for the vets.gov team to spend some time with the prototype application to understand how it works and how it compares to the current experience. Many of the things we pointed out have been known issues within the VA for some time.

## Current Pages:

### My HealtheVet Prototype - Inbox:
![My HealtheVet Prototype - Inbox](Screenshots/SM-Prototype-Inbox.png?raw=true)
There is no longer a trash, it has become archived. I'm not sure what the "No messages found with the current settings, please try again" is associated with. There is also a print link on every page now and a subject line has been added. An important message and crisis disclaimer has been added at the top of every page as well. 

### My HealtheVet Prototype - Inbox with hover:

Advanced search now shows up as a different page vs and an accordion in the current experience. 

### My HealtheVet Prototype - Inbox Search:

![My HealtheVet Prototype - Notification off](Screenshots/SM-Prototype-Inbox-Nortification Off.png?raw=true)
Turning on and off SM notification is now at the top of every page, where it was previously hidden in a preferences page and there is no longer a choice of each message or daily.

Now there is no empty table when there are no messages.

### My HealtheVet Prototype - Select Folder Dropdown:

Can't move messages to archived. Not sure how messages are moving to archived.

Message box looks like a box you can edit.

### My HealtheVet Prototype - View Message Thread:
![My HealtheVet Prototype - View Message Thread](Screenshots/SM-Prototype-Inbox-View Message- Message thread.png?raw=true)
The accordion for the message thread is a new feature where it was just previously displayed as a flat view. 

### My HealtheVet Prototype - View Message Workflow:
![My HealtheVet Prototype - View Message Workflow](Screenshots/SM-Prototype-Inbox-message workflow.png?raw=true)
For one message in our test account, instead of a message thread there was a message workflow.
