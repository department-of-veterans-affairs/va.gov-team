### What is the purpose of a discovery sprint?
The purpose of USDS discovery sprints is to quickly explore a pressing agency challenge by partnering agency personnel with a small cross-functional team from USDS. 

For vets.gov, the purpose is to quickly explore the current state of a new content area or product—to kick off the initial design and planning of a project. We apply the same methodology as a traditional USDS sprint, although instead of producing a report of recommendations, we produce next steps for ourselves to move forward on the project.  

**By the end of a discovery sprint, we will have a good understanding of:**
- The problem(s)
- The type of project it is
- Areas of opportunity
- Systems, teams, people involved
- Level of effort to complete the work
- Technical feasibility
- Documentation/evidence to support our decisions
- Stakeholder roles, needs, and motivations
- User needs and motivations

### Secure Messaging Specific Discovery Questions
Scope:
- What is the current experience of Secure Messaging on MyHealtheVet? 
- Are there any key critical issues with the current veteran experience on MHV? 
- What are some of the key veteran needs with SM? 
- Can the UX be moved to vets.gov without impacting the physical/health care provider process and tools? [yes: Carnetta meeting Aug 4]
- What is most important to stakeholders as it relates to SM?

UX:
- What is the experience in the in-progress prototype? 
- What do veterans think is working and not working? 
- What is the end-to-end process and experience for SM? 

Technical:
- What are the existing systems that the new UI will connect with? 
- What are the assumptions and potential risks with the existing systems?

### Initital Stakeholder Meeting Agenda
- Introductions
- Overview of vets.gov/guiding decisions
- Introduction to what we hope to accomplish with Discovery Phase
- Discovery Questions
- Determine next steps, key contacts and follow up meetings

### Outcome of a sprint:  
The most important documentation to come out of a sprint are:  
 1. Slide deck & presentation for internal team covering the current state, potential concerns, areas for opportunity, and recommendations/next steps  
 2. Draft charter — once the internal team has a chance to meet, the team can finalize the first iteration of the charter to get it in front of stakeholders and start work on the project.   
 
Other documentation that might come out of a sprint:  
 - User research protocols with: research questions, script, and testing plan  
 - User research and UX artifcats like journey maps, wireframes, etc.
