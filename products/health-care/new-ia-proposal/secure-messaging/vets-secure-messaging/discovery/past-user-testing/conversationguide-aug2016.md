### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve.

The team wants to learn about the secure messaging application process today. We want to see what works well, and what doesn’t work well.

In this session, I’ll ask you to tell me about your experiences with the messaging process, and give you the option to show me how you use the sites or any other tools. This will help us better understand how to make the site as easy to use and helpful as possible.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.

  * We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.
  * We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
  * This entire feedback session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
  * We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.
  * If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.




### Main questions

- Can you tell me a little about your time in the service? Where did you serve, in what branch?
- Can you tell me about the ways you've contacted VA medical professionals in the past year?
- How did you find out about Secure Messaging and learn to use it?
- What is using secure messaging like? How does it compare to other ways you can contact the VA medical team?

#### Current interface
- We'd like to take a look at the system and have you walk through it with us. I'm going to share my screen and give you control of a fake test account that won't have any real personal information. Can you give me a tour of how you've used this system to contact your medical provider with a question about your care? Please talk out loud about what you're doing, which parts you like or dislike, and things that could make more sense.
- Have you used a thing where you can sign your messages here? How did that work?
    [Follow-ups as needed about the steps of the process]
- Have there been things that were confusing or difficult?
- If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?
- What are the easiest parts of the messaging tool that should be kept as-is?

#### Prototype interface
- Now I'd like to compare that to a prototype of a new way that secure messaging could work. Let me switch which we're looking at, and then I'd like you to talk me through as trying to do the same thing as before – contact your medical provider with a question about your care.
    [Follow-ups as needed about the steps of the process]
- How does this one compare to the first version we looked at? Which do you prefer, and why?    

*Tasks*
- Let's say you were looking for a message from Dr. Schulze about a recent lab result. How would you find that message?
        Things to look out for: 
        - Does user search by looking at subject first or by Doctor's name?

- Lets say that you have 4 concerns:
        - You need a prescription renewal for your joint medication and heart medication.
        - You want to make an appointment for a checkup
        - You want to see your blood pressure results from a week ago. 
    Tell me what you would do in order to complete these tasks.

*Additional Questions*

- What's your favorite messaging tool?
    - If user is struggling, bring up texting, email. Ask about which email service. Get very specific!

- What makes an exchange of messaging feed secure to you?

- Show Vets.gov homepage (allow user to click around)
    - Where on this site would you expect to find secure messaging? Why? 
    - What else would you expect to find in this section?
