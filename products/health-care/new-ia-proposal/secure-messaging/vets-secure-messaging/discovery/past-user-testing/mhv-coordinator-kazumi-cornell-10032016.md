## Notes from call with Kazumi Cornell, MHV Coordinator

- 8 years as coordinator
- Manages secure messaging portal for the site
- Super user
- Uses SM as a staff person as well
- Not a clinician HIMES?
- If you talk to other coordinators we come from all sorts of backgrounds
- I approach it from a medical records standpoint

- Test patient
- EMR
- VistA CPRS -> MHV -> single sign on -> she's on every team, most people are just one team and doesn't normally take this long to log in. She experiences a lag. Primary care teams 4-5 a day
- Here inbox 1066 messages
** primary care team
inbox ->
as the admin can build a team

### Edit a triage group
- Group name, providers, clinics. 
- Coordinator memorizies clinic name by condition/issue + location + provider- PUG HSM ART
- carlos front line -> leslie need to get message to doctor bach -> she will get an email in her inbox
- doesn't like it when to click too many things at the same time, the session expires

### Triaging + subject categories
doctor, one person, or group of people (team).
general inquiry is usually the default
as a user I find it useful

### Character limit
- Character limit would help. 
- Some patients go on a rant. 
- Some other staff will say no and let them ramble


Inbox -> read the body of the message, if it's beyond your pay grade bump it up 
don't want it to go directly to the provider
support assistant can reply back, front line can address it at their level
concerns of lab results, beyond scope of practice then they bump it up to the nurse, nurse would then be able to reply

### Clinician workflow

1. open message
2. read message
3. look up patient and see if it was resolved
4. goes back to VistA to look up patient, it was addressed
5. I would make a comment that it was completed  
6. submit

#### Other options
- send an email if not resolved 
- could also be reassigned
- update their phone number 
  - if it was assigned to nurse, this is an admin issue, assign it to another person.
  - I don't have the key to update information, I would reassign it to eva jackson and include a note, "note sure if the phone number is updated."
  - submit
  - now it's reassigned to Eva and now she has a note
  - i'll probably go back later and close it out
- check a patient's record and appointment to verify facts
