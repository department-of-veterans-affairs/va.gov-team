# Agenda

- Any new updates from OCTO/IVC/VTP for teams to be aware of?
  - No
- What is each team working on in their current sprint? (Specific or related to our MVP scope)
  - Figma - BT question userflow wireframes
  - Figma - Appt detail page design wireframes
  - Figma - Userflow
  - [Documented draft of appt details page interact with vets-api and new travel-pay-api](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/beneficiary-travel/engineering/high-level-sequence.md)
  - Starting soon: UX will complete research on the details page as part of this work
  - **Open item (not MVP):** can’t deep link to one claim currently, e.g., from an Appt detail page
  - BT Claim Status Tool on VA.gov updates (not directly tied to filing a claim from a past appt)
    - Null state for Status Tool
    - Status language research: relevant to Status Tool
- Blockers? Document mitigation plan.
  - Consider caregivers, e.g., feedback from Martha at design intent - might be different process. Or, address in content in our simple-claim flow. 
- Any collab cycle touchpoints or CAIA support to prepare for? (Design Intent with platform happens immediately before this meeting. Probably good to do Midpoint Review together as well.)
  - One feature flag sounded like a good idea = one staging review  
- Understanding where one team’s work ends and another team’s work begins
  - [https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/beneficiary-travel/engineering/work-streams.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/beneficiary-travel/engineering/work-streams.md) 
- Questions:
  - We talked about bi-weekly meetings, but do we need to pivot based on any changes in either team's priorities? 
    - 30 min touch base (bi-weekly)
  - Figure out timeline (Lori)  
  - Eng meet as needed for tech discussions (Kevin ~to set up~ scheduled)
