**NOTE: THIS IS FOR ENTRY POINTS ONLY, UX AND FE ENGINEERING. TEAMS CONTINUE TO OWN THEIR CORE EXPERIENCES**		

As the Travel Pay experience expands and more entry points become necessary, this document outlines a discussion around the entry points for the Travel Pay MVPs on Web and Mobile. Note that this is *only* for the entry points, i.e. the bridges between one experience/page/flow and another.

This doc outlines an understanding of responsibilities discussed on 10/15 with Kristen McConnell and Mark Dewey (along with the UAE and Travel Pay teams), and is pending review from the VA Health and Benefits team.
