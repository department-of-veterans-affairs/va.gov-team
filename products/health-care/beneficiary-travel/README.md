### Check-In Experience

 <summary>Check-in app integration</summary>

[Wilkes-Barre Pilot Summary/Release Plan](/checkin/release-plan/check-in-travel-release-plan.md)
  

As Veteran, I want to submit a travel claim during the check in process

For the vets facing work, we are currently using the Check In Team for a bulk of the work since our first integration is Check In app. For the API we are using JIRA. 

- GitHub label = `HCE-Checkin` 
- [JIRA board](https://vajira.max.gov/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=7791&projectKey=BTSSS)

This is going to change in the fall of 2023.
