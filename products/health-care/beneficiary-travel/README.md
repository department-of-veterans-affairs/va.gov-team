# Beneficiary Travel (BTSSS)
BTSSS is a stand alone web application that allows Veterans to submit and manage claims to be paid back for mileage and other travel expenses to and from approved health care appointments, and to manage associated data.

## About the Product

### Vision
Deliver a seamless and positive experience for any Veteran who needs to submit or manage travel claims, with a focus on automated processing of most claims.

### User Problem Statement
Veterans are not able to easily discover, access, authenticate into and complete travel claims using BTSSS due to a complex user experience that was not built using human centered design principles. 

Staff travel clerks often have to take manual steps to fix, validate and process claims that were entered erroneously or on paper.
