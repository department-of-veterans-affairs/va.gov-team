# Beneficiary Travel Self-Service System (BTSSS)

The goal of our team is to develop a Veteran-facing user experience that enables users to complete travel reimbursement tasks across VA.gov. As part of our project, we'll review the legacy BTSSS portal and partner with teams to integrate relevant features and functionality with BTSSS services.

The legacy Travel Claims Portal is a stand alone web application that allows Veterans to submit and manage claims to be paid back for mileage and other travel expenses to and from approved health care appointments, and to manage associated data.

As Veteran, I want to submit a travel claim during the check in process

For the vets facing work, we are currently using the Check In Team for a bulk of the work since our first integration is Check In app. For the API we are using JIRA.
