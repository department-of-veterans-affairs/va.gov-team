# Travel Pay on VA.gov Team Charter

## How we work

### Scrum Ceremonies and Other Meetings

- Standup: M/T/W/Th except for alternate Tuesdays when there is sprint planning
- Mobile standup: daily at 11 am ET
- Backlog Grooming
- Sprint Planning: every other Tuesday at 11:30am ET
- Sprint Retro: Easyretro used here. Historically, columns are “what went well, what could improve, action items.” Team fills out first two columns solo, then we sort/vote, read them out, and populate the action items column together.
- Shared Demo: UAE has a shared demo every sprint, currently on Wednesdays. We populate slides on a shared deck.

- UAE Scrum of Scrums (Mondays): weekly meeting which includes stakeholders
- BTSSS Scrum of Scrums (Fridays): weekly updates across the BTSSS Migration teams
- BTSSS working session: a session run by the API and Base Teams with some stakeholders from VTP and OCTO
- TCP to VA.gov migration sync: meeting with Veterans Transportation Program (VTP) and OCTO

### Ticket Maintenance

#### Labels

- All tickets must include the `travel-pay` label
- Web and native mobile work is distinguished by respective labels: `travel-pay-web` and `travel-pay-mobile`

Columns
- New Issues: unrefined, issues with no estimates; these may be added either as part of an initiative specifically or randomly as issues come up
- Product Backlog: everything in this column should be in priority order, even if not entirely refined
- Tech Debt: we have found that items in a separate tech debt column have been helpful to track and pull from when we have extra time in a sprint
- Epics and Initiatives: each key initiative is broken down into epics.
  - For example, Simple, Mileage-Only Claims is an Initiative and has a variety of epics within that, each comprising many task-level tickets. Initiatives and epics live together in this column. Collab cycle tickets also live here.
- In Progress: tickets that are in progress.
- In Review: tickets that are usually under platform review or team member / stakeholder review
- Done
- Icebox: tickets that are not prioritized at the moment, but have been flagged as work that needs to be revisited. Defrost quarterly.
