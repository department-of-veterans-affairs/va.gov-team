### Study name: Federal header authenticated menu usability
**Team/Researcher:**  Liz Lantz, Authenticated Experience

**Date:** 2/1/2024

**Link to study:** [Research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/discovery-research/authenticated-menu-usability)

**Takeaway:** One participant added "Travel benefits" to their authenticated menu during a prioritization excercise, because they know it's important to many Veterans. They said they stopped using the benefit themselves because it's not worth the hassle of submitting a claim.

>P:  Well, I was thinking about putting it [travel benefits link] above profile, but travel benefits is something that only some veterans use or get. And you know, it's good for to be there, but it's not like a major thing. Because I can get travel benefits, but once they went from the paper process to online, it's not worth my time and effort to even worry about it. And it's only like 5 or 6 bucks, but you know. If you have to, you know, if you go, if you have a lot of appointments, it helps you, but. It's not really worth time or effort to put into it. So that's why it's at the bottom [of my authenticated menu].

### Study name: Personal health care contacts usability
**Team/Researcher:** MHV Cartography team, Jonathan Nelson

**Date:** November 2023

**Link to study:** [Research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-health-care-contacts/discovery-research/2023-10-personal-health-care-contacts-usability)


**Takeaway:** P1 talked about frustrations with all the different systems VA requires them to navigate, travel pay being one of them.
>Yeah, for travel pay I think they said they are getting rid of checks for travel pay and you have to have a direct deposit. I'm going to pull my hair out. I'll be calling the VA for that one. 
Being able to get to something directly is good too. Because I would go to My HealtheVet and click blue button, but it puts me into another system where I have to log in. So in general, to streamline it as much as possible is the best.

### Study name: Profile multi-feature UAT and generative research
**Team/Researcher:** Authenticated Experience, Liz Lantz

**Date:** October 2023

**Link to study:** [Findings summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-10-UAT-edit-as-subtask-default-send-checkbox-ui/findings-summary.md#travel-pay-painpoint)

**Takeaway:** One participant shared frustration that they’ve never been able to successfully use BTSSS to submit a claim for travel pay, and had missed out on $350 to date. They felt the site had a bug, and had attempted to call the MHV help line, and get help in person at their VAMC with no luck.

### Study name: Logged-in wayfinding research

**Team/Researcher:** Authenticated experience, Liz Lantz

**Date:** January - April 2023

**Link to study:** [Research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/)

**Takeaway:** This was a multi-method research study that included evaluating analytics, qualitative data, and user interviews.  Travel pay issues came up all areas.
- [A review of qualitiative data](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/qualitative-data-findings.md#what-do-people-have-trouble-finding-on-vagov) revealed that travel pay came up most frequently in comments related to not being able to find things on VA.gov
- [Analytics showed keywords related to travel pay among top keywords](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/analytics-review-findings.md), suggesting people are having a hard time navigating to this information on the website.
- The user interviews revealted the process of requesting travel reimbursement is a pain point. ([finding detail](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/findings-summary.md#the-process-of-requesting-travel-reimbursement-is-a-pain-point))

  >One thing that I’ve always told him that he needs to tell you when he’s doing one of these surveys [research studies] is about entering in for Travel benefits. It’s starting to get better but for the past year, it’s been unbelievable. And I mean, you really have to be a computer wiz to upload a travel letter. He says he goes to a provider outside of the VA, and he does for his back. But trying to get that letter, that he went to the appt, upload it so he can get travel benefits for it, is almost impossible. - P1 caregiver

  >I couldn’t do it [submit travel reimbursement without help]. You’ve got to go around the page so much. I have to have it big enough that I lose it. - P1, who has low vision and relies on magnification software to use computers

**Takeaway:** In the [post login-comments doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/8a5ebeccab14ac3cc37b70592396d30990638458/products/identity/Research/2023-02%20Desk%20Research/VA%20login%20post%20comments.md), two people talked about travel pay issues

> I hope the new VA director will do things for the benefit of all of us Veterans. Many things at the VA are more fitted to provide jobs for the staff than for the benefit of the Veterans. I have tried to question the performance of the travel personnel to have them spitefully hold my travel pay for nearly a month, thus far. The “in manual review “ is used to delay our payment, which the BTSSS is supposed to facilitate…!

> Trying to get travel pay is now a nightmare. What was wrong with the old simple system? How many old veterans don’t have computers or smart phones?



### Study name: My VA Payment Info and Onsite Notifications Research
**Team/Researcher:** Authenticated Experience, Liz Lantz

**Date:** January 2022

**Link to study:** [Findings document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/6591a206f2ed17e91143bf9a69c770fa99aaa25f/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings.md)

**Takeaway:** 2 participants shared frustration with the new process to request travel reimbursement.
>First of all, with VA travel, you have to go to eauth.va.gov/access-va. And, so you get to that site, and it’s a number of steps. it’s real confusing to try to fill out a claim. Its not so bad if it’s for travel to a VA but it if it’s to somewhere else (e.g. pain center) they want you to upload the letter that you get to verify the fact that you went to this appt. They’re suppoed to have the appt, they approved the appt for outside places. They don’t tell you how to upload the letter at all. If you do, I think I did upload one time, but then they got it and it sat in review status for 6 months and I ended up going to the VA office and I took a copy of everything I submitted and did it manually. She said she would do it once but that I had to start using the online system. But they don’t have the non-VA locations available. When you try to create it, it’s so hard. They just made it more confusing than they ever needed to. - P17
