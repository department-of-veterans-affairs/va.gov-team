# **Intro \- 5 minutes**

## **Past experiences**

1. How do you typically get to your VA medical appointments?  
- Normally i get a link from VA on my text messages. Most of the time i go there to do my travel because it prompts me immediately to go in. recently didn’t get that so I found it on the app. And wound up getting it there because it was easier there
- Typically travel by car. One time used ride share - didn’t claim travel for it can’t remember by, might have been before I was service connected

2. Have you ever submitted to be reimbursed for traveling for your VA medical appointment?  
- See above response
3. If you have submitted to be reimbursed for traveling before, did you have to upload evidence like receipts? Please describe your experience.
-  No have never done that
4. What are your expectations about Veterans being reimbursed for traveling for VA medical care?
- I think it’s a very nice added bonus so to speak. For me I only travel 5 miles down the road, not that bad. But my spouse works at the VA and knows people who travel for 2 hours. If had to travel 2 hours would definitely want to be compensated. If travelling to the main VA closest to her would want to be compensated


## **Moderator note: Alternate task order** 

## **Version A (tested second)**

## **Task: Submit travel claim**

***Task:*** Imagine that a few days ago you drove to the VA in another city to see your cardiologist.  You encountered a road with tolls and had to pay for parking. Now, you want to be reimbursed for your travel costs for that appointment.  Using this prototype, show me how you would request this reimbursement.  

**Questions from:** Intro page

Skipped because covered in Version B

1. Tell me what you are looking at. 
2. Do you think you can be reimbursed? What tells you that?  
3. What do you think that you need to know in order to get reimbursed? What tells you that?  
4. What items or information do you think that you will need to complete this process? What tells you that?  
5. Looking at this page, what do you expect to happen next? What tells you that?

**Questions from:** “Trip Info” page

*Probe as appropriate.*

1. Tell me what you are looking at. 
- Looks pretty much the same. Scanned page. Has the same info, but this time there wasn’t the icons where I could pick what I wanted to file. This is more like how it is now
- See the appointment details. Started address is address on file unless I tell them something else, I’d assume from please confirm
- How I got there, personal vehicle yes, and then put in mile
- Didn’t have icons and no place to put in expenses - so it knows I have expenses  
2. What do you think would happen if you clicked “Primary travel method”?  
- 
3. What do you think is next?
- More than likely will be where upload receipts

**Questions from:** “Receipts” page

*Probe as appropriate.*

1. Tell me what you are looking at.   
- Upload receipts for meals tolls loging, so lumping it for you. You have to add what you think you need to add. Less concise. I work with older veterans and this would be confusing to them because they wouldn’t know what to put in, so they’d bypass it. Would just go down to next 
2. What do you think you can do here? What tells you that?  
- Would need to check that expenses are reimbursable - would search on VA.gov. Knew about tolls by not parking, so I know I’d need ot upload those receipts if I cwant to get paid back.
- Would choose files and drag and drop
- Clicked on upload - Now there are icons in case you don’t read or have low vision
  - Actually says vendor which makes me think it’s picking it up on receipt - doesn’t look like it’s hand-entered
  - Expected to see this? Expected to see less. Like vendor wasn’t on there before. This is a little more concise. 

3. What do you think you need to do here? Why?
4. What do you think you'll do next?
- To review everything and make sure it’s correct
- Noticed this has a remove button - don’t think the other had that
- If did that - could add another receipt - wouldn’t have to back up if I missed something


**Questions from:** “Review” page

*Probe as appropriate.*

1. Tell me what you are looking at.   
- Telling me what estimated reimbursement will be. How much I spent in other expenses. Looks pretty much the same, just more concise about receipts. IF correct would hit submit and expect to get a confirmation number
2. What do you think you can do here? What tells you that?  
3. What do you think you need to do here? Why?  
4. What do you think is next?  
   

**Questions from:** “Submission confirmed” page

*Probe as appropriate.*

1. Tell me what you are looking at. 
- Yep! Got the confirmation page 
2. What do you think happens next? What tells you so?  
- At this point you’d be done with submitting that unless you had something else. Once you submit it that’s it. Unless you contact travel, can’t change it
3. What do you think you can do from here?

**Reflection Questions**

1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how easy or difficult would you say this process was? What makes you say so? *Probe*  
- Probably 2 or 3, because it’s not so concise about what you’re allowed to upload
- Concise meaning what exactly: It doesn’t give you prompts of what is allowed to be uploaded. Prior version had prompts: parking, toll, lodging, meals - prompted you so you didn’t forget to put something in there that you may have forgotten. Oh ya I paid for lunch because the dr took 3 hours. If you’re not prompted you don’t think about it - just think about travel 

2. What would you add, change, or remove about this process? *Probe*  
- This one didn’t have that you could choose what you were adding, would like that. But I liked how it did the receipts and put the info in there for you
3. What would you keep about this process? *Probe*  

4. If the user…  
   1. Has submitted for travel reimbursement before: Reflecting on your experience, how does this process relate to your previous experience of submitting for travel reimbursement?  
   2. Has not submitted for travel reimbursement before: Reflecting on your experience, how does this process relate other experiences at the VA?  
5. Anything else you want to share that we haven’t already covered?

*TRANSITION TO OTHER VERSION*

## **Version B (first prototype)**

## **Task: Submit travel claim**

***Task:*** Imagine that a few days ago you drove to the VA in another city to see your cardiologist.  You encountered a road with tolls and had to pay for parking. Now, you want to be reimbursed for your travel costs for that appointment.  Using this prototype, show me how you would request this reimbursement.  

**Questions from:** Intro page

1. Tell me what you are looking at.  
- It says welcome, let's get your travel expenses reimbursed. What you’ll need before you start. I know that I would need my receipts from the bridge, which is kinda difficult around here cuz everything is digital camera. So would have to get a copy from the leeway, and would also need a receipt from where I park.
- Talks about uploading the receipts
  - Would have to do that and then review them and then just submit it
  - Seems simple
- Helpful tips - telling you how much yo uget per mile. Which is actually kind of nice because i never knew how long it takes. Woulda been nice to know
- Bank information
- Then past appointment - that’s how I’ve filed before

2. Do you think you can be reimbursed? What tells you that?  
- Yes. Because i’m 70 percent service connected. All my appointments are reimbursable. Any appts. For cardiologist, etc. would be covered by VA
- What tells you on this page?: Other than it just says let’s get your travel expenses reimbursed, it doesn’t say that person is eligible. You’d have to know if they’re service connected or 50% or above

3. What do you think that you need to know in order to get reimbursed? What tells you that?  
- Would need receipts for parking toll receipts, would need to know address started at and where I went to
- Tells you that in the what you need before you start upper part

4. What items or information do you think that you will need to complete this process? What tells you that?  
5. Looking at this page, what do you expect to happen next? What tells you that?
- There’s probably gonna be little icons that show upload receipts and you’d click on that and take a pic of the receipt.  

**Questions from:** “Expenses” page

*Probe as appropriate.*

1. Tell me what you are looking at.  
2. Thinking of your last trip, what do you think you can be reimbursed for?

**Questions from:** “Trip Info” page

*Probe as appropriate.*

1. Tell me what you are looking at.  
2. What do you think would happen if you clicked “Primary travel method”?  
3. What do you think is next?

**Questions from:** "Receipts" page

*Probe as appropriate.*

1. Tell me what you are looking at.   
- Oh ok it wants my info first
- What’s tell you that? That’s the first thing that popped up. When I changed screens it said starting address
- Would need to click the yes that’s the correct address or I could change it to my address
- Travel info - that’s correct
- What would happen if clicked on primary travel method
  - Would probably ask if it’s your vehicle, transportation or rideshare, how you got there

2. What do you think you can do here? What tells you that?  

3. What do you think you need to do here? Why?
4. What's going to happen next?
- Ask for receipts
- I’ve never been asked my total miles though in the past - it has automatically calculated it for me. that s nice because if you had to take a roundabout way you could put in 8 miles vs 4 miles you usually travel
- So expect that if mileage was different than calculated there’d be something to know that? Yes.
- Think it’s going to ask me for an exclamation of why it’s more than the standard mileage allotted
- There you go - it’s asking me to drap and drop the files so I’d have to have them saved somewhere.
5. Whats your process usually?
- Scan receipt in or take a picture and upload a picture
- Drag and drop means I can drop it in there other wise I can choose the file and it will open up where I have it saved at 

6. Imagine that when you click choose files, the magic will do that. Tell me what you’re seeing - 
- amount and date and allows you to put a note so they know what you payed for. Tolls, same thing, amount that you paid. Two toll receipts because you wen tup and back. 
7. Where do you think info in the thing is coming from? 
- Ai reads it and puts the amount there. 
8. So there’s something there that reads it so you don’t have to input? 
- Possibly, they’ve come a long way with AI
9. WHat will happen next? 
- Will have to review info I already put in


**Questions from:** “Review” page

*Probe as appropriate.*

1. Tell me what you are looking at.  
- Estimated reimbursement - mileage was 31.49… It went through everything that I just filled out. And goes through the receipts I uploaded and gives me a total
 
2. What do you think you can do here? What tells you that?  
- I would think you could click on something if not right and go back and correct it.
- If the toll was incorrect you could go back?
  - In an ideal world I would think so, otherwise you’d have to use the back button.

3. What do you think you need to do here? Why?  
4. What do you think is next?  
- Going to finalize everything and once it happens I can’t change it

   

**Questions from:** “Submit” page

*Probe as appropriate.*

1. Tell me what you are looking at.  
- Request has been submitted and give confirmation number and I should receive something in 5-7 days, and can submit another request 
Do you think you’d submitted? Yes – confirmation number

2. Do you think that you have submitted your request?  
3. What do you think happens next? What tells you so? 
- Think it’s reviewed by VA and if everything checks out it goes in your account
- To follow up if there’s an issue: would go to location because lives close, but can always call them
 
4. What do you think you can do from here?

**Reflection Questions**

1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how easy or difficult would you say this process was? What makes you say so? *Probe*  
- 1 - nice and easy. Gave very exact directions of what to do and didn’t have a lot of nonsense in there that you have to sit and read before you know what to do. No long explanations
2. What would you change about this process? *Probe*  
- I can’t say I’d change anything. Seems easier than what I’d do already

3. What would you keep about this process? *Probe*  
- The last page with the confirmation number. Also likes that it told you how mch you’ll get. Currently doesn’t do that

4. If the user…  
   1. Has submitted for travel reimbursement before: Reflecting on your experience, how does this process relate to your previous experience of submitting for travel reimbursement?  
- I think it’s more informative. Tell you how much you’ll be paid per mile and you get to put in how many miles you traveled. 

   2. Has not submitted for travel reimbursement before: Reflecting on your experience, how does this process relate other experiences at the VA?  
5. Anything else you want to share that we haven’t already covered?

## **Comparison questions** 

1. Which of these processes did you find easier? What makes you say so?  
- Found the 1st one easier. Because it prompted me so that I wouldn’t miss something

2. Of everything that you looked at today, what would you say was the most confusing to you and why?  
- I think where it said drag and drop, expected to be able to take a picture of the receipt itself instead of uploading and saving it and all that

3. What about these processes would you keep?  
- Would combine the first page of the first one with the way the expenses came up in the second
- Tell me more: like how the expenses came up because it put the info in for you. You knew exactly what parking was, toll was. And the first example prompts you to think about what did I spend my money on. So two together would be very concise and you’d know what you did. 

4. Is there anything else you would like to share that we have not covered? 
- Would make icons a little bit bigger because there are a lot of people with low vision who depend on the icons. Macular degeneration makes it hard. Is a nurse and works with people on these things.
