# **Intro \- 5 minutes**

## **Past experiences**

1. How do you typically get to your VA medical appointments?  
2. Have you ever submitted to be reimbursed for traveling for your VA medical appointment?  
3. If you have submitted to be reimbursed for traveling before, did you have to upload evidence like receipts? Please describe your experience.  
4. What are your expectations about Veterans being reimbursed for traveling for VA medical care?

## **Screen sharing instructions**

I'm going to ask you to do a couple things on the VA website, VA.gov, and to share your screen so I can see how you navigate on the website. Do you know how to share your screen?

*Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:*

* In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad).  
  * If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.  
  * (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)  
  * Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

*Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:*

* Hit Alt S (as in Same); the option should come up to select the window you want to share \- please choose Basic.  
* Tab over and confirm that what is selected is "entire screen."  
* Tab once more \- make sure "share sound" is checked.  
* Tab 4 times over to "share screen" \- click activate.

Great, now I can see your screen\! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

* *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*  
  * Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *\[Share your screen\]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *\[Give mouse control\]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## **Prototype reminder and think aloud protocol**

Just a reminder, we will be using what we call a prototype to accomplish a task that I will give you. This is not an actual website, all the names and information is fake. It will still work much like a website \- you can move it up and down, click on certain things, etc. However, this prototype will not work exactly like a website. For example, not all of the links will work and you cannot click the back button in your browser because it will take you away from the prototype.

As we go through this prototype to accomplish the task I'll give you, I'd like you to think aloud. That inner narrative we all have? I'd like to hear it\! Again, you are not being tested in any way \- the design is being tested. And we want your honest feedback about your experience.

## **Moderator note: Alternate task order**
