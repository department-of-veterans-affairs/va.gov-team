## Research Goals 
As the Beneficiary Travel Team integrates complex claim submission with appointments on VA.gov, we want to understand how our users organize and approach filing travel claims with different expense types. The concept study was designed to help us understand what Veterans focus on first: the expense types or the trip itself. The study was a moderated and counterbalanced prototype study. Veterans walked through two different prototypes, one that started with expense type and one that started from the trip, and compared the ease of use and overall preference.   
Our goals were to:   
- Understand Veterans' mental models around complex claims for travel pay
- Learn whether Veterans focus primarily on their trip first or the types of expenses first as they prepare to submit

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Key Moments: This tool supports key moments in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) : Starting up, taking care of myself, putting down roots, and retiring.
- Outcomes: After learning Veterans' preference and expectations around complex claim submission, we will have research to support our higher fidelity designs. 

## Research Questions

* Based on the Intro page, do participants understand what to expect from the Claim submission process (what they will need, if they are eligible, steps)?
* When looking to get reimbursed for travel expenses, do users focus on the trip first or on what they want to be reimbursed for first?   
* Can users accomplish the key task (submitting a travel claim) using the different concepts provided?   
       a. What steps or language confuses them?   
       b. Where do they stumble in the process?   
* What do participants think will happen to the Claim after they submit?

## Methodology 

- Method 1: We conducted 45-60 minute long interviews via Zoom from August 25 - September 5, 2025. We gave participants a short hypothetical scenario around filing for travel pay.
- Method 2: Based upon the scenario provided, Veterans navigated a mid-fidelity coded [prototype](https://tfclkd.csb.app/). The study was counterbalanced, so some participants started with Version A and others started with Version B. All participants saw both versions. After each version, we asked participants about ease of use, parts of the process that they liked or didn't like, and provided the opportunity to speak further about their experience. Once participants had completed both prototypes, we asked if they had a preference or found one of the versions easier than the other. 

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **Hypothesis Statement:** [We hypothesize that participants will prefer option B, where the expense categories are listed separately]  
  - **Likely True** - 7 out of 13 participants said they preferred B, while 2 said that A and B were the same to them. Although this model added an extra step of identifying expense categories, participants said they preferred it because it prompted them to upload all of their required receipts, and helped ensure that they wouldn’t omit any receipts necessary to get reimbursement. 

## Key Findings

1. All participants (13 of 13) successfully navigated both prototypes and provided positive feedback.
* Most appreciated guidance about how to prepare ahead of time, as well as the clear steps presented at the top of the flow. Several referenced these steps as they progressed, using them to track their place in the process.
2. Overall, more participants (7 of 13) expressed a preference for Version B, and specifically noted that the receipts organized by category were helpful. 
* While 4 out 13 participants liked Version A, the streamlined prototype with fewer steps, the majority of participants preferred being individually prompted for receipts for each expense category they indicated—even if it required additional steps.
3. Most (10 of 13) participants voiced concerns about gathering and uploading receipts.
* Some participants expressed difficulty in finding and uploading receipts, with toll receipts posing a particular challenge. File size and format limitations were also a concern (e.g. questions about accepting HEIC files).
4. Most (9 of 13) participants reported some confusion about content, especially related to mileage and their total estimated payment.
* Participants were unclear about certain terminology and requirements, including whether mileage calculations include gas, whether receipts are required for mileage, the meaning of their "estimated” payment, and how deductibles are applied or included in that payment.
5. Participants had clear preferences for continued communication and visibility about their claim post-submission.
* Participants appreciated seeing a confirmation number after submission, and expected that VA would email them a confirmation after submission. They also expected a dashboard to track their claim status and a phone number to communicate with VA if they ran into issues. 


## Details of Findings 

### Finding 1: All participants (13 out of 13) successfully navigated both design concepts and generally provided positive feedback.
* At the end of each version, participants were asked to rate the ease of use on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being the easiest). 12 out of 13 participants ranked both prototypes between a 1 and 3 and confirmed that they understood what was being asked of them. One participant ranked Version B as a 4, due to concerns about accessibility and noted that the pages at the beginning were not 508 compliant. This participant ranked Version A as a 3, due to it having fewer steps than Version B.     
     > “The flow is excellent. The usability of this is really solid. The backbone is good.” - P10, after reviewing Version B first

     > “I would say it was a 1. It seemed extremely, you know, self-explanatory, and it's, you know, easy enough to go from screen to screen, whereas with the BTSSS, you know, we're not… we're not going from screen to screen.” - P9, after reviewing Version A first

     > “I have a tough time identifying anything that was confusing. I thought… It was effective.” - P12, after reviewing both versions   

### Finding 2: Overall, participants (7 out of 13) expressed a preference for Version B, and specifically preferred seeing the expense categories. 
* Although there was an extra step in Version B, 7 out of 13 participants stated that they preferred it over Version A. Those who liked version B said they appreciated the list of expense categories they could choose from. A few (2 of 13) specifically mentioned the upload categories and acknowledged the additional prompt to upload receipts by expense category would help them remember to upload all their evidence. Those who preferred A (4 out of 13) noted it was less busy and had fewer steps. 2 out of 13 participants had no preference and found both versions to be similarly easy. 

     > "The first one (Version B) enumerated tolls and parking and that helped to keep that square to where I didn't have to remember anything." - P10

     > "Well, I liked the idea where I was able to … take, like, vehicle, toll, and parking. So, when I went here to look at my review, it reminded me of those 3 things that I had submitted for my reimbursement." - P7

     > "I think initially I did prefer A, but as soon as I saw there was more to this one, and it was organized differently, but I think that's just because I was already trying to compare it against what I just saw, but, you know. I'm thinking that this is a little bit tighter organized. I think it's better." - P3

### Finding 3: Most (10 of 13) Participants voiced concerns about gathering and uploading receipts. 
* The greatest area for concern was around collecting and uploading receipts for the different expense types, especially tolls. Participants noted that they often did not have physical receipts after using toll roads and would have an additional step that would require them to locate and download a toll receipt before they would be able to successfully submit for reimbursement.

     > "Just uploading those receipts could be a little bit… again, even the toll receipt, as I shared with you, about everybody going ticketless, I don't know how you're going to...you don't get a ticket, you don't even get a receipt when you go through the toll." - P7

* Participants also expressed concerns about the process to digitally capture receipts through scanning or taking a picture and the corresponding file types. One participant with low vision also expressed concerns about accessibility. Another participant commented that it would be frustrating to have to convert HEIC files (the default iOS phone file type, which is not an accepted file type), and another participant was concerned that the file size limit was too small.   

     > “So you're at this, you know, you have to take a picture, scan it, and send it to your phone, and go from there. So I, on my phone, and my wife helped me with this, she'll take the…because I can't see very well with the small screen, even though I have a large cell phone." - P7

     > "You know, the pictures are on my phone, but my phone, the files are HEIC, they don't accept that, so I gotta email it or convert the file to something, something to get it on…a lot of frickin' stuff it's asking for, you know? Unless there's an app, and you can do it on your phone, and upload attachments and whatever there." - P11

     > "They tend to have really large file sizes, and I do get this error message when I try to, you know, upload something that is larger file size, and then I have to try and figure out how to convert it. [...] Sometimes you get that error message saying, nope, this file is. It's too big. Got it, okay. I have no idea what makes a file big versus what doesn't." - P13

### Finding 4: Most participants (9 of 13) reported some confusion with the wording and content related to mileage and their total payment.
* Some participants reported confusion about the term “mileage,” if it included gas, and if a gas receipt was required.

     > "I guess you don’t get paid for gas. I’ve never filled out a form. I guess I better get a receipt from the convenience store or wherever I’ve filled up, to get a receipt for gas.” - P1

     > “What does gas ‘mileage’ mean? I think it's very confusing.” - P3

* In addition, there was a lack of clarity around what “estimated” meant, and if it accounted for the deductible.

     > “I’m wondering about that ‘estimated’ word.” - P8

     > “They don't show the $6 deductible. It says ‘Total estimated.’ Maybe [that accounts for] the deductible." - P14

### Finding 5: Participants expressed a desire for continued communication and visibility about their claim post-submission.
* Many participants expressed that they would save the confirmation number displayed on the page.   

     > “I would take a picture of this because I lose paper. So that if I don’t get my reimbursement in the timeframe, I can call and reference this number to find out what’s going on. I do this once a week, so I submit multiple appointments when I log in.” - P13

     > “The only thing is unless I take a screen shot, I don’t know if I would get an email or text message with that confirmation number. Otherwise I would take my screen shot to have it.” - P9

     > “[I see a] confirmation number. If you are smart, you are going to take this and print and hold it until you have to find out what happened. If it's past 5-7 business days they are gonna ask you for this confirmation number to verify this. It is smart to either print it or put it into PDF and put it on your computer until you see reimbursement come from the bank.” - P7

* Many participants also expressed that they expected VA would email them a confirmation that their claim had been received.   

     > “It'd be cool if it sent you a receipt, like a submission receipt. You’d get pinged back with an email that your submission was received. That’d be cool because you could reference that. It’d tell you it was submitted successfully.” - P11

     > “[After submission, VA will] probably send me an email with the information on this screen.” - P12

     > “The confirmation number… I want to be able to copy it, or print the page, or save it as a .pdf, or send it to my email. Although I know it all comes back to the confirmation number, I would like multiple ways to take it off the page. Instead of thinking, ‘God, did I save that webpage?’” - P8

* Participants wanted to have visibility into the status of their claim. One participant expected to see a link to a dashboard with their claim status[es] on the confirmation page.   

     > “I assume that there would be some kind of BTSSS-type dashboard that I can go into later and see all my travel claims and check on status. I’m assuming so… or there should be. It’s very useful in BTSSS. I probably had 15-20 claims in one month, so it’s good to have that dashboard.” - P9

* Participants wanted to be able to contact claims-specific support at VA in case they needed help. Additionally, they wanted the phone number to connect to a specific department or office that could help them with their issue.   

     > “If I need help with this particular claim I would think I need to call my specific travel center. If I get a hold of big VA they will shrug their shoulders and say get a hold of the local office… Make sure it is a good contact number otherwise you're gonna get complaints about it.” - P9

     > “If I need help contacting the VA, here is the phone number. That should be on every page.” - P3


## Additional Insights
1. The prototype simulated a file upload and populated the receipt metadata (i.e. date, amount, etc.) in order to save time during the study. With some participants, we probed how they imagined the data was populated: did they expect the fields to be automatically filled by the system or manually input by the user? The responses from participants were mixed; some thought that they would need to populate the fields themselves, while others expected that the fields would be populated for them after they uploaded their receipt.   
   - 8 out of 13 participants expressed that they expected at least some of the metadata would be automatically populated; however, it’s possible the prototype design was a big influence in this factor as it seemed to autopopulate and could have influenced their perception.

2. Some participants (3 of 13) expressed concerns about submitting claims for appointments that do not appear in their past appointment list, like community care appointments.
     > “So the only thing that’s not on here that I was expecting to see is, what if my appointment’s not listed here? The ‘click to add appointment’ button. In the travel system, I have to manually enter them and then add the confirmation that I have been. So not seeing that on the first page like I do normally, I would wonder if I would not get reimbursed for community care visits.” - P13

     > "If your community care appointments are not in the system, you can’t get reimbursed. It is so hard and you almost give up because it just isn’t worth the stress to try to get what you are entitled to." - P7

     > "Those appointments don’t show. I have to create the appointment as a missing appointment. So I just recreated the appointment as if I never created it and then wrote a note explaining the situation. I certainly wasn’t going to go through the VA appeal process. It seemed too complicated; just file a new claim, let them figure it out." - P9

3. Participants who have filed for travel pay in the past, either using simple mileage only claims (SMOC) or the Beneficiary Travel Self Service System (BTSSS) portal, provided anecdotes about their experience, both positive and negative.
   - 7 out of 13 participants had filed for travel reimbursement online in the past, while 1 participant said that they filed years ago, when it was a paper process. 5 out of 13 participants had never submitted for reimbursement.

   - We believe that their experience with these systems influenced how they viewed the prototypes we presented. 5 of 13 participants referenced maps when mileage was being calculated.

     > "On BTSSS there is a map that shows 3 different routes for me. And I am not seeing a map so I would guess I would need to put in how many miles. Oh okay, it is automatically calculated, got it." - P10

   - People who used the mobile app to submit for mileage only had very positive things to report.

     > “Now with the app on the phone, it says, you go past appointments, you click it on the phone, and it showed that app, we just hit it and it took care of the filing for mileage, so that…That doesn’t get any easier.” - P14

   - One participant reported using the app to file for mileage on a trip, and then filed a separate claim on the same trip in BTSSS for the tolls. The second claim was initially denied and the participant called to have it reviewed again. 

## Recommendations

1. **Recommendation:** Begin  the reimbursement claim  by prompting  users to select expense types from a list
   - Our study revealed that a majority of participants (7 of 13) preferred Version B, which prompted users to select and submit receipts organized by expense category. Participants appreciated clarity in the process and found the guidance around expenses was helpful for navigating the claim. Users cited the organizational benefits and the ability to anticipate some of the required documentation.
   - We expect that beginning the travel reimbursement claim workflow by allowing users to first select the expense categories applicable to their claim (e.g. mileage, lodging, meals, etc) will also better integrate with the existing simple, mileage-only claim flow. Once categories are selected, we will guide users through submitting receipts and relevant information for each category. This approach aligns with user preferences, supports organizational clarity, and sets expectations for the documentation requirements. 

2. **Recommendation:** Utilize existing patterns for receipt upload and reduce requirements for user input   
   - To address potential user frustration related receipt uploads, we recommend using familiar patterns, such as the multi-file input component, to help alleviate user concerns and reduce the cognitive load associated with the upload process.
   - Additionally, we’re actively investigating which metadata fields are essential for the processing of receipts. If possible, we hope to further simplify the process for users, ensuring only minimum required information is collected.

3. **Recommendation:** Provide clear communication around pre-submission requirements and post-submission expectations
   - Users expressed a strong desire for upfront guidance, transparency, and continued communication about their claim status after submission. In order to support users, we will provide clear, accessible content throughout the travel claim process to set user expectations before, during, and after submission.
   - Content will inform users as early as possible in the workflow about the types of receipts and documents they will need. Helpful tips for collecting and organizing receipts (e.g. saving digital copies ahead of time, acceptable file types and sizes) can help prepare users for the upload process.
   - Post-submission, we will confirm claim receipt, with a confirmation number (which is currently already standard as part of simple mileage only claims), and direct users to claims in progress to view ongoing status. If users require additional assistance, we will direct them to the appropriate phone numbers, or at a minimum, a general VA support line or link to a webpage with phone numbers for local offices.
   - Email, text, and push notifications are part of the long-term plan for travel pay communications.

4. **Recommendation:** Provide clear definitions for mileage coverage, documentation, and estimated reimbursement   
   - Our research identified confusion among participants regarding mileage—specifically, how it is calculated and what documentation is required. Several participants voiced uncertainty about terminology and requirements for submitting mileage as part of their claim. Participants who had never filed before were unsure if “mileage” calculations included gas or if they needed gas receipts in addition to mileage information.
   - We will reduce user confusion by ensuring that all instructions and terminology, especially related to mileage and estimated reimbursement, are presented in clear, accessible language. Explicitly defining what mileage covers, what documentation is required, and how the deductible is calculated, will ensure that users are prepared for submitting their claims.

5. **Recommendation:** Perform user acceptance testing plan for complex travel claims MVP
   - The initial complex claims MVP will allow a user to select and submit evidence for all reimbursable expense types and integrate with the existing SMOC workflow. (Features not yet covered by the MVP will remain in BTSSS.) In order to validate functionality, usability, and readiness, we propose UAT with friends and family in production prior to a phased release. **(Note: This is our current understanding of how the MVP release and testing will occur).**
   - UAT objectives:
     * Ensure users can successfully initiate and complete claims by selecting expense types.   
     * Confirm that users can upload and attach receipts or documents for each selected expense type. We will monitor all expense types, but will note any drop offs around tolls in particular.   
     * Validate that the workflow is clear, with all instructions and terminology easily understood (especially for mileage).   
     * Assess integration with the existing mileage-only claims process.   
     * Identify any usability issues, drop off points, or confusing elements.   
     * Ensure error handling and messaging are clear and actionable.   
     * Confirm that unsupported scenarios are correctly redirected to BTSSS.
   - Based upon the objectives, we’ll devise test scenarios, procedures, timeline, then a summary report with further findings, recommendations, and both resolved and outstanding issues.   
 



## Next Steps
1. Engineers continue to build out the supporting infrastructure for attachments.
2. Share findings and recommendations with the Travel Pay stakeholders and team.
3. Design the MVP based upon our research recommendations.
4. Review and revise user-facing content for the travel pay process, as needed.
5. MVP launch with UAT, phased rollout, and continued monitoring.
6. Additional research for other complex claim scenarios. 


## Further research needed
* Since this was an initial concept study to explore the mental model of how users approach reimbursement, some demographics were not specifically recruited for or tracked (although some users did reference their assistive technology).
* Due to external timing constraints, there will be UAT completed after the complex claims MVP launch in winter 2025.
* In 2026, we plan to further investigate enhancements, as well as conduct additional research around community care, appointments that are missing from the system, and challenges to mileage.
