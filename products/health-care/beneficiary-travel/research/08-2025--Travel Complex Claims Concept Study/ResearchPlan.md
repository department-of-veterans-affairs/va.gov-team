# Research Plan: Complex Claims Concept Study

## Background

The goal of the Beneficiary Travel Pay team is to empower users to do more with their travel reimbursement claims on VA.gov. This process allows users to submit claims on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) that include reimbursement requests for mileage reimbursement only or additional expenses that include receipts.

### OCTO Priorities

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

* Key Result 1: CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.

### Veteran Journey 

1. Starting up  
2. Taking care of myself  
3. Putting down roots  
4. Retiring

## Research Goals

### Outcomes

Veterans want to be reimbursed for the costs they incurred traveling to their qualified medical appointment.   We hypothesize that participants will focus on the items they want to be reimbursed for. The designs tested will compare and contrast two different concept-level approaches to completing a travel claim submission. This study tests key facets of the user flows for these two concepts to evaluate what participants find simple and easy to use and what they struggle with.  

### Research Questions

1. Based on the Intro page, do participants understand what to expect from the Claim submission process (what they will need, if they are eligible, steps)?  
2. When looking to get reimbursed for travel expenses, do users focus on the trip *first* or on *what* they want to be reimbursed for first?  
3. Can users accomplish the key task (submitting a travel claim) using the different concepts provided?  
   1. What steps or language confuses them?  
   2. Where do they stumble in the process?  
4. What do participants think will happen to the Claim after they submit?

## Methodology 

### Location

Video interviews over Zoom.  We will rotate the order of which concepts are used first.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment Approach 

We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. We will request a kickoff meeting with Perigean to align on what is needed and desired from the sample, scheduling details below.

### Recruitment Criteria

We want to schedule 15 participants for **10 completed sessions minimum**.  

Similar to previous studies, we want Veteran users who have VA health care, travel to VA health appointments and have a range of experience with submitting for travel reimbursement.  We also want a participant pool that is representative of the Veteran population.

3. Considering your most recent trip to a VA Medical Center for a medical appointment, which of the following, if any, would you file for? Select all that apply.  
   * Reimbursement only for gas mileage from my house to the clinic \[does not meet criteria for complex claimant\]  
   * In addition to other costs, reimbursement for gas mileage from my house to the clinic \[meets criteria for complex claimant\]  
   * Reimbursement for tolls or parking I had to use to get to the clinic \[meets criteria for complex claimant\]
