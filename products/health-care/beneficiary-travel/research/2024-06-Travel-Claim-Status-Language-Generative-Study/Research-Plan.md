# **Travel Claim Status Language Generative Study**

Travel Pay team, Beneficiary Travel, June 2024
## **Background**

The goal of the Beneficiary Travel Pay team is to empower users to do more with their travel reimbursement claims on VA.gov. Building on extant research done by the Check-in experience team, this study seeks to create a set of recommendations as to what Travel Claim statuses - currently used and ones the findings of this study will propose be added - should be used in Veteran-facing experiences. This study does not seek to inform any recommendations of changes to Travel Claim statuses used in Staff facing experiences, only in Veteran (and Caregiver) experiences.

### **OCTO Priorities**

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.



* Key Result 1: CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.


### **Veteran Journey**



1. Starting up
2. Taking care of myself
3. Putting down roots
4. Retiring


## **Research Goals**


### **Outcome**

The desired outcome of this study is a generative, first version set of recommended changes to Veteran-facing Travel Claim statuses. This will include recommendations of alternative language sourced from users that could be used to supplement the current status system used by BTSSS. This supplemental language will help bridge the gap between the status language that aligns with users’ mental models and the language required for VA systems.


### **Research questions**



1. What do users see as the purpose of a Claim status?
2. How strongly does the status ‘label’ align with the status definition to the users’ mental model?
    1. What would users label each definition?
        1. How closely does the term users’ use to label a definition match the official status label?
        2. What words or terms resonate with users?
    2. What would users define each label as meaning?
        1. What words or terms resonate with users?
3. What currently used Travel Claims statuses do users conflate with each other or see as duplicative?
4. What statuses would users add to or subtract from the currently used Travel Claim statuses?
     1. What statuses do users see as unnecessary?
     2. What statuses do they see as missing?


### **Hypothesis**



* Hypothesis: Users will conflate all statuses related to payment being approved or out for payment
* Hypothesis: Users will create fewer statuses
* Hypothesis: Users will create status labels that focus on what requires action on their end
