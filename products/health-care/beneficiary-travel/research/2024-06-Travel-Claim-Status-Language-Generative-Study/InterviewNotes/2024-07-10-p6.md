# Participant 6, Wednesday, July 10, 12:00 pm – 1:00 pm

## **Instructions**

We will be able to get ok transcripts from EnjoyHQ, so focus notes on observations, clearly defined interpretations, and impactful utterances.


* Focus on observations of user behavior. 
    * Example of observation: “Participants clicks on My VA tab, hovers over X header, then back buttons to landing page.” 
    * Example of observation: “Participant says ‘this is annoying, that makes no sense.’ when looking to login to BTSSS.”
* Be clear where notetaker is interpreting or making inferences of what participant is thinking/feeling
    * Example of interpretation: “Based on facial expressions, participant seems to be confused.  Going back and forth between X and Y pages seems like they are looking for something.”
    * Example of interpretation: “Participant easily found link no frustration.” 


## **Context setting and questions - max 5 min**

Q1: After you have submitted a travel claim for reimbursement, how do you know what happens to it? 
* What do you think happens to it?
   * It takes a while. I think it takes extra long if I submit a paper claim and don't know what's happening until I get a peyment.
   * If I have doubts I'll call and ask to talk to the Travel Service
   * It goes throug the mailing system to the VA. I don't know if it goes to a stack of files. I just have to be hopeful.
   * The process part, it takes longer than it should. We could do it on a kiosk and the turn around was very quick
   * 


Q2: When you hear the term “claim status”, what do you think of?  
* What do you want to know from a claim status?
   * My travel pay for traveling to each of my appointments
   * I want to know if it's approved an input into the system


## **Mural exercise**

### Exercise 1: Label definitions 

Note what participants go back and forth on.  What do they debate? What do they change? What reasons for trashing cards do they give?
* User labels cards...
* Some of these labels require more than four words
* Card 4 - Oscilated but landed on process time
* Check back account. I want to verify it's been paid by checking my account
* Card 7 - I'm not understanding is why they are asking for expense when it's just milage. Call travel office
* Card 8 — What does that mean? Is there missing information
* Card 9 - Call travel office
* Card 10 - Woo hoo 🎉 😂
* Card 12 - I thought I'd hit submit but didn't.
* Card 13 - Why is there no payment? How can it be unarchived?
* All these status are with a paper claim too?
* Card 15 - If I submit a paper claim there is no reason why they would deny it.
* User trashed many
* I'd trash 13 b/c I know I traveld to my appointment and qualify for travel pay.
* Somebody's not communicating within the service to verify my claim.
* There's not communication or someone didn't put in the right information
* 

### Exercise 2: Grouping

Note what participants go back and forth on.  What groups do they debate? What do they change? What reasons for trashing cards do they give?
* User creates groups...
* Groups
  * Claim completion
  * Missing information
  * Something just ain't right!
  * Check bank
  * This is some BS! Some B-triple-S!
  * Mistake on my part
* 

### Anything else
* They could make the BTSSS system more user friendly
