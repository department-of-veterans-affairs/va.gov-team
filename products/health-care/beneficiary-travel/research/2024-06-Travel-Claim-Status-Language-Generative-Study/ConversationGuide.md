## **Intro - max 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Cara and I'm a Researcher with the VA. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today, I’d like to ask you some questions about managing your VA claims for travel reimbursement for medical care.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:



* This entire session should take about 45 - 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. We may also end sooner than that, and if we have covered everything I want to cover I'd love to give your time back to you.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* We will be spending most or all of our time together conducting some thought exercises in a platform called Mural.  I will share my screen and ask you a series of questions as we go through these exercises.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
* We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.

Knowing this, **are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** Are you comfortable with it if we share anonymized video clips with our VA colleagues for research purposes?



* I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    * If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    * If yes: Admit observers.
    * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
    * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?


## **Context setting and questions - max 5 min**

Like I said, our time today is about how you manage or monitor your claims for travel reimbursement from the VA.  Specifically, I want to talk about how you think about a claim after you have submitted it for reimbursement.

Q1: After you have submitted a travel claim for reimbursement, how do you know what happens to it? 



* What do you think happens to it?

Q2: When you hear the term “claim status”, what do you think of?  



* What do you want to know from a claim status? 


## **Mural exercise**

Ok great! Now I am going to share my screen and we are going to dive into the exercises I mentioned earlier.

## **Consent to use video clips**



* I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
    * If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## **Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


## **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
