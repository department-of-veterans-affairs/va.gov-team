# Travel Claim Status Visibility IA Research Plan 


## **Background**

Veterans currently lack the ability to easily check the status of their Travel Reimbursement claim once it has been submitted (and is processed through the BTSSS system). This leads to Veterans being unaware of actions or changes they need to make in order to get reimbursed, ultimately leading to them being less likely to be reimbursed. We propose providing Veterans with a way to see the status of their submitted travel claim directly on[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov) without having to go to the separate BTSS system. This study addresses the issue of where this information should live on[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov) and what it should be labeled. In order to do this, this study will gauge how users connect the travel reimbursement with other services provided by the VA via tree testing.

### **OCTO Priorities**



1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
3. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
4. Logged-in users have a personalized experience with relevant and time-saving features
5. Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov)


### **Veteran Journey**



1. Starting up
2. Taking care of myself
3. Putting down roots
4. Retiring


## **Research Goals**



1. To gauge if users’ mental models about a travel claim changes over the lifespan of the claim
2. To gauge if users associate a travel claim more strongly with the event that generated the claim of with other claim types supported by the VA
3. To identify where users expect to find information on the status of their Travel claim on[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov).  More specifically, to evaluate the
        1. Overall Success
        2. Overall Directness
        3. Time Taken
to locate information on about a Travel Claim

4. To identify what labels or terminology for claim information resonates with users


### **Outcome**

This study will give us insight into where we should put and how we should group information/updates on post-submission Travel Claims on VA.gov. This will give us insight into where users expect to find information about…



1. A specific claim in the process of evaluation (post submission but before completion of evaluation)
2. Travel Claims (general) that have been submitted for evaluation
3. What users expect that page to be called


### **Research questions**



1. Do users associate information about a Travel Claim with other information about the event that triggered the claim (ie, the Appointment) or with information about other types of Claims with the VA?
2. Where do users look for information about the status of their Travel Claims on VA.gov?
    1. Do users differentiate between where they expect to find information on a specific travel claim from information on travel claims in general?
3. What names or labels for information about their personal Travel Claims resonate with users?


### **Hypothesis**



1. We hypothesize that participants will look for more recent Travel Claims associated with the Appointment that generated the claim.
2. We hypothesize that participants will look for older claims (6+ months ago) in the Claim status tool or Payments section.
3. We hypothesize that participants will look for an overview of their past Travel Claims history in their Profile or Payments section.
4. We hypothesize that participants will look for status updates on Travel Pay claims on its own its own distinct page
5. We hypothesize that users will look information on Travel Claims - recent or historical - in the My VA health benefits section of MyHealtheVet
6.  We hypothesize that participants will look to check the status of a travel claim on the page where they submit travel claims. (From the Check-in team)


## **Methodology**



* Treejack Cohorts, 8 cohorts, 9 participants each, total 72 respondents. Minimum threshold of 60 responses split between the first tasks
1. Cohort A - Veteran Users aged over 55 who have extensive experience with Travel Pay
2. Cohort B - Veteran Users aged over 55 who have moderate experience with Travel Pay 
3. Cohort C - Veteran Users aged over 55 who have **no** experience with Travel Pay 
4. Cohort D - Veteran Users aged over 55 who have **minimal** experience with Travel Pay 
5. Cohort E - Veteran Users aged under 54 who have extensive experience with Travel Pay 
6. Cohort F - Veteran Users aged under 54 who have moderate experience with Travel Pay 
7. Cohort G - Veteran Users aged under 54 who have **no** experience with Travel Pay 
8. Cohort H - Veteran Users aged under 54 who have **minimal** experience with Travel Pay 


### **Location**

Remote, unmoderated. Optimal Workshop.


### **Research materials**

Tasks **(split/alternate which participant sees first)**



1. **[Recent claim task]** You submitted a request to be paid back for gas after traveling to your last VA doctor visit on January 12, 2024 and want to get an update on that request.  Where would you find this information?
2. **[Historical claim task]** You have submitted several requests to be reimbursed for gas for traveling to see your VA doctor multiple times following surgery in Spring 2023.  You want to know what happened to those requests. Where would you find this information?

After each task, ask:



1. Overall, how difficult did you find this task? Rating scale, 1 - Very difficult, 7 - Very easy
2. Overall, how confident are you that you completed this task successfully? Rating scale, 1 - Not at all confident, 7 - Extremely confident 

Labeling questions

Label Q1: Imagine that there was a page or place on[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov) where you could see up-to-date information on what was happening with a request for travel reimbursement after you submitted it. What would you call this page and why?

LQ2: If you were to name that page on[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov) where you could see up-to-date information on what was happening with a request for travel reimbursement after you submitted it, what would you name it? Please rank from your fist choice at the top to your last choice on the bottom.
