# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about filing a travel claim. This is a new product on VA.gov and we are doing early testing to make sure that Veterans can use it to file travel claims. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
     
- **Today we'll be starting a claim for travel pay.** We'll walk through some of the steps to submit, but you do not have to fully submit your claim if you're not ready. Once we start the process, we'll ask you to share your screen.
- <mark>**This is a live test, so if you file, it will be submitted for review by a travel clerk.</mark> If you have direct deposit for travel pay set up, VA will send you funds via direct deposit. (This is different from the direct deposit used for disability and pension benefits.) Once you file, it will not be possible to edit your submission.**
- **Filing on the call with us today does not guarentee that your claim will be approved. It will not impact the outcome of your claim in any way.**
- **Do you have any questions about that?**

> [!NOTE]
> If the user is not comfortable starting a claim today, end the test. See the exit strategies below.
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

> [!TIP]
> If the user does not want to record, take extra detailed notes. Observers may serve as backup notetakers.
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Moderator: Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Have you ever filed for travel pay before? 
- If yes: Tell me more about your experience. Did you file on VA.gov, the mobile app, or BTSSS?
- If no:
  - Can you share more about why you have not filed before?
  - Do you have VA healthcare?
  - Do you know if you're eligible for travel pay?
  - Have you attended an in-person appointment within the last 30 days?
  - IF yes to the above questions: Would you like to try to file for travel reimbursement on the call with us today? **This will not guarantee that your claim will be approved. (We are not the people who review the claims; we are just testing the tool that allows you to file.)**
    - IF no: End the call. See exist strategy below.
    - IF yes: Continue.
2. Do you have direct deposit for VA Health Benefits set up? Note that this is a different setup than used by disability and pension benefits.
3. Have you successfully received travel pay reimbursement via direct deposit before? 

# Complex claims main task flow

> [!NOTE]
> If you observe a bug at any point, pause and collect data that will help engineers resolve the issue. Ask the user for their:
> - Device type and model 
> - iOS (and version, if possible)
> - Browser (and version, if possible)
> - Steps to reproduce the issue (see if you can replicate the problem, but not at the expense of problematically manipulating the user's data)
> 
> Take careful notes, especially if you are not recording the session.

## Sub Task: [Login to VA.gov] - 5 minutes

- Moderator: I'd like you to login to VA.gov. Once you're logged in, I'll ask you to navigate to your past appointments. (If the participant struggles to navigate to their past appointments, coach them throught the below steps. This is not a test of the VA navigational system.)
  - Select "VA Benefits and Health Care" in the upper menu
  - Select "Healthcare" in the dropdown
  - Select "Manage health appointments" in the dropdown
  - Select the "Go to your appointments" action link on the page

- Moderator: If you know which appointment for which you'd like to file for reimbursement, find that appointment. If not, you can click on them to find one that has a link that tells you that you're able to file for travel pay.
- NOTE: If the participant struggles to find their appointments, offer to walk them through it with screenshare: Would you like to screenshare with me so that I can walk you through the steps? Know that if you do that, we'll be able to see any information on the screen, possibly including your profile and appointment information. 

> [!NOTE]
> - If the participant selects an appointment that is over 30 days old, explain that we can file today for the sake of our test and their compensation, but the claim itself will likely be denied due to the filing date being over 30 days after the appointment.

# Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes

- On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely difficult" and 5 being "extremely easy," how would you rate the process to file a travel claim?
- On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely unlikely" and 5 being "extremely likely," how likely would you be to use this system to file for travel pay in the future?
- That brings us to the end of our tasks. Do you have any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips - 1 minute

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

That brings us to our closing. Once this session is over, you won't be able to view this claim until the new process for filing claims is released to all VA.gov users. We anticipate that'll be within a month or so. Until that time, you'll still be able to file mileage-only claims on VA.gov, and BTSSS will remain avaialble to file other types of travel pay claims. Do you have any questions about that?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


# Exit strategies

## User does not meet testing criteria, or does not want to continue

Thanks for sharing! You've shared some really helpful information with us today. In order for us to fully test this product, we need an eligible appointment. Given that, we'll wrap up the call. (Modify as needed, then continue to Thank you and closing section above.)

## Emergency exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). <mark>**Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**</mark>
