# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about filing a travel claim. This is a new product on VA.gov and we are doing early testing to make sure that Veterans can use it to file travel claims. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
     
- **Today we'll be starting a claim for travel pay.** We'll walk through some of the steps to submit, but you do not have to fully submit your claim if you're not ready. Once we start the process, we'll ask you to share your screen. <mark>**This is a live test, so if you file and you have set up direct deposit for travel pay, it will be submitted for review by a travel clerk. Once you file, it will not be possible to edit your submission.**</mark> Do you have any questions about that?

> [!NOTE]
> If the user is not comfortable starting a claim today, end the test. See the exit strategies below.
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Moderator: Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Have you ever filed for travel pay on VA.gov before? Note that this is different than filing for travel pay on BTSSS.
- If yes: Tell me more about your experience.
- If no: Can you share more about why you have not filed before? _Note: This may note be necessary if our criteria is people who have filed/have appointments that are eligible. KF response: I still think it'd be good to ask, as I've had folks join calls where they were suppose to meet certain criteria, but didn't. It'd be good to know earlier in the test vs later. If they don't have it set up, will we end the test, or are there any questions we want to ask them about BTSSS or other travel-pay related stuff?_
2. Do you have direct deposit for VA Health Benefits set up? Note that this is a different setup than used by other types of claims across VA. _Note: maybe we won't need this if our criteria ensures it's only for people who have filed in the past. KF note: Hm. If we keep the above question, then hopefully that'll cover this one? I don't imagine it hurts to ask though. Will we end the test if they don't have it set up, or don't know if they have it set up?_

# Complex claims main task flow

## Sub Task: [Login to VA.gov] - 5 minutes

- Moderator: I'd like you to login to VA.gov. Once you're logged in, I'll ask you to navigate to your past appointments. (If the participant struggles to navigate to their past appointments, coach them throught the below steps. This is not a test of the VA navigational system.)
  - Select "VA Benefits and Health Care" in the upper menu
  - Select "Healthcare" in the dropdown
  - Select "Manage health appointments" in the dropdown
  - Select the "Go to your appointments" action link on the page
  - Select the "Past" appointments tab partway down the page
- Moderator: If you know which appointment for which you'd like to file for reimbursement, find that appoitment. If not, you can click on them to find one that has a link that tells you that you're able to file for travel pay.

> [!NOTE]
> - If the participant selects an appointment that is over 30 days old, explain that we can file today for the sake of our test and their compensation, but the claim itself will likely be denied due to the filing date being over 30 days after the appointment. 

## First Task: [Starting a claim] - 5 minutes

Moderator: Now I'm going to ask you to share your screen on Zoom so that we can look at the page together. _KF note: Should we ask them to share their screen earlier, after they've logged in? That could really speed up finding appointments. On the other hand, then we'd see all their past appts, which might feel personal._
- [ ] Step 1 - Reviewing Intro Page information.
     - Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page? Please think out loud as you explore.
     - Do you have any questions about this page? _If the user notices the other links on the intro page, ask them what they expect to happen, but encourage them to stay on this page for now._
- [ ] Step 2 - Starting the claim
     - _If the user does not click the action link, prompt them to begin the claim._

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Does the participant understand the information on the intro page? What, specifically, do they notice about the information presented here?
> - Does the participant notice and click the action link to create the claim?
> - Is the participant aware that they may be sharing personal information on their screen, and are they okay with that? - per question as needed _KF note: I feel like we should note this earlier, when they log into VA.gov._

## Second Task: [Select expenses: Round one] - 3-5 minutes
Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page. What do you expect to do here?
- [ ] Step 1 - User select an expense.

If user notices link in the expanded, ask them what the expect the link to do, but keep them in the flow. _KF Note: will we prompt them to expand Additional Info if they don't do it by themselves? Either way is fine, but let's clarify that here._
- [ ] Step 2 - Selects "Continue"

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - If the participant answers the questions and is re-directed to BTSSS, _Note: What is our plan to gather info for UAT if the user leaves they system at this point? KF: I assume we need to end the test. I've added an Exit section below for if they don't meet the criteria or don't want to continue._
> - Does the participant have any questions about how mileage is calculated?

## Fourth Task: [Actions from the unsubmitted expense page] - 2 - 4 minutes
Th user should be on the unsubmitted expenses page after adding mileage/or their first expense.

- [ ] Step 3 - User selects "Cancel editing" in the modal. 
- [ ] Step 4 - User returns to the Unsubmitted expense page if they have other expenses, or the expense selection page if they do not have any expenses. 

## Additional Task B: User edits an expense
Depending on the scenario the moderator can prompt: Let's say you need to edit one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense you would like to edit?

- [ ] Step 5 - User adds a new file.
- [ ] Step 6 - User selects "Continue."

### User edits expense metadata

- [ ] Step 1 - User locates the expense they'd like to edit in the expense accordion.
- [ ] Step 2 - User selects "Edit."
- [ ] Step 3 - User is taken to the corresponding expense page. The previously input data should be on this page.

> - Does the user notice the success alert at the top of the Unsubmitted Expenses page?
> - What, if anything, seems to be confusing about this process?

## Additional Task C: User deletes an expense

### User deletes an expense
Depending on the scenario the moderator can prompt: Let's say you need to delete one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense you would like to delete?
User should be on the unsubmitted expenses page.
- [ ] Step 1 - User locates the expense they'd like to delete in the expense accordion.
- [ ] Step 2 - User selects "Delete" in the expense card.
- [ ] Step 3 - User selects "Delete" in the modal. 

### User cancels deleting an expense

- [ ] Step 1 - User locates the expense they'd like to delete in the expense accordion.
- [ ] Step 2 - User selects "Delete" in the expense card.
- [ ] Step 3 - User selects "Keep expense" in the modal.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:

> - If they delete all of their expenses, what thoughts do they have when they see the empty state?

## Additional Task D: User leaves and re-enters the flow
Depending on the scenario the moderator can prompt: 
- Let's say you need to pause or leave before your've submitted your claim. For example, maybe you need a few more days to find a receipt that you want to include in the claim. What do you think will happen if you close this window?
- Thank you for sharing. This claim will be saved, so let's close this window to pretend that you're stepping away for a few days. 
- Let's pretend that you're ready to continue working on your claim. How would you find it again? (If they struggle to find it, moderator can prompt them on where to navigate. This is not a test of the VA navigational system.) _Note: It would be great if they did not have to login again and could be encouraged to stay on VA.gov. KF: I think they'll stay logged in unless we ask them to log out. I think we can remove this comment._
  
- [ ] Step 1 - User exits the flow.
- [ ] Step 2 - User re-enteres the flow from either a past appointment or list of travel reimbursement claims. The user should return to the unsubmitted expenses page.
- [ ] Step 3 - User selects "Add more expenses" OR user selects "Sign agreement" if they have no additional expenses. _KF note: I think we can remove this bullet point. The point of this particular task is that they can leave and come back. If they don't want to add more expenses or submit, the leaving and returning still meets the requriement._

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - How does the user exit the flow? Do they close the tab or window? Do they navigate somewhere else within VA.gov? _KF note: I've adjusted the script above to have them close the window. I think giving clear directions will save us time, and also avoid them using the Back button to navigate back._
> - Can the user re-enter the flow?
> - How do they they return to the flow? (Do they re-enter the flow from claims details or past appointment details?)

## Additional Task E: User leaves the flow while on an expense page
- [ ] Step 1 - User is viewing the expense page. 
- [ ] Step 2 - User selects the browser Back button or the "Back" breadcrumb.

> - Does the user understand that the data they entered on this page was not saved when they left the page?

# Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes

- On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely difficult" and 5 being "extremely easy," how would you rate the process to file a travel claim?
- On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely unlikely" and 5 being "extremely likely," how likely would you be to use this system to file for travel pay in the future?
- That brings us to the end of our tasks. Do you have any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips - 1 minute

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


# Exit strategies
