## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

The goal of the Beneficiary Travel Pay team is to empower users to do more with their travel reimbursement claims on VA.gov. This process allows users to submit claims on VA.gov that include reimbursement requests for mileage reimbursement only or additional expenses that include receipts.  
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**This is a new product that replaces functionality from a portal outside of VA.gov**

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

1. Ensure a beneficiary can file a complex claim on VA.gov from start to finish. We want to ensure a user can understand the steps and limitations, start a claim, add expenses to their claim, and file a claim.

2. Test that the content, including error messages and redirects, appear properly and are clear to users.

3. Validate that users can leave, and re-enter, a claim in progress.
  
### Outcome

The learnings from this study will be used to determine critical fixes prior to MVP launch, as well as areas for continued monitoring and future improvement. As complex claims is a new product, we need to understand points of friction and confusion in order to make improvements. 

---

### Research questions

1. Does the user understand the qualifications around filing on VA.gov, and if they are unable to file on VA.gov, does our process successfully route them to BTSSS?

2. Are participants able to add mileage, as well as additional expenses with documentation, to their claim?

3. Can the participant successfully edit and delete an expense?

4. How does the participant navigate within the tool?

5. Can a participant leave their claim and then return to it at a later time to add expenses or submit?

6. Can the participant successfully submit a claim? 

### Hypotheses

We hypothesize that a beneficiary will be able to complete a claim on VA.gov from start to finish. Beneficiaries may be confused by some of the nuances of complex claims, but our content and direction will allow them to successfully add expenses, edit expenses, leave a claim, re-enter, and submit a claim on VA.gov.

## Methodology  🛠️

This test will take the form of User acceptance testing (UAT). We will ask users to test key scenarios outlined in the [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/beneficiary-travel/research/2025-12%20Complex%20Claims%20UAT/conversation%20guide.md).

## Recruitment 🎯	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 
- Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
- Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
- Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
- Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean
Suggested dates and times: 
- `Monday, Dec 8 at 11:30am ET`
- `Tuesday, Dec 9 at 2pm ET`
- `Tuesday, Dec 9 at 3pm ET`
- `Wednesday, Dec 10 at 10am ET`
- `Thursday, Dec 11 at 10am ET`
- `Friday, Dec 12 from 11:30am ET through 3:00pm ET`

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length:` **1 hour**
- `Buffer time between sessions:` **30 minutes**
- `Maximum Sessions per day:` **3**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
>
> **Place time slots between `hash marks` when in edit mode.**

- `[MM/DD, Day, TT:TT AM/PM-TT:TT AM/PM] EST`
- `[MM/DD, Day, TT:TT AM/PM-TT:TT AM/PM] EST`
