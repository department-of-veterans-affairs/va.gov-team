## Warm-up Questions

1. **Have you filed for travel pay before? Share more about why or why not.**
    1. Yes
    2. It was a bit cumbersome. It's not an exact science. He got new hearing aids on Dec 26. He wanted to file a paper form but it never went through. Haven’t been able to file. It’s an unusual situation at the clinic because the hearing “department” is situated in a van parked outside the building. He’s in Ohio and the van comes out of another county, even though it doesn’t move. He gets notification about upcoming appts, as normal appt with VA, but in other cases he can file online but he can’t do it with this appt for whatever reason. It’s difficult to get that done. He can’t even start the claim because it doesn’t recognize the name. Has an appt there on the 30th, next week. The appt isn’t listed online. Even last time when tried to file via paper at the clinic it went nowhere. It’s only $1.67 after deductible. 
2. **Do you have direct deposit for VA Health Benefits set up?**
    3. Yes, that works fine.
3. **Have you successfully received travel pay via direct deposit before?**


## User commentary about navigating to their appointment

* Using a Mac desktop computer 
* From VA profile, clicking start and manage file claims just went to the home page.
* Saw error saying can’t view appt right now. [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CMNQT72LX/p1769179230424789).

## Task 1: Starting a claim

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Intro page]? Please think out loud as you explore.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant understand the information on the intro page? *
* *What, specifically, do they notice about the information presented here?*
* *Does the participant notice and click the action link to create the claim?*

Intro page: 

* In past sessions I’ve told people that the folks who put this [website] together forget that you’re dealing with older generations. Trying to find your way around a computer or phone is taxing to begin with. When you finally get where you want to go, the explanation has to be as simple and concise as possible. You need to evaluate, even if you have 1, 2, 3 steps. Is everything on this page absolutely essential to getting you where you need to be? Make it as simple as possible. 
* Here’s BTSSS. That [system] is not really user friendly. So my biggest point is it has to be user friendly. I’m an old guy but I like technology so I'll fiddle around and get where I need to go. I’m good at catching on quickly. But a lot of folks don’t. 
* Moderator: If we keep this page super concise if you need more info, how would you like that? A link out?
    * This page is pretty good. It’s telling you that you have to do that.That link out has to be as simple as possible. Simple, baby steps. 
* Roughly 30 mins in: Clicks to start claim.
* We see an error after clicking Start. We refresh. It goes to intro page, but without the link to file on VA.gov. 
* We look at the claims list. 
* **Bug?** On a paid claim, we see the alert about the appt being over 30 days. 
* He doesn’t like the deductible, but understands that it’s not our team who decides that. 
* Where would you click if you needed help?
    * None of them. I’d just call. 
    * We tried the facility link, then realized that this isn’t the travel pay footer, so we can’t test the link we wanted to test. 
* Told him he can create an appt in BTSSS. Says the mobile clinic doesn’t appear in any of the dropdowns to file manually. 
* They’d love to reschedule and try to file with us. 
* Don’t have a receipt; just need to file mileage.

* Note section


### Additional Task C: User deletes an expense

* Note section


### Additional Task D: User leaves and re-enters the flow

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to pause or leave before you’ve submitted a claim. For example, maybe you need a few more days to find a receipt that you want to include in your claim. What do you think will happen if you close this tab? You may go ahead and close it.**

**Let’s pretend you’re ready to continue working on your claim. How would you find it again?**
