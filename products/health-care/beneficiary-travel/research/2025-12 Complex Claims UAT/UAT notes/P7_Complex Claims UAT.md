## Warm-up Questions

1. **Have you filed for travel pay before? Share more about why or why not.**
    1. I file all the time on my phone. Not as familiar with doing it on the website. 
    2. Used the website for lots of other things. It’s so easy in the app. Often prompts you when you check in for appt. 
2. **Do you have direct deposit for VA Health Benefits set up?**
    3. Yes
3. **Have you successfully received travel pay via direct deposit before?**
    4. Note section


## User commentary about navigating to their appointment

* He’s using a computer today.
* Generally seems familiar and comfortable with tech.


## Task 1: Starting a claim

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Intro page]? Please think out loud as you explore.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant understand the information on the intro page?*
* *What, specifically, do they notice about the information presented here?*
* *Does the participant notice and click the action link to create the claim?*

* Intro page: Looks like step by step process. First see if you're eligible. If you're not sure, click the link here. Second step is direct deposit. I’m aware it’s a separate direct deposit. Last is to file your claim. (This is different from the app…)

## Task 2: Select expenses round 1

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Select expenses page]? What do you expect to do here?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant start with mileage?*
* *Does the participant try to select multiple expenses at one time?*

* Starts claim: asks if youre doing it for milage only, which I am. To and from the house. 


---


## Task 3: IF participant selects “mileage” - mileage questions

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [mileage questions].**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant have any questions about how mileage is calculated?*

* This confirms that I departed from the house. It obviously knows my house. If you click other address will probably enter a text address to add or search for an address. 
* Selects address and round trip. 
* Moderator: where would find info about how VA calculates mileage? 
    * Participant: This dropdown here? I know it’s officially put out through dept of … something. Subsidiary or part of the IRS that publishes the mileage rate every year. I assume… we can click this dropdown, it wont take us to another page. Mentions that we don't need to submit expense form. 
* Moderator: what do you think the ← Back link takes you back to?
    * Previous page. Won't make you start all over. 


---


## Task 4: Actions from the unsubmitted expenses page

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [unsubmitted expenses].**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant see their expense was added successfully?*
* *Are they able to add more expenses?*
* *Do they understand that nothing has been submitted yet?*

* Says I successfully submitted mileage expense and asks me if I have more expenses. 
* This is a bit confusing to me to see because it says your submitted expenses but below says I've successfully added a mileage expense. It would it make more sense if said “Any other expenses” or “do you have any other expenses to claim?” then gives you the option. Seems a bit contradictory. Idk what would be a better option, but it seems a bit confusing. 
* Estimated reimbursement: that's interesting… miles (I think it’s 12/24 round trip) but the rate seems wrong. I've only done it through the app and app doesn't tell you the estimated reimbursement. I think the current rate is 70 cents/mile. So it should be much more than $3.29.
* Expands mileage card, thinks it’s clear.
* Reads more about the deductible in the gray box. ‘Ve come across this before. Doesn't mention it on the app but does online. It’s a bit confusing… What is the deductible? It doesn’t make sense. I'm sure I could click the hyperlink to learn more. 
* Moderator: Does this amount take into account your deductible?
    * I've had a dozen appointments this month. Some are much more mileage than this. So I'm sure where it says I pay no more than 18. I know you can see past claims, but the list doesn't break it down (showing each deductible) in one place. You’d have to open each individual one to explore.

## Task 5: Select expenses round 2 - user continues to add expenses and uploads a receipt

**Moderator: Prompts as needed. If the user selects “add more expenses,” they will be back on the expense page for a second time. **

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant try to add a second mileage expense?*
* *What expense do they add next?*

* Moderator: How would you add a toll expense?
* Adds more expenses and selects toll. 

* Would like to select multiple types of expenses at once. If you have lodging, you probably also have meals, maybe airfare, etc. It might be confusing to some, but it might be easier for me. I don't think it’s bad to do it this way though. 
    

### Expense page: The user should now be on the expense page that corresponds with their selection

**Moderator: Tell me about this page. What do you expect to do here?**



* **If the user does not have a receipt ready, let them know they can add other expenses, then return to this claim when they are ready to add this receipt. Prompt them to cancel this expense and add any other expenses for which they have a receipt.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *How do they choose to upload a file? Do they drag and drop or do they upload from their computer?*
* *How do they organize their receipts? Do they mention having some on paper?*
* *Do they mention needing to pause to find more receipts?*
* *Do they understand the field labels and hint text?*

* Here you can add more information. Description: some folks might like to send several page dissertations about why they had to use the toll road. But I understand that it’s a brief description–you could say “it saved 20 minutes or 20 miles”. 
* Moderator sends file. Drags file in successfully. Likes the image preview o make sure its the right thing.
* Moderator: if it was a paper file, how would you upload?
    * You could scan it in with a printer. 
* User deletes file. Likes that has modal confirmation. 
* Likes that you can choose from folder OR drag and drop. The file explorer is old school way, but with audience (I'm on the younger end of age spectrum) they might be less familiar with drag and drop, so good to have both options. 
* Where does breadcrumb go?
    * Previous page, as if I hadn’t selected any additional expenses. (I think he’s saying the Review page.)
* He adds metadata. 
    * Types 5.34 for amount. Appreciates amount hint text. 
    * I can see Description is required, needs 5-2000 characters. I can’t type “none” or “NA”.
    * I'm sure if I didn't do requirements it'd give mea pop up or identify which is required. 
    * He Continues. Likes that button tells you it’s loading, working on the upload. 
    * Review page: I like that it gives you itemized details in gray box. You can expand these. 
    * To change it I’d click Delete to delete it all together. But if I wanted to change the upload or description, cost, date, etc. id click edit. 
    * Clicks to Edit. Notes that you can change the file, delete it entirely. But I see it’s required to have something uploaded. Changes date. It’s nice that when you hit Edit it doesn’t delete everything starting from scratch. I like that all the info you entered is still here. 
    * Yes, date saved, good. 
    * If I had to leave and come back, it would not be saved. There's no save and exit, save and continue later, etc. The only option to proceed is to sign the agreement.
 
* Lodging selection page: 
        * lets you choose a file. This would be your lodging receipt. 
        * Where did you stay: that could be refined. Are you looking for city/state or name of the facility itself. 
        * Add date on receipt: Im sure thats helpful on backend.
        * Same as before with tolls–you have amount and forced description. 
            * What do you think VA wants in description field?
                * To avoid back and forth with VA, I'd tell them why I needed to travel and have overnight stay and now need reimbursement. People looking at expenses might not look at them holistically. Might not know why. 
        * We cancel adding the expense. 
    * Airfare: 
        * File is same
        * Where did you purchase your ticket? I get that it could be from a travel agent, any number of sources online, expedia, etc. That’s good. 
        * Return date, date of receipt. Like lodging, could be differnt than date of travel. Presumably you’d pre-purchase the flight before the flight. 
        * Then the description, the why. Why couldn't I see a local provider. That's helpful because it lets the person know if this is a valid expense.  


### Unsubmitted expenses page: The user should now be on unsubmitted expenses page.

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *When they return to the unsubmitted expenses page, do they notice the successful addition of the new expense?*
* *Do they notice that their total estimated reimbursement changed?*

* We prompt him to click Appts in MHV header. We see yellow alert, but we refresh and appts show. Go to past appt. Sees “complete your travel claim” so maybe the info is still there. Don't recall if it said "complete" or not. 
    * Claim detail page: Claim status incomplete. “Complete and file your claim.” So yeah it saved the info. That's nice. There was no indication that it would save your progress. I often see a “save and exit” or “save and finish later” option. Tells you you can leave and come back. I expect this link will take me back to where I left off, which is the Submit option (I think he means the Review page) with just the mileage. It knows I added that, because it has the same amount on this [detail] page. He clicks to Continue.
    * How would you adjust your mileage? I’d click edit. 
        * I see prepopulated home address. If i select other address, im sure it’d open up another page that gives you what address you drove from. When on telehealth it’ll find an address when you type it. Uses usps locator tool. 
        * If we cancel here, it’ll take us straight back to previous page where we can sign agreement. We cancel. Sees are you sure? 
    * More complex scenario: if i needed to do more expenses id click this button, then select lodging.

## Task 6: User submits a claim

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator can prompt: Are you ready to submit your claim?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user understand they need to select "Sign Agreement" in order to submit?*
* *What does the user do on the confirmation page? What action do they take next?*

* He’s ready to submit. Sees that we deleted the shark photo 😛
* Agreement page: that’s easy. Depending where you do it on the app, if you do it when you check into appt, you confirm and type your name. Select “confirm” and it looks like this is the same, doesn't have you attest to anything by typing your name. Submit. I imagine we’ll get confirmation. 
* Confirmation page: You can write the claim number down. (it is a long number.) you can print it, im sure some do. I don’t usually do any of that because I know I can go back and see all my claims if I want or need. On the app you can go to past appts and look at each one individually. At bottom of that it gives you an option for your travel claims. Here (on website) idk, but we could future it out. 
* I like that it tells you what happens next. Sometimes it takes a while for va to do a lot of things. Says IF we approve your claim, we’ll deposit it. Then you can go to past appointments if want to. 
* Moderator: What would you do now?
    * I’d just close it out here if I have nothing else to do. 
* Observer: Is there a reason you didn't think to open submitted expenses? Did it stand out to you?
    * No, it didn't stand out. This doesn’t have any info other than the mileage expense. It’s not a recap of the date or total. It’s pretty basic info. 
* Would you prefer it being auto-opened, or like that collapsed?
    * I like it collapsed, because idk if I need to review it having already reviewed multiple times before submitting.

## Additional usability tasks

These are additional actions we would like to see, that may deviate slightly from the happy path.


### Additional Task A: User cancels adding an expense

*Observer things to watch for: *



* *Is the user able to successfully cancel adding an expense?*
* Note section


### Additional Task B: User edits an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to edit one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you would like to edit? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

**The user can either: 1) edit the expense metadata, 2) edit the file 3) cancel editing the expense if they decide their information is correct**

*Observer things to watch for: *



* *Does the user know where to go to edit?*

* *What, if anything, seems to confuse them about this process?*
* Note section


### Additional Task C: User deletes an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to delete one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you need to delete? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

* Note section


### Additional Task D: User leaves and re-enters the flow

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to pause or leave before you’ve submitted a claim. For example, maybe you need a few more days to find a receipt that you want to include in your claim. What do you think will happen if you close this tab? You may go ahead and close it.**

**Let’s pretend you’re ready to continue working on your claim. How would you find it again?**

## Post-task Interview

**Moderator: On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely difficult" and 5 being "extremely easy," how would you rate the process to file a travel claim?**

Probably a 5, extremely easy. [The hardest part was  navigating to it.] just because I didn't know where to go to do it. But once there, walking through the steps incredibly easy.


**On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely unlikely" and 5 being "extremely likely," how likely would you be to use this system to file for travel pay in the future?**

Extremely likely. If I’m online it’s really easy on my phone especially when I check in to my appt. If I were on this site and realized I hadn’t done one, I’d do it right then and there because it's incredibly easy. 

**That brings us to the end of our tasks. Do you have any questions for me?**

I’m glad to see you continually making the whole thing better. The last couple years, especially with the app, it's getting there. It’s come a long long way. I’m happy to play a role in that. This is the 3rd or 4th research session with you.
