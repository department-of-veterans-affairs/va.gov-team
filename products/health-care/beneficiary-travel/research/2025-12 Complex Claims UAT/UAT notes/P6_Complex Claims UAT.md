## User commentary about navigating to their appointment

* Was able to navigate correctly

## Task 1: Starting a claim

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Intro page]? Please think out loud as you explore.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant understand the information on the intro page? *
* *What, specifically, do they notice about the information presented here?*
* *Does the participant notice and click the action link to create the claim?*

Appointment details

* Looks like the app, likes the “file for travel reimbursement” claim on the app
* It lets me know if I can file or not, tells me how many dates left to file
* Likes the two links, but taps the top link

Intro

* Looks like the travel reimbursement link, tells me each step to be able to submit it
* There is a notification to set up direct deposit - issue with toggle, seeing old version (and also he does have direct deposit set up)
* Started actual call 30 minutes in due to toggle and login issues


---


## Task 2: Select expenses round 1

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Select expenses page]? What do you expect to do here?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant start with mileage?*
* *Does the participant try to select multiple expenses at one time?*

* Selects mileage (check video 30 minutes in)


---


## Task 3: IF participant selects “mileage” - mileage questions

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [mileage questions].**

*Observer things to watch for: *
* *Does the participant have any questions about how mileage is calculated?*

* Unsure how process would change if he stopped to get gas
* Adds address and round trip

To edit:

* Thinks that if he clicked on another address, it would pull something up to populate on the same page
* Thinks breadcrumb would take you back one step
* Hits save and continue as a form of “cancelling”
    * Interesting that the alert on unsubmitted expenses is that you successfully edited, when there were no changes


---


## Task 4: Actions from the unsubmitted expenses page

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [unsubmitted expenses].**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant see their expense was added successfully?*
* *Are they able to add more expenses?*
* *Do they understand that nothing has been submitted yet?*

* Sees estimated amount and how much the deductible is
* Unsure if the estimate amount takes into account the deductible
    * “I would think that if it was included it [the total] would be less than $21”
* Thinks to edit would have to go back to previous screen, then opens accordion to edit, sees that he can edit there and selects edit


---


## Task 5: Select expenses round 2 - user continues to add expenses and uploads a receipt

**Moderator: Prompts as needed. If the user selects “add more expenses,” they will be back on the expense page for a second time. **

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant try to add a second mileage expense?*
* *What expense do they add next?*

* Unsure about adding other expenses in the pretend scenario; unsure about adding pretend airfare…then notes the add more expenses button
* Sees options on the select expenses page - in line with expectations


### Expense page: The user should now be on the expense page that corresponds with their selection

**Moderator: Tell me about this page. What do you expect to do here?**

* **If the user does not have a receipt ready, let them know they can add other expenses, then return to this claim when they are ready to add this receipt. Prompt them to cancel this expense and add any other expenses for which they have a receipt.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *How do they choose to upload a file? Do they drag and drop or do they upload from their computer?*
* *How do they organize their receipts? Do they mention having some on paper?*
* *Do they mention needing to pause to find more receipts?*
* *Do they understand the field labels and hint text?*

* Pretend airfare expense; sees content to upload proof, and roundtrip flight and options to upload receipt. Observers additional fields “sounds pretty straightforward”
* Thinks in this case back breadcrumb would go back to the select expenses page
* Notes the ‘cancel adding expense button’ on this screen
* Can close the alert (already have a ticket)
* Pretend parking: Adds more expenses, back to select expenses page
* Selects parking; notes the receipt upload (“I would take a picture and drag and drop”)
    * “I would select the choose from folder option”



### Unsubmitted expenses page: The user should now be on unsubmitted expenses page.

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *When they return to the unsubmitted expenses page, do they notice the successful addition of the new expense?*
* *Do they notice that their total estimated reimbursement changed?*

* Note section* *

## Task 6: User submits a claim

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator can prompt: Are you ready to submit your claim?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user understand they need to select "Sign Agreement" in order to submit?*
* *What does the user do on the confirmation page? What action do they take next?*

* User reads agreement and confirms
* Likes confirmation page, when I submitted and my claim number, option to print page for record, usually I screenshot before I get approval of denial
* Usually I screenshot and wait for approval; checks the app for approval
* Once it says submitted, I just leave
* I do like that you can go back and look at the status 
* Now sees the help number

## Additional usability tasks

These are additional actions we would like to see, that may deviate slightly from the happy path.


### Additional Task A: User cancels adding an expense

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Is the user able to successfully cancel adding an expense?*

* Note section


### Additional Task B: User edits an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to edit one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you would like to edit? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

**The user can either: 1) edit the expense metadata, 2) edit the file 3) cancel editing the expense if they decide their information is correct**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user know where to go to edit?*
* *Is the user able to edit the information (metadata/file) that they would like to edit?*
* *Does the user understand that they have been redirected to a page they previously filled out?*
* *Does the user notice the success alert at the top of the unsubmitted expenses page, if they complete their edit?*
* *What, if anything, seems to confuse them about this process?*

* Note section


### Additional Task C: User deletes an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to delete one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you need to delete? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

**The user can either: 1) delete the expense or 2) cancel deleting the expense**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *When deleting an expense, is the user confused by the loading indicator in the card?*
* *If they delete all of their expenses, what thoughts do they have when they see the empty state?*

* Note section


### Additional Task D: User leaves and re-enters the flow

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to pause or leave before you’ve submitted a claim. For example, maybe you need a few more days to find a receipt that you want to include in your claim. What do you think will happen if you close this tab? You may go ahead and close it.**

**Let’s pretend you’re ready to continue working on your claim. How would you find it again?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Can the user re-enter the flow?*
* *How do they they return to the flow? (Do they re-enter the flow from claims details or past appointment details?)*
* *What do they want or expect to do at this point?*

* Note section


### Additional Task E: User leave the flow while on an expense page

**If the user exits the flow from a partially filled expense page, rather than unsubmitted expenses, the moderator can prompt them for their expectations around whether their information is saved.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user understand that the data they entered was not saved when they left this page?*

* Note section

## Post-task Interview

**Moderator: On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely difficult" and 5 being "extremely easy," how would you rate the process to file a travel claim?**
* 5 - extremely easy

**On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely unlikely" and 5 being "extremely likely," how likely would you be to use this system to file for travel pay in the future?**
* 5 - likely
* Would probably just use the app, it’s right there on the home screen

**That brings us to the end of our tasks. Do you have any questions for me?**
