## Warm-up Questions



1. **Have you filed for travel pay before? Share more about why or why not.**
    1. Yes. Have filed with paper, on BTSSS, and navigating through MyHealtheVet (which eventually goes to BTSSS)
2. **Do you have direct deposit for VA Health Benefits set up?**
    2. Yes
3. **Have you successfully received travel pay via direct deposit before?**
    3. Yes


## User commentary about navigating to their appointment



* Laptop user; usually goes to VA.gov for appointments and medications, taking a bit of a roundabout way, going to medications first, then can pick appointments from the top
* Eventually made her way to past appointments, mentions that sometimes they don’t show up (depends on video or in person/sometimes therapist travels to her)
* Bug? 7:15 from past appt detail, clicked "Back to past appts" breadcrumb and it brought up the SMOC intro page. Happened again around 8:06.

## Task 1: Starting a claim

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Intro page]? Please think out loud as you explore.**

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *Does the participant understand the information on the intro page?*
* *What, specifically, do they notice about the information presented here?*
* *Does the participant notice and click the action link to create the claim?*


* From appointments page: did see text about 30 days and understood there would likely be no reimbursement and it would be rejected
* Used to just seeing BTSSS, doesn’t usually see the “start your travel reimbursement claim link”
* Wants to click the new link, knows that BTSSS will take a long time to load. 


---

## Task 2: Select expenses round 1

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Select expenses page]? What do you expect to do here?**

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *Does the participant start with mileage?*
* *Does the participant try to select multiple expenses at one time?*

* Picks mileage. “On the website it seems like I have to go back…like if there’s food or parking, for community care if I pay for parking, I have to attach that and go back to the different pages.”


---


## Task 3: IF participant selects “mileage” - mileage questions

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [mileage questions].**

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *Does the participant have any questions about how mileage is calculated?*

* Picks home address
* Recalls that mileage is calculated by end (not on this screen); assumes they go off of google maps, and thinks they can see traffic and weather for the date (did not look at the additional info mileage component)
* Puts one way - gets to the BTSSS redirect message “that is my home address, I don’t know why it’s saying that”
* Thinks the message is telling her that the address is the issue
* Recounts that there were times she has driven to the hospital, but has had to stay, so thinks that would be one way 


---


## Task 4: Actions from the unsubmitted expenses page

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [unsubmitted expenses].**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant see their expense was added successfully?*
* *Are they able to add more expenses?*
* *Do they understand that nothing has been submitted yet?*

* Notices the sign agreement right away and estimated reimbursement; notices deductible wording
    * Questions about the deductible “what deductible am I paying?”
    * “I would look at what transportation would get vs me, so I never knew I was paying a deductible. I just know what I would get typically.”
    * Thinks different formatting would maybe help - reiterated that she never knew she was paying a deductible
    * Guessing she would make more if there was no deductible
    * Unsure about how amount is calculated for deductible and whether that is included in the estimated reimbursement
    * “If I have an appointment and it’s a day away, they try to make it all part of one trip” - so appointments on the same day if farther away
    * Maybe make it more explanatory; maybe put it in there “this is the amount before deductible and this is the amount after.” Maybe it could show you if you’re already passed it and you would see a different total.
    * If I have multiple appointments in one day, I usually put food, too, but it doesn’t usually change the amount (probably no preapproval)
    * Usually only gets parking expenses approved for community care

## Task 5: Select expenses round 2 - user continues to add expenses and uploads a receipt

**Moderator: Prompts as needed. If the user selects “add more expenses,” they will be back on the expense page for a second time. **

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *Does the participant try to add a second mileage expense?*
* *What expense do they add next?*
* When prompted, “how would you add parking?” moved to parking expenses page


### Expense page: The user should now be on the expense page that corresponds with their selection

**Moderator: Tell me about this page. What do you expect to do here?**

* **If the user does not have a receipt ready, let them know they can add other expenses, then return to this claim when they are ready to add this receipt. Prompt them to cancel this expense and add any other expenses for which they have a receipt.**

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *How do they choose to upload a file? Do they drag and drop or do they upload from their computer?*
* *How do they organize their receipts? Do they mention having some on paper?*
* *Do they mention needing to pause to find more receipts?*
* *Do they understand the field labels and hint text?*


* “They usually want a ‘cover sheet’ to approve” - I think referring to receipt
* Doing a pretend add since this trip did not have any parking receipts
* Adding in pretend data
* Tried to proceed without a file “I would put something here if I had something.”
* Done community care with dental and “there were two of them” - “with the root canal, the VA wanted the cover sheet, but travel wanted the receipt.”
* “It was too much doing all that.”
* Appointment was close to VA so just traveled to VA.
* If paper, would take a photo and then save it. Then pull file.


### Unsubmitted expenses page: The user should now be on unsubmitted expenses page.

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *When they return to the unsubmitted expenses page, do they notice the successful addition of the new expense?*
* *Do they notice that their total estimated reimbursement changed?*

* If wanted to change expense types, would press cancel (didn’t really read modal), but was able to navigate back to unsubmitted expenses page, back to choose an expense page, to pick tolls
* Thinks breadcrumb would take her back to appointment page, but not sure
* Tried to untoggle toll radio button, then used back button to get back to unsubmitted expenses page.

## Task 6: User submits a claim

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator can prompt: Are you ready to submit your claim?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user understand they need to select "Sign Agreement" in order to submit?*
* *What does the user do on the confirmation page? What action do they take next?*
* Doesn’t want to submit past the time frame


---


## Additional usability tasks

These are additional actions we would like to see, that may deviate slightly from the happy path.


### Additional Task A: User cancels adding an expense

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Is the user able to successfully cancel adding an expense?*

* If wanted to change expense types, would press cancel (didn’t really read warning modal), but was able to navigate back to unsubmitted expenses page, back to choose an expense page, to pick tolls


### Additional Task B: User edits an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to edit one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you would like to edit? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

**The user can either: 1) edit the expense metadata, 2) edit the file 3) cancel editing the expense if they decide their information is correct**

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *Does the user know where to go to edit?*
* *Is the user able to edit the information (metadata/file) that they would like to edit?*
* *Does the user understand that they have been redirected to a page they previously filled out?*
* *Does the user notice the success alert at the top of the unsubmitted expenses page, if they complete their edit?*
* *What, if anything, seems to confuse them about this process?*

* When asked about editing, would probably press back again and start all over
* Does not notice closed accordion at first, eventually toggles open with prompting
* Thinks she’d just use back button to edit (seems like she would click the back button all the way up to edit)


### Additional Task C: User deletes an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to delete one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you need to delete? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

**The user can either: 1) delete the expense or 2) cancel deleting the expense**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *When deleting an expense, is the user confused by the loading indicator in the card?*
* *If they delete all of their expenses, what thoughts do they have when they see the empty state?*

* Note section


### Additional Task D: User leaves and re-enters the flow

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to pause or leave before you’ve submitted a claim. For example, maybe you need a few more days to find a receipt that you want to include in your claim. What do you think will happen if you close this tab? You may go ahead and close it.**

**Let’s pretend you’re ready to continue working on your claim. How would you find it again?**

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *Can the user re-enter the flow?*
* *How do they they return to the flow? (Do they re-enter the flow from claims details or past appointment details?)*
* *What do they want or expect to do at this point?*

* Asked about leaving - noted she would probably put add more expenses button (maybe unclear about the leave and come back)
* Mentioned she did have an issue where she didn’t have all the paperwork, had to back to the appointment to get more paperwork, so paying for parking again (additional submission)
* Unclear about leaving and coming back
* “I don’t think it would let me go past the page if I didn’t have the file” - seems unsure that she’d be allowed to leave and come back
* Does seem to indicate that the scenario of leaving and coming back is common, but says “it was starting to fade” - the receipt itself on paper, then took a picture of it
* “Here I don’t know how that works. I don’t know if I could come back. They time you to submit it for travel in general.”
* Did get back into MyHealtheVet from [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) and navigated back to past appointments. 
* Did get back into claim from past appointments and then got to claims details
* Thinks it was submitted after seeing submitted amount on claims details (noted the modal and the alert - note: LM thinks that modal is a little confusing, as if that is the action that is filing it)
* Even if it said “requested” would think that it was submitted; would like it to be worded different, show another option under amount, some kind of indication that you’re submitting later
* Did notice CTA to complete and file, took her back to VA homepage, but browser back did get her back to claim details
* Tried again, then got to unsubmitted expenses, which is what she expected to see


### Additional Task E: User leave the flow while on an expense page

**If the user exits the flow from a partially filled expense page, rather than unsubmitted expenses, the moderator can prompt them for their expectations around whether their information is saved.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user understand that the data they entered was not saved when they left this page?*

## Post-task Interview

**Moderator: On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely difficult" and 5 being "extremely easy," how would you rate the process to file a travel claim?**

* 5 - Extremely easy
* Navigating to get there - very difficult “once you’re there, it’s easy”

**On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely unlikely" and 5 being "extremely likely," how likely would you be to use this system to file for travel pay in the future?**

* 5 - very likely

**That brings us to the end of our tasks. Do you have any questions or final thoughts for me?**

* Please make the sites easier to navigate through
* Most difficult part is the navigating - getting to this part because I had to go to two other sites to just get to this part, and verification, I just want to get there

**Additional observations**

* Thinks there should be an easier way to navigate to travel from MyHealtheVet; spends most of her time there and wants to get to travel faster
* Using the old version of MyHealtheVet
* Doesn’t want to see the My VA stuff
* Would like to see the burden time for herself and other Veterans
* Knows that it will not be reimbursed after 30 days
* Tries to have everything together
* The other submission for expenses could be under the amount
* The burden time and the days left more visible
* Concerns about weird login loop between [ID.me](ID.me), [VA.gov](VA.gov), and MyHealtheVet
