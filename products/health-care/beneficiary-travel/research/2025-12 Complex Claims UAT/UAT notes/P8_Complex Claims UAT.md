## Warm-up Questions



1. **Have you filed for travel pay before? Share more about why or why not.**
    1. Yes
    2. Used paper. It wasn't very smooth at all, I didn’t like it. I noticed there’s an electronic way to do it now and automatically pulls it up. Cool. 
    3. That was on the app. I use that mostly, but I noticed it on the website too. 
2. **Do you have direct deposit for VA Health Benefits set up?**
    4. I think so, yes. 
3. **Have you successfully received travel pay via direct deposit before?**
    5. Yes.


## User commentary about navigating to their appointment

* They are on desktop.
* Already logged in. We go to MHV on the upper right menu, then Manage Upcoming Appts, then Past.
* We click the in person appt, but already filed. 
* Click breadcrumbs (they know this word–maybe somewhat familiar with tech?).
* We find an appt over 30 days.

## Task 1: Starting a claim

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Intro page]? Please think out loud as you explore.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant understand the information on the intro page? *
* *What, specifically, do they notice about the information presented here?*
* *Does the participant notice and click the action link to create the claim?*

* Intro page: When I first come here I see title and know I’m in the right place. I see the 3 step. Do this first, second, third. I can click to get more information on the hyperlinks. 
    * Clicks to learn more about direct deposit. Yes, I did that.
    * Is there a way to… is it possible to put a button to go back to where you were? Or just need to use browser back button. (Would he prefer it to open in a new tab?)
        * We ask. That might be helpful. 
* This is the old system, right? BTSSS? I used it before and found it confusing
* Clicks to start.

## Task 2: Select expenses round 1

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Select expenses page]? What do you expect to do here?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant start with mileage?*
* *Does the participant try to select multiple expenses at one time?*

* You can only select one at a time. It’s kind of confusing. What if I have parking also in addition to mileage? If I have to click mileage, submit, come back and do parking, that’s annoying, inefficient. This might confuse the heck out of people. Confuses me. 
* Do you usually do other expenses, or just  mileage? 
    * Just mileage for me. Sometimes there’s parking or tolls if I go to [city].
* Moderator: Where does ← Back go?
    * No idea. 


---


## Task 3: IF participant selects “mileage” - mileage questions

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [mileage questions].**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant have any questions about how mileage is calculated?*

* Moderator: how would you find out about mileage? 
    * No idea. State or feds decide? I know they follow the guidance from the IRS, I think. I trust it. 


---


## Task 4: Actions from the unsubmitted expenses page

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [unsubmitted expenses].**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant see their expense was added successfully?*
* *Are they able to add more expenses?*
* *Do they understand that nothing has been submitted yet?*

* There is a way to add more expenses. So that ability is there, but have to go back and start all over again. Kinda like a la carte. 
* Expands mileage card. 
* Moderator: how do you expect that it’s calculated? 
    * Whatever the miles is based upon mapquest data or google drive data, idk. Then multiply it by the allowance of the vehicle. 
    * Then there's a deductible it looks like. This is confusing. 
* Moderator: is deductible included in this amount?
    * I think so? But what does $18 mean? I don't understand that statement. Idk why im struggling with it.

## Task 5: Select expenses round 2 - user continues to add expenses and uploads a receipt

**Moderator: Prompts as needed. If the user selects “add more expenses,” they will be back on the expense page for a second time. **

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant try to add a second mileage expense?*
* *What expense do they add next?*

* Moderator: You took taxi. How would you add public transportation?
    * Clicks button to add more, selects public, taxi, rideshare.


### Expense page: The user should now be on the expense page that corresponds with their selection

**Moderator: Tell me about this page. What do you expect to do here?**



* **If the user does not have a receipt ready, let them know they can add other expenses, then return to this claim when they are ready to add this receipt. Prompt them to cancel this expense and add any other expenses for which they have a receipt.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *How do they choose to upload a file? Do they drag and drop or do they upload from their computer?*
* *How do they organize their receipts? Do they mention having some on paper?*
* *Do they mention needing to pause to find more receipts?*
* *Do they understand the field labels and hint text?*

* Public transit page: (I missed some notes on this page)
* Description: Moderator: could we add more to make it clearer?
    * Yes. I'm ignorant about what to add. What's the reason to add it? I wouldn't know what should be there. 
* (We send a pretend receipt to add.)
    * This will be quite a challenge for older population of Vets. They have to get it off their device, or scan it somehow. 
    * Chooses from folder.
* Moderator: Did that operate as expected?
    * Yes, pretty quick. Said it can’t be larger than 5mb, so might kick it out if over that, or not the file type it’s looking for. 
* Moderator: If you had a paper receipt, how would you add it here?
    * I have a scanner app I use. Or I take a screenshot with my phone and share it on Google Drive. 
* Adds metadata:
    * Taxi
    * Medical reasons
    * May 20, 2025
    * 5,000,000 → enter amount in numbers (but he reads *dollars*). Enters 5.000.000. Still same error. He enters 9..059, 9.059, 9.59. Yay! 
    * Tries w/o description, sees error. Description field error triggered on blur after entering field. Correct?
    * Continue


### Unsubmitted expenses page: The user should now be on unsubmitted expenses page.

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *When they return to the unsubmitted expenses page, do they notice the successful addition of the new expense?*
* *Do they notice that their total estimated reimbursement changed?*

* This is the same thing as we saw. Just confirming all the details. 
* We ask him to delete the taxi. Clicks breadcrumb. 
    * Did you expect that? No. 
    * Clicks to file, saw pop up.
* Claim detail page with yellow alert: I see claim number and saved. Oh this gets dicey, I see that file here. How do I edit that thing? No idea. Complete and file your claim I guess? I didn't know where to go to edit the thing. 
* We ask them to delete it, then how not to delete
    * Didn’t like modal pop up. No wait did, it’s helpful. But thinks some ppl grump about it. Agrees it’s helpful. “It’s saved my bacon a couple times.”
* Chronic pain affects the brain.

## Task 6: User submits a claim

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator can prompt: Are you ready to submit your claim?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user understand they need to select "Sign Agreement" in order to submit?*
* *What does the user do on the confirmation page? What action do they take next?*

* We confirm that it’ll probably be denied. 
* Clicks to sign agreement. They are asking you to confirm you’re not double dipping. Wish they’d use layman's terms. 
* He’s open to submitting. 
* ERROR. “We couldn't file your travel claim in this tool right now.”
    * We refresh in the browser. Claim submitted! But no alert with confirmation number. 
* I usually save as a PDF in case I need to refer back. We saw him do that. 
* Moderator: Would a claim number be helpful?
    * Probably would be, yes. [When we saw that bug] If you didn't tell me I’d be confused. 
* This gives you some info, and a phone number, and feedback. I usually don't look at the feedback, I just make sure it is processed the way it should. It’s helpful to have link to past appointments (I think that’s what he pointed to?)
* Moderator: What would you do next?
    * I’d close out. I accomplished my objective.

## Additional usability tasks

These are additional actions we would like to see, that may deviate slightly from the happy path.


### Additional Task A: User cancels adding an expense

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Is the user able to successfully cancel adding an expense?*

* Note section


### Additional Task B: User edits an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to edit one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you would like to edit? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

**The user can either: 1) edit the expense metadata, 2) edit the file 3) cancel editing the expense if they decide their information is correct**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user know where to go to edit?*
* *Is the user able to edit the information (metadata/file) that they would like to edit?*
* *Does the user understand that they have been redirected to a page they previously filled out?*
* *Does the user notice the success alert at the top of the unsubmitted expenses page, if they complete their edit?*
* *What, if anything, seems to confuse them about this process?*

* Note section


### Additional Task C: User deletes an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to delete one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you need to delete? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *When deleting an expense, is the user confused by the loading indicator in the card?*
* *If they delete all of their expenses, what thoughts do they have when they see the empty state?*

* Note section


### Additional Task D: User leaves and re-enters the flow

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to pause or leave before you’ve submitted a claim. For example, maybe you need a few more days to find a receipt that you want to include in your claim. What do you think will happen if you close this tab? You may go ahead and close it.**

**Let’s pretend you’re ready to continue working on your claim. How would you find it again?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Can the user re-enter the flow?*
* *How do they they return to the flow? (Do they re-enter the flow from claims details or past appointment details?)*
* *What do they want or expect to do at this point?*

* Note section


### Additional Task E: User leave the flow while on an expense page

**If the user exits the flow from a partially filled expense page, rather than unsubmitted expenses, the moderator can prompt them for their expectations around whether their information is saved.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user understand that the data they entered was not saved when they left this page?*

* Note section

## Post-task Interview

**Moderator: On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely difficult" and 5 being "extremely easy," how would you rate the process to file a travel claim?**

* 4, Really easy. Just some things that weren't really clear originally. 

**On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely unlikely" and 5 being "extremely likely," how likely would you be to use this system to file for travel pay in the future?**

* 5

**That brings us to the end of our tasks. Do you have any questions for me?**

* Any way to use tech to automate tasks is good. 
* Nothing else, it’s awesome. Hats off to you for doing this. 
* The only other feedback I have is that I didn't even know this was a feature–was there a notice sent out? I wasn’t even aware. I just logged in one day and thought, cool! (Travel pay in general.) Now it's right in front of my face.
