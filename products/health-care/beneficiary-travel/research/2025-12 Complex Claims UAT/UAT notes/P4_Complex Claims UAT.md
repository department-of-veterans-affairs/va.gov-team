## Warm-up Questions

1. **Have you filed for travel pay before? Share more about why or why not.**
    1. Yes. Haven’t done it online, but before through the kiosk. 
    2. There’s no reason she hasn’t filed online, but the kiosk feels more convenient to do on the spot. You might forget if you don’t do it then and there. 
2. **Do you have direct deposit for VA Health Benefits set up?**
    3. Yes. Has received funds that way. 
    4. Has a question, she forgets… when you go to the one where they send you to the outskirts, the non-VA care, can you also file for those? You don’t see the kiosk there and you don’t think about it. 
    5. [We say many are eligible for travel pay and can be done on the portal] 
3. **Have you successfully received travel pay via direct deposit before?**


## User commentary about navigating to their appointment

* On Android device
* Login has gotten so complicated! Made her sign in like, 3 times. Then she selected to verify and it required a selfie video to verify. 
* Launched the mobile app and took us a long time to navigate to the right page.
* She didn’t have an appt for which she could schedule a claim.
* This shows the need for a way to filter past appts by whether you’ve filed or not, or at least show which ones you’ve filed for in the list.


## Attempts to start a claim

* Many of the links are launching the mobile app instead of in the browser. We spend some time trying other links to access past appointments.
* At 15:30 we were finally able to see past appointments without launching the mobile app.
* At 17:36 we looked at a claim detail page.
* At 18:35 we view the past appointment page for a community care appointment. There’s no link to file. We thought it should give you a link to BTSSS. Bug? 
* Around 21:20 participant wonders if a prescription would serve as proof of attendance for a community care appointment. Thinks it would show in the VA system because VA ordered the prescription. We explain that there are multiple systems, not necessarily connected. 
* 24:58 we navigate to the claims list (actually get there at 26:04). She doesn’t have any in-progress claims (all are in manual review or paid).
