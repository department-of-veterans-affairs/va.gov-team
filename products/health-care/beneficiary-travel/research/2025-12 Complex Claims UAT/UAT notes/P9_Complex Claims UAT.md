## Warm-up Questions

1. **Have you filed for travel pay before? Share more about why or why not.**
    1. Many times. I would go typically either directly into BTSSS or I would have a link and I haven’t used it (this way) I would be in one of the websites and there would be a link via benefits (I think not sure) and there was a link going into BTSSS and I would have to relogin, which I thought was quite cumbersome.  I am already in a VA system why would I need to login in again but seems to be resolved
    2. Medical folder and  a VA App and I go into that and it tells me that I have one appointment that I don’t know if it is okay…under past appointments in the activity page one is eligible for travel reimbursement and then I hit the arrow and it takes me to where I can do my claim. 
    3. In person in 3- day? Yes and would like to travel for it today. Held off specifically for this study
2. **Do you have direct deposit for VA Health Benefits set up?**
    4. Yes
3. **Have you successfully received travel pay via direct deposit before?**
    5. Yes with no problem 

**Notes from participant before getting started:**

* One of his pet peeves so he is glad to participate. Things have greatly improved and I even see new improvements. So I am pleased to do my latest travel claim with you. 
* My last couple claims I haven’t used BTSSS instead used [VA.gov](VA.gov) or the app. 


## User commentary about navigating to their appointment

* I was logged in when I checked to see what the page said. Still logged in. 
* He is in the mobile app so we redirect him to [VA.gov](VA.gov)
* He points out past appointments and eligible and just clicks the arrow
* Goes to [VA.gov](VA.gov) and has to do the login process
    * Now you can see why I do it the other way. One button click is easy (referring to way he has been doing it)
* Asks about last one “file for travel” - clicks on manage health appointments
    * Go to your appointments -> gets him to mobile app 
    * Menu -> File for travel pay reimbursement - “that was what my finger was hovering on” -> go to past appointments -> launches the app 
    * Tells him to use the BTSSS link and then logs in (referring to the method he typically does)
    * Tries menu -> “manage health appointments” 
    * Men -> myhealthevet -> manage upcoming appointments -> gets an error and refreshes browser -> past -> 
* Has a claim with a receipt from the 12th to the ENT. 
* *Looks like I am going to hit the green button with the arrow to hit travel a reimbursement claim *

## Task 1: Starting a claim

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Intro page]? Please think out loud as you explore.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant understand the information on the intro page?*
* *What, specifically, do they notice about the information presented here?*
* *Does the participant notice and click the action link to create the claim?*

* SO I am getting ready to file a travel claim. I got to this page here. I don’t need to check my eligibility to set up direct deposit so I keep going until I find something I want to do…file claim. I would hit go to BTSSS in the middle of the page. 
* I would hit the green button here that says start your travel reimbursement claim
* Makes me wonder why the go to BTSSS link is right above that?
    * **Why do you think it is there?**
        * Reads it more in depth and then makes sense of it. 
            * That makes sense now, I can see why it is there. But I thought it would have been under the other one. As long as I read the whole page I get the information that I need. 
    * Would do button link - clicks on start travel reimbursement claim 


---


## Task 2: Select expenses round 1

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Select expenses page]? What do you expect to do here?**

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *Does the participant start with mileage?*
* *Does the participant try to select multiple expenses at one time?*

* What type of expense do you want to add. So now I go through how to do the claim. Just real quick, the last couple claims I did, I didn’t have any attachments. When I checked into my appointment and if I didn’t have receipts I clicked on did I want to file a mileage only claim and click yes and boom it is all done, can’t get any easier. In this case I will have mileage and tolls so I will click those. I don’t have any other . I guess I have to do them individually. 
* Been awhile since I am seeing this screen. So I guess it will let me go back to do tolls. So now I click continue? 
* I hope there is a back button. 
* Clicks continue


---


## Task 3: IF participant selects “mileage” - mileage questions

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [mileage questions].**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant have any questions about how mileage is calculated?*

* Shows how they would calculate the mileage. SHows home address. I get to pick round trip or one way. Clicks his home and round trip
* **If you had to stop for gas what would you expect?**
    * I would ignore the fact that I stopped by for gas. I don’t see any need to mention that. The way I understand how the system works is like any travel claim while I was in the military. It is going to tell me the official mile distance since they have my home address. I don’t see any need to mentioned I stopped for gas or lunch
* Continues

---


## Task 4: Actions from the unsubmitted expenses page

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [unsubmitted expenses].**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant see their expense was added successfully?*
* *Are they able to add more expenses?*
* *Do they understand that nothing has been submitted yet?*

* Looks to be the right amount (for mileage). 
* Well it is explaining the deductible. 
* One thing I might overlook is “add more expenses” if I wasn't paying attention I might have bypassed. 
* Sign agreement indicates no I don’t want to do that yet. Scroll up and down and look for how to get back without hitting the back button. 
* If I had stopped for gas it wouldn’t have changed the mileage reimbursement
* **KF asks about deductible:** doesn’t think the amount includes the deductible. I suppose if this were my 3rd or 4th for January it would have known I already satisfied in the first 3 but I think that will be done on the other end. I don’t know if all these travel claims are manually reviewed. I don’t know. 
* **KF: first travel reimbursements of the month (which it is):** I am assuming the $6 will come off of that plus my bridge tolls I am going to add in 
* **KF: where would the back arrow take you? **Good question, I am trying to remember the page before this one. We can click it. Take me back to the page of where I am leaving from with my home address. 


---


## Task 5: Select expenses round 2 - user continues to add expenses and uploads a receipt

**Moderator: Prompts as needed. If the user selects “add more expenses,” they will be back on the expense page for a second time. **

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant try to add a second mileage expense?*
* *What expense do they add next?*

* I am curious about what happens if I click the back button. If I want to add tolls going to click add more expenses. And now I can pick my tolls


### Expense page: The user should now be on the expense page that corresponds with their selection

**Moderator: Tell me about this page. What do you expect to do here?**

* **If the user does not have a receipt ready, let them know they can add other expenses, then return to this claim when they are ready to add this receipt. Prompt them to cancel this expense and add any other expenses for which they have a receipt.**

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *How do they choose to upload a file? Do they drag and drop or do they upload from their computer?*
* *How do they organize their receipts? Do they mention having some on paper?*
* *Do they mention needing to pause to find more receipts?*
* *Do they understand the field labels and hint text?*

* He is going to have two tolls. One going to hospital and one going home. I think I will probably end up at the previous page. Fills out the toll page. 
* So I think I have finished with this toll. So then I would hit continue 
    * Oh that is right I have to add receipt
    * Clicks and has a screen shot on his phone. I screenshot my receipts. 
    * Scrolls up and down, clicks continue
    * Error message, we couldn’t add this expense right now. Tries refreshing the page.
        * Did I hit a wrong button, I don’t understand why I got this screen 
        * I was afraid this might happen, this happened to me once before, so it just filed my travel claim. Because it assigned it a travel claim number. 
        * **KF: how can we make it clearer that it is saved and not submitted:**
            * Trying to remember, it's been awhile. I tried to hit save and do not file and the next thing I know the claim was submitted. Would have been one of these and it was a $1.16 toll on the bridge. Didn’t have screenshots of receipts so he tried to save it and it submitted but just let it ride because it was only $1.16. 
            * It does say claim status saved. I suppose from here I would hit the travel reimbursement claim button and then notes the BTSSS link at the bottom of the page. 
        * Can’t complete it on [va.gov](va.gov), he will have to complete it on BTSSS. 
        * Notes the saved language, which is helpful. For me that is a positive thing that it is saved and not submitted. 
        * **Ask about hitting travel claims reimbursement button above**
            * Thinks I don’t know I would do it just to see what happens 
            * My natural inclination would be to hit that link near the top and what's the worst that could happen
            * Clicks that link
                * Similar or different: Kind of what I did expect. Here is that particular claim and the status is saved so that is positive. But what I would expect to see there, which I don’t. What I would like to see. Instead of travel claim details or in addition to, but a link to just go to BTSSS to complete the claim. Another verbage to say to complete your saved claim..maybe that will happen if I push that link. 
                * Clicks link and gets back to the previous page that I had before. I would like to bypass and just get to BTSSS. THis works but yeah anything to reduce the number of clicks. 
            * I see where I could finish it now by hitting the link that was **there before **
        * **Any other appointments from past 30 days:**
            * Sending me to CC, which is a whole new ball game when it comes to travel claims. Probably only a $1.00 worth of gas to get there. I had some cc visits and it was a whole different thing filing those claims. Hasn’t come together in time. 

**KF: Generally speaking, things we should know about travel pay experience:**


* I started using it when it first came out. And I thought when first using BTSSS was the most cumbersome, un user friendly program in his life. That was a few years ago. Now it is seamless and seems to work with the other apps via links. And if I wasn’t logged in can just go directly into BTSSS and find all of my travel claims and the status 
* My last claim was over 30 days so I am gonna see if they will accept it, so maybe I missed out. Only 30 days to make a claim. If the appointment happened it happened and if I forgot to put it in, I am an old guy, give me a break! But I guess it is federal law

**KF: CC travel claims - specific difficulties:**


* I had these 12 visits with the chiropractor. I didn’t realize although they did tell me. I needed to put in proof that I went to the appointment. Things that are done in the VA system there is proof that I made my appointment. Providers must click something. Well with CC, it is outside of the VA system so one needs to attach some sort of proof that I went to the appointment. Initially messed that up and then I went ahead and did my travel claims in batches so I didn’t have all these attachments. I would have to do 4 separate claims but using the same attachment. Providing proof that I was at the appointment. 
* **KF: what document served as proof?**
    * So they gave me basically what would have been an invoice. And then what was done at the appointment. They maybe even put the diagnostic codes on there. But they did details about whatever exercise I did. That seemed to do it. After that they paid all my claims after they rejected all of my claims 
* **KF: Where/when would you want to know about needing that proof?**
    * Trying to remember when I realized I needed proof. May have called the travel office and got through to somebody. I can’t remember if the app or BTSSS told me. If may have been on the info sheet. But now I was hoping to have one we could have done together with an optometrist locally here. But all of that has been done by phone. I don’t have anything that tells me I need to. I know I need to only from past experience, but nothing in hand to tell me that I need to show proof of attending. Kind of important because then the claim gets denied because of no proof. 
    * I didn’t fix it the way the VA wanted me to. They wanted me to file a travel claim amendment using some VA form. My attitude was no I am not doing that, I will just file a new claim as if I hadn’t filed one and then they paid it. I wasn’t about to go through something convoluted because VA forms typically aren’t the simplest forms in the world. Still within the 30 day window. 
    * First time I experienced this 30-day window. I forgot to do it from October. So I went ahead and filed, the system told me I was outside the window but it allowed me to file anyways and see what happens but most likely be rejected. It was in manual review last time I checked the status. 


### Unsubmitted expenses page: The user should now be on unsubmitted expenses page.

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *When they return to the unsubmitted expenses page, do they notice the successful addition of the new expense?*
* *Do they notice that their total estimated reimbursement changed?*

* Note section* *

## Task 6: User submits a claim

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator can prompt: Are you ready to submit your claim?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user understand they need to select "Sign Agreement" in order to submit?*
* *What does the user do on the confirmation page? What action do they take next?*

* Note section

## Additional usability tasks

These are additional actions we would like to see, that may deviate slightly from the happy path.


### Additional Task A: User cancels adding an expense

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Is the user able to successfully cancel adding an expense?*

* Note section


### Additional Task B: User edits an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to edit one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you would like to edit? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

**The user can either: 1) edit the expense metadata, 2) edit the file 3) cancel editing the expense if they decide their information is correct**

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *Does the user know where to go to edit?*
* *Is the user able to edit the information (metadata/file) that they would like to edit?*
* *Does the user understand that they have been redirected to a page they previously filled out?*
* *Does the user notice the success alert at the top of the unsubmitted expenses page, if they complete their edit?*
* *What, if anything, seems to confuse them about this process?*

* Note section


### Additional Task C: User deletes an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to delete one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you need to delete? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

**The user can either: 1) delete the expense or 2) cancel deleting the expense**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *When deleting an expense, is the user confused by the loading indicator in the card?*
* *If they delete all of their expenses, what thoughts do they have when they see the empty state?*

* Note section


### Additional Task D: User leaves and re-enters the flow

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to pause or leave before you’ve submitted a claim. For example, maybe you need a few more days to find a receipt that you want to include in your claim. What do you think will happen if you close this tab? You may go ahead and close it.**

**Let’s pretend you’re ready to continue working on your claim. How would you find it again?**

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *Can the user re-enter the flow?*
* *How do they they return to the flow? (Do they re-enter the flow from claims details or past appointment details?)*
* *What do they want or expect to do at this point?*

* Note section


### Additional Task E: User leave the flow while on an expense page

**If the user exits the flow from a partially filled expense page, rather than unsubmitted expenses, the moderator can prompt them for their expectations around whether their information is saved.**

*Observer things to watch for:*

* *Does the user understand that the data they entered was not saved when they left this page?*
  
* Note section

## Post-task Interview

**Moderator: On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely difficult" and 5 being "extremely easy," how would you rate the process to file a travel claim?**

* 5 - pretty easy to do everything

**On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely unlikely" and 5 being "extremely likely," how likely would you be to use this system to file for travel pay in the future?**

* [Va.gov](Va.gov) website as opposed to the apps? If I am honest, I would say 1, and I could caveat that with, if I can go into the mobile app and it will let me hit that button to file a claim on my eligible travels then that is the way I am going to do it because it is so easy

**That brings us to the end of our tasks. Do you have any questions for me?**

* No, not really. That is what matters. 

**KF: Notifications from Travel Pay?**

* No, the VA app is very useful and it has in past appointments and it shows you that you have one available for travel pay. I suppose if I had been in the app within the window of my claim that would have served as a reminder for me. 
* I don’t even know they paid the claim until I see a weird deposit in my account. 
* Otherwise I have to go into BTSSS to see what the status of the claims are. 

**Website vs. app: **Been doing everything on my phone, but if I was on my desktop, I would probably use the website and not the app



* Super easy to use phone, put my finder print on there. If I hit yes, bam my travel claim is submitted (for mileage only). That is the most simple way of doing it as long as it is only mileage.
