## Task 1: Starting a claim

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Intro page]? Please think out loud as you explore.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant understand the information on the intro page?*
* *What, specifically, do they notice about the information presented here?*
* *Does the participant notice and click the action link to create the claim?*

* Reads eligibility section - “I would check off the criteria to make sure it’s approved.”
* Knows disability rating, knows direct deposit is set up, notes 30 day limit
* “It’s self-explanatory”
* “Why is it telling me to go back to BTSSS if I’m on this site?”
* “Is this a second option [referring to BTSSS] or is this going to be primary?”
* “I’ll tell you right now, I don’t like it. BTSSS is easier. No one goes to [VA.gov](VA.gov) to do anything. Before it was integrated, I’m used to my HealtheVet. I don’t go to [VA.gov](VA.gov). I’m used to the older way.”
* “There’s got to a different way to appease to the crowd. I’m used to this old way. I’m going to tell you I don’t like it.”
* Found CTA start link

## Task 2: Select expenses round 1

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you're seeing on this page [Select expenses page]? What do you expect to do here?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant start with mileage?*
* *Does the participant try to select multiple expenses at one time?*

* “Asks me what kind of expense that I want to add. Travel pay is always mileage. The others don’t apply to you unless you work for the VA.”
* “They never told you that!” - regarding toll payment
* “There’s a map [referring to BTSSS], and it has tolls on the route that I take, I’m a disabled Veteran, I’ve got my sticker. It’s free for me.” 
* Selects mileage


---


## Task 3: IF participant selects “mileage” - mileage questions

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [mileage questions].**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant have any questions about how mileage is calculated?*

* Sees address and trip type - “oh this is quicker”
* Comparing to BTSS “you can edit it on that page, not here…a map. Seems convenient. I like looking at that map.”
* “It’s a two step process from what I understand, because I have to do it in person too. Someone looks at the claim and determine if your route is what you say it is - some people lie - …well maybe I’m jumping ahead and that’s on the next page.”
* [Missed portion on gas]
* Unsure about other complex claim scenarios - never stayed overnight anywhere. Wouldn’t even know who to ask. 
* Back breadcrumb - “would take me to the previous page”
* Clicks continue


---


## Task 4: Actions from the unsubmitted expenses page

**Moderator: Tell me about what you're seeing on this page [unsubmitted expenses].**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant see their expense was added successfully?*
* *Are they able to add more expenses?*
* *Do they understand that nothing has been submitted yet?*
  
* Bug - mileage did not add, page is empty
* Refresh did not work


---


## Task 5: Select expenses round 2 - user continues to add expenses and uploads a receipt

**Moderator: Prompts as needed. If the user selects “add more expenses,” they will be back on the expense page for a second time. **

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the participant try to add a second mileage expense?*
* *What expense do they add next?*

* Started over and selected public transport (with prompting)
* Notes that all of them need a receipt
* “What is other travel expenses?”
* Select airfare when prompted again


### Expense page: The user should now be on the expense page that corresponds with their selection

**Moderator: Tell me about this page. What do you expect to do here?**

* **If the user does not have a receipt ready, let them know they can add other expenses, then return to this claim when they are ready to add this receipt. Prompt them to cancel this expense and add any other expenses for which they have a receipt.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *How do they choose to upload a file? Do they drag and drop or do they upload from their computer?*
* *How do they organize their receipts? Do they mention having some on paper?*
* *Do they mention needing to pause to find more receipts?*
* *Do they understand the field labels and hint text?*

* Knows that the claim will be denied without proof; recalls once taking the bus “but I just put the claim in and it went in” without proof (but that was 2012)
* Thinks the “why you choose to use public transport” are weird. “I didn’t take it for pleasure!”
* “Date has to align with the date of the request?” “Nothing per say [tells me it has to align with the request], you have to remember. You can’t put it for future or for past.”
* Gets error for can’t put future date - “See?”
* Description - “I don’t put anything here, I’ve never done that”
    * Add brief description. “I don’t know if I should put the address. On the paperwork you have to put the center you’re going to.”
    * “Description - what am I putting there? I need more elaboration on that.”
* Tries to proceed without receipt. Sees error.
* “I would have to scan it. And I have an app. I scan it, I upload it to my phone, in a Google folder. When I do it for community care, scan it, download it to my phone, and upload it”
* Airfare expenses:
    * Receipts description, seems to acknowledge that you’d need the separate expenses
    * Pretends to enter airfare data; seems to understand input fields
    * “This is self-explanatory”
    * Would select round-trip to go there and home
    * “Date on receipt? Receipt of what?”
    * Unsure about what the “date on receipt” means, whether thats date flown or date purchased
    * “Description - do they want description of all of this?”
* Meals 
    * “What if you had multiple? Would you have to go in and do it again?” Thinks you would submit multiple times if you had more meals
    * “If you scroll down there should be another option that says “add”” - A button that would save it and then add another of the same 
    * Hits back button to cancel
* Lodging
    * Thinks you would have two copies, one reservation copy and one when you check out
    * Thinks it still all needs to be within 30 days
    * Sees checkout date and believes that corresponds with the checkout date receipt

### Unsubmitted expenses page: The user should now be on unsubmitted expenses page.

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *When they return to the unsubmitted expenses page, do they notice the successful addition of the new expense?*
* *Do they notice that their total estimated reimbursement changed?*

* Notes


---


## Task 6: User submits a claim

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator can prompt: Are you ready to submit your claim?**

*Observer things to watch for: *
* *Does the user understand they need to select "Sign Agreement" in order to submit?*
* *What does the user do on the confirmation page? What action do they take next?*

* Note section

---


## Additional usability tasks

These are additional actions we would like to see, that may deviate slightly from the happy path.


### Additional Task A: User cancels adding an expense

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Is the user able to successfully cancel adding an expense?*

* Instead of cancelling, he just hit the back button


### Additional Task B: User edits an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to edit one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you would like to edit? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

**The user can either: 1) edit the expense metadata, 2) edit the file 3) cancel editing the expense if they decide their information is correct**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user know where to go to edit?*
* *Is the user able to edit the information (metadata/file) that they would like to edit?*
* *Does the user understand that they have been redirected to a page they previously filled out?*
* *Does the user notice the success alert at the top of the unsubmitted expenses page, if they complete their edit?*
* *What, if anything, seems to confuse them about this process?*

* Note section


### Additional Task C: User deletes an expense

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to delete one of your expenses. What would you do if you realized you had added an expense that you need to delete? Users should start this task from the unsubmitted expenses page.**

**The user can either: 1) delete the expense or 2) cancel deleting the expense**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *When deleting an expense, is the user confused by the loading indicator in the card?*
* *If they delete all of their expenses, what thoughts do they have when they see the empty state?*

* Note section


### Additional Task D: User leaves and re-enters the flow

**Depending on the scenario, the moderator may prompt: Let’s say you need to pause or leave before you’ve submitted a claim. For example, maybe you need a few more days to find a receipt that you want to include in your claim. What do you think will happen if you close this tab? You may go ahead and close it.**

**Let’s pretend you’re ready to continue working on your claim. How would you find it again?**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Can the user re-enter the flow?*
* *How do they they return to the flow? (Do they re-enter the flow from claims details or past appointment details?)*
* *What do they want or expect to do at this point?*

* Believes VA saves everything, but the system will log you out. Not a specific thing he noticed about travel pay, just believes that VA will save things
    * Trying to click back to intro page to see text, couldn’t get there
* Believes past 30 day claims “won’t go through” - “I put in a claim and it took them longer than 30 days to make a decision, then they made a decision and it was denied. It wasn’t on me because I put it in on time.”
    * Thinks denial reason was “doctor didn’t sign off on paperwork”


### Additional Task E: User leave the flow while on an expense page

**If the user exits the flow from a partially filled expense page, rather than unsubmitted expenses, the moderator can prompt them for their expectations around whether their information is saved.**

*Observer things to watch for:*
* *Does the user understand that the data they entered was not saved when they left this page?*

* Note section

## Post-task Interview

**Moderator: On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely difficult" and 5 being "extremely easy," how would you rate the process to file a travel claim?**

* 4 - “it’s not thorough on its questions” more detail on input fields

**On a scale of 1-5, 1 being "extremely unlikely" and 5 being "extremely likely," how likely would you be to use this system to file for travel pay in the future?**

* “You have not choice if you want your money. I could put 4 or 3 all day, you have to it anyways”
* Would prefer BTSSS, long process. Would give BTSSS a 4, too. Goes down a lot.Takes a long time, knows there’s a backlog. “You think a claim is getting processed, but it’s not. I would hope they would give you an update instead of having to check in periodically until its done.”
* Then stated that doesn’t want emails and would just login to check.

**That brings us to the end of our tasks. Do you have any questions for me?**

* Note

**Additional comments**

* “I don’t see any issues with this”
* “I don’t know how to get back to that page without all the way starting over. Menu doesn’t direct me back to it - it’s a 3 step. BTSSS just takes you straight there.”
* “See, I don’t like this”
* “This will deter a lot of Veterans, who don’t want to do this” - all the double logging in
* Does seem to understand that BTSSS and [VA.gov](VA.gov) travel pay should show the same info
* Claim that was started does show as incomplete. Claim updated time looks weird. 
* Potential issues with the recruitment. Didn’t know that he wasn’t supposed to submit.
* “It just says travel pay, it doesn’t elaborate” 
* “The receipt is your guarantee, without it, there is no guarantee.”
