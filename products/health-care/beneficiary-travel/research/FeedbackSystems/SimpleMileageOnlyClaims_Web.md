Qualitative feedback:

**Emerging theme:** Respondents are frustrated with the route limitations

“File travel claim. However, it would appear that i CANNOT select the direct I took because of traffic through RI which you have TAKEN  AWAY. I can I can only assume you will give me the lower rate for travel. How slick. Another item to bring up with my congressman.”

“THE ONE THING I DO LIKE IS THAT YOU HAVE HOW MANY DAYS ARE LEFT TO FILE’”

“Filing my travel claim after my scheduled appointment. The last time I submitted a travel claim was 3 months ago. I find it so much easier and quicker filing my claim. I didn't have to much. All I had to do is answer a few questions to validate my information. Once I completed the questionnaire, my claim was submitted. I am so satisfied with the new and improved Filing.”

“Reimbursement for travel pay.  Why must each visit be claimed separately which involves jumping around the website several times to fill in the same information per each visit? Navigating back and forth to repeat the same info times the number of visits is wasteful,of time. Also confusing.”

“Please if the claim is made to my bank, or the bank of any veteran's it should be showing in the money received in the total amount paid to the veteran, so that when they check to see if the deposit ongoing is made monthly it would show with the benefit amounts for that month.  It would make it a way to track when the payment is made on the site instead of waiting to get a bank statement.  thanks. Great job setting up the new portal.  Making things easier brings better results…”

Qualitative feedback:

By far, the most common task respondents were trying to complete was file for mileage reimbursement for one or more medical visits.

“This was pretty easy with the new system....we can only "assume" the mileage and the fee to be paid is correct as I can't see it like I could in the past.  Why not say your claim is being processed for X miles for a total of $XX.xx.” 

“Mileage reimbursement claim, prior to your online app change I had three choices of mileage from my home to the VA centers in [redacted city]. Now I am not given the opportunity to choose the route I drove to VA. I choose route based on current traffic conditions. Please restore the logic that allowed veterans to correct their mileage expense. Interesting this new app change chooses the cheapest but not always the best route, traffic, accidents weather impacted routes etc. Please quit making IT changes en masse without testing functions that worked better before.”

“Why when signing in through login.gov and I click the link for my connected account va.gov do I have to sign in a second time with the same exact login and password?  I am highly satisfied with everything else about the website but this seems a redundant task.”

“It would be nice to have a little bit longer grace period to file a reimbursement for travel. I see the real reason behind this requirement is to keep more $$ in your pocket which I really don't understand.   Secondly, you have the reimbursement page buried so far down, I have to search for it. It needs to be in the masthead, not hidden somewhere else.”

“File travel reimbursement.  Much simpler than previously.  I would like to see the amount of the reimbursement.  How do I correct mileage for Community Care appointments when they are a follow up and not the initial appointment?”

“Milage reimbursement  **Note: ty for the expedited, just milage claim process, but could you please add a start another milage claim button after the submit process, its a pain in the Butt to navigate back to that main page. Ty”

“Milage reimbursement  Note: ty for the expedited, just milage claim process, but could you please add a start another milage claim button after the submit process, its a pain in the Butt to navigate back to that main page. Ty."

"A little archaic, but it works."

"Not satisfied, as I used to be able to get all of my notes for a specified period of time.  Now I have to click on each one, which is frustrating, as I now have to check multiple windows, when I used to be able to download 3-6 months worth of data into one pdf file."

"To get in it takes forever to get on site it sucks"

"Please provide a "verification" that travel pay has been confirmed. PLEASE!!!"

"This has my wrong address.  I tried updating but it doesn't let me."

Qualitative feedback:

*Task trying to complete:*

“File a mileage-only travel reimbursement.”

“File a travel claim”

*Experience:*

“Travel benefit  I LOVE the new system! So much easier!  Thank you!”

“This is much better than previous milege application which seemed so redundant.”

“File mileage reimbursement claim for an appointment that I attended on May 1st, 2025. So far this has been an easy format to follow and seems to be a slam dunk after having filed one a month ago that required all of my information that has been saved and used to expedite this claim.”

“I filed a travel mileage only claim. This new system is more user friendly and I appreciated it. Thanks.”

"I think so (completed task of apply for travel pay). However, the changes made to the travel claim filing process is frustrating to a non-computer person like me

"I realize this is a new way to file a claim and maybe once one gets used to [typo] become easier, But, is not user friendly."
