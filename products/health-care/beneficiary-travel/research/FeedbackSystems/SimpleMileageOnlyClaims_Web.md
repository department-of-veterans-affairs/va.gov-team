Qualitative feedback:

*Task trying to complete:*

“Claim filed for a VA medical physical (mileage only)”

“Apply for travel pay”

*Experience:*

"I think so (completed task of apply for travel pay). However, the changes made to the travel claim filing process is frustrating to a non-computer person like me

"I realize this is a new way to file a claim and maybe once one gets used to [typo] become easier, But, is not user friendly."
