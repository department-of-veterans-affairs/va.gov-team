Qualitative feedback:

*Task trying to complete:*

“File a mileage reimbursement claim."


*Experience:*

“Milage reimbursement  Note: ty for the expedited, just milage claim process, but could you please add a start another milage claim button after the submit process, its a pain in the Butt to navigate back to that main page. Ty."

"A little archaic, but it works."

"Not satisfied, as I used to be able to get all of my notes for a specified period of time.  Now I have to click on each one, which is frustrating, as I now have to check multiple windows, when I used to be able to download 3-6 months worth of data into one pdf file."

"To get in it takes forever to get on site it sucks"

"Please provide a "verification" that travel pay has been confirmed. PLEASE!!!"

"This has my wrong address.  I tried updating but it doesn't let me."

Qualitative feedback:

*Task trying to complete:*

“File a mileage-only travel reimbursement.”

“File a travel claim”

*Experience:*

“Travel benefit  I LOVE the new system! So much easier!  Thank you!”

“This is much better than previous milege application which seemed so redundant.”

“File mileage reimbursement claim for an appointment that I attended on May 1st, 2025. So far this has been an easy format to follow and seems to be a slam dunk after having filed one a month ago that required all of my information that has been saved and used to expedite this claim.”

“I filed a travel mileage only claim. This new system is more user friendly and I appreciated it. Thanks.”

"I think so (completed task of apply for travel pay). However, the changes made to the travel claim filing process is frustrating to a non-computer person like me

"I realize this is a new way to file a claim and maybe once one gets used to [typo] become easier, But, is not user friendly."
