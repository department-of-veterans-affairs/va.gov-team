# Travel Reimbursement Status Visibility Look and Feel Study 

## Background

The goal of the Beneficiary Travel Pay team is to empower users to do more with their travel reimbursement claims on VA.gov.  Using a prototype of a design concept, this study will inform the design of the Travel Reimbursement Status page on VA.gov by testing the path by which users expect to find the page and how they expect to interact with the information they find on the page.  This will allow the design team to iterate and adjust the design to best fit Veterans’ needs and expectations.

### OCTO Priorities

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.
- Key Result 1: CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.
- Key Result 3: All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.


### Veteran Journey 



1. Starting up
2. Taking care of myself
3. Putting down roots
4. Retiring


## Research Goals


### Outcomes

The desired outcome of this research is to inform the look and feel of the Travel Claim Status page.  This work will inform 1) where the Travel Reimbursement Status page should live on VA.gov, 2) what entry points should be enabled, 3) what language should be used on the page to inform users about a claim(s) and status label language and 4) what types of interaction should be prioritized enablement on this first launch.    


### Research Questions



1. What path do participants take to the Travel Reimbursement page?
   
    1. How many can locate the page without assistance?
       
    3. Where else do participants look for the information on the Travel Reimbursement page?
       
3. What action do participants expect to be able to take from the Travel Reimbursement Status page as it is currently designed?
   
    3. What actions or capabilities would they add?
        
    5. What actions or capabilities would they change?
       
    7. What actions or capabilities would they take away? What do they see as unnecessary?
       
5. How do participants interpret or understand the information about each claim presented?
   
    6. What information would they want to be able to see that they currently do not?
       
    8. Do they understand that the “Claim status” field is telling them where a claim is in the process?
       
    10. Do they understand what status in the “Claim status” field requires them to do something?
        
7. How would participants expect to be able to organize the claim information they see on the Travel Reimbursement Status?
    
    9. How would they want to organize the information on the page? 


### Hypothesis 



1. Participants will know that they have to log into their VA.gov account to access any information about their travel claims.
2. Participants will look in the Claims tool for information about travel claims.
3. Participants will look on My VA for information about travel claims.
4. Participants will expect reverse chronological claim order.
5. Participants will want to sort by claims that need action or attention.
6. Participants will not understand what a claim number is or how to use it.
7. Participants will now know what information they need to take action on a claim in BTSSS.
8. Participants will not understand the difference between the label and the claim status.  
9. Participants will want to deep link into their claim to take action.


## Methodology 

Moderated usability / cognitive walkthrough with 16 Veteran participants.  **10 completed sessions are required for the study to be considered complete.**

Primary Task: Imagine that you have submitted several requests to be reimbursed for gas for traveling to see your VA doctor multiple times following surgery in Spring 2023. You want to know what happened to those requests. **Using this prototype, where would you find this information?**


### Location

Video interviews over Zoom
