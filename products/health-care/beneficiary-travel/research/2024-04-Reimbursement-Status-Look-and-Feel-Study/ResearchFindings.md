## **Research Goals**

The desired outcome of this research is to inform the look and feel of the Travel Claim Status page. This work will inform: 
1) where the Travel Reimbursement Status page should live on VA.gov,
2) what entry points should be enabled, 
3) what language should be used on the page to inform users about a claim(s) and status label language and
4) what types of interaction should be prioritized enablement on this first launch.


## **Research Questions**



1. What path do participants take to the Travel Reimbursement page?
   
    1. How many can locate the page without assistance?
       
    3. Where else do participants look for the information on the Travel Reimbursement page?
       
3. What action do participants expect to be able to take from the Travel Reimbursement Status page as it is currently designed?
   
    3. What actions or capabilities would they add?
        
    5. What actions or capabilities would they change?
       
    7. What actions or capabilities would they take away? What do they see as unnecessary?
       
5. How do participants interpret or understand the information about each claim presented?
   
    6. Of the information presented, what would they change? What makes them say so?
    7. What information would they want to be able to see that they currently do not? What makes them say so?
    8. What information would they take away? What information do they deem as not necessary or superfluous? What makes them say so?
       
    9. Do they understand that the “Claim status” field is telling them where a claim is in the process?
       
    10. Do they understand what status in the “Claim status” field requires them to do something?
        
7. How would participants expect to be able to organize the claim information they see on the Travel Reimbursement Status?
    
    9. How would they want to organize the information on the page? 


## **Methodology**

Moderated usability / cognitive walkthrough with 9 Veteran participants. 

Primary Task: Imagine that you have submitted several requests to be reimbursed for driving to see your VA doctor multiple times following surgery in Spring 2023. You want to know what happened to those requests. Using this prototype, where would you find this information?

## **Hypotheses and Conclusions**

1.  Participants will know that they have to log into their VA.gov account to access any information about their travel claims.

    _Finding: Not supported.  Only 3 of 9 participants started by signing in._

2.  Participants will look on the MyHealtheVet on VA.gov page for information about travel claims.

    _Finding: Not supported.  This was because so few participants signed in and instead took a direct route from Top Pages._

3.  Participants will look in the Claims tool for information about travel claims.

    _Finding: Partially supported.  Participants who signed in first went there but were unsure._

4.  Participants will look on My VA for information about travel claims.

    _Finding: Partially supported.  Since this is the first page they see upon logging in, participants went to what seemed like the first choice on the page to them._

5.  Participants will expect reverse chronological claim order.

    _Finding: Supported.  All participants understood the claim order and how to navigate it._

6.  Participants will want to sort by claims that need action or attention.

    _Finding: Partially supported.  3 of 9 mentioned wanting to sort by status so that they could focus on open or problem claims._

7.  Participants will not understand what a claim number is or how to use it.

    _Finding: Not supported, evidence supports false.  All participants understood claim number conceptually and knew that they would need it to take action on 
     a claim._

8.  Participants will not know what information they need to take action on a claim in BTSSS.

    _Finding: Not supported.  See claim number hypothesis._

9.  Participants will want to deep link into their claim to take action.

     _Finding: Supported.  Participants wanted to take action, but did not call it deep linking._

## **Key Findings**



1. **Finding one:** Participants satisfice.  The majority - 6 or 9 - participants don't think too deeply from the start, but take the first thing that looks available and start their path from the unauth Top Pages section.

2. **Finding two:** As seen in the tree test, expected entry locations were scattered across multiple locations.  Primary locations are Top Pages, My VA: Manage all claims and appeals, My VA

3. **Finding three:** Of the 4 participants who landed on the MHV on VA.gov page, all found the entry point quickly and confidently 

4. **Finding four:** The desktop experience was more successful than the mobile experience - all 4 of the mobile participants but only 2 of 5 desktop participants required direction to find the status page 

5. **Finding five:** All participants understood the overall purpose of the page, its layout and how to navigate the current design 

6. **Finding six:** All participants understood the contents of the claim card conceptually 

7. **Finding seven:** All participants wanted a way to see why a claim was in the status it was in, especially if it was in a negative status (denied, on hold, etc) 

8. **Finding eight:** All participants wanted a way to initiate an appeal of a negative claim from the page 

9. **Finding nine:** Some participants wanted to see how many miles were being covered for reimbursement
    
10. **Finding ten:** Most participants wanted more options by which to sort their claims


## **Details of Findings**

**Finding 1:** Participants satisfice.  The majority - 6 or 9 - participants don't think too deeply from the start, but take the first thing that looks available and start their path from the unauth Top Pages section.

**Finding 2:** As seen in the tree test, expected entry locations were scattered across multiple locations.  Primary locations are Top Pages, My VA: Manage all claims and appeals, My VA

Participants who entered via Top Pages and found the entry had the most straightforward path

Path: Top Pages: Get reimbursed for travel pay > VA Travel pay reimbursement: How do I check the status of my travel reimbursement claim? > Sign in > Check your travel reimbursement claim status

* Of the 3 participants on the desktop, 2 saw the entry point on their own, while 1 went back to sign in after they could not sign in on that page.
*  Of the 2 mobile participants who ended up on the top pages path, neither saw the entry point on their own.

Sign in > My VA: Manage claims and Appeals > Check the status of your travel reimbursement claim OR MHV tab > Check your travel reimbursement claim status

All of the participants who signed in at the start needed direction to find the status page 

* None of of the 5 participants who landed on the My VA page went to the MyHealtheVet tab without direction
*  Both of the 2 desktop participants who ended up on the Claims manager page struggled to find entry point, 1 never found it and 1 almost gave up before finding it
* Neither of the 2 mobile participants who saw the Claims manager page found the entry without direction

**Finding 5:** All participants understood the overall purpose of the page, its layout and how to navigate the current design 

* All participants understood the sort function and pagination conceptually
* All participants found  their Spring 2023 claims 
* Most participants identified the Help section as the best place to start an appeal from the page 
    * Of  6 participants who scrolled down far enough to see the Help section, 5 with saw that as the way to start an appeal from the page but were not confident
    * 3 participants (2 desktop, 1 mobile) simply never scrolled down far enough to see the Help section
    * All participants, even those who did not see the Help section, expected that they would need the claim number in order to get assistance resolving the claim

**Finding six** All participants understood the contents of the claim card conceptually 

<img width="1508" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-17 at 3 50 34 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/129799592/50a7bcd8-fc74-410c-baf3-1a5c4bf4d1b0">

**Finding seven - nine:**  Participants want to engage further with a claim

<img width="1415" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-17 at 3 54 41 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/129799592/e853acdc-cb96-454d-a628-fd9aaaa40525">


**Finding ten:** Most participants wanted more options by which to sort their claims


* Some participants wanted to be able to sort their claims by a more granular date range (ie, 2020 - 2022) (4)
* Some participants wanted to be able to sort their claims by status of the claim (3)
* One participant wanted to sort by location


## **Recommendations**



**Recommendation 1:** Decide what capabilities to implement on status page

<img width="1404" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-17 at 4 10 05 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/129799592/9e98a1e1-f86c-4334-b2b3-1a1cd7d63259">


**Recommendation 2:** Absent another way to start appeal, reconsider Help section

Finding: Most participants identified the Help section as the best place to start an appeal from the page 
- Of  6 participants who scrolled down far enough to see the Help section, 5 with saw that as the way to start an appeal from the page but were not confident
- 3 participants (2 desktop, 1 mobile) simply never scrolled down far enough to see the Help section
- All participants, even those who did not see the Help section, expected that they would need the claim number in order to get assistance resolving the claim

**Recommendation 3:** Amplify the entry point from the unauth VA Travel Reimbursement page, especially on mobile

Finding: Participants satisfice.  The majority - 6 or 9 - participants don't think too deeply from the start, but take the first thing that looks available and start their path from the unauth Top Pages section.
- Of the 2 mobile participants who ended up on the top pages path, neither saw the entry point on their own.
- Of the 3 on desktop, 2 saw the entry point on their own, while 1 went back to sign in after they could not sign in on that page.

**Recommendation 4:** Amplify the visibility of the entry point on the Claims manager tool

Finding: As seen in the tree test, expected entry locations were scattered across multiple locations.  Primary locations are Top Pages, My VA: Manage all claims and appeals, My VA
-  Every mobile user required direction. Neither of the 2 who landed on the My VA page saw the MyHealtheVet tab without direction.  The 2 desktop participants 
   who ended up on the Claims manager tool struggled to find entry point, 1 never found it and 1 almost gave up before finding it
