## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Cara and I'm a Researcher with the VA. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today, I’d like to ask you some questions about how you access and manage your VA claims for travel reimbursement for medical care.  

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:



* This entire session should take about 45 - 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. We may also end sooner than that, and if we have covered everything I want to cover I'd love to give your time back to you.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
* We will be using what we call a prototype. This is not an actual website. It is a file that we use to explore what the website could look like and get feedback from users like yourself before we make any final changes to the website. This prototype will not work exactly like a website but all information is fake. For example, not all of the links will work and you cannot click the back button in your browser because it will take you away from the prototype.  This will require you to share your screen with me.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? Are you comfortable with it if we share anonymized video clips with our VA colleagues for research purposes?



* I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    * If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    * If yes: Admit observers.
    * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
    * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

## Screen sharing instructions

I'm going to ask you to do a couple things on the VA website, VA.gov, and to share your screen so I can see how you navigate on the website. Do you know how to share your screen? 

_Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:_
- Hit Command Shift S for mac



Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.


- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Prototype reminder and think aloud protocol 

Just a reminder, we will be using what we call a prototype to accomplish a task that I will give you. This is not an actual website, all the names and information is fake. It will still work much like a website - you can move it up and down, click on certain things, etc. However, this prototype will not work exactly like a website. For example, not all of the links will work and you cannot click the back button in your browser because it will take you away from the prototype. 

As we go through this prototype to accomplish the task I'll give you, I'd like you to think aloud.  That inner narrative we all have? I'd like to hear it! Again, you are not being tested in any way - the design is being tested.  And we want your honest feedback about your experience.  




## **Task 1: Navigate to Travel Reimbursement Status page**

From landing page:

_Task:_ Imagine that you have submitted several requests to be reimbursed for driving to see your VA doctor multiple times following surgery in Spring 2023. You want to know what happened to those requests. **Using this prototype, where would you find this information?**

Please remember to think aloud and describe what you are looking for.


## **Task 2: Travel Reimbursement Status page expectations**

From travel claims page: 

1. How would you **describe** what you see on this page?

   a. How would you **summarize** this page to another veteran?

2. Looking at this page, what do you expect to **be able to do here**?

    b. Looking at this page, what looks like something you can **click or take action on**?

       - Probe: What makes you say that?
       - Probe: What do you think would happen if you clicked on that?

3.  Looking at this page, what would you want to be able to do on here that you **can’t do now on this page**?

4.  Now let’s look at the card at the top of the page.  Reading through it, what can you tell me about it?
   
    a) What do you think this card is? What is it **about**?
    
    b) What do you think the card **header (the date)** means?
     
    c) What do you think **“Where”** means?
    
    d) When you see **“Claim Details”**, what does that make you think of?
    
    e) What does **“Claim status”** mean to you? What is it telling you?
    
    f) What does **“Claim number”** mean to you? What is it telling you?
    
    g) What does **“submitted on”** mean to you? What is it telling you?
    
    h) What does **“updated on”** mean to you? What is it telling you?
    
    i) What would you **change** about this card and what makes you say that?
    
    j) What would you **take away** from this card and what makes you say that?
    
    k) What would you **add** to this card and what makes you say that?

5.  Coming back to our original task, what can you tell me about **what’s going on with your claims for your Spring 2023** doctor visits?
    - Probe: What does that mean to you?
    - Probe: What tells you that?
    - Probe: What do you think you could do from here?
    - Do you think any of these claims **require you to do anything else?**


## Questions on how to appeal

1. Let’s look at that claim that was **denied**. Imagine that you wanted to **appeal** that claim denial. What **information would you need** to appeal that denial?

2. Do you think you could **start that appeal process from here**?  
    1. If **yes, how** would you do that?
        1. Probe: What **information would you need** to make that appeal?
    2. If no: If you **can’t** start it from here, but you still wanted to appeal, **how** would you do that?

3. I asked you this when we started, but circling back to it now that we have spent some time on this page, what would you want to be able to do on here that you **can’t do now on this page**?

4. Lastly, looking at this page and this prototype as it relates to your experience submitting for travel reimbursement from the VA, do you have any feedback or insight you wanted to share that we haven’t already discussed?


## **Consent to use video clips**



* I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
    * If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## **Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


## **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
