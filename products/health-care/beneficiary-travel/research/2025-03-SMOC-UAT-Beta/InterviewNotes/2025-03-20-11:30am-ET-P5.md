# **Participant 5, 3/20/2025 and 11:30 am ET**


## **Instructions**

We will be able to get ok transcripts from EnjoyHQ, so focus notes on observations, clearly defined interpretations, and impactful utterances.



* Focus on observations of user behavior.
    * Example of observation: “Participants clicks on My VA tab, hovers over X header, then back buttons to landing page.”
    * Example of observation: “Participant says ‘this is annoying, that makes no sense.’ when looking to login to BTSSS.”
* Be clear where notetaker is interpreting or making inferences of what participant is thinking/feeling
    * Example of interpretation: “Based on facial expressions, participant seems to be confused. Going back and forth between X and Y pages seems like they are looking for something.”
    * Example of interpretation: “Participant easily found link no frustration.”

## **Section 1: Warm up questions (max 10 min)**

**1.** What type of device are you using right now?

Notebook/PC - Laptop 
   
**2.** I know that you recently traveled to a VA facility for a medical appointment.  How did you get to your medical appointment (drive, public transit. etc)? 
  -  If drove: did you have to take any tolls or have any parking fees?
    - I drove myself, no parking fee/toll. 
   
**4.** Do you think travel for a medical appointment is something that a Veteran can be reimbursed for? Do you think you could be reimbursed for it? What makes you say so?
   - Yes
   - I know I can for some, but don't know the nuances. Nuances maybe - it should be service related medical appt. 
   
**5.** If you have submitted for travel pay in the past, how have you done so?
  - How often have you submitted for travel pay?
    - Have not submitted in the past.
   
**6.** If you wanted to submit for reimbursement for traveling for your appointment, where would you expect to do that?
  - When it comes to your travel reimbursement claims, what would you expect to be able to do on VA.gov?

       - VA.gov - MHV, I don't go on there often
       - I use VA app on my phone, but didn't see travel claim related.
       - VA.gov is global site, and MHV, also provide resources like PACT.

## Section 4: Final thoughts and closing

**6.** How easy or difficult would you say this process was? What makes you say so? 
- Easy 

**7.** What would you change about this process? What makes you say so?
- "something went wrong" is vague, wants to know why so I know what I need to do.
- It's nice to see links on MHV home payments section.
- another way to get there - main menu > travel pay > read the menu/content list on the travel pay content page 

**8.** What would you keep and why?
- liked multiple places to access it

**9.** Do you have any other feedback about this process for submitting travel claims? Anything else you want to share that we have not covered?
- Straightforward
- Not sure he's able to get reimbursed from the recent appointment - after reading eligibility section
- Wonder if he needs to set up direct deposit again
