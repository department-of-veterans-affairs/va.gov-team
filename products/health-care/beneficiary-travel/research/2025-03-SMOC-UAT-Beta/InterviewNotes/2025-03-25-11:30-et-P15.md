# **Participant 15, 03/25/2025 11:30am ET**


## **Instructions**

We will be able to get ok transcripts from EnjoyHQ, so focus notes on observations, clearly defined interpretations, and impactful utterances.



* Focus on observations of user behavior.
    * Example of observation: “Participants clicks on My VA tab, hovers over X header, then back buttons to landing page.”
    * Example of observation: “Participant says ‘this is annoying, that makes no sense.’ when looking to login to BTSSS.”
* Be clear where notetaker is interpreting or making inferences of what participant is thinking/feeling
    * Example of interpretation: “Based on facial expressions, participant seems to be confused. Going back and forth between X and Y pages seems like they are looking for something.”
    * Example of interpretation: “Participant easily found link no frustration.”

## **Section 1: Warm up questions (max 10 min)**

**1.** What type of device are you using right now?
- iPhone8
   
**2.** I know that you recently traveled to a VA facility for a medical appointment.  How did you get to your medical appointment (drive, public transit. etc)? 
  - "Drove my own car myself"
  -    If drove: did you have to take any tolls or have any parking fees?
    - "No"
   
**4.** Do you think travel for a medical appointment is something that a Veteran can be reimbursed for? Do you think you could be reimbursed for it? What makes you say so?
- "It kinda depends. If it was short, no. It's a longer way for me , so yes. It depends on the distance and vehicle. Gas milage and wear and tear. I beleive they (Veterans) should be paid. With all the trips I take it starts to add up."
- "Yes, I believe I can because of how much gas it takes to get there"
   
**5.** If you have submitted for travel pay in the past, how have you done so?
- Yes
  - How often have you submitted for travel pay?
  - "50, maybe more. In the past 6 months, probably 5 vistis a month."
   
**6.** If you wanted to submit for reimbursement for traveling for your appointment, where would you expect to do that?
- "I tried to go online but now I physically write them to the facility to the Travle office."
- "I went on to the VA app which takes you to another website. I alos ued VA.gov. I used to use My HealtheVet. I like it but it didn't have what I needed."
- 
  - When it comes to your travel reimbursement claims, what would you expect to be able to do on VA.gov?
    - "It should be easy to get to. Boom... icon to get paid. KISS rule... Keep it simple Simon"
  - Do you think you could submit for travel reimbursement on VA.gov?
    - "Yes. If I wanted it, I'd put it towards the top of things to do. DOn't hide it. Don't put BSTT or what ever it is. That's not simple. Something short and easy. Don't hide it in menu"
