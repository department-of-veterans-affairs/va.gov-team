# **Participant 13, March 24 at 2:30pm EST**


## **Instructions**

We will be able to get ok transcripts from EnjoyHQ, so focus notes on observations, clearly defined interpretations, and impactful utterances.



* Focus on observations of user behavior.
    * Example of observation: “Participants clicks on My VA tab, hovers over X header, then back buttons to landing page.”
    * Example of observation: “Participant says ‘this is annoying, that makes no sense.’ when looking to login to BTSSS.”
* Be clear where notetaker is interpreting or making inferences of what participant is thinking/feeling
    * Example of interpretation: “Based on facial expressions, participant seems to be confused. Going back and forth between X and Y pages seems like they are looking for something.”
    * Example of interpretation: “Participant easily found link no frustration.”

## **Section 1: Warm up questions (max 10 min)**

**1.** What type of device are you using right now?
laptop 

   
**2.** I know that you recently traveled to a VA facility for a medical appointment.  How did you get to your medical appointment (drive, public transit. etc)? 
  -  If drove: did you have to take any tolls or have any parking fees?

Drove.  No tolls or parking fees
  
   
**4.** Do you think travel for a medical appointment is something that a Veteran can be reimbursed for? Do you think you could be reimbursed for it? What makes you say so?

Thinks veterans can be reimbursed, but he has not submitted because he is fortunate.  Very grateful.  He's not had a really big cost like airplane.  

   
**5.** If you have submitted for travel pay in the past, how have you done so?
  - How often have you submitted for travel pay?

  no
   
**6.** If you wanted to submit for reimbursement for traveling for your appointment, where would you expect to do that?
  - When it comes to your travel reimbursement claims, what would you expect to be able to do on VA.gov?
  - Do you think you could submit for travel reimbursement on VA.gov?

Would expect to submit on a VA website.  VA office is overwhelmed.  Could see them giving him a piece of paper and saying mail it.  On va.gov, expects there would be mileage reimbursement or a toll or if he had to order an uber.  
He doesn't go on VA.gov often, but he would expect to do something on VA.gov,
