## **SMOC UAT Beta**


## **Background**

The goal of the Beneficiary Travel Pay team is to empower users to do more with their travel reimbursement claims on VA.gov.  This step is to allow users to submit for simple mileage only claims on VA.gov.  This user acceptance test will ensure that the build functions as designed in key scenarios and allow the team to address any issues prior to rolling out further.

### **OCTO Priorities**

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.
* Key Result 1: CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.
* Key Result 3: All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.


### **Veteran Journey**

1. Starting up
2. Taking care of myself
3. Putting down roots
4. Retiring


## **Research Goals**

Test that the build functions as designed for the following scenarios on VA.gov.  As we go through these scenarios, we will work with our engineering team to document what failures in the API transfer we run into so as to ensure that we have 

1. Entry points: Can users - new or established claimants - find where to submit for a simple mileage-only claim on VA.gov? Can participants identify what 
    appointments are eligible for travel reimbursement?

2. New claimant submits (starts and completes) a simple mileage-only claim for a past VA appointment

3. Established claimant submits (starts and completes) a simple mileage-only claim for a past VA appointment

4. Claimant (new or established) starts claim submission on VA.gov but fails to meet criteria for adjudication on VA.gov (e.g., the claimant wants to 
   submit a claim that includes receipts and so answers ‘no’ to one of the 3 qualifying questions) and the claimant is successfully redirected to BTSSS

5. Established claimant confirms that they have already submitted a claim for a past VA appointment 


### **Outcome**

Confirm that the SMOC build functions as designed.  Allow the team to document any errors in implementation.  


### **Research questions**



1. Does what users expect to be able to do related to submitting for Travel Pay on VA.gov match what they are able to do once on VA.gov?
2. Do participants find the entry point to submission from past Appointments?
3. Do participants understand that they can only submit for simple mileage reimbursement on VA.gov?

    a. Does being redirected to a second system (BTSSS) confuse participants?
   
    b. When participants are redirected to BTSSS, do they understand why they are being redirected?
   
4. Do participants know if, when, and where to submit their complex claims?

   a. Do participants know how to go to BTSSS? 

   b. Do participants recognize that they are being redirected to BTSSS?
   
6. Are participants accurately re-directed if they are trying to submit a complex claim?
7. Are participants able to complete a simple mileage-only claim submission if applicable?
8. Can participants differentiate between starting a claim and confirming that a claim has already been submitted?

## **Recruitment**


### **Recruitment approach**

12 completed sessions required.  Recruit 20 Veterans using Perigean recruiting services and the Perigean participant pool.  We will have a kickoff call with Perigean the week of **Monday, 2/24/25** and aim to start testing the week of **Monday, 3/10/25.** We will work with VTP and Perigean to begin the process of setting up a separate database of participants who come in through Travel Pay VSOs that can be used going forward.  The logistics of this will be addressed in the kickoff call with Perigean. 

We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. We request a 30 minute kickoff meeting with Perigean to align on what is needed and desired from the sample. Availability for potential kickoff meeting times with Perigean, depending on their availability is below.

Thursday, 2/27 4pm EST
Friday, 2/28 11am EST
Friday, 2/28 11:30am EST
