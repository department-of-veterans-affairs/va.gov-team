## **Research Goals**

The desired outcome of this study is to test key flows a Veteran user would use when submitting a simple mileage-only claim for travel for  VA medical care on VA.gov.  Broadly, the user experience research areas are around a) if and how users find the entry point to simple mileage-only claim submission from Past Appointments, b) if and how users understand what type of expenses they can submit for on VA.gov, c) if participants understand the simple mileage-only claim submission flow as designed and d) if participants understand when and why they are being redirected to BTSSS for more complex claims.  


## **Research Questions**

1. Do participants find the entry point to submission from past Appointments?

2. Do participants understand that they can only submit for simple mileage reimbursement on VA.gov?
   a. Does being redirected to a second system (BTSSS) confuse participants?
   b. When participants are redirected to BTSSS, do they understand why they are being redirected?
   
3. Do participants know if, when, and where to submit their complex claims?
   a. Do participants know how to go to BTSSS?
   b. Do participants recognize that they are being redirected to BTSSS?
   
4. Are participants accurately re-directed if they are trying to submit a complex claim?
   
5. Are participants able to complete a simple mileage-only claim submission if applicable?
   
6. Can participants differentiate between starting a claim and confirming that a claim has already been submitted?



## **Methodology**

15 60-minute interviews using the live site.  Due to technical constraints, 3 of the 15 were not used for research analysis.
3 primary participant groups, based past usage of travel claims:
7 new claimants filing a mileage only claim
5 established claimants filing a mileage only claim
2 established claimants filing a claim for more than mileage (complex claim)
1 established claimant confirming submission of prior claim.

## **Key Findings**



1. **Finding one:** Participants did not find the entry point to simple mileage-only claim submission from Past Appointments easily.  Once on the Past Appointments page, participants easily found the entry point, but none of the 12 research participants found the Past Appointments page on their own.

2. **Finding two:** Participants focused what they wanted to be reimbursed for. Thoses who wanted to reimbursed for more than mileage were successfully redirected to BTSSS.

3. **Finding three:** Multiple participants successfully completed and understood the simple mileage-only claim submission flow on VA.gov.  Those who ran into errors were successfully redirected to BTSSS when applicable.  

4. **Finding four:** Those who receive disability payments believed their deposit information was set up and did not know to check BTSSS.



## **Details of Findings**

**Finding 1:**  Participants did not find the entry point to simple mileage-only claim submission from Past Appointments easily.  Once on the Past Appointments page, participants easily found the entry point, but none of the 12 research participants found the Past Appointments page on their own.

**Finding 2 and 3:** Participants focused what they wanted to be reimbursed for. Thoses who wanted to reimbursed for more than mileage were successfully redirected to BTSSS. Multiple participants successfully completed and understood the simple mileage-only claim submission flow on VA.gov.  Those who ran into errors were successfully redirected to BTSSS when applicable.

- Participants understood where to submit for mileage and where to submit for more - see video clip in Sharepoint presentation
- Even when unsure if they could submit their claim on VA.gov, participants were accurately redirected by the submission question flow - see video clip in Sharepoint presentation
- When encountering an error, participants were successfully redirected to BTSSS  - see video clip in Sharepoint presentation
- Participants understood where to go to follow up on a claim after submission 


**Finding 4:** Those who receive disability payments believed their deposit information was set up and did not know to check BTSSS.

- Multiple participants successfully submitted SMOC, but misunderstood direct deposit

- When shown information about direct deposit while submitting, participants incorrectly believed that if they received direct deposit payments for other VA sevices and benefits then they were already set up for travel pay direct deposit.  4 of 12 participants (P7, P17, P14, P20) expressed this belief unprompted.

_**“… I'm gonna assume since I have disability [direct deposit is] already taken care of... because it's attached to va.gov and I've already got disability coming in…those are all tied to my account…which should all be under one thing.“ -  P14 (new mileage-only claimant**_



## **Recommendations**

**Recommendation 1:** Recommendation in progress:  Streamline entry points from My VA, the Claim Status tool and other common routes observed.

**Recommendation 2:** Recommend in future building on the “what I can be reimbursed for” mindset in complex claims.

**Recommendation 3:** Recommend in future clarifying content around the need to set up Travel Pay specific direct deposit at or prior to submission.
