## **Intro - max 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Cara and I'm a Researcher with the VA. Today, I’d like to ask you some questions about submitting and managing your VA claims for travel reimbursement for medical care.  Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This entire session should take about 45 - 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. We may also end sooner than that, and if we have covered everything I want to cover, I'd love to give your time back to you.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- During the session, I'll ask you to login to VA.gov and test some features using your own account. I'll be asking you to share your screen, which means we'll be seeing parts of your account, and potentially other health information. We will not use your personal health information for the study and will redact it from any notes we take. Are you ok with sharing your screen?
- I know they asked you this when you signed up, but want to confirm - you have have not submitted for travel reimbursement for your most recent medical visit to a VA facility? What date was it?
- And is this (check list) the email that you use to login to VA.gov?  If not, what email do you use? 
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
    * Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
  - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

 

*Start recording.*



* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
* **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## **Section 1: Warm up questions (max 10 min)**



**1.** What type of device are you using right now?
   
**2.** I know that you recently traveled to a VA facility for a medical appointment.  How did you get to your medical appointment (drive, public transit. etc)? 
  -  If drove: did you have to take any tolls or have any parking fees?
   
**4.** Do you think travel for a medical appointment is something that a Veteran can be reimbursed for? Do you think you could be reimbursed for it? What makes you say so?

Next, I will need you to share your screen so I can see how you use the tool. Can I help walk you through how to start the screen share?

*Help participant share screen:*

- [iOS: Zoom screen share(https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)

**9.** Do you have any other feedback about this process for submitting travel claims? Anything else you want to share that we have not covered?


## **Consent to use video clips and Closing (5min)**


- I want to circle back and **re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip** of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
     - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want  shared in a video clip?

- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!


## **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an[ emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
