## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Mel Choyce and I’m a Product Designer working with the VA. My team is currently conducting research on the VA’s Beneficiary Travel reimbursement system, and we want to get your feedback as someone who has used the system before.

I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about forty-five minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability to use the system. We just want to improve this tool to better meet Veteran's needs. I haven’t worked on the system at all, so I will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- We’re hoping to record today’s conversation, both video and audio – only my internal project team will have access, so we can confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Would that be okay with you?
If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

**Start recording.**
I have started recording. I just want to confirm again: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minute

- To start things off, can I ask where you’re calling in from today?
- How often do you travel to VA medical appointments?
- Do you usually go to a VA Medical Center, or a private healthcare provider?
  - What kind of transportation do you usually take to get there?
  - Do you always request travel reimbursement for your appointments?
- What’s your general impression of the online travel reimbursement system?
- How long does it usually take you to receive your reimbursement? (Shortest? Longest?)

## Interview Questions - 25 minutes

Now, I’m going to have you think about the last time you filed a claim for travel reimbursement online. I’m going to ask you a series of questions about your experience before, during, and after.

**Before:**
- First off, when did you last submit a reimbursement claim using the online beneficiary travel system?
- How did you determine that you were qualified for travel reimbursement?
- What kind of preparation did you need to do before filing your claim?

**During:**
- Where did you file your claim from? Somewhere at home, or elsewhere?
- What devices did you use? (Phone, tablet, laptop, kiosk, etc.)
- Tell me a bit about the login process.
  - Which login service did you use? DS Logon, ID.me, MyHealtheVet, Login.gov, etc
- Once you were logged in, what do you remember about the process of filing the claim?
  - If it’s easier for you to open up the system and look at it now, you can do that.
- What do you remember about what was easy or hard about filing a claim?

If they use a car: 
- Have you ever had to challenge the route, or mileage, while submitting a claim?
- If so: Can you tell me more about that experience?

**After:**
- If their claim was manually reviewed:
  - It looks like you’ve had a claim go into manual review. Can you tell me a little bit more about that process?
- Did you get your claim mailed as a check, or direct deposited? Why did you choose that option?
- How long did it take to receive your reimbursement in this case?

Do you have any general thoughts or feedback you’d like to share with us about the beneficiary travel reimbursement process? What else do you think we should know?

If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing about the travel reimbursement process, what would it be?

## Thank You and Closing - 5 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is really helpful to us as we continue to look for ways to improve the travel reimbursement system for Veterans.

If you think of anything else after this interview that you want us to know, feel free to get back in touch with us. I’m going to drop my email into the chat here, or you can reach out to the person who scheduled this interview.

Lastly, we may do additional research throughout our project. Would you be open to speaking to us again if so?

Thank you so much, and enjoy the rest of your day!
