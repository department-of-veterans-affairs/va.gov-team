# Ideas for Future Research Ideas 'Brainstorm' Log 

This is a running list of ideas for research related to Travel Pay.  Ideas on this list have **not** been evaluated, planned or prioritized.  If it's on this list, that does not automatically mean a study will happen.  All ideas will have to go through an evaluation and prioritization process.  Those items can be found at TBD.  Questions? Please reach out to Cara Frissell or Micah Taylor

### Idea 1: 'Listening tour' painful parts 
A study or 'listening tour' whereby we would observe veterans using the current online experience and document what part of the process they stumbled upon.  This would help us learn where the most painful parts of the process are. Analytics and other feedback mechanisms would be helpful here. 

### Idea 2: Status language 
This would build on prior research to dig into the different user facing language and labels around statuses at different points in the process.  We could test different language and/or gauge comprehension of current language.

### Idea 2a: Status labels lifecycle
This study would look at how often certan statuses are triggered (for example, "Manual Review") to understand what statuses are common and which are edge cases.  Hopefully this could lead to how long a claim usually stays in a status (e.g., on average, of the 8% of claims that enter "Manual Review", a claim stays in this status for 4 business days before transitioning to another status").  It's unclear how feasible this would be.

### Idea 3: Understanding the physical paper process
This study would build upon extant research to understand and document the physical methods of submission - kiosk and mail - what that process is like.

### Idea 4: How money hits the bank
This study would dive into how the funds are transferred into the Vet account, that process and pain points.

### Idea 5: Status updates on VA.gov 
Having to "double log in" to BTSSS in order to see the status of a claim is a known pain point.  If we were to give Vets visibility into this status on VA.gov, where would it live? Where would Vets look for this info? What is the user mental model? **This has been prioritized and will commence in January 2024**, pending research findings from the Check-in team.

### Idea 6: VA Staff / Travel Clerk discovery
