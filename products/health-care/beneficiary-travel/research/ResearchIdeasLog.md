# Ideas for Future Research Ideas 'Brainstorm' Log 

This is a running list of ideas for research related to Travel Pay.  Ideas on this list have **not** been evaluated, planned or prioritized.  If it's on this list, that does not automatically mean a study will happen.  All ideas will have to go through an evaluation and prioritization process.  Those items can be found at TBD.  Questions?

### Idea 1: 'Listening tour' painful parts 
A study or 'listening tour' whereby we would observe veterans using the current online experience and document what part of the process they stumbled upon.  This would help us learn where the most painful parts of the process are. Analytics and other feedback mechanisms would be helpful here. 

### Idea 2: Status language 
This would build on prior research to dig into the different user facing language and labels around statuses at different points in the process.  We could test different language and/or gauge comprehension of current language.

### Idea 3: Understanding the physical paper process
This study would build upon extant research to understand and document the physical methods of submission - kiosk and mail - what that process is like.
