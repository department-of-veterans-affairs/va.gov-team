## **Research Goals**


### **Outcome**

The desired outcome of this study is a generative, first version set of recommended changes to Veteran-facing Travel Claim statuses. This will include recommendations of alternative language sourced from users that could be used to supplement the current status system used by BTSSS. This supplemental language will help bridge the gap between the status language that aligns with users’ mental models and the language required for VA systems.


### **Research questions**

* What do users see as the purpose of a Claim status?
* How strongly does the status ‘label’ align with the status definition to the users’ mental model?
    * What would users label each definition?
        * How closely does the term users’ use to label a definition match the official status label?
        * What words or terms resonate with users?
    * What would users define each label as meaning?
        * What words or terms resonate with users?
* What currently used Travel Claims statuses do users conflate with each other or see as duplicative?
* What statuses would users add to or subtract from the currently used Travel Claim statuses?
    * What statuses do users see as unnecessary?
    * What statuses do they see as missing?


## **Methodology**

60 minute user interviews with 16 Veterans.  In addition to open ended questions, participants completed 2 exercises.  In Exercise #1, they labeled status definitions.  In Exercise #2, they completed an open card sort.


## **Key Insights**



1. Insight #1: Participants’ mental model divided the imagined claim processing process into pre- and post- decision with an emphasis on when they did or did not need to take action to unblock or recover a claim.
2. Insight #2: Participants did not clearly understand how individual claim statuses connected with each other in the larger process; they wanted to be proactively made aware of critical phases of claim processing, when they needed to do something to avoid a denied a claim and learn why a claim was denied. 


## **Details of Findings**


### Insight #1: Participants’ mental model divided the imagined claim processing process into pre- and post- decision with an emphasis on when they did or did not need to take action to unblock or recover a claim.

**Finding 1**: Participants expect a travel claim to go through an evaluation process and expect that “claim status” tells them where the claim is in that process

_“...goes to…some division within the VA that processes the travel claims validates them, makes sure that there's a appointment associated with the claim and that the appointment was confirmed and the patient showed up and that sort of thing.” - P24_


**Finding 2:** Participants’ imagined the claim evaluation process as starting clearly and ending clearly, but with a murky middle that they did not understand; dividing the process into pre- and post- decision

**Finding 3:** The pre- and post- decision division can be further broken down into 5 groups oriented around the internal VA process and the moments that require action

Dendrogram based on open card sort

**Finding 4**: Participants expect a travel claim to go through an evaluation process and expect that “claim status” tells them where the claim is in that process

**Finding 5**: Participants collapsed “Claim Submitted” and “In Process” as both a confirmation of a submitted claim; the first clear,  ephemeral step in the broader claim review process

<img width="345" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 5 32 19 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b3e00eb-b318-453d-bb17-2aad00a965a6">

_Participants Described This Group As…:_

_“The veteran submitted all the required information, they have **nothing left to do.” -P18_

_“You submitted a claim through the online process” - P3_

_“[I would describe this group as]... just confirmation that you've submitted your claim.” - P14_

**Finding 6:** “Roadblocks that Require Action” claim statuses comprise the heart of the murky middle of the claim review process; “Loose Ends” are a subset of claim statuses that bounce between the pre-decision review and post-decision phases.  

* Participants connected “Roadblocks that Require Action” statuses as instances when further action would need to be taken to advance a claim, most often by the Veteran but also potentially by the VA
* Recommend collapsing “On Hold” and “Incomplete” together; removing or consolidating “In Manual Review” 
* Unsure of what to do with “Loose Ends” statuses; participants vacillated between grouping these statuses with the pre-decision review phase or the post-decision phase

**Finding 7**: Although most participants grouped the “Claim Denied” statuses together, they distinguished the statuses based on the reason for the denial, especially being denied due to error versus being ineligible

_How participants discussed ‘Denied’ statuses…_

_“I'm traveling to these appointments and they're in the system either through the VA or community care from a consult…**somebody's not communicating within the system for the information to be processed for me to be able to receive travel pay. And I don't know…if I filled out all the relevant... I don't understand, how is it that they cannot verify the services in my my claim.” - P6_

_“...clarify why … it's not rejected because of a missing information, it's not eligible to be reimbursed.” - P24  on Card 17_

**Finding 8:** Participants saw “Claim Paid” as the successful group; they did not distinguish between internal VA process phases but did distinguish between payment “en route” and payment complete 

_How participants discussed these statuses…_

_“ …anything that's been approved and is waiting…on the next step…or paid” - P20_

_“All of these point to the money's coming my way.” - P1_

_“It's the successful group. You got your payment. Somehow you managed to get your money.” - P4_

### Insight #2: Participants did not clearly understand how individual claim statuses connected with each other in the larger process but wanted to be proactively made aware of critical phases of claim processing, when they needed to do something to avoid a denied claim and learn why a claim was denied. 

**Finding 9:** Participants struggled to connect the different claim statuses because they felt they did not well understand the process as a whole; Recommend managing participants expectations of the claim review process so that they can situate their claim within the broader process 


_How participants discussed this…_

_“You submit it's pending, approved or denied…maybe add days in  …[not] specific days, you know, three to five days or something like that.” - P1_

_“ …where I'm at** in the process, how long it may take the process …the steps it takes like a FAQ questionnaire and what documents I need… “ -P11_

_“[I want to know] a timeline, even if it's best or worst case scenario, ETA, you know, military is big on acronyms, so ‘need to know’...” - P5_

_“I wanna know what are the **next steps **and I wanna **know when I will know **the claim has been either denied or approved.” - P1_

**Finding 10:** Participants wanted more prominent notifications of both key moments in the claim process and when a claim is blocked and they need to do something (e.g., provide additional information) to unblock it 

_How participants discussed this…_

_“...it's totally on me to have to keep going back every day to check to see if it's pending and to hope that I happen to see before day 29 that they're missing information because nothing dings me. I get no email saying, ‘Hey, your travel claim is missing information.” Or ‘Hey, you need to review this.’ I get no notification. So a notification like that card supposedly says happens - it doesn't happen” - P4_

_“I would want notifications for major milestones for any major action - under review, approved, denied.” - P1_

_“[I care most about] appealed, denied and submitted ….so cards 4 [Appealed], 1 [Claim Submitted], and 9 [Partial Payment] and 15 [Denied] and maybe card 10 [Submitted for Payment] too… those are about submitted, appealed, approved and a couple in the denied section.” - P20_

_“[I would set an alert for] particularly the ones that would require me to submit more information because how else would I know that I needed to do that? - P24_

**Finding 11:** When a claim is denied, participants want to be given a way to learn why the claim was being denied 

**Finding 12:** Moments in the claim process participants wanted to be proactively made aware of included both updates and moments that require action

## Recommendations

1. Consider alternative language that emphasizes when a submitter needs to take action or provide additional information.
   
2. Manage users expectations of the claim review process from the start, giving them a way to conceptualize  what to expect from the process overall with information such as timeframes and steps in the process.
    1. Give users a way to place their claim within that larger process.
       
3. Give users the option to proactively keep themselves up to date with key and critical moments in the process with capabilities like notifications and emails.
