## Research Goals

### Outcomes

Veterans want to know why a certain claim decision was reached.  When a travel claim is denied, a decision letter and appellate rights document is issued.  Currently, when a travel claim is denied, a Veteran is directed to the paper version of the 3 appeals processes available.  All of these forms or processes have digital versions or equivalents.  We hypothesize that we can provide value to the Veteran by 1) providing them information about the outcome of their claim decision on VA.gov, 2) providing Veterans with an unofficial digital copy of their claim decision letter on VA.gov and 3) easily connecting them to the supported digital appeals process from denied claims.  The designs tested in this study provide these connections on a Claim Details page related to an individual claim.  This study tests key facets of user flow for appealing a denied travel claim on VA.gov.   


### Research Questions


1. Can users find the Status page?
2. Can users find the Claim Details page?
   1. Do users expect that a Claim Details page will tell them what has happened to their claim and why?
4. Once on the Claim Details page, what information do users find most valuable? Least valuable?
5. Based on the information on the Claim Details page, do users understand what they can take action or when they need to do something to unblock or advance processing or payment of a claim?
    2. Do users find their decision letter on a Claim Details page?
    3. What information do users expect to find when they see the words “decision letter”?
6. Can users identify if they need to take action to unblock or advance processing or payment of a claim and if so what that action is and how to take it?
    4. If a claim is denied or partially approved, do they understand that they can appeal and how to appeal?

## **Methodology**

Over a 60 minute interview, 10 Veterans completed 4 tasks using a prototype.  The task order alternated.  

**Approved claim task:** Imagine that on May 1 you went to see your PCP at the Cheyenne VA. After that visit, you submitted a claim request to be reimbursed for the cost of the gas and tolls you incurred going to that visit. Now, you want to find out what has happened to that claim. From here, show me where you would look for that information. 

**Denied claim task:** Now, imagine that you submitted a claim to be reimbursed for traveling for a visit on April 25, but you have not received payment. You want to follow up on that claim. From here, show me where you would look for that information.  

**Partial Pay task:** Now, imagine that several months ago you submitted another claim to be reimbursed for traveling for a visit. You expected to be reimbursed around around $50 for this trip. However, when you checked your account, you noticed that you were only paid around $20. Now you want to learn more about why you did not receive that around $30 gap. From here, show me where you would look for this information. 

**Fiscal Rescinded task:** You submitted a claim to be reimbursed for traveling for a visit on April 2 but have not heard anything. You want to follow up on that claim. From here, show me where you would look for that information. 


## **Key Insights**


**Finding #1:** Participants easily found the Claim Details page off of the Claim Status page
  
  - Participants struggled most to find the Partial Pay decision claim
  - Some participants were unsure if “Submitted for payment” meant that a decision had been reached on their claim

**Finding #2:** Overall, participants were able to accurately understand what had happened to their claim
  
  - Participants looked to the Claim Status and Status description to understand what has happened, but several participants overlooked it
  - In case of a denied claim, participants accurately identified the decision letter as where to locate their next step

**Finding #3:** Participants accurately identified the appropriate next steps and how to initiate an appeal for a denied claim, but some struggled with the best way to move forward 

**Finding #4:** On the Claim Details page, participants placed greater value on information directly related to what they should expect next
  
  - Not all participants noticed the deductible gap on their own, but once they noticed it, all participants wanted to understand why


## **Details of Findings**


**Finding 1**: All participants struggled to identify partial payment decisions on the Status page

**Finding 2:** Participants prioritized claim amount, status, the decision letter and appeal options

**Finding 3:** Regardless of decision, amount was most important

Recommend explaining the gap between the submitted for and reimbursed amount on page.  Most participants noticed the gap between submitted for and reimbursed amounts.  Some knew the gap was the deductible, but most did not.  All wanted to know why there was a gap.

**Finding 4**: Claim Status section provides critical context
![Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 2 30 22 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89198b71-c8f2-4163-b1c5-9150c680b999)

**Finding 5**:Users identified the ‘rejection reasons’ section as the explanation of what the claim decision is  

Recommend displaying the Denial Reasons in the Decision letter on  Claim Details page, allowing users to see the “why” of their claim decision without having to download the full Decision letter.

**Finding 6**:The full decision letter is key to  users 

Recommend enabling users to download the decision letter regardless of platform.   On the Claim Decision letter, recommend moving the “Denial Reasons” section to the first page.

**Finding 7**:Participants understood when and how to appeal a denied claim, gravitating to the decision letter 

Recommend clarifying and restructuring appeal options on the Claim Details page to provide more guidance, similar to what is provided in the decision letter.

**Finding 8**:Participants deprioritized information that they did not see as critical to the future of the claim

## Recommendations

**1. Recommendation:** Expose the status description on the Claim Details page —> IN PROGRESS

**2. Recommendation:** On Denied and Partial Pay decision claims, show users the decision reasons (listed in the decision letter) on the Claim Details page, allowing    the user to bypass download  —> IN PROGRESS 

**3. Recommendation:** Explain the difference between submitted /reimbursed amounts (i.e. deductible) —> IN PROGRESS 

**4. Recommendation:** Clarify and restructure the Appeals option section of the Claim Details page so as to streamline the intended path —> IN PROGRESS

**5. Recommendation:** Consider reorganizing the hierarchy of the Claim Details page to emphasize the pieces of information most relevant to future action —> IN
   PROGRESS
   
**6. Recommendation:** Consider give users a way to distinguish between full payment decisions and partial payment decisions from the Claim Status page —>
   DEPRIORITIZED FOR NOW
   
**7. Recommendation:** Enable users to view and download their Decision Letter regardless of platform —> DEPRIORITIZED FOR NOW DUE TO TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
