# Research Plan: Travel Claim Management Usability Study


## Background

The goal of the Beneficiary Travel Pay team is to empower users to do more with their travel reimbursement claims on VA.gov. The Claim Details v2 design builds upon prior research to support users in accomplishing two well established needs: to learn the details (the why) of a claim decision and to contest, follow up or appeal a claim decision that they disagree with.

### OCTO Priorities

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.



* Key Result 1: CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.


### Veteran Journey 



1. Starting up
2. Taking care of myself
3. Putting down roots
4. Retiring


## Research Goals


### Outcomes

Veterans want to know why a certain claim decision was reached.  When a travel claim is denied, a decision letter and appellate rights document is issued.  Currently, when a travel claim is denied, a Veteran is directed to the paper version of the 3 appeals processes available.  All of these forms or processes have digital versions or equivalents.  We hypothesize that we can provide value to the Veteran by 1) providing them information about the outcome of their claim decision on VA.gov, 2) providing Veterans with an unofficial digital copy of their claim decision letter on VA.gov and 3) easily connecting them to the supported digital appeals process from denied claims.  The designs tested in this study provide these connections on a Claim Details page related to an individual claim.  This study tests key facets of user flow for appealing a denied travel claim on VA.gov.   


### Research Questions



1. Can users find the Status page?
2. Can users find the Claim Details page?
   1. Do users expect that a Claim Details page will tell them what has happened to their claim and why?
4. Once on the Claim Details page, what information do users find most valuable? Least valuable?
5. Based on the information on the Claim Details page, do users understand what they can take action or when they need to do something to unblock or advance processing or payment of a claim?
    2. Do users find their decision letter on a Claim Details page?
    3. What information do users expect to find when they see the words “decision letter”?
6. Can users identify if they need to take action to unblock or advance processing or payment of a claim and if so what that action is and how to take it?
    4. If a claim is denied or partially approved, do they understand that they can appeal and how to appeal?


## Methodology
