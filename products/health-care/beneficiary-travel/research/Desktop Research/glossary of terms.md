## Terms   

### A

**Alternate Mileage**  
A situation where the reimbursable distance is calculated based on a route other than the standard or direct route between the point of origin and the destination. This may occur if:

- The traveler takes a different route due to road closures, construction, or personal reasons.
- The agency or organization has pre-approved an alternate route for specific circumstances.
- There are policy guidelines that allow for the calculation of mileage based on the most cost-effective or reasonable route, rather than the shortest or most direct one.
The beneficiary must provide documenation in order for the route to be approved.   


**Appeal**  
A formal request for review of a denied or reduced travel claim, resulting in a decision to uphold the original denial, modify the reimbursement, or approve the claim.

**Appointment**  
A scheduled meeting, visit, or session that qualifies a traveler for reimbursement of travel expenses. Most commonly, this means a pre-arranged medical, official, or business appointment—such as a doctor’s visit at a VA facility or a required meeting at a government office—for which the organization provides travel pay.  

**Appointment Date**  
The scheduled date for a medical or official appointment, often used for sorting or searching travel pay claims.
