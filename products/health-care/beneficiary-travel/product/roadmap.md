## Definations

- **Simple Claim** : A round trip claim for a single appointment that a Veteran used their own vehicle to travel to and from. 

## MVP

- Claims API that can accept a simple claim
- Integrated expereince to submit with inside the Check In app
- Able to know the analytics around
 - How many claims are being submitted via the API
 - How many of those claims went into manual review vs auto approved

## MVP+1

> disclaimer: depending on feedback and research results

- Text Veteran a link to submit a claim post appoitment
- Submit claim after appointment
- Determine how we can handle eligbility and enrollment status to refine work flow
- Submit more complex claim that can help the major of Veterans that do not do the simple cliam
- Check claim status from the API for a Veteran based on ICN / Appt ID
