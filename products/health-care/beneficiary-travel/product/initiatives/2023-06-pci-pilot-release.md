# Travel Pay + PCI Release plan 

## Theory we are testing

As a Veteran seeking care at a VA facility, I can submit a simple Beneficiary Travel claim (mileage only, no other receipts, traveled by personal vehicle from home address, 1 appointment) during the digital check in process. 

## Prep work 

- [x] feature toggle and facility restriction is in place
- [x] Analytics are in place 
- [x] Colab Cycle has passed 
- [x] Coordination with Facility is complete
- [x] Getting Travel Office on board
- [x] Go/no-go decision made on 6/15/2023

## Production rollout

**How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it**

We have a feature toggle and the ability to restrict to Veterans only at a facility


### Define the Rollback process

We will roll back if 

#### 1) Error rates are high

**Condition**: If there are >5% (adjustable) error rate of submission, then we will disable the feature via feature toggle 

**Where are the numbers located**: [Datadog_link]

**Who is watching** Mark Dewey + PCI team 

**path to reenable** Dev team will Address the Error and deploy a solution


#### 2) Travel office gets overloaded with manual claims

**Condition**: IF the number of claims in the manual process overwhelms the travel office

**Where are the numbers located**: See KPI 3 & 4

**Who is watching** Mark Dewey + Travel Pay Office

**path to reenable** Mark Dewey will work with the various teams to lead a retro to identity the issues and create a solution. 


### Questions to answer after each Phase

- Is this providing value to the Veteran?
- What is the Veterans response to this? (VSignals, on premise feedback)? 
- What is the Clinicians response to this? (VSignals, on premise feedback)? 
- How is this affecting the Travel office workflow?
- What minor tweaks can be made before rolling this out to more Veterans?
- What new metrics arise that we care about? 


#### Phase 0: First Facility  - Wilkes Barre

**Desired date range** 

06/26/2023 - 07/31/20212

**What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?:**

> PCI check numbers are not negatively affected

**GOAL --** âœ… No significant drop in usage, we saw usage **slight** increase

> Veterans successfully send claims during check ins

**GOAL --** âœ… Total of ~210 claims created during the pilot, ~2% of all travel claims created at WB
![total pilot claims](./assets/grand%20btsss%20total.png)


> Increase usage of BTSSS system claims from X to Y

**GOAL --** ðŸ”µ June had ~5800, July had ~7300. This increase is good, but probably not because of the pilot
**GOAL**: âœ… 92% of claims created were approved 

> Back office for Travel pay is not flooded with claims

- **GOAL --** âž• There were fewer paper claims, âž– but every claim was sent into manual review  

> Claims are paid faster 

**GOAL --** âœ… from June (14.4 days), claims were paid in ~12 days


**To move to the next phase** 

- âœ… All metrics are happy enough
- Buy in from 
  - âœ… OCTO 
  - Travel Office
  - âœ… Veteran
