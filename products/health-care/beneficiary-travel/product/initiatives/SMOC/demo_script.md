## Intro:
- Explainer of what Simple, Mileage-Only Claims on VA.gov can do (enable users to file claims for reimbursement when they are traveling to and from their VA appointments if they traveled in their own car and are only claiming mileage from their home)
- Other claims can go to BTSSS

## Entry points
- Key unauthenticated entry points
- Key authenticated entry points (on the last one, pick an appointment from the appointments list and go through the successful flow)

## SMOC Flow
