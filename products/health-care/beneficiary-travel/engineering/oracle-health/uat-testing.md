# Oracle Health + Travel Roll out

Answering questions for the UAT of OH + Travel Pay rollout

## Goal

We are looking to test the integration of Vetext + Oracle Health Travel Pay + BTSSS. The goal is to test the integration

## Questions

- What environment are testing? Staging or Production
- If production, Do we have production test accounts for OH sites? If no, what is the is plan? 
- If staging, can we use Judy? 
- How can we control testing to just a few users? How as Vetext done this with other OH roll outs?
