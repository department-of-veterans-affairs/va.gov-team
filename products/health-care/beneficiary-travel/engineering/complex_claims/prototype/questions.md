- [ ] Can we use the CRM as the source of truth, i.e. avoid storing partial claims in the vets-api db?
- [ ] Portal has a limit of 5 uploads, is this a hard limit? Travel could conceivably have more receipts.
- [ ] What strategy should we use to improve performance when switching views from adding expense, viewing claim, attaching files, etc.
- [ ] In the CRM, uploaded files are attached directly to claims. Can we make that structure work for us and still give the Veteran a good user experience?
- [ ] How early can we load the appointment?
