# Beneficiary Travel Self-Service System (BTSSS) on VA.gov Product Outline
---

## Overview

VA aims to improve the tooling and accessibility of the beneficiary travel system and experience. As part of our mission to improve Veteran access to care, the existing claim submission systems needs to be integrated more intentionally with VA.gov and VA Health and Benefits mobile application in order to make it easier for Veterans to find and use this benefit.

## Problem Statement

The existing BTSSS system is siloed from other systems and the current VA.gov Veteran experience. Veterans are not able to easily discover, access, authenticate into and complete travel claims using BTSSS due to a complex user experience that was not built using human centered design principles.

Staff travel clerks often have to take manual steps to fix, validate, and process claims that were entered erroneously or on paper.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Able to interact with travel reimbursement functionality directly on VA.gov and VAHB mobile app
- Able to interact with travel reimbursement functionality where it is needed by leveraging an API-first approach
- Enjoy a simple, intuitive experience that meets all VA.gov accessibility, design standards, and performance standards
- Positive feedback through Medallia
 
## Undesired User Outcomes

- Increased usage of the existing Veteran-facing BTSSS portal
- Frustration preventing submission of claims

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Increase digital travel reimbursement claim submissions
- Increase travel claim submission accuracy
- Decrease the number of manually reviewed claims

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Re-writing the BTSSS backend, business rules, or processing pipelines
- Creating additional work for travel reimbursement staff

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
