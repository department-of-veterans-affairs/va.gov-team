## Decisions/Processes?????
- UX scrum team or not? NOT
  - We will NOT have a formal UX scrum team
  - We WILL have a "shared services" team made up of all UXers
    - UX "shared services" group WILL meet once a week to sync on ALL in-progress prioritiees & process
    - UX "shared services" group WILL handle & review their own design processes with the intent of making delivery of final wireframes more efficient
- Teams, each team
  - WILL do 2-week sprints
  - WILL follow Scrum
  - WILL estiblish sprint goals, refinements, daily standups that every member attends, and sprint reviews
  - WILL maintain one workspace for their team's tickets
  - Brenda WILL be the scrum master for the Appts team
    - Anita will work with Brenda
- UX/DM/PM bi-weekly meeting purpose/intent
  - Updating the UAE roadmap
  - Resource planning
  - Status of features/initiatives
- **We did not get to this one** GitHub board management for cross-team designs/implementations
  - Only 2 Github workspaces? (CIE + APPT)
  - Use Github workflows?
  - Labeling cross-team features so both teams have visibility

## Action Items
