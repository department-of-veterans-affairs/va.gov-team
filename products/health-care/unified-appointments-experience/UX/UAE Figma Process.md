# UAE Figma Process [WIP]

The teams under UAE manage web and mobile UX for multiple tools related to appointments. This document is an overview of how teams work together in Figma across those tools. 

**A note on VAHB:** The UAE Figma process for VAHB is still a work in progress. Links to known resources are in the last section, but these haven't been folded into the process for web yet.

## Libraries

UAE tools are built on the [VA Design System](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/105082786). 

For components, patterns, and templates that are not in VADS, UAE uses the [MHV Shared Libraries](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/493247030)*.

*UAE is currently migrating the [UAE library](https://www.figma.com/design/ktX3at2KixnYf2G6MoBSuC/MHV---Unified-Appointments-Library?node-id=2193-5199) to the MHV cross-portal libraries.

UAE's goal is to keep its libraries small and manageable, and push custom components/patterns/etc. to VADS whenever possible.


## Production Documentation

UAE builds out screens and workflows in various files in the [UAE project space](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/175332858). Teams use these to understand the current state of these tools. The Figma documentation across all teams lives in the [MHV - Unified Appointments project](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/175332858).

While we aim to keep this documentation up-to-date, your best bet for a closer to perfect source of truth is staging.va.gov.

## Working files

UAE manages working files for work in progress. Each team has a file with pages for small changes. Some projects are large enough that they live in their own file. All work that has been released to users should be documented in the production documentation (see previous section).

## VAHB app resources

These aren't to be used as any kind of a source of truth. They are noted here for awareness. In the future the UAE teams plan to integrate these into our processes
