# UAE Figma Process [WIP]

## Libraries

UAE tools are built on the [VA Design System](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/105082786). 

For components, patterns, and templates that are not in VADS, UAE uses the [MHV Shared Libraries](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/493247030)*.

*UAE is currently migrating the [UAE library](https://www.figma.com/design/ktX3at2KixnYf2G6MoBSuC/MHV---Unified-Appointments-Library?node-id=2193-5199) to the MHV cross-portal libraries.

UAE's goal is to keep its libraries small and manageable, and push custom components/patterns/etc. to VADS whenever possible.


## Production Documentation

UAE builds out screens and workflows in various files in the [UAE project space](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/175332858). Teams use these to understand the current state of these tools. The Figma documentation across all teams lives in the [MHV - Unified Appointments project](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/175332858).

## Working files

UAE manages working files for work in progress. Each team has a file with pages for small changes. Some projects are large enough that they live in their own file. All work that has been released to users should be documented in the production documentation (see previous section).
