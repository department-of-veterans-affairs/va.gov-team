# UAE Figma Process [WIP]

The teams under UAE manage web and mobile UX for multiple tools related to appointments. This document is an overview of how teams work together in Figma across those tools. 

**A note on VAHB:** The UAE Figma process for VAHB is still a work in progress. Links to known resources are in the last section, but these haven't been folded into the process for web yet.

## Project space

The Figma documentation across all UAE teams lives in the [MHV - Unified Appointments project](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/175332858).

## Libraries

UAE tools are built on the [VA Design System](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/105082786). 

For shared components, patterns, and templates that are not in VADS, UAE uses the [MHV Shared Libraries](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/493247030).[^1] 

UAE's goal is to keep its libraries small and manageable, and push custom components/patterns/etc. to VADS whenever possible.

## Production Documentation

UAE UX documents all features that have been released to Production across all tools. While we aim to keep this documentation up-to-date, staging.va.gov is the closest thing we have to a source of truth.

## Working files

UAE manages working files for work in progress. Each team has a file where they work on smaller changes. Larger projects have their own files in the [MHV - Unified Appointments project](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/175332858).

## VAHB app resources

These aren't to be used as any kind of a source of truth. They are noted here for awareness. In the future the UAE teams plan to integrate VAHB into our processes.
