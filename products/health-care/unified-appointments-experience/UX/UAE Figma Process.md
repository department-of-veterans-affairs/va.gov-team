# UAE Figma Process WIP


## Libraries

UAE tools are built on the [VA Design System](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/105082786). 

For components, patterns, and templates that are not in VADS, UAE uses the [MHV Shared Libraries](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/493247030)*.

*UAE is currently migrating the [UAE library](https://www.figma.com/design/ktX3at2KixnYf2G6MoBSuC/MHV---Unified-Appointments-Library?node-id=2193-5199) to the MHV libraries.

UAE's goal is to keep its libraries small and manageable, and push custom components to VADS whenever possible.


## Production Documentation

UAE builds out screens and workflows in various files in the [UAE project space](https://www.figma.com/files/1499394822283304153/project/175332858). Teams use these to understand the current state of these tools.
