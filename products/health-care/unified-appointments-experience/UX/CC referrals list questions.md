# Expanding community care and VA referrals list to display all referrals

## Context
We already display referrals at the entire integrated site that is part of the community care direct scheduling pilot, so Veterans are seeing referrals that they can't schedule online already. We made adjustments to account for these referrals that can't be scheduled online; however, we could make further improvements. We hypothesize that many of these improvements could apply to all community care and VA referrals/consults. 

We want to do some brief discovery on what a possible future could look like displaying all community care (CC) and VA referrals to the referrals and requests page. We want to start with just understanding more about the referral process, such as referral statuses, the Veteran experience, and staff processes. 

## Questions for IVC

- Our understanding is that community care referrals that we show in the UI down the line won't have online scheduling (at least in the near-term). In these cases, should we tell users that their provider will reach out to them to schedule, or can we offer users a phone number to call to schedule? (Would that complicate anything on the staffing side?) 
  - If Veterans must wait to be contacted, what actions can they take in the meantime (if any)?
  - _Note:_ Currently, in the pilot, if there's an error or issue with scheduling, we tell users to call their provider to schedule the appointment. 

- When and why would a referral would be removed from the user interface? These are the scenarios we're aware of:
  - A: The referral was for 1 appointment and that appointment has been scheduled.
  - B: The referral was for a series of appointments and the first appointment has been scheduled. (You may have more appointments to schedule, but the referral goes away in the UI after the first is scheduled. We're hoping to change this down the line.)
  - C: The referral expired (regardless of if the appointment was scheduled or not).
- Questions about that:
  - Are there other cases we're missing? (E.g. Are referrals ever _withdrawn_?)
  - Are there referrals for appointments outside of community care? If so, do these rules differ for other VA referrals? 

- Can you share more about the timelines related to scheduling referrals? How quickly does VA need to respond to reach out or respond to referrals?

- Could you describe the notification processes (email/text/snail mail) associated with referrals?

- What’s the lifecycle of a CC referral?
  - Can you share all the workflow diagrams that you have on the lifecycle, showing the stages and statuses a referral goes through? We know that we have seen the request workflows before, but want to make sure we have the latest documents. 
  - Are there any documents listing out the different statuses in HSRM or EPS that we can see?
