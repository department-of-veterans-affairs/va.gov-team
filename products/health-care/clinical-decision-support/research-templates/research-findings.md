## Research Goals
*Provide context for this research by explaining how it fits into the Clinician Journey or CDS Console.*  


**Guiding Questions:**  
- What are the key moments this tool supports in the Clinician’s journey?  
- What outcomes are we aiming to achieve for clinicians, VA staff, and stakeholders?  

[Example Research Goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-goals) 

## Research Questions

*List the research questions that guided this study.*  

* Question 1
* Question 2
* Question 3

## Methodology 

*Provide a brief description of the research methods used (e.g., usability testing, interviews).*  

- Method 1: Description  
- Method 2: Description  

[Example Methodology](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#methodology)


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

*List hypotheses explored in the research and the conclusions drawn. If applicable, list the success or task completion rate.*

> [!TIP]
> Place true or false statements in bold for easier scanability

- **Hypothesis Statement:** [Insert statement]  
  - **"Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”**  
  - Supporting evidence  

[Example Hypotheses and Conclusions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)


## Key Findings

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

> [!TIP] 
> Write findings as stand-alone insights that are easy to scan. For example:  
> - "Most participants used the search field to locate forms, often searching for 'veteran health.'"  
> - "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form."
