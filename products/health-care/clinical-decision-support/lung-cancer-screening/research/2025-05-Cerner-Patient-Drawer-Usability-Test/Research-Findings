## Research Goals
*Assess the degree to which the new Patient Drawer meets users needs, is efficient and intuitive.*  

## Research Questions
* `How well does the new patient drawer design experience fit with user needs?



## Methodology 
- Method 1: Usability Testing of staging data on Cerner LCSPv2 

## Key Findings

1. "Information to include Patient drawer; Latest completed exam date and Latest Lung-RADs, Upcoming order status and future appointment information."
2. "A number of users felt like the sections in the drawer merged into one another making it challenging for them to situate themselves in the flow of the drawer." 
3. "Most users preferred needing to close a patient drawer before navigating to the next."
  

## Details of Findings 

### Finding 1
"Information to include Patient drawer; Latest completed exam date and Latest Lung-RADs, Upcoming order status and future appointment information."
  - _Supporting data: "I don't see that they have a future order in the drawer and to see that I have to go out of the drawer to see if they have a future order." _

### Finding 2
"A number of users felt like the sections in the drawer merged into one another making it challenging for them to situate themselves in the flow of the drawer." 
  - _Supporting data:"They kind of seem to meld together a little bit to me like there's no good way to differentiate between them like." _

### Finding 3
"Most users preferred needing to close a patient drawer before navigating to the next."  
- _Supporting data:"you have to close one to go to the next. I wouldn't want two drawers open ... because you could document on the wrong patient." _

## Recommendations

1. **Recommendation: Enhance UX interaction and UI heirarchy within the drawer structure."**   
   - _Supporting evidence:A number of users felt like the sections in the drawer merged into one another making it challenging for them to situate themselves in the flow of the drawer._

2. **Recommendation:Include coordinator priority information in the Patient drawer.**   
   - _Supporting evidence: Information to include Patient drawer; Latest completed exam date and Latest Lung-RADs, Upcoming order status and future appointment information._
  
## Product User and Business Outcomes

This research will help determine feature development in line with observing patients in a grouped way, allowing prioritization for patient care with an interoperable tool that works with legacy (Cerner/VistA Lung Cancer Screening Platform version 1) sites and Oracle Health sites

### Desired User Outcome 
This research supports our desired user outcome by documenting the expectations and feature ideas of the LCS coordinators. 
 
### Desired Business Outcome
This research supports our desired business outcome by creating an understanding of core features to support the LCS workflow across the VHA EHRs.


## Next Steps
Refine Patient Drawer
