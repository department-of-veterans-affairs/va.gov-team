# Conversation Guide for LCS Cerner Patient Drawer Usability Test

## Moderator logistics 📋✅
### 2-3 days before the session

`List and complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study below:`

- [x] Email participants 1:1 via VA email or Message participants via Teams chat 
- [x] Create Teams link for interviews 
- [x] Invite team members to observe sessions as available 


### Notetaker and Silent Obeserver Guide
- Be a silent observer. If you have a question for the participant, ask the facilitator via a Slack DM and they'll accommodate it if appropriate.
- If you can notetake, please do! It helps researchers a lot to see what you captured. There’s a note taking template in this Mural with screenshots. If you find it easier to write your notes or use a word doc, that's fine too! If you take running notes, please be sure to make a clear reference to the screen in question or the scenario being mentioned.
- Write what you hear and see as much as possible. For some it can be easier to write in first person, as it is said, so that you don't need to paraphrase anything. Try to capture what they said without adding your own interpretation of what they meant. E.g. "I'm not sure about this checkbox" does not equal "Doesn't understand checkbox."
- Share your notes back with the facilitator via Slack if taken outside of the mural. Do not include ANY PII in this chat.
- For design testing, try to write down things that aren't said—for instance, when someone misunderstood some copy or clicked the wrong element. It helps us figure out what needs to be revisited.
- Share a few raw impressions with the facilitator via Slack or in the notetaking document after the interview is done, if possible. It helps with synthesis!

**Protecting PII**
- It's important to protect the privacy of our VHA staff participants AND any Veterans. 
- Do not include the participants name or other identifiers -- such as a very specific title that can be easy to identify them with in your notes. Instead, use a general role description, such as "primary care provider" and "also works in informatics"
- In the event a participant needs to share their screen or a tool with an actual patient (since test patients don't always work to show how the tool functions), stop the recording before they share. DO NOT RECORD THE PARTICIPANT'S SCREEN IF THEY ARE SHOWING A REAL PATIENT.


### Starting the session

#### Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us today. My name is Ayangbe and these are my colleagues ____ and ____. We are part of the Lung Cancer Screening Platform team and are looking to improve the current LCS v2 experience to ensure it is as efficient and user centered as possible. Today our session will be focused on the Patient drawer redesign. Before we begin, I’d like to establish a few ground rules for our conversation: 

●	Our conversation should take about an hour. Is that still okay for you? I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. You will be interacting with a prototype today so the functions and features will be limited and may not function exactly as you expect. 
●	Think aloud: This may not come naturally to you but we ask that as you react to what is shown to you today--that you say out loud what you’re thinking. Where and why you’re clicking on things, what you don’t like or like. 
●	There are no right or wrong answers. I won’t be offended by any feedback, so please be honest. We are testing the product, not you or your capabilities. Not all things shared may be implemented but we value your feedback and it will help us improve our product. 
●	I may not answer your questions immediately as we want to see how you interact with the tool and are interested in what you think. If I can answer your questions, I will do so at the end. 
●	Everything you share is confidential and any quotes we share will be anonymized and not personally attributed to you. You also have the right to revoke permission to use your quotes at any time, even after our session today. 
●	We can pause or stop the session at any point in the process. 

Do you have any questions so far? 
If it’s ok with you, we would like to record this conversation? This is so we don’t miss anything in our notes. The recording will only be used by members of our team and as mentioned before any information shared outside our immediate team will be anonymized in the form of unattributed quotes. 
Please let me know if you consent to recording our session? 

### Task Scenarios Warmup ands set up (2 min)
How are you doing today? 
Has your LCS process changed in any way since our last 1:1 session? 
Today, you will be interacting with the LCSP v2 staging environment, this is our test enviroment and everything you see is mock data so it might not be a 100% medically accurate, for eg, the order titles might not match what you see in Cerner. As you’re working through the tasks, we ask that you please think aloud so we can understand how you’re processing things. This includes reading aloud, sharing what you’re looking for, and asking questions.
