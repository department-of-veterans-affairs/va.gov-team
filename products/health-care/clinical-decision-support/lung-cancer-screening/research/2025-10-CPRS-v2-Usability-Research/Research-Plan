# Research Plan for [LCS, v2, Oct 2025]

## Background 🏗️
`What problem is your product or feature trying to solve?`

**LCSPv2 is currently used by Coordinators on the Cerner EHR, as a Lung Cancer Screening Registry and a tool for managing their tracking related tasks. In working towards being an EHR agnostic tool LCSPv2 now aims to test its tracking capabilities with Coordinators in CPRS, to ensure the tool is meeting the unique needs of coordinators operating in either EHRs.**

`Where is your product situated within the clinicians' or VA staff's toolset (ex: CDS Console > LCS )`

**CDS Console > LCS**
  
`What is clinicians' familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**This is an iteration of LCSPv2**

### OCTO-DSD Priorities 

<details><summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed. </summary>

`Objective 1:  VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Assess the degree to which LCSPv2 meets users tracking needs, is efficient and intuitive**

### Outcome
***Determine opportunities for future iterations and improvements to LCSPv2**

### Research questions

**`1.`Identify opportunities for future iterations and improvements to LCSPv2**
**`2.`Identify any gaps in current LCSPv2 Tracking experience for users on CPRS**

## Methodology  🛠️
Usability testing with live prototype with fake patient data with LCS cooridnator use cases.


### Location
Currently, all clinical research for CDSC takes place remotely over MS Teams. We do not have processes in place to conduct in-person research with clinicians and VA staff. We will update this guide as things change.

- [x] **Remote**

## Recruitment 🎯	

### Recruitment approach
`Audience:` CPRS LCS Coordinators 

**`5.`Product SME shared contacts** 

### Recruitment criteria

- Primary user type - LCS Coordinators currently on CPRS EHR
Other Criteria
- Diversity in VISNs and locations
- Established vs newly launched LCS programs 
- Varying clinical models - Hybrid and Consult model of LCS 
- Coordinators with varying levels of LCS experience - ranging from Less than 1 year up to 5 years + 
- Part time and full time LCS Coordinators
- Coordinators with low and high patient caseloads

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (clinicians, VHA administrative staff, coordinators, etc.) of participants for this study:
- `Clinicians - CPRS:` **7**
- `Total:` **7**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **7**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study. For example, is it important to capture both inpatient and outpatient care settings? Or are you looking for a certain specialty or role such as a nurse practitionaer or physician?* 

- `CPRS LCS Coordionator`
- `in VISN 10`

### Outreach Email Templates

Hello [Name], 
 
I am a member of the LCS Platform team working with the National Center for Lung Cancer Screening (NCLCS). We are working on a digital tool to assist coordinators in managing patients in their LCS workflow. This tool, LCSPv2, is currently in use as limited number of sites and is an alternative to the v1 PowerBI reports. 
Amber and Angela from NCLCS (cc’d) believe your insights would be valuable to helping understand additional LCS contexts as we roll this tool out to more locations. Would you be willing to have a 30 minute call to explore a prototype of a new LCS platform? This is an entirely voluntary request. After an initial call, you would have the opportunity to try the LCSPv2 tool and explore if it might be a useful support for your work.   
Here is a link with some potential meeting times. If none of these work, please let me know when might be better for you. Thank you for your time!  I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have.  

Best, 
[Name]

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: **[45 minutes to 1 hour]**
  
  
## Team Roles  🕵️👩‍💻👩‍🔬

> [!NOTE]
- `Moderator:` **Ben Peterson**	
- `Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):`  **Ben Peterson**			
- `Participant recruiting & screening:`	 **Ben Peterson**		
- `Project point of contact:`  **Ben Peterson**			
- `Note-takers:` **Saliha Ghaffhar, Sarah Shields ** 	
- `Observers: **Saliha Ghaffhar, Sarah Shields **

### Notetaker and Silent Obeserver Guide
- Be a silent observer. If you have a question for the participant, ask the facilitator via a Slack DM and they'll accommodate it if appropriate.
- If you can notetake, please do! It helps researchers a lot to see what you captured. There’s a note taking template in this Mural with screenshots. If you find it easier to write your notes or use a word doc, that's fine too! If you take running notes, please be sure to make a clear reference to the screen in question or the scenario being mentioned.
- Write what you hear and see as much as possible. For some it can be easier to write in first person, as it is said, so that you don't need to paraphrase anything. Try to capture what they said without adding your own interpretation of what they meant. E.g. "I'm not sure about this checkbox" does not equal "Doesn't understand checkbox."
- Share your notes back with the facilitator via Slack if taken outside of the mural. Do not include ANY PII in this chat.
- For design testing, try to write down things that aren't said—for instance, when someone misunderstood some copy or clicked the wrong element. It helps us figure out what needs to be revisited.
- Share a few raw impressions with the facilitator via Slack or in the notetaking document after the interview is done, if possible. It helps with synthesis!

**Protecting PII**
- It's important to protect the privacy of our VHA staff participants AND any Veterans. 
- Do not include the participants name or other identifiers -- such as a very specific title that can be easy to identify them with in your notes. Instead, use a general role description, such as "primary care provider" and "also works in informatics"
- In the event a participant needs to share their screen or a tool with an actual patient (since test patients don't always work to show how the tool functions), stop the recording before they share. DO NOT RECORD THE PARTICIPANT'S SCREEN IF THEY ARE SHOWING A REAL PATIENT.
