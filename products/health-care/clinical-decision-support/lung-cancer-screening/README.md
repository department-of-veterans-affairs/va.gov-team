# Lung Cancer Screening Initiative
LCSP v2 is a tool for Lung Cancer Screening coordinators across the VA.

# About the Product
## North Star Goal 
•	Create lung cancer survivors
LCSPv2 Value Proposition
•	Transition bridge LCSPv2 provides a "transition bridge" while VISNs and LPOP hub and spoke sites prepare for Cerner deployment
•	A Common database in LCSPv2 maintains accumulated data consistent for research cohorts (clinical treatment trials) 
•	Scalability and performance based on cloud-native technology helps eliminate outage hiccups so that the LCS program can focus on its mission 
•	Traveling Veterans are fully supported. When half the country is on Cerner, there will be many Veterans that had their initial screen performed in Legacy 

## User Problem Statement
Screening is a high touchpoint experience where a Lung Cancer Screening Coordinator must shepherd the patient through the multi-year process.  Implementing a recurring annual screening program to monitor lung cancer nodules is a heavy burden that requires time and organization.  As a result, several tools were built to track and manage the influx of new patients.  The tools were effective (some more than others) but ultimately the disparate tools made it difficult to share information across VAMCs and put patient safety at risk.  Example: if a patient has a radiology procedure in one VAMC but is planning to receive lung cancer screening at another in the same year there’s no guarantee that the information will be shared between VAMCs.

### What We're Working On
Status
Roadmap
•	Proof of concept pilot at Cerner sites (likely Walla Walla and/or Columbus)
•	Initial focus on LDCT results tracking and follow-up assignments (Annual, Diagnostic, Nodule Tracking)
•	Scale to more sites
•	Iterative refinement to improve workflow efficiency in support of the systematic and equitable LCS program objectives
