## Synthesis
### FY25 Q2 Summary
(added June 4, 2025 )

**Usage of Clinical Design System**
At the end of March 2025, we surveyed teams on their usage of the Clinical Design System. The metrics indicate that each team is making an effort to use the Clinical Design System. The Clinical Decision Support Collaborative has five product teams. The commonly used are the accordion, alert, button, icon, link, modal, tooltip, and select components. Commonly used is defined as implemented by 4 - 5 teams.
The Design System has 40 components/pattern as of the end of March 2025. Of these, 32 components/pattern are in use.
All teams are working towards adopting the Design System. LCS has identified components that they may use with the data grid. Task Manager identified seven potential components to replace. All teams anticipate using the new header once available.

**Mutual Support within the Collaborative**
More has been added or were contributed. The tag with outline variation was added to support the LCS LungRADS use case. The videocam icon from VADS was added to support My Work Week. Additionally, My Work Week contributed the skeleton loader. The elevation token was added to support the data grid and other products. Three bugs submitted by product teams have been fixed including the Date Picker, Clinician Initials Button, and Compact Button variants.
Other building blocks in progress include the drawer, line graph, header, typography tokens, and breakpoint tokens. All of which have either been requested or identified as a commonly used pattern within the Collaborative.

**Shift Left on Accessibility**
The biggest win has been the "shift left on accessibility" initiative. Every token, component, pattern, and guidance that we have worked on prioritizes accessibility. Accessibility enters the discussion during research and discovery, i.e., at the beginning of the product life cycle. As a result, ideas and questions brought to the Office Hour are also asked if they have had accessibility review.
