## Research Checklist
While the details of each step may differ based on the type of research being conducted, this checklist provides a genearl overveiew of the work that needs to be completed and can serve as a basis for covering research related tasks.

1. **Prepare Research Materials**  
   - Check if any related research exists in the OCTO GitHub Research Repository. 
   - Deterimine research method.
   - Write your research plan and guide.
   - Create stimuli if needed.
   - Get peer reviews and run a pilot session.
2. **Recruitment and Scheduling** 
   - Prep and modify outreach templates.
   - Identify potential participants.
   - Send emails.
   - Create MS Teams event for remote sessions.
   - Find notetakers and observers.
3. **Conduct Sessions** 
   - Have the conversation guide ready and a glass of water.
   - If recording, get verbal consent before recording and right after you start the recording.
   - Do not record screens when patient data is showing.
   - Debrief or capture a few top takeaways immediately after the sesion.
4. **Synthesize Data**
   - Identify top themes
6. **Share and document research**
   - Create GitHub research folder and copy markdown files.
   - Add research ticket to GitHub board and link to the research folder. Close the ticket. We do not need to do a PR review.
   - Share out in HCD CoP or async via a recording.
7. **Research close-out**
   - Send participants thank you emails.
   - Update "last contacted" data in research participant database to reflect MM/YYYY of session.
   - Scrub PII or PHI from raw notes or transcripts being retained.
   - Delete recordings.
   

## Handling Sensitive Information
> [!NOTE]
> Sensitive information includes **both** the PHI and PII of a veteran patient, as well as the PHI and PII of our research participant. Because we do not get informed consent from the patient to record their PHI and PII, we **do not record research sessions** where a patient's PHI/PII may be shown on the screen when we are observing how a clinician is interacting with tools, even though MS Teams is an approved tool for sharing sensistive information. 

[Read more about about PHI and PII here.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/what-is-pii#)


## Prepare Research Materials 

1. Check if any related research exists in the OCTO GitHub Research Repository. Filter using keywords and labels or use GitHub co-pilot to help you search. Labels specific to CDS research include: AUD:clinicians, PRDT:clinical decision support
2. Determine your research methodology.
3. Write your research plan and guide.
   - **Mural** [all-in-one research plan and conversation guide](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1739412803667/0269ae06130cf79e1e1cae0d085e8ae6fd708ccd?wid=0-1759452909310) template.
   - **Slack canvas** research plan template
   - **Slack canvas** conversation guide template. 
> [!TIP]
> Write your research plan and conversation guide using Mural or Slack Canvas templates since this makes it easier to share and collaborate and incorporate feedback compared to writing initially in the markdown files. Copy over your materials to the markdown files when they are finalized. Documentation in GitHub can be completed at the end of your research study. See the documentation in GitHub section for details.

4. Create stimuli (Figma or Mural).
5. Get peer reviews and run a pilot session. Put your request in the [#cds-hcd-cop](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C06043YBWTC) Slack channel, and give at least 48 hours notice for peer reviews and pilot sessions.

> [!NOTE]
> Additional tips and support in [Research at VA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-at-va). Do not use the TEMPLATES provided in the Quick Resources section here. Templates have been adapted for staff-facing research and are in the [clinical decision support folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/clinical-decision-support/research-templates).



#### VHA Union and PRA considerations for staff-facing research
<details>
   
**Interviews, Usability Studies, and Surveys**  
When reaching out to clinicians about participating in ANY form of research, clearly communicate that participation in this survey is voluntary, and employees will be assured that their responses will remain confidential, and their anonymity protected. Research focus should remain related to the research subject and the duties of their role as it relates to the product being researched.

When considering using a questionnaire or survey as a method to collect data on the clinician's experience, note that the survey questions will need to go through a VHA/DHO and labor relations approval process.

Coordinate with your OCTO HCD Lead who can assist with getting materials through the labor relations process.

**Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)** 

PRA does not apply to surveys of government employees if the questions are related to their official duties. Generally, research focus should remain related to the research subject and their official duties vs the nature of engaging the federal workforce in government research as participants. For more detailed instructions, see this guide to the PRA on digital.gov: https://pra.digital.gov/do-i-need-clearance/ 

</details>

## Recruitment and Scheduling
While the make-up of research participants may vary based on the product's target user group (such as primary care physicians or LCS coordinators), every research study should strive to include a 50/50 split between CPRS and Oracle Health EHR users and as we are getting started, a minimum of 1 Oracle Health EHR user. Unless the product being researched will never be used by both EHRs.

### Recruitment Channels 
1. **CDS Research Participant Database**  
   - The CDS Reserach Participant Database is connected to an MS Form that allows clinicians to self select to sign-up to be contacted for user research. It also includes staff who were manually added who we connected with through other channels.
   - [Link to research participant database](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/jana_smith-post_va_gov/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7Be5dac0d3-c637-463a-99d2-fcd508feb6be%7D&action=edit&activeCell=%27Sheet1%27!M123&wdinitialsession=1ac6a8c9-c283-7ee6-84e4-39363ae877d0&wdrldsc=3&wdrldc=1&wdrldr=AccessTokenExpiredWarningUnauthenticated%2CRefreshin)
> [!NOTE]
> The research participant database includes PII and access to the database must be limited to adhere to VA privacy policies and Labor Relations agreements. Therefore, to protect PII, access is provided to those who will need to interact with the data and research activities (HCD team members) and assist in maintaining data (Shared Support Services).
2. **Clinical Business Owner & SMEs**  
   - The clinical business owner and stakeholder of a particular product or integration along with SMEs can be a good source for clinical contacts to add to the CDS research participant pool.
3. **Snowball Recruitment**
   - Ask clinicians and staff you already are connected with to share the research participant sign-up form with their colleagues.
4. **Support and Feedback Forms**
   - The "Get Help" feedback form that is monitored by Shared Support Services can be a good place to find clinicians who are engaged with the product. Check for feedback related to the product or thing you are testing and be clear in your email to the clinician where you got their contact information from.
   - Other support or feedback channels end users might engage with (eg Share Support Office Hours)

> [!NOTE]
> It is important not to over contact from our limited participant pool. Therefore, we have a soft-limit for contact frequency. Do not contact a participant for more than 1 study every 2 months. For example, if a clinician participated in something in September, don't reach out again until November. Use your judgement based on the rapport you have with a participant to decide if additional outreach would be OK. You can also ask another researcher if they have a sense of how much a particular clinician likes to engage.

#### Maintaining the CDS Research Participant Database

<details>

**Syncing and Updating**
- The database is synced to the sign-up form inputs which are the blue columns in the spreadsheet. The yellow-orange columns are not associated with form fields and are for our own notes and management purposes.
- While the database syncs to the sign-up form, it does not overwrite changes to any of the blue columns. For example, if a user marked CPRS as their EHR and then they migrated to Oracle Health, we can change the cell to Oracle Health and it will not revert back to CPRS when syncing. The syncing process looks for new records and adds them to the bottom of the list, so it is okay to adjust and correct form inputs as needed.
- Only one submission is allowed per VA email. Therefore HCD pratitioners need to manually add new particpants directly into the spreadsheet. Check first to ensure the participant is not already in the database. Duplicates will arise only from manual entires.
- All CDS HCD practitioners should add their own contacts to the database and update "last contacted" when contacting participants to participate in studies.
- When adding manually, align to the feedback form entries to maintain standardization and consistency for easier filtering, add the new participant directly to the spreadsheet view because there is only one submission of the form per email to prevent clinicians from filling it out multiple times and creating duplicate entries. Ctrl + f to search for and confirm the participant is not already in the database before adding them.
- "Last contacted" column ensures we are not contacting participants for multiple studies at the same time. Use only MM/YYYY format so we do not create an opportunity for people to be connected to specific studies.
- Soft limit: do not contact a participant for more than 1 study every 2 months. So if they participated in something in September, don't reach out again until November. Use your judgement based on the rapport you have with a participant to decide if additional outreach would be OK. You can also ask another researcher if they have a sense of how much a particular clinician likes to engage.
- For research participants who no longer want to be contacted, mark "No" in the "Agree to Participate" column.
- This research participant database should **NOT** be used as a study level participant tracker. We do not want to be able to connect the dots of participants to quotes or comments to maintain participant's anonymity.
- Study level trackers should be created in the VA space but on the researcher's personal OneDrive (not in a shared team drive) and shared with either the HCD lead or another HCD member to have one backup person with access. [Here is an example template that can be copied for individual use.](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/CDSProgramTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCB1A98E8-3826-46BD-9279-CBCC5D8149CF%7D&file=CDSC%20Research%20Participant%20Study%20Tracker.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

**Database Access**
- Program and Product leads should only have access by request if they need to interact with the data and research activities (such as doing recruitment). 
- Other staff and projects conducting research in support of understanding the clinical experience and building clinical decision support tools may need either a participant list to help with their recruitment efforts or access to the database depending on the frequency of the need. 
- All requests beyond the CDS Collaborative HCD members should be sent to and approved by the VA HCD lead
- Members who no longer need access should be removed. 
- Shared support services owns the database (can add/remove permissions)

**Sharing the sign-up form**

- Do not mass email [this sign-up form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=Ixtf6a-r7kWCHberJRqzvwJmS8KCiL9DiWDzYKVU_XFUQUVLTjNNUjNPSDc3MkVNUjE2M0pERUtaOS4u&origin=lprLink&route=shorturl) to distribution lists, however, you can put the link in your email signature or share directly with other clinicians to pass along to their colleagues.


</details>

### Outreach & Scheduling  
The following templates can be used and modified to fit the purpose of your outreach to clinicians when recruiting participants for HCD research. 

Make the adjustments you need while ensuring the outreach contains the following information: 

- identify who we are
- share how we got their contact information
- highlight the purpose of the research
- let them know that their participation is voluntary and their responses are kept confidential and their anonymity is protected
- give them a way to opt out of future outreach for research activities

> [!TIP]
> Start recruitment about 2-4 weeks out from your first session. Send outreach emails in batches. Start with emailing 4-6 potential candidates. Every 24-48 hours, email about 2-3 more until you reach your target number of participants.
>

## Conduct User Sessions

- Have your conversation guide ready, prototype or stimuli on the screen or link handy to share, and a glass of water!
- Introduce yourself with cameras on, as well as any notetakers or observers. Then notetakers and observers can go off camera for the duration of the session.
- Get informed consent and verbal agreement from the clinician to record the session. 
- **Do not record screens that share actual patient data.** We do not have informed consent from the patient for recording their data.
- If you need to record a session where a clinician is showing patient data on a screen, you can record "transcript only" and not the screen. Ensure to have an extra observer to be able to capture notes. Do not capture any PHI/PII
- If you need to record a screen, ensure only a test patient is used.
- If PHI/PII is accidentally shared, stop the recording as quickly as possible. Let the research lead know for awareness. Delete the recording as soon as possible after you collected what you needed for synthesis. An incident does not need to be reported since MS Teams is used for the recordings and approved by security for sharing PHI and PII. Remember, we do not record patient PHI and PII because we do not have informed consent from them to record. Sometimes when deleting a recording, you need to delete from more than one folder. 


## Synthesis

Use whatever method and tool that works for you and your team. The key things you’ll want to get out of your research to write up your research findings are:
1. 5-10 top findings/themes, along with supporting quotes
2. Determine whether you proved your hypotheses true or false
3. Come up with recommendations based on your findings, including supporting evidence.

Write up your findings following the structure of the research-findings.md template so it's easy to copy and paste into the markdown file when you are ready.

> [!TIP] 
> Write findings as stand-alone insights that are easy to scan. For example:  
> - "All users felt having a search function for patient name would be more useful in the calendar view rather than search for a column."  
> - "Clinicians didn't notice when certain values in the Key Data section were elevated, and wanted to see abnormal values display in red and normal ranges to help provide context to how far above the normal range a patient is."  

If keeping a video clip from a user session, [review the tips here on how to scrub PHI/PII from recordings](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-scrub-a-video-clip-of-pii-and-phi).

For details on how to write descriptive links that are accessible to assistive technology users, see Platform documentation on [How to create accessible GitHub Markdown files](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-create-accessible-github-markdown-files).

## Share and document research
Completed research must be added to the OCTO research repository board. Since the CDS research processes differ from the VFS research processes and we are not relying on other workflow integrations or reruitment services, we can add our research to GitHub when studies are completed. 

#### Document your research in GitHub
For research conducted and documented prior to October 1, 2025, refer to this section for adding older research findings to the GitHub repository. 

1. Create a GitHub research folder for your study inside the [respective CDS product folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/clinical-decision-support), 
   - Click into your respective folder.
   - Click add file.
   - Type the name of the study folder with the format: titled with date then study name [YYYY-MM-Name-of-Study]. Example: 2025-09-Calculator-Detail-Page-Line-Chart-Testing
     <img width="1203" height="179" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87488734-27e8-4850-bbb4-ab87f348ca6b" />

   - Type **/** then **research-plan.md** and then **Commit changes**.
     <img width="1239" height="215" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1c86a09-f463-47e7-aea5-ca300a6f85c1" />

> **TIP:** A folder needs an .md file to create. Make a research-plan.md to start and then copy over the research-plan template by clicking the **copy raw data** icon near the top right. Then you can paste all of the content into the newly created research-plan.md file. Moving or renaming files in GitHub will break links previously shared. Ensure you have naming how you want it before sharing links!

2. This new folder should have the following files: research-plan.md, conversation-guide.md, research-findings.md. Do not rename these files.
   - Github templates exist to create the markdown files and help make it easy to maintain the structure needed. 
   - [These templates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/clinical-decision-support/research-templates) are markdown files, new to many. Use OCTO GitHub tips as a resource to get you up to speed. Additionally, there are tips to making your GitHub files accessible.
   - These templates are adapted from the VA.gov templates used for Veteran facing research for CDS purposes. For example, the demographics section about the participants recruited reflects the clinical setting since we aim to recruit for different EHR systems, clinical roles, etc.
   - The templates maintain the same structure as the VFS templates as that will assist with copilot use
   - The conversation guide template has all of the intro text around participant privacy and recording such that only small modifications may be needed for these sections.

  > **TIP:** Select the **Copy raw data** to copy from the templates to your own folder. Then edit the markdown files and copy from your Mural or Slack research-plans and conversation guides. You'll want to copy and paste over in sections to maintain the formatting.  

3. After your research folder is created and your markdown files are complete, create a ticket in the Completed column of the Research Repository board.
   - Go to the OCTO Research Repository board.
   - Scroll to the **Complete** column and click **Add item**.
   - Begin typing and then click Create new issue.
   - A modal will pop-up and confirm the Repository listed is department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository
   - Then select Research Intake Form.
   - Follow the naming convention for the Title.
   - Copy the path from the new research folder you created that contains the study's markdown files and paste into the Research Folder field.
   - Complete the **Summary** and **Key Findings** sections and add the following labels: AUD:clinicians, PRDT:clinical decision support, and relevant RESRCH label.
   - Click **Create** and then click **Edit** and edit the Summary to put the Veteran Journeys and Benefits below the **Key Findings** section for easier reading since those sections are not relevant for the clinical & staff facing research.
   - Update ticket with start and end dates.
   - Click **Close** to close the ticket.
     
#### Document older studies in GitHub
For studies conducted prior to October 1, 2025, only the summary ticket needs to be created in GitHub with links back to the original source such as Confluence. [Here is an example of a prior study added to GitHub.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/1710)

After your research folder is created and your markdown files are complete, create a ticket in the Completed column of the Research Repository board.
   - Go to the OCTO Research Repository board.
   - Scroll to the **Complete** column and click **Add item**.
   - Begin typing and then click Create new issue.
   - A modal will pop-up and and confirm the Repository listed is department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository
   - Then select Research Intake Form.
   - Follow the naming convention for the Title.
   - Put the link to the original documentation source in the Research Folder field (like Confluence).
   - Complete the **Summary** and **Key Findings** sections and add the following labels: AUD:clinicians, PRDT:clinical decision support, and relevant RESRCH label.
   - Click **Create** and then click **Edit** and edit the Summary to put the Veteran Journeys and Benefits below the **Key Findings** section for easier reading since those sections are not relevant for the clinical & staff facing research.
   - Update ticket with start and end dates.
   - Click **Close** to close the ticket.

#### Share findings with your team
1. Consider signing up for a research readout in the weekly CDS HCD CoP and/or the OCTO weekly Design CoP meeting.
2. Consider recording a readout to share async in Slack channels for your product and the HCD CoP.


## Research close-out
Tasks for when synthesis and documentation is completed.

1. **Remove PII/PHI from transcripts if keeping**
   - If keeping any transcripts of recordings for future reference, remove PII/PHI. You might consider keeping transcripts for topics that you know will carry forward into future research studies. 
2. **Delete recordings:** 
   - When synthesis is completed, delete recordings.
   - Go to your OneDrive and the Recodrings folder. Select the recordings you need to delete and click "Delete."
   - Then click on the recycle bin and confirm they are deleted from there. If you don't see anything, and see "Can't find what you're looking for? Check the Second-stage recycle bin" and delet from there if it is still available.
3. **Confirm raw notes do not contain PII/PHI**
   - Remember that PII includes the name of the participant. This sometimes is copied accidentally when coping from a transcript to Mural stickies! Double-check!
   - Store transcripts in a folder that has limited access.
4. **Send participant a thank-you note**
   - A small note of appreciation goes a long way! Thank them for their time and include something specific to them to make it personal. This could be a surprise takeaway or even a common interest you learned about, like living in the same state.
