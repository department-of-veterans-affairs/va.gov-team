> [!NOTE]
> *Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out first in the via Slack in [#cds-hcd-cop] (https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C06043YBWTC) or if more help is needed check out the [#research-ops](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C0216PL32HJ) Slack channel.* 

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>* Patient Details 1.0 on the CDS Console has been released: September 30th . Gathering usability of 1.0 and user-driven value will be critical to help guide potential enhancements and next steps related to this feature, and to inform PGM #100.
* Additionally, as Oracle Health integration planning continues, we will be including 3 OH users in these studies, to gather their perspective on the integration of the Console into Oracle Health, state of Patient details and potential enhancements, will be essential to inform and guide our Console integration work [PGM #217] </summary>
	
`What problem is your product or feature trying to solve?`

### [OCTO-DSD Priorities] 

<details><summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed. </summary>
- * [PGM] CDS Console and Applications Oracle Health Integration #217
- * [PGM] Console Redesign and App Widgets #100
- * Enhance User Experience of the CDS Console through Clinician Feedback #696

`Objective 1:  Insights on Patient Details 1.0 and validation on enhancements'

> - **Key Result 1:** Insights will identify where the feature meets clinician needs, where friction persists, and what opportunities exist to evolve Patient Details on the Console. This evidence will guide prioritization of enhancements and inform the roadmap for future iterations.
> - **Key Result 2:** Navigation input - focused on navigation within the CDS's patient details to the individual apps for task flow completion.

`Objective 2: Viable user-tested ‘app widget’ concepts/'partial views'* to inform PGM #100' 

> - **Key Result 1:** "Partial views" of CDS Apps with actionable CDS data are available on the CDS Console default view"

`Objective 3: High level user feedback on the Console within Oracle Health (initial integration approach) provider workflows'

> - **Key Result 1:** High level insight on Oracle Health Workflows

`Objective 4: High level user feedback on clinician familiarity with ICN (CPRS plans unknown, however from Shane's perspective it would be good to gather what clinician's know about ICN and usage)`

> - **Key Result 1:** High level insight on ICN use and familiarity

### [Clinician Journey](https://www.figma.com/proto/YhERBZMWoqvwRgDUo6OgCx/User-Testing-Prototypes?page-id=2196%3A2&node-id=2293-3966&viewport=-10%2C-3901%2C0.35&t=sGnhUugq1ReREHAi-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=2293%3A3966)

<details><summary>Where does your product fit into the Clinician or VA staff journey?

As a Vista CPRS or Oracle Health user, I access patient details and key workflows via the Console, for example:
- 'Setting context, opening the Console, CDS applications'
- 'Using MWW to determine when an appointment is'
- 'Reviewing a patient's details prior to an appointment'
- 'Utilizing Med Pic to review a patient's medication adherence'
- 'Using a medical calculator to determine a diagnosis or result'
- 'Adding a Task as a follow up for a patient'

</details>

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Patient Details 1.0 & Enhancements - Evaluate the value of Patient Details 1.0 feature value and identify needed enhancements**

`2.` **App Widgets and OH Workflows - Validate the usefulness of App Widget task flows within the Console (from playground). Example flows to test: TM Widget, MWW Widget, Medical Calculators Widget** 
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings? - `

---

**Insights will identify where the feature meets clinician needs, where friction persists, and what opportunities exist to evolve Patient Details on the Console. This evidence will guide prioritization of enhancements and inform the roadmap for future iterations.**

### Research questions
> [!NOTE]
> Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the` [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/clinical-decision-support/research-templates/conversation-guide.md)

***Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:***
	
`What will I do with what I learn from this question?`
  
`Does this question serve the goals of my study?`

**`1.`How do clinicians perceive the value of accessing Patient Details through the CDS Console compared to their current workflows (within Vista CPRS or Oracle Health)?**

**`2.`What usability challenges and friction points emerge when clinicians use Patient Details 1.0 within the Console?**

**`3.`Which enhancements to Patient Details 1.0 would most meaningfully improve the clinician experience and task completion?** 

**`4.`In what ways does the Console as an entry point/home for Clinical Decision Support influence clinician efficiency, decision-making, and overall workflow integration?**

**`5.`Based on foundational insights gathered from previous user testing of the CDS Console, how are clinician experiences and workflows influenced when the Console is accessed within Oracle Health compared with Vista CPRS?**

**`6.`How do clinicians evaluate the usefulness and viability of the app widget concepts (task flows), and which use cases provide the greatest value? What additional information is needed to support their workflow? What information is not valuable?**

### Hypotheses
> [!NOTE]
> Remember to constrain the hypotheses to the goals of your study!
 
**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

---

**Primary Hypothesis (Patient Details 1.0)**
- If clinicians can reliably access Patient Details through the CDS Console (across both Vista CPRS and Oracle Health), including provider workflows within Oracle Health. Usability testing will surface friction points that, once addressed, will increase adoption and reinforce the Console as the central entry point and “home” for Clinical Decision Support.

**Secondary Hypothesis (App Widgets)**
- When a user accesses Patient Details within the Console, then clinicians will find higher value in ‘at a glance’ app widgets that properly guide them to relevant Clinical Decision Support applications/tools, such as Medical Calculators, My Workweek, and Task Manager. Research will clarify which 'top tasks' and information align with clinician priorities and identify which task flows and CDS content/data should be prioritized for the future Platform roadmap.

**Workflow Integration Hypothesis**
- If Patient Details in the CDS Console delivers a consistent and streamlined experience across both Oracle Health and Vista CPRS, then clinicians will experience lower cognitive load and perceive greater value in using the Console. This consistency will support smoother provider workflows, improve efficiency, and reinforce the Console’s role as the unifying entry point/"home" for Clinical Decision Support.

## Research materials 📔

> [!NOTE]
> **Have your research plan reviewed by the OCTO VA HCD Lead or a CDS HCD Peer review before beginning recruitment. This doesn't mean the research plan has to be 100% finalized, but reviewed to ensure we are clear on our target participants**

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.  

**For moderated usability test and interview:**

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. This is helpful if getting recruitment assistance from CDSC peers.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question. 
  Example: Have you used CDS Medical Calcualtors in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider what criteria MUST be met, versus what is nice to have.

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (clinicians, VHA administrative staff, coordinators, etc.) of participants for this study:
> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **2x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 6 ideal completed sessions, plan to email at least 12 participants)*

- `Clinicians - CPRS:` **[n=5]**
- `Clinicians - Oracle:` **[n=3]**
- `VHA admin staff:` **[n=0]**
- `Total:` **[n=8]**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **[n=4]**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study. For example, is it important to capture both inpatient and outpatient care settings? Or are you looking for a certain specialty or role such as a nurse practitionaer or physician?* 

- `Primary Care Physicians`
- `Familiar with the CDS Console, has used OH (ideal)`

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
*What criteria would strengthen your results? For example, getting a variety of FTE percentage (patient facing time) or providers who work float schedules. Secondary criteria could also be role types, specialty, etc depending on the priority for a given study* 

- `Potentially a few ‘super users,’ familiarity with CDS tools`
- `User who uses Task Manager`
- `User who uses Med calc`
- `User who uses My Workweek`
- `Someone from AiScribe pilot and uses Console`
- `Behavioral Health`
- `Outpatient Surgical`

## Timeline 🗓️
Consider recruitment lead time is often 2-4 weeks. 

### Outreach Email Templates
**General template, adjustments made for individual emails based on context or prior connection with participant. The outreach email must contain the line about voluntary participation and anonymity**

Hello (Name),

My name is (researcher/designer name), and we previously connected via your support request to (enter request or issue). 

I am reaching out now to see if you would be interested in participating in a design feedback session. We are currently evaluating some new designs for the (product name). I’d love to get your perspective and feedback on these new concepts. It would involve participating in a 60-minute remote session on MS Teams. The session would include a general introduction and current experience with (product name), then I would share a design prototype with you along with a few probes to get your reactions, followed by closing questions. 

**Your choice to participate is completely voluntary. We will share our learnings within the CDS Collaborative in the form of aggregated information or anonymized quotes. Your responses will remain confidential, and your anonymity protected.**

If you are interested in participating, the following days and times are available. Please respond to this email with a few 60-minute options that work for you, and I will send an invitation. If you are interested in participating, but not available for this session, please keep an eye out for future opportunities. 

All times are in **Eastern** time:

- [Availability]

Cheers,

Liz Blasi


### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been shared via Slack in #cds-hcd-cop or DS Office Hours for feedback. 

**A pilot session is strongly recommended. Find a partipant in the HDC CoP slack channel or your product team** 

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Inpatient Behavioral Health Participant - Name Redacted]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[November 10th, 2025]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates 11/10-12/02]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[1 hour]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[30 min]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[2 per day]**

  
## Team Roles  🕵️👩‍💻👩‍🔬

> [!NOTE]
> **Please do not include email addresses in this section.** We previously required email addresses. VA's GitHub policy ([see announcement](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/discussions/13)) has changed. VA.gov email addresses cannot be in public repositories.
>
> **Please list the names of people in each role.** In the Slack study channel, send an email and primary phone number for the moderator. Also send emails for the notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker.

- `Moderator:` **[Liz Blasi]**	
- `Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):` **[Liz Blasi]**		
- `Participant recruiting & screening:`	**[Liz Blasi]**	
- `Project point of contact:` **[Liz Blasi]**		
- `Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):` **[Homer Gaines]**	
- `Note-takers:` **[Rosemary Rogers, Ruben Sun, Ayangbe Mannen, Natalie Hill, Alyssa Li]** 	
- `Observers: **[None]**

### Notetaker and Silent Obeserver Guide
- Be a silent observer. If you have a question for the participant, ask the facilitator via a Slack DM and they'll accommodate it if appropriate.
- If you can notetake, please do! It helps researchers a lot to see what you captured. There’s a note taking template in this Mural with screenshots. If you find it easier to write your notes or use a word doc, that's fine too! If you take running notes, please be sure to make a clear reference to the screen in question or the scenario being mentioned.
- Write what you hear and see as much as possible. For some it can be easier to write in first person, as it is said, so that you don't need to paraphrase anything. Try to capture what they said without adding your own interpretation of what they meant. E.g. "I'm not sure about this checkbox" does not equal "Doesn't understand checkbox."
- Share your notes back with the facilitator via Slack if taken outside of the mural. Do not include ANY PII in this chat.
- For design testing, try to write down things that aren't said—for instance, when someone misunderstood some copy or clicked the wrong element. It helps us figure out what needs to be revisited.
- Share a few raw impressions with the facilitator via Slack or in the notetaking document after the interview is done, if possible. It helps with synthesis!

**Protecting PII**
- It's important to protect the privacy of our VHA staff participants AND any Veterans. 
- Do not include the participants name or other identifiers -- such as a very specific title that can be easy to identify them with in your notes. Instead, use a general role description, such as "primary care provider" and "also works in informatics"
- In the event a participant needs to share their screen or a tool with an actual patient (since test patients don't always work to show how the tool functions), stop the recording before they share. DO NOT RECORD THE PARTICIPANT'S SCREEN IF THEY ARE SHOWING A REAL PATIENT.
