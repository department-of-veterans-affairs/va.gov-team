# Clinical Decision Support Platform
The goal of the platform is to provide onboarded applications with the capabilities of a robust cloud infrastructure and the SMART-on-FHIR container (SOFC), such as enabling applications to launch from CPRS, keeping patient context through CCOW, authenticating via SSOi and accessing real-time patient data in VistA and Cerner.

Developers can abstract away previously solved problems, and focus on domain-specific knowledge to maximize clinical benefit and patient outcomes. It would also allow developers to quickly deploy, test, and productionalize new applications, which can in turn shorten the time to value for development teams assisting clinicians.

# About the Product
## North Star Goal 
The SoF Platform is in its infancy, and yet we already have significant interest from teams who wish to build upon it.  We believe by creating a platform that makes it easy to build, deploy, and test clinical applications, teams will use the platform and more value will accrue to clinicians.  We also believe that clinicians will return when they can discover easy-to-use applications that focus on good user experience and solve relevant problems.

## User Problem Statement
As a clinician, I want to develop Clinical Decision Support Tools that are SMART-on-FHIR complaint and can be launched from CPRS.

### What We're Working On
•	The CDSP platform team conducted engagements with 11 different teams across the VA and identified three potential use cases for development and/or integration efforts. Those use cases include:
o	Virtual Care Manager
	Pending prioritization and level of effort by team
o	STORM – Opioid management
	Exploring UI design work to improve visibility of STORM w/CPRS
	Determining technical feasibility 
o	Precision Oncology (work being led by Coforma)
	Exploring problem statement w/key stakeholders, i.e. Dr. Ahmed
	Determining team bandwidth 
•	Exploring tighter integration into clinical workflows via CDS hooks, auto event-triggers
•	Formulating approach for platform design strategy
