# Clinical Decision Support Platform
The CDS Platform is meant to be the home for all impactful clinical decision support-related tools, information and data visualization that support and transform clinician workflow built upon a platform that is integrated to key VA systems and provides the highest quality of monitoring and alerting. Our team works to enable application teams to develop and deploy modern, scalable applications more quickly and securely, while providing clinicians with an improved user experience as they provide clinical care.

# About the Product
## North Star Goal 
The goal of the platform is to provide applications with the capabilities of a robust cloud infrastructure and the SMART-on-FHIR container (SOFC), such as enabling applications to launch from CPRS, keeping patient context through CCOW, authenticating via SSOi and accessing real-time patient data in VistA and Cerner. We also work to bring innovative technologies to VA such as CDS (Clinical Decision Support) Hooks and Gen Ai. 

We believe by creating a platform that makes it easy to build, deploy, and test clinical applications, teams will use the platform and more value will accrue to clinicians.  We also believe that clinicians will return when they can discover easy-to-use applications that focus on good user experience and solve relevant problems.

## User Problem Statement
As a clinician, I want to develop new and access existing Clinical Decision Support Tools that are SMART-on-FHIR compliant and can be launched from CPRS.

### What We're Working On
•	The team is currently working on building out a patient context two-way sync capability needed by CDS Application teams, building out our ability to measure DORA metrics, and bringing innovative technology to VA in CDS Hooks. We are preparing to undertake migrating VistA-api-x to the CDS Platform as well as improving our platform’s security and reliability. Finally, towards the end of this quarter, we will be working to enhance the user experience of the CDS Console itself by implementing a new navigational structure towards our longer-term vision of bringing functionality out of apps and into the Console, i.e., our vision of the Console as a workspace.
