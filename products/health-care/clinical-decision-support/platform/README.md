# Clinical Decision Support Platform
The goal of the platform is to provide onboarded applications with the capabilities of a robust cloud infrastructure and the SMART-on-FHIR container (SOFC), such as enabling applications to launch from CPRS, keeping patient context through CCOW, authenticating via SSOi and accessing real-time patient data in VistA and Cerner.

Developers can abstract away previously solved problems, and focus on domain-specific knowledge to maximize clinical benefit and patient outcomes. It would also allow developers to quickly deploy, test, and productionalize new applications, which can in turn shorten the time to value for development teams assisting clinicians.

# About the Product
## North Star Goal 
The SoF Platform is in its infancy, and yet we already have significant interest from teams who wish to build upon it.  We believe by creating a platform that makes it easy to build, deploy, and test clinical applications, teams will use the platform and more value will accrue to clinicians.  We also believe that clinicians will return when they can discover easy-to-use applications that focus on good user experience and solve relevant problems.

## User Problem Statement
As a clinician, I want to develop Clinical Decision Support Tools that are SMART-on-FHIR complaint and can be launched from CPRS.
