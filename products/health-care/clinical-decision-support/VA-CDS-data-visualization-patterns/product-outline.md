 
## Overview
Our team aims to create patterns for the clinician experience that can be shared with VADS, USWDS, and other federal agencies. 

## Problem Statement
How might we update existing, or create new patterns to improve clinician experiences in a way that is adaptable by VADS, USWDS, and other federal agencies? We expect these new patterns will reduce clinician cognitive load and increase quality of the Veteran patient experience. 

[What is the difference between components, templates, and patterns?](https://design.va.gov/patterns/#what-is-the-difference-between-components-templates-and-patterns) VADS has clear definitions and expectations that is adopted by the VA CDS. 

## Desired User Outcomes
- Simple displays of a single variable/data point
- Complex displays of multivariate data
- Gallery of images with image detail
- Other data visualization patterns as determined by discovery and prioritized by OCTO

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Up to 3 (at least 1) new clinician-facing and/or health-related applications using Design System components in production.
- Up to 10 new components (at least 5) generated for clinician-facing applications.
- An increase in the total number and/or percentage of teams creating or maintaining health-related applications that utilize the Design System.
- Total number and percentage of Veteran Health patients being serviced by VA health applications that utilize the Design System.
- A 15% or greater reduction in VA custom code by end of TMF project overall (for associated reduction in legacy development costs)
- After discovery to define baseline Google Lighthouse performance targets acceptable to both VA and USWDS, such as time to first contentful paint (FCP), acceptable Lighthouse performance targets should be met
- Documentation for data visualization patterns is authored for use and delivered to necessary stakeholders for integration into both https://design.va.gov and https://designsystem.digital.gov
- Research findings are delivered that are associated with testing data visualization patterns with actual users, including Veterans, Veteran family members, VA staff, and relevant members of the public, and research findings are made available to VA staff via OCTOâ€™s standard research archiving processes
- All delivered web component and pattern code achieves perfect accessibility scores per 508 and WCAG 2.1 requirements via automated and manual testing

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- No new applications integrating USWDS data visualization components are developed
- Less than five distinct components are delivered
- It is not sufficient quality to be adopted by existing VA.gov applications retroactively (e.g. code and patterns/flows do not easily replace/adapt to existing code and patterns/flow)
- It does not sufficiently account for the value in (and build on) existing in-production solutions on CDSP or other data visualization applications for VA customers
- It does not meet sufficient quality measures to be integrated into the US Web Design System

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Once fully adopted by CDSC teams, we expect these to be indicators of success:
- After discovery to define current baseline percentage utilization of design system (USWDS/VA) components and patterns, an increase in utilization of design system components by 15%
- A 15% or greater reduction in VA custom code by end of project overall and/or measurable performance improvement
- An increase in the total number and/or percentage of teams creating or maintaining health-related applications that utilize the Design System. 
- {{add KPI to hit for increase in specific pattern usage}}

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
  - Lines of custom code removed from CDSC (for reduction in legacy development costs)
  - 5-8 patterns are created and presented to USWDS for consideration
  - All delivered web component and pattern code achieves perfect accessibility scores per 508 and WCAG 2.1 requirements via automated and manual testing

## Assumptions
Based on existing research and priorities we have identified several potential candidate patterns. These include:
- [data grid] Help Users to parse through dense data quickly
- tbd

## Solution Approach
Our pattern prioritization matrix is based on the following factors:
- It is related to data visualization.
- It solves a specific Clinical Decision Support Collaborative (CDSC) problem.
- It is sufficiently abstract-able to be reusable across CDSC teams.
- It is sufficient quality and utility to be integrated into VADS.
- It is sufficient quality and utility to be integrated into USWDS.

Additional consideration includes:
- Dependencies on other teams.
- Dependencies on other patterns and components.
- Highest impact x feasibility

- *What are we going to build now, and why have we decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have we explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

  
### [Parse through dense data quickly with a data grid](#)
We believe this is a good pattern [add hypothesis reasoning] 

This pattern should consist of: 
- tbd
- tbd
- tbd

### Navigate as a clinician
We believe this is a good pattern [add hypothesis reasoning] 

This pattern should consist of: 
- tbd
- tbd
- tbd

### [Pattern tbd](#)
We believe this is a good pattern [add hypothesis reasoning] 

This pattern should consist of:
