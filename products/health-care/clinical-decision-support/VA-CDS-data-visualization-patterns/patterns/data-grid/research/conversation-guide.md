# Intro - 5 minutes

Hello. My name is Ben and these are my colleagues ____ and ____. Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us today. My colleague(s) are here as observers or notetakers, and the conversation will primarily be between you and me today.

Our interview will focus on testing Data Grid. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

Over the course of the hour, we will have a general discussion and intro, review a design prototype, and then wrap-up with a few final questions. Your participation in this session is completely voluntary. Your responses will remain confidential and your anonymity protected. In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. There are no right or wrong answers. We want to improve these tools to better meet clinician needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. You may have questions as we go. I'll try my best to answer, and occasionally, I might not be able to answer until the end so that I can get your perspective. Are you comfortable if I record our conversation as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. When we share our insights, we may quote things you said but they will be attributed to your role or care setting -- such as primary care provider or nurse practitioner. Recordings are stored in the MS teams chat and get shared with other members in the CDS Collaborative.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. We can take a break or stop this interview at any time if you need to. Do you have any questions so far?

Is it OK to record this session?


# Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we get started, I want to ask you a few questions to get to know you better!



1. Can you tell me about your current role at the VA? 
    1. How long have you been at the VA?
2. Can you walk me through your day to day work activities?


# Prototype Introduction - 2 minutes

Next we’re going to look at a prototype of the Data Grid. You might have used something similar in applications or in other places. There are a few things I’d like you to keep in mind:



* I’ll describe a scenario and then give you a set of tasks to complete using the prototype.
* This is a prototype and not the real application. You may see placeholder information that doesn't match your own situation exactly and that's ok.
* There are questions that will ask to input information. When we get to these points, you can tell me what you would input, and then we'll move on.
* As you're going through the prototype, please think aloud. I'd like you to say whatever comes into your mind. I'm interested in what's grabbing your attention on the screen, what questions you have, and your general thoughts as you review a page.
* If at any point you feel uncomfortable or confused, please let me know. We are testing the designs and gathering feedback and not testing you. We’re here to support and learn from you.
* If you have any questions as we go along, please feel free to ask me. I may not be able to answer them right away since we’re interested in how people would navigate this application without a helper around. But if you still have any questions when we’re done, I’ll try to answer them then.

And please feel free to be as honest as possible – it won’t hurt our feelings.

# Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?
