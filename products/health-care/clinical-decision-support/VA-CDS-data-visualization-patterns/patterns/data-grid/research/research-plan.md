# Data Grid Usability Testing Research Plan

Data Grid | Data Visualization Team


# Background:

Data Grid is a pattern that consists of an interactive table that allows clinicians to view and interact with large datasets. Currently, data grid is still in development and will be used within the CDSC applications. This is a new pattern that is currently being used in Lung Cancer Screening and Task Manager.


# Research Goals:

To assess the overall usability of the Data Grid and to observe how clinicians use Data Grid.

Better understand the specific needs, behaviors, and workflows of clinicians when using Data Grid and identify areas of improvement for future iterations.


# Outcome:



* Testing the usability of Data Grid will help our team identify any areas for improvement and opportunities to grow the functionalities of Data Grid to ultimately optimize clinician workflow and user experience.
* Observational activities and interview questions will allow our team to deep dive into particular features of the Data Grid such as the toolbar and filtering capabilities.
* Observational activities will shed light to the shortcomings (if any) of responsive features.


# Research Questions:

**Toolbar**

We want to ask questions and observe how clinicians search for data using the search functionality in the toolbar. We want to observe the entire workflow of what prompts clinicians to search for something and what actions they take based on the results of the search. Furthermore, we want to understand how clinicians are filtering the results. By understanding how clinicians use the toolbar, we hope to identify areas for improvement.



* How are users prioritizing the table search in relation to the individual column search fields?
* Are users getting the expected experience around the search functionality?
* How are users filtering table data? Are they able to recognize if filters are active?

**Table**

We want to understand how clinicians interact with and navigate the data grid table and see how they find key data. Weâ€™re interested to see if and how clinicians use the various table functionalities such as pinning, sorting, and filtering.



* How do clinicians use the pinning functionality (if at all)? What are some use cases where they would use pinning?
* How do clinicians use column searches compared to the toolbar search?
* How do clinicians use the sorting functionality? What are some use cases where they would use sorting.
* How do clinicians update/edit cell values?


# Hypotheses:



* Users will recognize data grid from using similar patterns and will be able to complete tasks with general ease.
* Users will successfully find information that they are tasked to search for but the double layered search may cause some confusion.


# Methodology:

**Semi-structured interviews**

Researchers will observe clinicians using data grid on a Codespace staging environment and ask for general feedback throughout the session. All sessions will take place over Microsoft Teams and we will ask clinicians to share their thoughts as we give them a series of tasks. We will ask follow-up questions for any needed clarification. Each session will take approximately 1 hour. We aim to hold 5 sessions at a minimum.


# Locations:

Remote via Microsoft Teams. We will adhere to EST.


# Research Materials:



* Conversation guide


# Recruitment:

Cold email clinicians on the SharePoint Research Participant Database.
