# Data Grid 2.0 PRD (Product Requirements Document)
<br>

## Pattern Outcome 
The Data Grid 2.0 pattern will have more interaction capabilities. The consumer of this pattern will be able to customize interactions for their user experience.
<br>

## Requirements in scope
1. exposing list of interactions
2. sticky column view (aka column stays in view during horizontal scrolling)
   - [see slack for this priority agreement ](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04DMDC3TS8/p1734548335437739)
   - important for a11y
3. adding, deleting, and editing rows
   - https://muhimasri.com/blogs/add-remove-react-table-rows/
4. cell editor for select
5. cell editor for date picker (aka date selection affordance)
6. visual tagging in the table
7. reordering columns (dragging and dropping columns)
   - https://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/guide/column-ordering
8. quick filter (aka multi-selection filtering) (need to validate the variant)
   - https://borstch.com/snippet/implementing-multi-select-filters-in-react-tanstack-table
9. Meets accessibility scores by WCAG 2.1 (Section 508) (update to 2.2)

<br>

**Desired Affordances**
- manually adding/deleting data
- manually adding/deleting/moving/selecting rows
- creating custom filters
- exporting state
- restoring state
- accessing client side filter
- accessing client side sorting
- accessing selected row(s)
- grid options changes (changing column definition array on the fly)
- get row by Id
- get all rows

<br>

**Desired Affordances**
- manually adding/deleting data

- creating custom filters
- "control over the rows (saved states instead calling again with each )
- ability to remove or delete a row"
- ability to add rows from the app
- get data for row selection
