# Drawer PRD (Product Requirements Document)
<br>

## Pattern Outcome 
The Drawer is a container that enables a user to view, edit, and/or create new information while having the context of the current screen.
<br>

## Requirements in scope
- **P1:** Must have. Prioritized into scope.  
- **P2:** not in scope. Can be a post-MVP enhancement or contributed back by product teams.
- **P3:** not in scope. May not be a candidate for the pattern design and more appropriate as an enhancement in the consumer's product UX instead.

| Affordance  | Requirement | User Story  | Priority Level  | Status  |
