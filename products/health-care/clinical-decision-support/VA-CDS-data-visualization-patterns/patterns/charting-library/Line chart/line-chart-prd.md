# Line Chart PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- **Version:** MVP 
- **Start Date:** March 5, 2025
- **End Date:** September 30, 2025
- **Status:** Complete

## Overview
The Chart Library is a collection of reusable, standardized data visualization components. The line graph will be the first in the collection. It will provide a flexible and accessible way to visualize data with lines. 

## Background
Data visualization is a growing need across our products. Currently, teams rely on disparate charting solutions that result in inconsistent user experiences, accessibility gaps, and duplicated efforts. A centralized chart library will ensure visual cohesion and technical efficiency.

## Pattern Outcome 
The outcome of this project is to deliver a robust, accessible, and reusable line graph pattern that serves as the foundation for a comprehensive chart library within the Clinical Design System. This pattern will ensure visual consistency, ease of integration, and support for future chart types.

## Goals
- Provide a reusable and accessible line graph component
- Ensure responsive behavior
- Enable easy integration for both designers (via Figma UI Kit) and developers (via code and Storybook)

## Out of Scope
- more than four lines
- showing data for the same X-axis value in one tooltip
- export or download functionality
