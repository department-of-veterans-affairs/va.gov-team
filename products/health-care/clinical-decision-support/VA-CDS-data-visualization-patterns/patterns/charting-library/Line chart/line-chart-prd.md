# Line Chart PRD (Product Requirements Document)
<br>

## Pattern Outcome 
The outcome of this project is to deliver a robust, accessible, and reusable line graph pattern that serves as the foundation for a comprehensive chart library within the Clinical Design System. This pattern will ensure visual consistency, ease of integration, and support for future chart types.
<br>

## Requirements in scope
- **P1:** Must have. Prioritized into scope.  
- **P2:** not in scope. Can be a post-MVP enhancement or contributed back by product teams.
- **P3:** not in scope. May not be a candidate for the pattern design and more appropriate as an enhancement in the consumer's product UX instead.
