# Precision Oncology Initiative
Precision Oncology is a national program to find “biomarkers” on cancer cells, targeting patients with advanced stage cancer.  

# About the Product
## North Star Goal 
It aims to help providers match eligible patients with new research therapies for their cancer treatment. 

## User Problem Statement
Provider (any oncologist at the VA) sends tissue or blood samples to lab. Lab sends back a PDF report to the provider that ordered it, which is currently uploaded into the patient's EHR after 6-8 weeks. On the PDF, some precision treatment suggestions are notes (but difficult to find in the PDF). If no precision treatments are available, providers go with conventional treatments.

### What We're Working On

Precision Oncology completed its early discovery phase (including stakeholder interviews, understanding of current workflow and needs), and is finalizing preliminary validation of that discovery. An immediate need for shoring up vendor results integration was identified so the engineering team will start work on that in Q1 2023. This will help create a standardized workflow that the future work of alerting for future therapies can be built upon.
