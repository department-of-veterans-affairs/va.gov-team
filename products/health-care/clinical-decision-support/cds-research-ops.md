## Research Checklist
While the details of each step may differ based on the type of research being conducted, this checklist provides a genearl overveiew of the work that needs to be completed and can serve as a basis for covering research related tasks.

1. **Planning for research:**  
   - Check if any related research exists in the OCTO GitHub Research Repository. Filter using keywords and labels or use GitHub co-pilot to help you search. Labels specific to CDS research include: AUD:clinicians, PRDT:clinical decision support
   - Write your research plan and guide.
   - Create stimuli
   - Get peer reviews and run a pilot session.
2. **Recruitment and Scheduling** 
   - Prep and modify outreach templates
   - Identify potential participants
   - Send emails
   - Create MS Teams event for remote sessions
3. **Conduct Sessions** 
   - Prep and modify outreach templates
   - Identify potential participants
   - Send emails
4. **Synthesize Data** 
5. **Share and document research**
6. **Research close-out**
  

## Handling Sensitive Information
> [!NOTE]
> Sensitive information includes **both** the PHI and PII of a veteran patient, as well as the PHI and PII of our research participant. Because we do not get informed consent from the patient to record their PHI and PII, we **do not record research sessions** where a patient's PHI/PII may be shown on the screen when we are observing how a clinician is interacting with tools, even though MS Teams is an approved tool for sharing sensistive information. 

*List the research questions that guided this study.*  

* Question 1
* Question 2
* Question 3

[Example Research Questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-questions)

## Research Planning 

*Provide a brief description of the research methods used (e.g., usability testing, interviews).*  

- Method 1: Description  
- Method 2: Description

> [!TIP]
> Write your research plan and conversation guide using Mural or Slack Canvas templates until they are finalized and ready to publish in GitHub templates (see Share and document research section).

[Example Methodology](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#methodology)


## Recruitment and Scheduling
While the make-up of research participants may vary based on the product's target user group (such as primary care physicians or LCS coordinators), every research study should strive to include a 50/50 split between CPRS and Oracle Health EHR users and as we are getting started, a minimum of 1 Oracle Health EHR user. Unless the product being researched will never be used by both EHRs.

### Recruitment Channels 
1. **CDS Research Participant Database**  
   - The CDS Reserach Participant Database is connected to an MS Form that allows clinicians to self select to sign-up to be contacted for user research. It also includes staff who were manually added who we connected with through other channels.
   - [Link to research participant database](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/jana_smith-post_va_gov/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7Be5dac0d3-c637-463a-99d2-fcd508feb6be%7D&action=edit&activeCell=%27Sheet1%27!M123&wdinitialsession=1ac6a8c9-c283-7ee6-84e4-39363ae877d0&wdrldsc=3&wdrldc=1&wdrldr=AccessTokenExpiredWarningUnauthenticated%2CRefreshin)
> [!NOTE]
> The research participant database includes PII and access to the database must be limited to adhere to VA privacy policies and Labor Relations agreements. Therefore, to protect PII, access is provided to those who will need to interact with the data and research activities (HDC team members) and assist in maintaining data (Shared Support Services).
2. **Clinical Business Owner & SMEs**  
   - The clinical business owner and stakeholder of a particular product or integration along with SMEs can be a good source for clinical contacts to add to the CDS research participant pool.
3. **Snowball Recruitment**
   - Ask clinicians and staff you already are connected with to share the research participant sign-up form with their colleagues. 

> [!NOTE]
> It is important not to over contact from our limited participant pool. Therefore, we have a soft-limit for contact frequency. Do not contact a participant for more than 1 study every 2 months. For example, if a clinician participated in something in September, don't reach out again until November. Use your judgement based on the rapport you have with a participant to decide if additional outreach would be OK. You can also ask another researcher if they have a sense of how much a particular clinician likes to engage.

#### Maintaining the CDS Research Participant Database

<details>

**Syncing and Updating**
- The database is synced to the sign-up form which covers the blue columns. The yellow-orange columns are not associated with form fields and are for our own notes and management purposes.
- While the database syncs to the sign-up form, it does not overwrite changes to any of the blue columns. For example, if a user marked CPRS as their EHR and then they migrated to Oracle Health, we can change the cell to Oracle Health and it will not revert back to CPRS when syncing. The syncing process looks for new records and adds them to the bottom of the list.
- Only one submission is allowed per VA email. Therefore HCD pratitioners need to manually add new particpants directly into the spreadsheet. Check first to ensure the participant is not already in the database. Duplicates will arise only from manual entires.
- All CDS HCD practitioners should add their own contacts to the database and update "last contacted" when contacting participants to participate in studies.
- "Last contacted" column ensures we are not contacting participants for multiple studies at the same time. Use only MM/YYYY format so we do not create an opportunity for people to be connected to specific studies.
- Soft limit: do not contact a participant for more than 1 study every 2 months. So if they participated in something in September, don't reach out again until November. Use your judgement based on the rapport you have with a participant to decide if additional outreach would be OK. You can also ask another researcher if they have a sense of how much a particular clinician likes to engage.
- For research participants who no longer want to be contacted, mark "No" in the "Agree to Participate" column.
- This research participant database should **NOT** be used as a study level participant tracker. We do not want to be able to connect the dots of participants to quotes or comments to maintain participant's anonymity.
- Study level trackers should be created in the VA space but on the researcher's personal OneDrive (not in a shared team drive) and shared with either the HCD lead or another HCD member to have one backup person with access. [Here is an example template that can be copied for individual use.](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/CDSProgramTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCB1A98E8-3826-46BD-9279-CBCC5D8149CF%7D&file=CDSC%20Research%20Participant%20Study%20Tracker.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

**Database Access**
- Program and Product leads should only have access by request if they need to interact with the data and research activities (such as doing recruitment). 
- Other staff and projects conducting research in support of understanding the clinical experience and building clinical decision support tools may need either a participant list to help with their recruitment efforts or access to the database depending on the frequency of the need. 
- All requests beyond the CDS Collaborative HCD members should be sent to and approved by the VA HCD lead
- Members who no longer need access should be removed. 
- Shared support services owns the database (can add/remove permissions)

**Sharing the sign-up form**

- Do not mass email [this sign-up form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=Ixtf6a-r7kWCHberJRqzvwJmS8KCiL9DiWDzYKVU_XFUQUVLTjNNUjNPSDc3MkVNUjE2M0pERUtaOS4u&origin=lprLink&route=shorturl) to distribution lists, however, you can put the link in your email signature or share directly with other clinicians to pass along to their colleagues.

### Outreach & Scheduling  
The following templates can be used and modified to fit the purpose of your outreach to clinicians when recruiting participants for HCD research.

When connecting with clinicians, it's important to:

- identify who we are
- share how we got their contact information
- highlight the purpose of the research
- let them know that their participation is voluntary and their responses are kept confidential and their anonymity is protected
- give them a way to opt out of future outreach for research activities

> [!TIP]
> Start recruitment about 2-4 weeks out from your first session. Send outreach emails in batches. Start with emailing 4-6 potential candidates. Every 24-48 hours, email about 2-3 more until you reach your target number of participants.

**Cold outreach**

Hello, [Clinician name]

My name is [researcher name] and I’m part of a team of contractors working with the Clinical Decision Support Collaborative (CDSC) in partnership with the Veteran’s Health Administration (VHA) and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). 

Together, we are working to improve clinical decision support (CDS) tools that are available within the VA to help clinicians provide best in class care for Veterans. 

We are working on a project to [insert your project area or application name] that are available nationally to VA clinicians from the CDS platform. We are inviting you, as a clinician who works in [insert area], to help us identify the most needed calculators and risk assessments as well as provide feedback on designs and workflows. We received your email and job title from [insert how we got their contact info]  for the purposes of this research and do not have access to any other information about you personally or your employment with VA. 

Your choice to participate is completely voluntary. We will share our learnings within the CDS Collaborative in the form of aggregated information or anonymized quotes. Your responses will remain confidential and your anonymity protected.

If you are interested in participating, please [insert next step].  If you are interested in participating, but not available for this session, please keep an eye out for future opportunities. If you are not interested in participating and do not want to be contacted about any future design research sessions, please respond to this email indicating that so I can make note in our database. If you are aware of other colleagues who may be interested in participating in this type of activity, please share [this sign-up form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=Ixtf6a-r7kWCHberJRqzvwJmS8KCiL9DiWDzYKVU_XFUQUVLTjNNUjNPSDc3MkVNUjE2M0pERUtaOS4u&origin=lprLink&route=shorturl) with them!

Thank you for your time!

Cheers,

[researcher name]
