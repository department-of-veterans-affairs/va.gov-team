## Research Checklist
*What steps are involved in the user research process?*  
1. **Planning for research:**  
   - Check if any related research exists in the OCTO GitHub Research Repository. Filter using keywords and labels or use GitHub co-pilot to help you search. Labels specific to CDS research include: AUD:clinicians, PRDT:clinical decision support
   - Write your research plan and guide.
   - Create stimuli
   - Get peer reviews and run a pilot session.
2. **Recruitment and Scheduling** 
   - Prep and modify outreach templates
   - Identify potential participants
   - Send emails
   - Create MS Teams event for remote sessions
3. **Conduct Sessions** 
   - Prep and modify outreach templates
   - Identify potential participants
   - Send emails
4. **Synthesize Data** 
5. **Share and document research**
6. **Research close-out**
  

## Handling Sensitive Information
> [!NOTE]
> Sensitive information includes **both** the PHI and PII of a veteran patient, as well as the PHI and PII of our research participant. Because we do not get informed consent from the patient to record their PHI and PII, we **do not record research sessions** where a patient's PHI/PII may be shown on the screen when we are observing how a clinician is interacting with tools, even though MS Teams is an approved tool for sharing sensistive information. 

*List the research questions that guided this study.*  

* Question 1
* Question 2
* Question 3

[Example Research Questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-questions)

## Research Planning 

*Provide a brief description of the research methods used (e.g., usability testing, interviews).*  

- Method 1: Description  
- Method 2: Description

> [!TIP]
> Write your research plan and conversation guide using Mural or Slack Canvas templates until they are finalized and ready to publish in GitHub templates (see Share and document research section).

[Example Methodology](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#methodology)


## Recruitment

*List hypotheses explored in the research and the conclusions drawn. If applicable, list the success or task completion rate.*

> [!TIP]
> Place true or false statements in bold for easier scanability

- **Hypothesis Statement:** [Insert statement]  
  - **"Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”**  
  - Supporting evidence  

[Example Hypotheses and Conclusions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)


## Conduct User Sessions

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

> [!TIP] 
> Write findings as stand-alone insights that are easy to scan. For example:  
> - "Most participants used the search field to locate forms, often searching for 'veteran health.'"  
> - "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form."  

[Example Key Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)

1. Finding one
1. Finding two
1. Finding three
1. Finding four
1. Finding five
1. Finding six
1. Finding seven

## Synthesis

*Provide detailed descriptions and supporting evidence for each key finding.*  

### Finding 1

## Share and document research
*Include insights that do not represent patterns but are still valuable.*  
> **TIP:** These could be powerful user comments or unexpected issues worth noting


## Research close-out

*Summarize actionable recommendations based on findings.*
