# Research Plan for VA Coronavirus Volunteer List Survey  September 23rd, 2020

 

## Goals     

\1. What product & team are you doing this research for?

 

Team:
 Veterans Health Administration

Office of Research Protections, Policy and Education (ORPP&E)

VA Coronavirus Volunteer List Survey
 
 Product:

A VSignals survey (built on Medallia platform) to understand the experience of Veterans who have considered volunteering for a Covid-19 vaccine trials at 3-5 sites (Janssen)

 

\2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 

VSignals is a tool that the Veterans Experience Office has built on the Medallia platform to gather near-real time customer experience (CX) feedback. The Veterans Experience Office regularly deploys CX surveys for various service lines within the enterprise, VHA, and VBA. Most of these CX surveys are focused on Veteran experience, with a few focused on the experience of VA stakeholders. CX surveys start with identifying the moments in an experience that matter most to Veterans and writing questions that align with OMB A-11 circular guidelines. A key part of designing surveys that resonate with Veterans is testing and validating the survey questions with Veterans prior to launch.

 

Question testing and validation with Veterans is not focused on usability of the surveys themselves, but rather clarity and comprehension of the questions.

      

\3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?      

We will test survey questions with Veterans to gauge clarity and comprehension, and refine questions iteratively.

\1.   Do Veterans understand what each survey question is asking them about? If not, how might we re-word it to arrive at the desired understanding?

\2.   Are there any questions that do not add value on the survey?

\3.   Are there any questions that would add value and are missing?[AL1] 

 

\4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?      

\1.   Survey questions will need to be refined for Veteran clarity and comprehension

 

## Method   

\1. What method of research are you planning?  

 

 

Remotely-moderated interviews with Veterans where they have a PDF of the survey wireframes [AL2] in front of them to guide the conversation.

      

\2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 

This approach will allow us to iterate on the survey questions quickly with frequent input from Veterans.

      

\3. Where are you planning to do your research?

Remote

 

\4. What will you be testing? (Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)  

Customer experience survey wireframes.

 

\5. If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Pergiean offers: Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)     

Conference Dial-in Number provided by research team:

1-800-300-3070

Access Code: 642 570 139[AL3] 

 

## Participants and Recruitment  

\1. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant? 

(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements[[EE4] , the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)

 

Recruit 13 Veterans. (Assuming 3 no-shows, that is 10 Veterans.)



[AL5] 

Screening Questions:

·    Have you ever volunteered for a VA research study or a trial?

o  Please record their answer to this question and document somewhere to share with the research team. 

·    Have you ever volunteered for a research study or trial outside the VA?

o  Please record their answer to this question and document somewhere to share with the research team.

·    Can you access a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet with an internet connection? 

o  If no, then DO NOT recruit.[AL6] 

·    Language: Must be fluent in spoken English so the researchers can communicate with them.

 

Discharge date: A roughly 50/50 split (± 20%) between:

·    Discharge date is before 1990

·    Discharge date is 1990 or later

 

Demographics:

·    Rationale: Roughly mirror the general Veteran population, and over-sample largest minority groups based on the national Veteran population model: https://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/Demographics/New_Vetpop_Model/Vetpop_Infographic_Final31.pdf

·    Oversample minority groups 

o  Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander

·    Gender

o  4 or more women

o  8 or more men

·    Race and Ethnicity

o  2 or more Black or African American

o  2 or more Hispanic

o  5 or more White

 

Geography: Participants that represent geographic diversity across the US; please make sure participants are not focused in just one area of the US (i.e., northwest only)

      

\2. What is your recruitment strategy?  

Please recruit via the existing recruiting contract.      

 

## When?    

\1. Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?   

October 1, 2020 – October 6, 2020

We understand this is a short timeline, but there are constraining factors here beyond our control. Please let us know if this timeline causes any risks to recruiting at least 10 Veterans.

 

\2. Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Monday, September 28th, 2020

      

\3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)  

30 minutes

 

\4. Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.    
 Our goal is to speak to 13 Veterans (assuming some no-shows) within the research time frame (10/1/2020 – 10/6/2020)

Please allow at least 15 minutes between each 30-minute session.

Thursday, October 1: 11:45 – 2pm ET

Friday, October 2: 11:45 – 5pm ET

Monday, October 5: 12 – 5pm ET

Tuesday, October 6: 11 – 1:30 pm ET


 

\5. Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? [[EE7]       

Monday, September 28, 2020 (preferably between 2pm and 5pm ET)

Ellie Eberts and Kt Gregory can serve as the POCs for the pilot: Ellen.Eberts@va.gov  and Katherine.Gregory@va.gov 

 

Additional recruiting requests:

·    Confirm in advance that each Veteran participant has access to a computer, laptop, or tablet with connection to the internet

·    To reduce the no-show rate, please do the following:

o  Confirm each interview with the Veteran participant 24 hours in advance

o  Text or email a reminder to each Veteran participant the morning of their interview

§ Call the Veteran to confirm if you do not hear back

 [AL1]How do you plan to evaluate this during the session? 



 [AL2]I would recommend that you pull the survey up on YOUR screen (moderator) and share it with them. 



 [AL3]Please pick one of these three tools: Webex, Zoom, or GoToMeeting. Our team will provide you with access to the account login information and will send the details to the participants. 



 [[EE4]Please let me know if any requirement or combination poses a risk to recruitment. The timeline is more important than these precise criteria, with a few exceptions.



 [AL5]If you are looking for a min of 10, I’d recommend recruiting a min of 15. 



 [AL6]We can share the screener responses with you. 



 [[EE7]Is a pilot necessary given the low technical complexity?
