 Survey Question Validation SOP 

 

Validation Dimensions

1. Comprehension – language choice, interpretation of words and question, syntax

2. Clarity – ambiguous meanings, alternate meanings, relevance

3. Accuracy – users’ language, naming conventions, bias reduction

4. Relevance – does the question relate to the users’ lived experience?

 

Note-taking

1.   Notes should be taken in a word document, should not include any PII/PHI, and should be saved at this link:

2.   The note-taker should document Veteran comments and proposed re-writes of any questions

3.   Additional contextual information should be applied to raw notes to ensure that Veteran sentiment, meaning, and understanding are fully represented. Brackets [] should surround additional information provided by the interviewers, while ellipsis […] should be used to remove unimportant, repetitive, or non-topical information from quotes.

 

Pre-Interview

\1.   Confirm Veteran code (Vet-XX) in the calendar invite and navigate to appropriate tab in the raw data spreadsheet [Link removed] on BAHSP. A tab has been created for each interview, and tabs are color-coded by date

\2.   Open survey question wireframes to share screen with the Veteran – if needed (because they are unable to open them from their email)

 

During Interview

1. Introduce     yourself and the team members on the call 
2. Confirm that     participant has received and is viewing the email with the attached     consent form and survey questions
3. Gain consent
4. 1. Did you see      consent form?
   2. Provide      Veteran with verbal overview of consent, ensure that the interview has no      impact or harm to the Veteran’s benefits
   3. Confirm with      the Veteran - “Do you understand what we’re asking?”
5. Introduce     the questions
6. 1. We’re      not asking you to take the survey, but we want to know if the questions      make sense and are relevant to your experience with VA. We’re not testing      you; we’re testing the questions themselves.
   2. Feel      free to be brutally honest; you won’t hurt our feelings and there will be      no consequences for you.
   3. For      each survey question, we ask that you read the question aloud and then      tell us your initial thoughts before moving on to the next question.

                        i.   For example, we will ask you to tell us what you think this question is trying to ask 

                       ii.   Then, we may ask if there is anything you would like to change about the question. 

1. 1. At the end,      we’ll ask you about the whole list of questions globally.
2. Work     through individual questions
3. 1. In      your own words, what is this question trying to ask?
   2. Is      there anything you would change about this question?
   3. How      might you rephrase this question?
4. Global review
5. 1. What comes to      mind when you hear to term “same day service”? 

                        i.   What would you say instead to mean a service you receive the same day it was requested?

·   Are there any questions you would remove?

·   Are there any question we didn’t ask related to your experience?

1. Close out the     call and thank them for their time

 

Post-Interview – must be completed by COB each day

1. Take 15     minutes after the session to de-brief with your teammate. In raw data     spreadsheet [Link removed] complete the     following for each question:
2. 1. Column D      “Team Notes” – Reflect on and discuss the user’s feedback and document      observations, potential testing points, potential changes
   2. Column E      “Overall Survey Score” – Assign an overall score to each question

                        i.   0 – Fail

                       ii.   1 – Pass with struggle

                      iii.   2 – Pass with no struggle
