# Research Plan for Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) Team, Form 10-10D, December 2023

## Background
This research is to be conducted on a protoype of [Form 10-10D](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-10-10d/), which is a component of the application for [CHAMPVA benefits](https://www.va.gov/health-care/family-caregiver-benefits/champva/). At the time this research plan is being written, Form 10-10D is a fillable PDF that applicants must print and mail in. The overall goal of the [project](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/1010D/product-outline.md) is to create a fully digitized form that Veterans and/or family members can use to streamline their application process.

The purpose of this research is to explore the usability of our prototyped Form 10-10D and identify opportunities to improve the experience. Based on participant feedback, we will iterate on the prototype and implement it on va.gov.

### OCTO Priorities 
1. Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
2. Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy

### Veteran Journey
- Putting down roots
  - Moment: taking care of my family

## Research Goals	
The goals of this research are to:

1. Determine whether or not the flow and copy in the 10-10D prototype are usable and understandable for those filling out the form on their own behalf and those filling it out for someone else
2. Determine whether or not the flow and copy are usable and understandable for participants who do have other forms of health insurance and those who don't have other forms of health insurance
3. Determine whether or not the prototype is usable and understandable in both an authenticated and unauthenticated state

### Research questions
1. Are participants able to use and understand the partially pre-populated form as an authenticated user?
2. Are participants able to use and understand the form as an unauthenticated user?
3. Are participants able to use and understand the form when filling it out for themselves and when filling it out for someone else?
4. Are participants able to easily add more than one applicant for the form?
5. What are opportunties to streamline the flow and make the form feel less redundant for users?
6. Are participants able to easily understand how to upload supplementary documents and why they're being asked for those documents?
7. Do participants who have other health insurance understand why are asked to fill out additional information and add additional documents?
8. What is the overall sentiment about the experience?

### Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- Understanding why they're being asked for certain information, including:
	- Sponsor's date of death
 	- Whether the Sponsor died during service
 	- Contact information 
- Redundancy of information, such as asking for an address, email address, and phone number for each applicant
- Understanding their progress through the form
- Understanding to correctly report other insurance information

### Outcome
The findings from this research will: 
- Provide insights needed to iterate upon and refine our initial prototype of Form 10-10D
- Demonstrate where copy needs to be rewritten to enhance clarity

## Methodology	
**Usability study**

A usability study will be conducted remotely via Zoom using the Perigean contract. A remote moderator will begin with introduction questions about their experience with applying for benefits. They will then be asked to complete a series of tasks on a Figma prototype.

Participants will be showed one of the following four flows:
1. An authenticated experience where the user has additional health insurance to report
2. An authenticated experience where the user does not have additional health insurance to report
3. An unauthenticated experience where the user has additional health insurance to report
4. An unauthenticated experience where the user does not have additional health insurance to report

Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the flow. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

### [WIP] Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## [WIP] Participants and Recruitment	

### [WIP] Recruitment approach
Our intended audience is Veterans, spouses of Veterans, and family Caregivers for Veterans. Participants will be recruited by Perigean.

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### [WIP] Recruitment criteria
We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 15 full sessions. Therefore, we request that 20 sessions be scheduled.

**[WIP] Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- User groups:
	- At least 7 Veterans
	- At least 13 spouses of Veterans or family caregivers
- Device
	- 25% on phone or tablet
 	- 75% on desktop	  

What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**[WIP] Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## [WIP] Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### [WIP] Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### [WIP] Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### [WIP] Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### [WIP] Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## [WIP] Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
