1
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:09.320
Renata: Alright. I have started the recording. So I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.660
P5: Yes, I am.

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:20.360
Renata: Are you okay, and are you comfortable? If we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion to share with our Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.360
P5: Yes, I'm I'm okay with that.

5
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:33.929
Renata: Okay? All right, let's get this party started. So before we look at the demo tool, I have a few questions for you. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

6
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.359
P5: No, I have not.

7
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.000
Renata: Okay. Any reason why not?

8
00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:42.389
P5: I didn't really know about it. I didn't.

9
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.739
P5: I've heard of CHAMPVA, but I don't really know what it is, and so I, and I don't.

10
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.280
P5: I don't think I've ever had a reason to apply for it. But I really didn't know what it was.

11
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.119
Renata: Okay, fair enough. Do you think you might apply for CHAMPVA benefits in the future?

12
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.019
P5: Probably not because my wife falls under tricare. So

13
00:01:12.782 --> 00:01:20.930
P5: she gets her medical care through the base hospital, so.

14
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.579
Renata: Got it.

15
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:30.090
P5: If I understand CHAMPVA correctly, it would be for her and I don't. At this point I don't think she would require that.

16
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.190
Renata: Okay, do you have a va.gov account?

17
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.040
P5: Yes.

18
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.509
Renata: And what has been your experience with logging into the site?

19
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.390
P5: It.

20
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.079
P5: It's gotten a lot easier. It was.

21
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.680
P5: It was complicated for a while. When they were switching over

22
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.529
P5: they to to the new website and stuff like that, and also the new ways of signing in. But

23
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.679
P5: generally, now it's it's pretty easy to to get signed in on my computer and on my cell phone.

24
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.339
Renata: Got it, and how often are you logging into va.gov?

25
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.520
P5: Probably at least once a week.

26
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.930
P5: Yeah, at least once a week.

27
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.890
Renata: Okay. And what are you doing on like a a roughly weekly basis when you're logging in?

28
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:50.020
P5: I check for appointments. I will up like prescriptions. I have a lot of prescriptions through the VA. So I go on there to to refill those also. I go on there to look at

29
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.992
P5: like if I've had a test done, or

30
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:11.580
P5: like I get different X-rays or Ct scans, or I get an MRI once a year, and so I will go on and look at those results

31
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.960
P5: from those those tests and a lot of it scheduling because I'm now involved in the whole health

32
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.699
P5: recreational therapy. And it's a there's a lot of scheduling involved in that. So a lot of it's going on there for scheduling.

33
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.669
Renata: Okay, and any issues with any of that? Or is it? Is it pretty straightforward?

34
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:43.339
P5: It's pretty straightforward now, I mean, a couple of years ago it was kind of all jacked up, but they seem to have gotten it straightened up, and so I've been very happy with it for the past at least a year, if not more.

35
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:57.729
Renata: Okay, well, thank you for sharing so for the next portion of our session, we're gonna be looking at that demo tool that I talked about. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen in zoom?

36
00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.950
P5: Yes. Yeah.

37
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:13.279
Renata: Okay, so I'm gonna give you a moment to close any tabs, or anything. But I'm dropping a link in the chat in zoom and when you're ready, go ahead and share your screen.

38
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.875
P5: Alright.

39
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.880
P5: okay.

40
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.309
P5: it's sharing.

41
00:04:40.852 --> 00:04:49.219
Renata: It's sharing zoom. Can you switch it to sharing your browser where you open the link?

42
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.059
P5: Okay, we might have hit my.

43
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.834
P5: what? What? I'm good at here

44
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.060
Renata: Do you have the link open in another browser window?

45
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.010
P5: Okay,

46
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.430
P5: you know, I used to know how to do this.

47
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.169
Renata: Let's see if can you go down to the zoom, chat and click on the link that I shared? And we'll see if it just opens up in.

48
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.660
Renata: Yeah, if you click that and then click there.

49
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.700
Renata: let's see if it just shows it to us.

50
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.140
Renata: It did. Okay, yeah.

51
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.519
P5: Alright, oops! I'm sorry. I just exited out of that. Okay.

52
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.850
Renata: Okay, perfect. Alright it.

53
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:16.780
Renata: Now we're cooking! So a few things before you start filling out this form to be aware of. So like, I said before, this is a demo testing site. So we're not. And we're also not submitting anything today. But you don't have to worry about any of the information we're going to be inputting in the form going anywhere, and nothing you click on is gonna have any bearing on your Va benefits.

54
00:06:17.402 --> 00:06:26.140
Renata: As you go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, such as social security numbers. If you don't feel comfortable using real information.

55
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:52.740
Renata: And there's a few places in this form where you may be asked to upload some documents. As we're not submitting the form. And this isn't attached to VA systems. Nothing you upload here is going to be actually sent to the Va. But when we get to those screens that ask for a file, I have a couple of dummy files I can provide to you, or you can just upload a random photo or something that you have on your desktop. I'll ask you when we get there, though, but just giving you a heads up ahead of time. But do you have any questions for me?

56
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.180
P5: No.

57
00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:05.469
Renata: Okay. So to get started without clicking on anything, I'd just like you to take a look at the information on this page and tell us your initial thoughts, questions, reactions that you have.

58
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.420
P5: Well, my 1st thought is it? It looks like a a VA page.

59
00:07:14.437 --> 00:07:19.499
P5: I mean it. It looks like all the other VA pages. So it it's it's got some

60
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.360
P5: familiarity there.

61
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.900
P5: And so if I were looking at this

62
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:35.299
P5: I'm just gonna click out of this thing, I don't know if that there you go so it

63
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.650
P5: it's pretty self explanatory. If I were going to fill this out, I think I would know what to do.

64
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.440
Renata: Okay.

65
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.640
P5: I is that is that what you were looking for?

66
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:59.400
Renata: No, I mean, there's nothing we're looking for in particular. Just you know anything that's jumping out to you, or questions or thoughts you have. But yeah, anything else before we move on to the next question?

67
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.490
P5: No, I mean, I

68
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:29.039
P5: I like the layout because I and I like the fact that the Va. Now lays things out like this because it's easy to understand, and it's, you know, got this step by step thing. So the Va can be very complicated. And so anything they do to make things a little bit easier to understand is is helpful. So if I were coming to this page for the 1st time, I would I would feel comfortable that I knew what to do next.

69
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.270
Renata: Okay.

70
00:08:31.024 --> 00:08:44.740
Renata: and at the top of the page there's 3 little links underneath the dark blue header, they say, va.gov home Ivc Champ, Va. And 1010 d. Extended. What does 1010 d. Extended mean to you? If anything.

71
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.699
P5: Well, you had said that that was the form, and I see down here that that's the VA form. So

72
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.350
P5: I, you know, looking at

73
00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.039
P5: it just tells me that this is the form. I don't know what extended means, but

74
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.250
P5: this tells me that I'm gonna be filling out a form.

75
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.789
P5: The form.

76
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:20.040
Renata: Got it, and if you were on va.gov. Filling this form out for yourself and a spouse or another family member, what research would you do before applying for and completing a form like this?

77
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.709
P5: Well, I would probably go to that "Find out if you're eligible for CHAMPVA benefits."

78
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.749
P5: But again, I think the 1st thing I would do is

79
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:44.269
P5: try to find out more about CHAMPVA, because, like I said, I don't really know what it is other than what y'all have kind of

80
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:50.030
P5: talked about. So if I were on this page, the 1st thing I would do is I would

81
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.940
P5: find out if I was eligible for CHAMPVA benefits, and hopefully, that would

82
00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:04.450
P5: give me some sort of understanding of what CHAMPVA is. But I don't think I would be at this page if I didn't really know what CHAMPVA was.

83
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.160
Renata: That makes sense.

84
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:22.019
Renata: If you we're not gonna click that eligibility link today. But what would you expect to find there like in you know what? What would in an ideal situation. What would you see there that would help you understand your eligibility?

85
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.994
P5: Well, I guess it would be a a list of the

86
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:36.869
P5: different criteria who who this program is for? And again, the specific

87
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:59.309
P5: situation that you have to have in order to qualify for CHAMPVA. So I would expect it to see like, you know, if there's a if there's a certain disability rating, then, you know, do you have this disability rating? And then who is the CHAMPVA for? Is that person a qualified?

88
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.869
P5: contestant, so to speak, I. And so I

89
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:10.570
P5: I'm assuming it would give me a list of things that let me know that lets me know

90
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:15.940
P5: whether I or whoever I'm applying for qualifies for this.

91
00:11:16.835 --> 00:11:19.990
P5: I would probably have looked at.

92
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:29.829
P5: You know we're on the 1010 d. Extended part those 3 hot links up above. I would probably have gone to the

93
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:38.220
P5: link before that the the "Lvc CHAMPVA" link, and I would probably have already looked at that so

94
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.879
P5: that might give me some more information.

95
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:53.569
Renata: Okay. And aside from looking at the eligibility and that earlier link within the hot links at the top of the page, would you do any other research on va.gov or elsewhere on the Internet before filling out a form like this?

96
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:05.529
P5: if I did not it. It depends on what I learned when I click that link about. If you're eligible.

97
00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:08.000
P5: But I don't.

98
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:21.279
P5: I don't think I would be at this page unless I'd already done that research. In other words, I don't think I would come to this page if I did not know I or one of my family members, was already eligible.

99
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.870
P5: If that makes sense.

100
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:38.730
Renata: Yeah, it does. It does. So just based on the information on this page, what do you think you're gonna need to have on hand to be able to fill out this application for you and your spouse or family member?

101
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:42.850
P5: Well,

102
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.319
P5: I mean,

103
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:02.250
P5: It says I'm gonna need personal information, which I pretty much already have that stuff. And then

104
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.820
P5: it says I'm gonna need some supporting documents. So I would click on that

105
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:20.429
P5: link there to find out what documents I need to apply. And I probably already have all those documents, because I apply for a lot of stuff.

106
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:27.650
P5: But yeah, I mean, I would click on that link to find out what documents I needed.

107
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:42.069
Renata: Okay, you mentioned that you apply for a lot of stuff, so you tend to have sort of like personal documents on hand. Are are you talking about like it's already on your computer, or like, would it take you a few minutes to go collect things?

108
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:48.330
P5: It would probably take me a few minutes like if they need, you know, if they need.

109
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:57.609
P5: Well, a lot of them actually already have scanned on my computer like birth certificates or things like that. 

110
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:19.179
P5: I mean, I already have those social security numbers. I already know that stuff, birth dates, contact information. I already know those sorts of things. So and or like it says I'm looking on there. It says proof of school enrollment. Well, I mean, I have a daughter who's still in college. So

111
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.099
P5: I I have that proof because we've been applying for other

112
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.280
P5: things through the VA with her, and so

113
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.740
P5: probably a lot of these documents I already have.

114
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:42.569
P5: and if I don't have them already scanned, I I probably have them close by that I can. I can get them within a few minutes.

115
00:14:43.570 --> 00:15:00.600
Renata: Got it. Okay. One last question before we start filling the form out. So on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly, and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin, based on the information you see on this page?

116
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:10.940
P5: Well.

117
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:23.260
P5: I think I'm you, you said one is poorly so. One is bad, and 5 is great.

118
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.680
Renata: Yeah

119
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:35.089
P5: Okay, yeah. I'm gonna say, 4. And that's only because I'm still not familiar with with entirely with the CHAMPVA program. But

120
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.440
P5: I feel

121
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:45.565
P5: if I were on this page, and I was trying to apply for this right now I would feel very comfortable

122
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:54.259
P5: it starting the process. I this, you know again, this looks very familiar to other VA.

123
00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:21.480
P5: things that I have done. So it's and and it it appears I haven't clicked on those links, but it appears like it has the information. If I need information, it looks like I've got places that I can go to get that, you know the eligibility and then the documents. So I feel confident that I'm ready to go start this application process.

124
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:34.659
Renata: Got it. Thank you for sharing. So I'm gonna have you scroll down towards the bottom of the page in that big blue box. There's a link that says, Start your form without signing in, if you could. Please click that

125
00:16:36.440 --> 00:17:01.359
Renata: all right. So for the purposes of today's session, I'd like you to start the form as if you're applying for your spouse and one other family member, like a dependent son or daughter, and I'll let you know when to pause, and I'll ask you some questions. But to help orient you, we're going to go through the 1st 3 sections of the form. And again, just a quick reminder. None of the information we're putting in here is going to be submitted.

126
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:12.169
Renata: Feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, and as you go through the form, please remember to think out loud. We'd really like to hear any reactions or questions as you're experiencing them.

127
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.130
P5: Okay.

128
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.700
P5: So I'm gonna click here.

129
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.010
P5: I'm sorry I didn't say anything out loud, but that that was all pretty straightforward.

130
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:29.309
Renata: No problem. Anything confusing or coming up for you with this page?

131
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.579
P5: No, no, I'm ready to. I'm ready to go ahead.

132
00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.329
Renata: Alright. Go on, go ahead!

133
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:26.710
Renata: And for this section as a reminder, we'd like you to imagine you're filling this out for both a spouse, and like a 1 other family member, like a dependent.

134
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.520
P5: Yeah, I'm just impressed that you can add up the 25 applicants.

135
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.105
Renata: Oh!

136
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.229
P5: I was trying to imagine a situation where that would.

137
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.900
P5: Okay, so this is the applicant.

138
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.650
P5: And so this is, gonna be my wife.

139
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:31.820
P5: I'm just reading through it, but so far it's all pretty straightforward.

140
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.460
Renata: Okay. Nothing confusing or unusual?

141
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:34.950
P5: No.

142
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.270
Renata: Okay.

143
00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:39.319
Renata: I notice you paused here. Why, why were you pausing for a moment?

144
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.860
P5: Well, I was just. I was just reviewing the information.

145
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.140
Renata: Okay.

146
00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:50.653
P5: And making sure that that was all correct, particularly since I'm not really putting accurate information in there.

147
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.355
P5: It's kind of throwing me off.

148
00:21:53.620 --> 00:22:05.749
Renata: It is a little, it is a little tough, but if you realize, say you got your wife's date of birth wrong at this point, would you know how to go about fixing it before proceeding?

149
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.870
P5: Yeah. And actually, it's funny you say that because I did get it wrong.

150
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:10.554
Renata: Oh!

151
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:19.066
P5: But the 21st it's the 22nd. So, and I was thinking, Well, I'm going to go back and change that. But then I thought, well, we're just.

152
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:26.239
P5: We're not really applying it. But if I would, I would go back and edit it right here. And look, I put the 22nd.

153
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.580
Renata: Oh, interesting!

154
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:32.190
P5: That's weird. I put [MONTH] 22nd, [YEAR].

155
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.890
P5: But

156
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.850
P5: hold on.

157
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.220
P5: And then [MONTH, DAY]. That's it.

158
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.790
Renata: Oh, that is bizarre.

159
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.500
P5: Can't explain that. Yeah.

160
00:22:51.750 --> 00:23:01.730
Renata: You know what that might be, because we're using our our demo tool. There's a couple of little bugs that we might find along the way, and I promise we will not tell your wife. 

161
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:02.979
P5: Well, no, I know if we did.

162
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.411
Renata: It's correct. So.

163
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:11.129
P5: No, we. I know her birthday. That's why I was looking at. And I thought, Well, that's

164
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:32.020
P5: because my dad's birthday is [DATE], and my wife's birthday is [DATE]. So I looked at that. And I was like, I know, I typed that incorrectly so, anyway. But yeah, that's why I pause because I was looking at that. And then I was thinking, oh, I put the wrong birth date in there. But anyway, so I but I'm comfortable with that, and.

165
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:32.530
Renata: Okay.

166
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:39.299
P5: It was all fairly straightforward, and so I'm ready to go forward if that's cool.

167
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:45.870
Renata: Yeah, yeah, go ahead and click yes, for adding another applicant and add just a dependent child. At this point.

168
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:46.740
P5: Okay.

169
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:27.629
Renata: Alright. Anything you mentioned school enrollment when we were looking at that 1st page. Is this what you're kind of expected to see? Or is there anything here that's unexpected?

170
00:25:29.851 --> 00:25:32.979
P5: No, I would expect to see this.

171
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:45.869
P5: I don't have one right now. But but yeah, this was not this would not surprise me at all.

172
00:25:46.220 --> 00:26:04.639
Renata: Okay. And I think you mentioned when we were looking at that 1st page that you'd probably have something of this sort sort of ready to go. It would take you a few minutes to collect it. Once, you see, saw the details of what's needed on this page. Is this something that you do have on hand, or would you need to call your daughter or the school to get a copy of it?

173
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:12.215
P5: Yeah, we would. I would need to get a copy of this, because there.

174
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.729
P5: I mean, they're asking for some very specific information the that

175
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:28.180
P5: I haven't used in other things that I've enrolled. So I would need her to get the

176
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:41.099
P5: the actual letter, so I would not be able to submit this today for her, because I would need to get. I would need to get her to get this letter from from the University.

177
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:53.600
Renata: Got it. So this is one of those screens I mentioned, where we just need to upload a dummy document if you have like a random photo on your desktop. Feel free to upload that, or I can give you a a random document to upload as well.

178
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.930
Renata: and you had one right there, so perfect.

179
00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:03.910
P5: For you, too. Yeah, I don't know what it is, but we'll call it enrollment letter.

180
00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.880
Renata: Alright, go ahead and click the continue.

181
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.730
Renata: Okay. So I'm gonna stop you before we move on to the next section.

182
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.039
P5: It did the same thing with her birthday.

183
00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.640
Renata: Oh, my gosh! It did! Oh, that is so interesting!

184
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.569
P5: Yeah, because there.

185
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.150
Renata: I can't wait to tell our engineers about this.

186
00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.549
P5: I interrupted you.

187
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:43.220
Renata: No, no, I'm sorry. So I have a couple of questions for you for this 1st section. So on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being very hard, and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to fill out this section of the form?

188
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.509
P5: Very easy. 5.

189
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.799
Renata: Okay, and anything in particular that really get made it that 5?

190
00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:59.799
P5: It was I mean, the the questions were all very specific, and the

191
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:12.649
P5: you know it gave me a place to answer, and I was able to put the answer in there. And so it it was easy to understand. It was easy to fill out. And

192
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.399
P5: so yeah, I was very happy with it.

193
00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:32.250
Renata: Okay, thank you for sharing. You mentioned that for other VA Benefits that you've applied for with your daughter. I think education benefits you've had to obtain some sort of proof of enrollment. What's the process been like for doing that for you?

194
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:33.942
P5: Well, it really hasn't.

195
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:42.312
P5: It really hasn't been for me, because I'm not really the one who's applied. She's applied and so

196
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.749
P5: but I've had to help, because

197
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:55.145
P5: if you've never experienced the VA before, it can be very, very complicated. So but like for

198
00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:11.020
P5: what is it, Chapter 35, I think, or 33. I can't remember which one what the number is for the educational benefits that she gets due to my disability rating so

199
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:21.509
P5: that has involved her working with the people at the university. But then, also

200
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:27.950
P5: and I'm trying not to get mixed up about this.

201
00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:34.780
P5: I've had to do some help with showing her how to

202
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.520
P5: do the applications and and and stuff like that.

203
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:49.750
Renata: Okay, got it. Well, thank you for sharing that. I just was curious. So at this time you can click no on other applicants to add, and then hit the continue button.

204
00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:59.200
Renata: Before we proceed with filling out this next section of the form. I'd just like you to take a look at this page, and let me know if anything stands out, or you have any questions.

205
00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:08.320
P5: No, I don't. Nothing.

206
00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.090
P5: I don't have any questions.

207
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.380
Renata: Okay.

208
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.940
P5: Pretty straightforward.

209
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.710
Renata: So what is this section of the form asking you for in your own words?

210
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:28.127
P5: Well, it's asking if any of the applicants have

211
00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.874
P5: are on Medicare. I guess they're on Medicare, or

212
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:43.150
P5: So they're asking, yeah, it's a yes or no question. If either of the 2 applicants are on Medicare.

213
00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:54.849
Renata: Okay. Thinking back to the 1st page that we looked at on this site, do you remember if it asked you to gather any Medicare or health insurance information?

214
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.939
P5: It said something about a health insurance card.

215
00:31:00.645 --> 00:31:01.610
P5: But

216
00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:11.680
P5: I don't recall seeing anything about Medicare, but I'll be honest with you, since we're not quite at the Medicare stage in our lives yet. I really

217
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:16.769
P5: don't pay much attention when I see the word medicare

218
00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:24.870
P5: but I did see the word. I did see that it asked for health insurance cards. I but I didn't recall if it said anything about Medicare.

219
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:41.710
Renata: Okay, that's totally fair. If you were filling this application for CHAMPVA benefits out on va.gov, today, would you need to stop and go collect some health insurance or medicare you mentioned. You're not the Medicare stage, but health insurance information at this point, or would you have that on hand?

220
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.189
P5: I would. I think I would have it on hand.

221
00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.220
Renata: Okay.

222
00:31:49.090 --> 00:32:17.289
Renata: got it. So for this next section of the form, I'd like you to imagine that your spouse and your daughter have both Medicare and Private Health Insurance. I know you just mentioned that you're not at the Medicare stage yet, but for for the purposes of today's session we're just going to imagine. So go ahead and fill this out for Medicare and private health insurance for both your spouse and daughter. And again, if there's any upload screens up, feel free to upload a random image, or I can provide a dummy card for you to upload.

223
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.840
P5: Okay.

224
00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.279
P5: any suggestions on this.

225
00:32:32.845 --> 00:32:38.960
Renata: Which whichever you want to do, but most folks have just hit that a top button, the medicare parts A and B.

226
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.670
P5: I'm just gonna make something up here.

227
00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.130
Renata: Go for it

228
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:36.059
Renata: and for time today you can just hit no on this section.

229
00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:36.850
P5: Okay.

230
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.180
P5: all right.

231
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.999
P5: And you want me to say yes here?

232
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:53.100
Renata: Yes, please, yeah, for your daughter as well.

233
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.090
P5: And you want Medicare. Yes.

234
00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:00.149
Renata: Yes. Please. Yeah.

235
00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.350
P5: Okay.

236
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:45.930
P5: I'm gonna hit...no?

237
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:53.650
Renata: It gonna be annoying and answer your question with a question. Do you think you're gonna hit no, here and keep going anything else that you need to do here?

238
00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:03.410
P5: No, because I've only got 2 people, and I've answered for both of them, and.

239
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:06.470
Renata: All right.

240
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:08.821
Renata: I'll go ahead and click, continue.

241
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:10.899
P5: Any other plans.

242
00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.850
P5: Okay, so did you want me to say yes. Here.

243
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:20.809
Renata: Yes, please. Yeah. You'll add a health insurance plan for both of them.

244
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.289
P5: Well, I'm just gonna hit this one.

245
00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.220
Renata: Okay, that's fair.

246
00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.340
P5: Would you like a yes or a no? Here.

247
00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.240
Renata: Either one is fine.

248
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:52.450
Renata: all right.

249
00:36:52.580 --> 00:37:07.730
Renata: So I'm gonna go ahead and stop you. At this point. We're gonna do that 1 to 5 scale again with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, so how difficult or easy was it to complete the Medicare and Health Insurance section of the form?

250
00:37:09.368 --> 00:37:17.329
P5: Well, it was real easy, for 2 reasons. Number one. The again the layout is pretty intuitive.

251
00:37:17.973 --> 00:37:26.910
P5: and so, and the questions are broken down so that they're easy to answer. It was also easy to answer, because I was making stuff up.

252
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.880
Renata: So.

253
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.529
P5: And and I have to admit I mean I don't.

254
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:40.499
P5: since I don't really have private insurance. This is all an area that I've not dealt with before and medicare same thing. But

255
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:52.120
P5: but yeah, the it was easy to fill out, and I understood the questions, and I understood what it was asking for, and I understood what it was I needed to upload.

256
00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:58.449
Renata: Okay, so on that one to 5 scale. Would you give it a 4 for easy or a 5 for very easy?

257
00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.569
P5: I'd give it a 5 for very easy.

258
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:01.520
Renata: Okay.

259
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:08.359
Renata: thank you for sharing. So you can click no on that question about adding more health insurance plans. And then hit continue.

260
00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:25.380
Renata: So we're not actually going to submit the form today. This is the last screen that we're going to look at without clicking the submit button on this page. I'd like you to. Now review your application for chant. Va. Benefits for your spouse and daughter. Just let me know what what comes up as you're going through this page.

261
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.339
P5: And notice it. Got my birthday correct. So.

262
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.760
Renata: Oh, that's even more interesting.

263
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.410
P5: Right there. It's it's the right day. But

264
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.759
P5: okay, so what did you need me to do? I forgot.

265
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:28.139
Renata: Just wanted you to to review the information so I'm gonna ask you some questions now, unless you have any any questions or or feedback at this point?

266
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:28.860
P5: No.

267
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:45.370
Renata: Okay. So I know we already noticed the the birth dates were wrong for your wife and daughter, and we already talked about that on that review page for applicants. But if, say, you got to this point in the form and hadn't noticed yet, how would you go about editing your spouse's birth date?

268
00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:50.329
P5: Well, they have to edit the the edit link right here for both of them.

269
00:39:50.746 --> 00:40:00.249
P5: so I would go there, and I've seen this on other. I I think I've seen this on other Va ones. So yeah, I would just go here and edit it.

270
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:08.709
Renata: Okay, great. You don't have to click on that today. If you were to submit the form, what would you expect to happen next?

271
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.459
P5: I don't really know, actually.

272
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:28.973
P5: I honestly, yeah, I don't know. I assume that I would get some sort of notification that I'd submitted the form

273
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:35.519
P5: But I don't really know what would happen next.

274
00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:42.690
Renata: Totally fair. Would you expect to get a notification by email by text? A letter in the mail...?

275
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:46.970
P5: I would expect to get a notification by email.

276
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:48.030
Renata: Okay.

277
00:40:48.326 --> 00:40:53.660
P5: But I wouldn't be surprised if I got a letter, because the VA Likes to send out letters.

278
00:40:54.700 --> 00:41:05.150
Renata: Yeah. Yeah. If would you save a copy of the application for your records, or just keep the email? What would be your preference in this situation?

279
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.632
P5: Yeah, I would.

280
00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.450
P5: Well.

281
00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:18.280
P5: once I hit submit form, would it give me an opportunity to save the application.

282
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:24.379
Renata: I'm gonna be annoying again. Is that what you would want to happen when you hit that submit button?

283
00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:37.310
P5: Well, it  would be nice to have a copy of the application and I'm not sure how I would save that I mean I wouldn't like

284
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:42.450
P5: screenshot this page or anything like that. So I'm...

285
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:50.129
P5: I think I would hope that once I submitted it that it would, it would say, you know it would allow me to

286
00:41:50.690 --> 00:42:00.829
P5: keep a copy of it, but if I didn't, then if if that didn't happen, I would expect or hope that I would get something again.

287
00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:04.449
P5: I imagine I would get an email that says

288
00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:13.010
P5: you've submitted this application, and here it is. Here's a Pdf of it. Or, again.

289
00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:20.850
P5: if that didn't happen, I would expect that once I once I hit submit form

290
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:27.270
P5: that there would be a Pdf version of my application, that I could, that I could download.

291
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:37.099
Renata: Okay, got it. And how soon would you expect to be notified about action being taken on your application after you submitted it?

292
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.028
P5: Well, it's the VA, so

293
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:50.990
P5: I would expect anything from 2 weeks to 2 months.

294
00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:57.229
Renata: Okay. And in an ideal world would it be more? The 2 weeks or the the 2 months side of things?

295
00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:04.600
P5: Well in the ideal world it'd be more than 2 weeks, but it's the VA. So I always.

296
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.959
P5: I hope for the best. But

297
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.830
P5: you know, plan for the the longer time.

298
00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:23.330
Renata: Yeah, I totally understand that. So we're done with this section of the session. We're not going to be submitting that form. So you can go ahead and stop screen sharing and close that browser whenever you're ready.

299
00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:26.950
P5: Alright!

300
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:45.529
Renata: I believe the stop screen share should be a little green strip at the top of your screen.

301
00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.190
P5: Oh, there it is! Yes.

302
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:48.880
Renata: There should be a checkbox.

303
00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.410
Renata: There we go.

304
00:43:49.410 --> 00:44:05.900
Renata: all right. So just a few questions before we wrap up. I'm going to ask that one to 5 scale again. So with one being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits that last page that we were looking at.

305
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.690
P5: 5. It was very easy to review.

306
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:10.165
Renata: Okay, got it.

307
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:19.770
Renata: Thank you. So, thinking about the overall experience of filling out the form today, was there anything that you saw in the session that worked really well for you?

308
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:41.830
P5: yes, I most of filling out the form worked really well, because again, it asks for each specific item and then gives me an you know, gives me a place to fill that out, and it gives me plenty of opportunities to edit

309
00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:46.239
P5: if there's a mistake, and it gives me plenty of opportunities to double check

310
00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:53.049
P5: if I have made a mistake and then

311
00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.869
P5: and then go back and correct it. So I

312
00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.890
P5: yeah, I found it very easy to fill out.

313
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:07.489
Renata: Got it. And was there anything that you saw in the form today that was unclear or didn't work well for you?

314
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.589
P5: No, not really

315
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:18.349
P5: If I were applying for CHAMPVA, I would feel very comfortable applying it, using using that process.

316
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:39.580
Renata: Okay. So now that you've gone through the form and knowing what you know now about the questions it's asking and the types of documents it's asking you to upload. Is there any research or additional information that we could provide? You know, earlier on, or that you would tell other veterans that they would need to have on hand in order to fill this form out successfully.

317
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:49.410
P5: Well, I

318
00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:59.739
P5: I don't think there'd be anything special that I would need to tell them, because I think, for example, if somebody who is filling out this form

319
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:12.582
P5: has private insurance or has Medicare. They probably already have those documents that, like the insurance cards and the things they probably already have those things on hand. The

320
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:23.339
P5: So I think most of the stuff that's required is probably things that are easily accessible. Either you already

321
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:40.720
P5: either already have it even might. Maybe you already have it scanned, and if you don't you already you have it nearby, as we saw with this one, with my daughter and her school. That's a form, or that's a piece of paper that I would have to

322
00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.470
P5: stop and go get. But

323
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:53.529
P5: I don't know that you can plan ahead for that, because, it's a it's a very specific

324
00:46:53.720 --> 00:47:01.089
P5: letter that they're asking for with certain specific signatures on it. And so I don't know that that's the kind of thing that you

325
00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:15.219
P5: would have just laying around. I think that's the kind of thing document that you have to go get specially for this this process, but everything else seems to me like things that people would already have. And so it.

326
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:22.229
P5: If I were filling this out. I could probably do it. At one. Sit down

327
00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:32.169
P5: in most cases, except, of course, because of the the educational thing. But even then that would just be a

328
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.969
P5: once I needed to get that.

329
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:40.439
P5: Once I had that in my hand, then I could easily finish this finish this form, so

330
00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.520
P5: I don't know that I would be able to tell anybody

331
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:48.750
P5: what they needed to do ahead of time other than just read the

332
00:47:49.760 --> 00:48:01.140
P5: what the requirements are, and make sure that they have those documents on hand. But again, anybody who's dealt with the VA. Is probably going to have those documents on hand already. Most of them.

333
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:12.859
Renata: Got it. Thank you. What are your thoughts about the amount of information or explanations that you saw provided in the form? Was it not enough? Just the right amount, too much?

334
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:20.240
P5: I thought it was the right amount, and then I felt like it

335
00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.120
P5: It

336
00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:43.499
P5: allowed me to go get, you know, with the with the the links in there. If I needed more information I could get, I could, you know, go get more information using those links, but I felt like the information that was presented was was the right amount, for.

337
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:46.320
P5: you know, processing the form.

338
00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:53.299
Renata: Got it. Just before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me?

339
00:48:54.736 --> 00:48:57.283
P5: No, I don't.

340
00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.300
P5: I just want to say that I

341
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:13.960
P5: I've been very impressed with how the VA has been working on their website because I was using, you know, I was trying to use it 8 years ago, and it was not very easy to use. And so it is much improved over those

342
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:17.370
P5: over over the past 10 years that I've been using it.

343
00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:39.660
Renata: Well, thank you. We really appreciate that feedback and also appreciate you taking time with the session. And we really can't do it without the input. From what of veterans like you? I want to circle back and just reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va. Partners, with all of your personal and identifying information removed.

344
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:40.980
P5: Yes, I am.

345
00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:45.900
Renata: Are there any portions of the discussion today that you would not want shared in a clip?

346
00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.899
P5: No, you're you're free to share anything.

347
00:49:50.080 --> 00:50:02.369
Renata: Okay. Well, I really appreciate you taking time out of your day to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is really important to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans.

348
00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:21.089
Renata: Lastly, Perigian is going to be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to any veterans you know. It provides them a chance to sign up and participate in future research studies like this one. And with that, Jeff, thank you and have a fabulous rest of your day and week. And yeah, take care.

349
00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:25.210
P5: Well, thank you very much, and I wish all of you all a very good afternoon.

350
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:26.999
Renata: Thank you so much. Take care!

351
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:27.780
P5: Bye-bye.

352
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.620
Renata: Bye.
