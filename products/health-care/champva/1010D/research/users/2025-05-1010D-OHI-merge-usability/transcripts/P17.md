1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
Renata: There it is.

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.240
Renata: Okay. I have started the recording. I just - 

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.439
P17: Do I need to hit this "Okay" button? An okay button popped up on my screen.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.369
Renata: Oh, yeah, definitely, you can hit that "Okay" button. It's not gonna close you out or anything.

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.200
P17: Okay.

6
00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:22.169
Renata: So I'd just like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.140
P17: Yes.

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:32.650
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you.

9
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.570
P17: Yes.

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:43.260
Renata: Thank you. All right, before we start looking at that tool. Let's just start with a few questions. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

11
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.680
P17: Yes, and I told them I have CHAMPVA.

12
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.849
Renata: Oh, great! How long ago did you apply for the CHAMPVA program?

13
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.500
P17: Oh, probably 3 years ago.

14
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:13.719
Renata: 3 years ago. All right. Did anyone such as a Veterans Service Organization, a family member or friend help you fill out the application for CHAMPVA?

15
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.540
P17: Well, I went to the-

16
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.160
P17: No, I filled it out myself. Then I had to go to the building in downtown [city]

17
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.950
P17: where it was housed, and they gave me the information for the card and all that.

18
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.240
Renata: Okay, was this a VA building by chance that you visited?

19
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.629
P17: No, I think it was the VA is housed in there. There's a part American Legion.

20
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.140
P17: The FBI might be in there.

21
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.920
Renata: Okay.

22
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.650
P17: I mean, it's a government building definitely.

23
00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.199
Renata: Okay, got it. And aside from yourself, is anyone else in your household currently enrolled in the CHAMPVA program?

24
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.900
P17: No.

25
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.605
Renata: Okay.

26
00:02:03.587 --> 00:02:14.589
Renata: Do you recall if you ever had to fill out a form called the Other Health Insurance Certification, otherwise known as Form 10-7959c?

27
00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:21.670
P17: I don't actually remember the name of the form, but I did have to tell

28
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.880
P17: the people that I had Medicare and [supplemental insurance provider].

29
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.610
Renata: Got it. 

30
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.899
P17: CHAMPVA is like my 3rd insurance.

31
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.704
Renata: Okay. So just to confirm, you have medicare and another health insurance?

32
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.820
P17: Supplemental.

33
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.840
Renata: Okay, alright. Got it, and you were asked to provide that information when you applied for CHAMPVA?

34
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.000
P17: Yes.

35
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.610
Renata: Okay. And you've not had to update that information like none of your health insurance provider information has changed?

36
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.119
P17: No, no! It stayed the same.

37
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:07.650
Renata: Okay, so from what you've mentioned about filling out the application, it sounds like you did it on paper, and then took it in person to submit it; is that understanding correct?

38
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.240
P17: That's what I'm believing occurred. Yes.

39
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.730
Renata: Okay, like, I said, we're not testing your knowledge or abilities. So just trying to understand the broad strokes of how

40
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:26.789
Renata: people enroll in the program. Do you remember if there was anything confusing about the application process or frustrating?

41
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.499
P17: Not with that application. No, I not anything that I can recall.

42
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:48.969
Renata: Okay, and have you ever submitted any medical claims like by form to the CHAMPVA program, or have your medical providers done all of the claims?

43
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.090
P17: The

45
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.310
P17: The medical providers and the pharmacy do all of that.

46
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.990
Renata: Okay, you've never, never, just submitted any?

47
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.380
P17: And then.

48
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.330
Renata: Okay.

49
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.740
P17: No.

50
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.860
Renata: Got it. Just a couple more questions for you. Do you have a va.gov account?

51
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.339
P17: That's where you use the MyHealtheVet?

52
00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:10.930
Renata: Yes. Yeah.

53
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.800
P17: Oh yes!

54
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.665
Renata: Okay

55
00:04:13.602 --> 00:04:17.590
Renata: And what has been your experience with logging into the site?

56
00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.649
P17: That is very frustrating, and

57
00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:33.109
P17: I am used to EPIC with [hospital system] and Metro and hospitals in our area, and it was so simple.

58
00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.609
P17: And where I get so frustrated [with MyHealtheVet], it was with the

59
00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:45.029
P17: trying to find lab results, tests or X-ray results.

60
00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:50.349
P17: And I just went online. Maybe

61
00:04:51.019 --> 00:05:13.709
P17: a few 2 weeks ago with [name]. Now I finally saw that they have the lab tests where you can actually see the name of the test. It doesn't say serum. It doesn't say plasma, because we used to have to scroll through all those tests just to find the results we were looking for.

62
00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:29.009
P17: So maybe with this new update that they did, that you're now needing to use login.gov. This changed things, but I repeatedly, when they would ask for suggestions would tell them how hard it is to navigate this.

63
00:05:29.109 --> 00:05:35.929
P17: and I'm a registered nurse, and for me I still have my wits about me.

64
00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:47.959
P17: [Name] sits with me, but there is no no way in the world that he would be able to do this at all. He couldn't order medications online. He couldn't do anything with it.

65
00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:49.089
P17: So if it was.

66
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.270
Renata: [Name] is your husband?

67
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.619
P17: Terry. Yes, that's who I'm the caregiver of.

68
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.760
Renata: Okay.

69
00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:18.500
Renata: got it. I'm really sorry to hear that it's been frustrating to use it. But I really appreciate you sharing your experiences with us. It's the best way for us to be able to get feedback to make the experiences better. So thank you for sharing. So it sounds like you're frequently logging into MyHealtheVet to look for appointments information and test results. Is that accurate?

70
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.449
P17: That's that's the biggest thing. Or to send a message to a provider.

71
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.850
Renata: Okay. And how often would you say, are you logging into va.gov?

72
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.400
P17: Several times a month.

73
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:35.580
Renata: Okay.

74
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.317
Renata: Alright, that's fair.

75
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:43.190
P17: Not many, if not more, the appointments and lab work or tests that are done.

76
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.950
Renata: Okay

77
00:06:44.722 --> 00:07:02.399
Renata: So those are all of my questions. So we're gonna move to the next portion of our our session, where we're going to look at that demo tool. Are you comfortable? If I was to give you a link to share your screen? Or would you prefer that I share my screen, and you can just look at the tool. We can do it either way. I want to check to see what you're comfortable with.

78
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:10.040
P17: Well, I'm always afraid I'm gonna lose, lose the person I'm talking to, if you send me a link

79
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.520
P17: and I click on that I'm not going to lose you. That's my fear.

80
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:29.890
Renata: Okay, I'm perfectly happy to share my my screen. And so you can just look at it. I'm gonna be asking you questions, and we'll sort of fill the form out online together. And that way, you don't have to worry about like dropping the call. Does that sound good?

81
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.130
P17: That's fine!

82
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:38.960
Renata: Okay, just give me a moment. I need to get that up in my browser.

83
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.440
Renata: Okay.

84
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.521
Renata: I have too many things open on my computer this morning. I'm so sorry.

85
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.750
Renata: Okay.

86
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.150
Renata: okay. Can you see my screen?

87
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.440
P17: Yes.

88
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.940
Renata: It should say, apply for CHAMPVA benefits at the top.

89
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.380
P17: Correct.

90
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:21.327
Renata: Okay, perfect. So just a few things before we get started here.

91
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:33.770
Renata: so like, I said before, this is our testing site. So we're gonna be filling out a sample application. But we're not submitting anything. So nothing we click on or nothing we enter will have any bearing on your benefits.

92
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.780
P17: Okay.

93
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:49.489
Renata: As we go through the form today, I'm gonna ask you some scenarios where you're applying for CHAMPVA again. You can have you like, dictate what we're gonna fill in. And you can use fake information if you want to, for sensitive questions like social security numbers.

94
00:08:50.153 --> 00:09:08.000
Renata: there's a few screens that you may see in this form where you're asked to upload documentation. I have some sample documentation that will upload. It's just dummy dummy info. And again. We're not submitting anything, so it doesn't really matter what we're uploading here. But do you have any questions for me before we get started?

95
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:08.890
P17: No.

96
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:29.400
Renata: Okay, so I'm just gonna at your, you're gonna dictate what we do here. But we're not gonna click on anything. But we can scroll up and down. I'd like you to just take a look at the information on the page. You can tell me if you want me to scroll or enlarge any fonts or anything. But just tell me what you see and what your initial thoughts are with the information on this page.

97
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:42.599
P17: Well, unless people know that they can make it larger, I think people with vision issues, this is going to be very small.

98
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.050
Renata: Okay. And would you like me to enlarge?

99
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.720
P17: The font is a little

100
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.569
P17: Little bit.

101
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.320
P17: Yeah, like the top part, "Apply for CHAMPVA" is fine.

102
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.680
P17: But.

103
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.948
P17: You just made it bigger now that I'll have to make it a little smaller.

104
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.880
Renata: Does it help though, if I enlarge it on my side? Okay, perfect.

105
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.710
P17: But I know that you can take your fingers and make it bigger.

106
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.079
P17: Not everyone knows that.

107
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.450
P17: So I think the printing is quite small

108
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:20.180
P17: if you, if you don't enlarge it, it would be hard to read. And again, remember, I'm on a cell phone.

109
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.130
Renata: Yeah.

110
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:32.139
P17: But I like that. The categories like 1, 2, those are all bolded so you can see that

111
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:40.069
P17: the to check, like to click on a link that's in blue that's customary. So that stands out.

112
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.270
Renata: Okay.

113
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:55.950
Renata: and anything here unusual or different from what you saw or remember from when you applied for CHAMPVA? Or does this seem pretty consistent with when you filled it out 3 years ago.

114
00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.579
P17: I'll be honest with you. I don't remember what that form looked like.

115
00:11:01.302 --> 00:11:02.450
Renata: That's totally fine.

116
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.190
P17: There we go. A lot has happened since that time.

117
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.778
Renata: It sure has. So

118
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:19.239
Renata: I'm going to ask you a few questions about this page now. Do you know if you are on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

119
00:11:22.785 --> 00:11:23.250
P17: Yes!

120
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.950
Renata: Okay. And how do you know?

121
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.530
P17: Yes.

122
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:32.919
P17: Well, 1st I could check my eligibility, and then, it there, Number 3 is, "start your application."

123
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:33.980
Renata: Okay,

124
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:45.890
Renata: got it. And I'm gonna scroll up a little bit here. There is this little link, breadcrumb crumb link here that says "1010d Extended." Does that mean anything to you by chance?

125
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:54.230
P17: Well, the only reason it means anything to me, as you mentioned in the beginning, about the 10 Form.

126
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.889
P17: wasn't it called 10 Dd?

127
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.360
Renata: It is called that. Yes.

128
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.589
P17: And that's the only reason I would know what that is

129
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.660
P17: other than I would never know what that is.

130
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.349
Renata: Okay, and if thinking back to when you.

131
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:22.510
P17: I read the small line underneath there, but I missed that in the beginning. I just went to apply down to 1, 2, 3, you know I read all that other stuff.

132
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.110
Renata: Got it. So you missed this portion right here, the "Apply"?

133
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:39.420
Renata: Okay, got it and thinking back to when you applied for CHAMPVA. Did you do any research into what you might need to fill the form out, or what you might? Documentation you might have to provide?

134
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.460
P17: Yes.

135
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:49.920
P17: I had a booklet from one of the veterans fair that I went through, and I actually think I called CHAMPVA

136
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:58.569
P17: because I wanted to make certain that applying for this wasn't going to interfere with my Medicare Supplemental Insurance.

137
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:05.200
P17: And at that time they told me I don't really need supplemental insurance.

138
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.670
P17: Because CHAMPVA would pick that up, but

139
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.109
P17: they never know when the funds could run out, and

140
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:20.829
P17: then I could be stuck. That's why, I've kept the part b of Medicare, the supplemental insurance

141
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.930
P17: just to be on the safe side.

142
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:29.730
Renata: Okay, so that's just peace of mind for you that you're going to have enough insurance for your care?

143
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.800
P17: Correct.

144
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:42.100
Renata: Okay, got it. So do you recall what types of documentation you needed to provide with the application? Any any specific files, or you know...

145
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.070
Renata: proof of anything?

146
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:54.710
P17: Well, I know I had to put the proof of the insurance, because if you had it, you had to send it in.

147
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.530
Renata: Okay.

148
00:13:55.530 --> 00:14:00.850
P17: And I believe there was veteran information that I had to send in.

149
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.210
P17: Because that's the way I'm eligible.

150
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:22.519
Renata: Okay. So just one more question. Well, actually, 2 more questions for you. If you were to fill this out again today on va.gov, would you have all that information on hand, or would you need to pause at this point and go collect all of that in order to fill the application out?

151
00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.360
P17: Oh, I need to go get all that together.

152
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.460
Renata: Okay.

153
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:46.069
Renata: got it. And last question for you on this page on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very poorly and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the application for CHAMPVA that you're about to begin? Based on this page's content?

154
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.100
P17: 7.

155
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.900
Renata: So very, very well informed?

156
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:03.559
P17: I feel that it's right until I'd actually start the process. I feel it's telling me what I need.

157
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.430
Renata: Okay.

158
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:13.139
Renata: Got it. So the next thing we're gonna do, I'm gonna scroll down a little bit and I'm gonna click, "start your form without signing in"

159
00:15:13.409 --> 00:15:36.049
Renata: So from this point on, we're going to fill the form out together. I'm going to have you dictate what we're doing, and I'm just going to drive through the form I'm going to have you imagine that you're applying for yourself for CHAMPVA benefits. We're going to stop a couple of times during the form. I'm going to ask you some questions, but just to orient you, we're going to fill out the 1st 3 sections of the form before we stop.

160
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:45.129
Renata: And as a reminder, this is our testing site, so we can use dummy information. And I'd like you to think out loud and sort of ask questions as we're going but-

161
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.090
P17: I'm just walking to get my glasses.

162
00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:49.480
Renata: Okay, got it

163
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.030
P17: So you could keep talking.

164
00:15:52.240 --> 00:16:11.750
Renata: Okay? Yeah. So that's basically what we're gonna do. We're just gonna imagine that you're applying for the 1st time for yourself. And I'll just have you dictate as we go through and ask questions. If anything's unclear, give feedback if if you don't like something or like something a lot. Yeah, any any questions about that, though?

165
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.460
P17: No, I'm fine.

166
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.089
Renata: Okay. You got your glasses on?

167
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.530
P17: I got them on.

168
00:16:18.058 --> 00:16:19.449
Renata: Great

169
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:33.649
P17: But see there, I think I'm just gonna make it pinch it, make it bigger. I have to have glasses for distance, and I thought it might, I might save me from pinching that all the time, but it it sort of makes things blurry so.

170
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:41.319
Renata: Okay, well, if you'd like, I can also increase the size on my end, too. I know that I can do that again. If you'd like.

171
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:46.200
P17: Well the size I have on the screen now. I can see fine.

172
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:56.710
Renata: Okay. All right. So if you were applying for yourself for benefits for the CHAMPVA program today, which one of these would we select which best describes you?

173
00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.039
P17: I'm applying benefits for myself.

174
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.720
Renata: Okay, I'm going to click, continue

175
00:17:04.313 --> 00:17:09.169
Renata: and just go ahead and shout out what you'd like me to put in here.

176
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.759
P17: Oh, and this is where I could use fake stuff?

177
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.310
Renata: You can use fake stuff if you don't feel comfortable using real stuff.

178
00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.669
P17: Okay. Susan.

179
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.020
Renata: Okay.

180
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.270
P17: Smith.

181
00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.819
Renata: All right, no suffix?

182
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.540
P17: No suffix.

183
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.440
Renata: Okay.

P17: The street address address is 1, 2, 3, Garden Street.

187
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:44.850

P17: In [City, State].

189
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.590
Renata: There we go!

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.250
P17: [Zip code].

191
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.269
Renata: Okay, I'm gonna click, continue.

192
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:21.260
P17: Contact phone number [Phone].

193
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.160

P17: Veterans@aol.com.

195
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:43.579
Renata: Alright, I'm gonna click, continue again. Nothing unusual or unexpected, so far?

196
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.520
P17: No.

197
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.420
Renata: Okay

198
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.180
Renata: and anything.

199
00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.010
Renata: No, nothing.

200
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.660
P17: I don't have a problem with that.

201
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.000
Renata: Okay, I'm gonna click, continue.

202
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.910
P17: The 1st name is John E.

203
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.880
P17: Smith.

204
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.090
Renata: Okay. No. Suffix.

205
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.364
P17: No. Suffix. Date of birth.

206
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:28.830
P17: [DOB].

207
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:43.099
P17: [Social security].

208
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:44.929
Renata: All right.

209
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.150
P17: No.

210
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.420
Renata: Okay.

211
00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.889
P17: Does the sponsor live at a previously entered address? Yes.

212
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.550
Renata: Want me to click on this.

213
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:05.910
P17: Yeah, we're gonna indicate the same.

214
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.230
P17: Make it? Yes.

215
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.240
Renata: Okay.

216
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.900
P17: Continue.

217
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:18.890
Renata: Okay.

218
00:20:22.441 --> 00:20:28.070
P17: The sponsors contacts the same as that other phone number. Or I just make up another one?

219
00:20:28.918 --> 00:20:37.850
Renata: We can do either. If you were really filling this out, would you give a separate phone number for your spouse? Or would it be the same phone number as yours?

220
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:44.739
P17: It would be the same as mine, because for anything important it's got he.

221
00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:49.709
P17: I'm the one that manages all of that because he doesn't know what to do with it.

222
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:56.749
Renata: And in an ideal world would you want to be re-entering the same phone number here? Would you want the ability like the address?

223
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.639
Renata: No, I use my same phone number.

224
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:05.558
Renata: Okay? So I think you said it was [number], right?

225
00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.650
P17: Yeah, that sounds good.

226
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.310
Renata: Okay, all right.

227
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.319
Renata: Do you understand what's being asked for here?

228
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.620
P17: Yes.

229
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.430
P17: Well, I'm thinking I'm the only applicant.

230
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:31.500
Renata: Okay.

231
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.869
P17: So I wouldn't have anything else to add.

232
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.200
Renata: Okay. So you'd click, continue?

233
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.060
P17: Right.

234
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.779
Renata: All right. Let's do that.

235
00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.869
P17: Oh, the birth date's missing.

236
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.760
Renata: Okay. What would you like me to do here?

237
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.989
P17: Well, we gave a birth date.

238
00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:02.100
P17: It was [Sponsor DOB], but it didn't carry over.

239
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.049
P17: so I'd have to put in the birth date again.

240
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.009
Renata: Okay. So where should I go from here?

241
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.050
P17: Edit.

242
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.590
Renata: Okay, I'm gonna click that edit button.

243
00:22:13.182 --> 00:22:17.410
Renata: Let me know if you'd like me to stop or scroll down.

244
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.290
P17: Well, you'd have to scroll down to get to date of birth.

245
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.610
Renata: Okay, alright. We're down at date of birth. And what would you like to enter for the the birthday?

246
00:22:29.165 --> 00:22:34.010
P17: [Applicant DOB].

247
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.859
Renata: Okay and save and continue?

248
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.760
P17: Yes.

249
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:40.610
Renata: Okay.

250
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:53.890
P17: The social security was [Sponsor SSN]

251
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.610
Renata: Okay.

252
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.430
P17: That would be good, save and continue.

253
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.360
Renata: Okay.

254
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.060
P17: Save and continue

255
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:32.549
P17: female, we'd have to do female. Continue Susan's sponsor, spouse or partner.

256
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:33.890
Renata: Okay.

257
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:46.320
P17: The date of marriage would be [marriage date].

258
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.350
Renata: Okay.

259
00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.320
P17: Save and continue no other applicant.

260
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.370
Renata: Okay.

261
00:23:54.370 --> 00:24:08.070
Renata: I'm going to stop here and ask you a couple of questions before we proceed on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to fill out this 1st section of the form?

262
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:11.580
P17: 5.

263
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.380
Renata: A 5 very easy and

264
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.120
Renata: why did you give it a 5?

265
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:30.879
P17: Because I did. The only thing I questioned is what we already put in before didn't roll over like the other stuff. Does the address, not the address. Social security and the birth date

266
00:24:31.326 --> 00:24:36.549
P17: didn't come over. But that's easy to fix that. So I still think it was easy.

267
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:43.949
Renata: Okay. It was easy when you got to this page to see that information was missing and to find that edit button and stuff? Okay.

268
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:50.920
Renata: got it. Anything else that you want to give feedback on about this 1st section before we keep going?

269
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.009
P17: No, I think that was okay.

270
00:24:53.190 --> 00:25:06.449
Renata: Okay, got it. I will hit that continue button. So before we start answering more questions. Just take a look at this page. Let me know what it's asking, and if anything stands out to you.

271
00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.119
P17: Well, it asks if you have Medicare.

272
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.230
Renata: Okay.

273
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.979
P17: And my answer would be Yes, and then continue.

274
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:26.200
Renata: Okay. And thinking back to the information you saw on that very 1st page we looked at. Do you recall if it told you that you'd need to provide Medicare information today?

275
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:41.100
P17: I don't recall, because I know you needed to provide it. I did tell me that I had to have personal information.

276
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:45.650
Renata: Got it. Okay, but nothing specific about medicare or health insurance.

277
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:56.130
P17: That that I don't recall, but I must have read that on an application before. I wouldn't have had everything in front of me when I was filling the application out.

278
00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:11.439
Renata: Got it? So I already asked you this on the 1st page. But would you need to stop at this point to go gather like your red, white, and blue card, or any other information about your your plans before filling out this section? Or would you have.

279
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.150
P17: Yes, no, I would need to gather all of that.

280
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:15.510
Renata: Okay

281
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:31.079
Renata: And I want to draw your attention to the top of the screen. So next to the VA logo, we have that "1010d Extended, CHAMPVA Application again, but it next to it, it says in parentheses includes "10-7959c." Does that

282
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.849
Renata: mean anything to you at all?

283
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.120
P17: Same to me. Nothing.

284
00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:46.860
Renata: Okay, got it. So we're gonna proceed with filling this section out again. You can use fake information, and we'll just we'll just proceed from here. Are you comfortable with going to the next step?

285
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:47.840
P17: Yes.

286
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:52.320
Renata: Okay, so you want to click "Yes," here for reporting your medicare?

287
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.380
P17: Yes.

288
00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.530
Renata: All right, I'm gonna click, continue.

289
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.160
Renata: And what would you like me to do on this screen?

290
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:14.520
P17: Now I there it is!

291
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.229
P17: A spam call came in here, and everything got mixed up on my end.

292
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.139
P17: Now I'm back

293
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:20.999
Renata: Sorry to hear that.

294
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.820
P17: That's okay. It's good now.

295
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:24.670
Renata: Okay.

296
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:31.830
P17: What would you like to add? Medicare insurance for Susan Smith? So I'd have to click that box.

297
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.330
P17: Okay, circle. Continue.

298
00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.500
Renata: Continue. Okay.

299
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.159
P17: Type of Medicare.

300
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.829
P17: I would do the 1st circle.

301
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.980
Renata: This one for parts a, and B?

302
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.380
Renata: Okay, and continue?

303
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.430
P17: Continue.

304
00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.509
P17: Oh, the effective date! O Lord!

305
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.631
P17: Well, I'm putting any date in May.

306
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.257
P17: This is easy.

307
00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:16.240
P17: [Date]

308
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.610
P17: [Date]

309
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.930
Renata: Okay, same date for part B?

310
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.020
P17: Same date, for part B.

311
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:34.410
Renata: Okay. And if you're filling this out for real, do you have to go stop and find those dates?

312
00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.280
P17: Yeah, I'd have to think about that.

313
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.589
Renata: Okay. Do you know where you could find that information?

314
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.879
P17: Well, I'd have to figure out when I turned 65,

315
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:52.700
P17: cause I applied for it, yeah. 65. When I turned 65 would be the date I applied for it.

316
00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:53.830
Renata: Okay.

317
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:59.500
P17: I did it like in advance. You can do it like up to 30 or 60 days ahead of time.

318
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.900
Renata: And that I did all online.

319
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:11.559
Renata: Oh, nice. Okay, so you just have to calculate back which which year was when you turned 65, and it's it's a piece of cake from there?

320
00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.350
P17: Right.

321
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.320
Renata: Okay, I'm gonna click, continue.

322
00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:32.130
Renata: So what is this page asking you for does, do you? Do you understand? In your own words, what it's asking for?

323
00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.970
Renata: And I can scroll back up, feel free to boss me around as we're going through this!

324
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.039
P17: Well, scroll back, up.

325
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:49.360
P17: Because that's where the directions are. You have medicare and date coverage begins. You'll need to submit a copy.

326
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.620
P17: Okay.

327
00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.440
Renata: Alright, scroll down?

328
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.770
P17: You could scroll down.

329
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.410
P17: Then how to update the file.

330
00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:04.120
Renata: Okay

331
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:16.249
Renata: And I kind of already asked this before, do you have? Would you? Do you already have your Medicare card scans like somewhere saved on your computer, or would you need to stop and scan that in order to upload it?

332
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.349
P17: I would need to stop and scan it to upload it.

333
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:29.575
Renata: Okay. So like, I said, I have a dummy file that I'm gonna upload at this point. So I'm gonna go ahead and do the uploading for you. We're gonna imagine that we just scanned your cards in.

334
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:38.140
Renata: If my computer will cooperate.

335
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.400
Renata: All right.

336
00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.280
Renata: Does that look good to you?

337
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.700
P17: And

338
00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:07.249
P17: right now the question I would have is, is this one where you put the card down and you put your phone over it, and you have to get it in the box and then click a button?

339
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:18.519
Renata: Gonna be a little annoying, and answer your question with another question, which is, is that what you would want or expect here if you were doing this for real on va.gov today?

340
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:36.169
P17: I guess I'm familiar with that on other sites that I've had to do, and I thought that was very easy. They just told me to put the camera over the document, get it in the box, push the button, and it was uploaded. Very easy to do.

341
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:51.360
Renata: And when you've done that in the past, does it populate the information from your card like in the form? Just curious what happens afterwards. Okay, so it would. You could skip like filling in the effective date because it'd be scanning

342
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.390
Renata: correctly? Okay, Got it.

343
00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:03.760
Renata: Thank you for sharing that we're always curious what folks expectations are when they're navigating these things. So I'm gonna go ahead and click. Continue.

344
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.340
P17: Medicare prescription, drug coverage. Yes.

345
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:25.789
Renata: Yes, to this? Okay, I'm going to click, continue.

346
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.880
P17: Name of the insurance carrier? [Provider name].

347
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.260
P17: the date?

348
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:51.529
P17: Well, this could be different. Any date, right? It doesn't have to be. When Medicare started. It could just be any date we're putting in there. So we'll put in September

349
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.560
P17: [Date]

350
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.819
Renata: Okay, I'll click, continue.

351
00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.200
Renata: And what's this page asking for?

352
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:16.400
P17: Well, this is you're uploading your insurance for the prescription coverage.

353
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:20.910
Renata: Okay, so I'll go ahead and upload another dummy card again.

354
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:21.560
P17: Right.

355
00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.860
Renata: All right, I'm gonna click, continue.

356
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.130
P17: Another plan?

357
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.750
P17: Well, the other plan I have is the medication plan.

358
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:59.920
Renata: The part d?

359
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:00.950
P17: Yes.

360
00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.380
Renata: Is that somewhere here?

361
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.599
P17: What says Part A/B.

362
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:17.800
P17: it's not where it says, type, original medicare parts A and B hospital and medical, and underneath it it says, do you have another plan to report for one or more applicants.

363
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:24.090
Renata: Okay. So we just we just added that plan. D, but you're not seeing it on this page?

364
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.039
P17: Not on my screen. No.

365
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:30.890
Renata: Okay, so if you were filling this out for real, what would you do at this point?

366
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.099
P17: I'd have to say yes.

367
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.079
Renata: You'd say yes [another plan to report], and you'd start over again?

368
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:42.159
P17: Yeah, because they would. They'd want to know about the medicine plan. At least, I'm thinking they'd want to know that.

369
00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:59.270
Renata: Okay, for the sake of time I'm gonna click "no" here. But I'm just curious to know what what you would have done. So you, just to make sure I understand. You would have clicked that "Yes," and then gone back to the screen that asked you which plan? And you would have selected the supplemental the drug plan, the part d?

370
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:00.620
P17: It's a drug plan.

371
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:06.660
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you for that feedback. So I'm gonna click no, and continue.

372
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:14.250
P17: That answer would be, I don't have, so it'd be "no" [other health insurance].

373
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:30.069
Renata: No, okay. I'm going to stop us here. And I'm going to ask another question of you, that 1 to 5 scale where one is very hard, and 5 is very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the Medicare and Health Insurance section of the form?

374
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:40.489
P17: Well, it was easy, because you were uploading the cards. I would say, if I had to do it myself, I'd probably rate it a 4.

375
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.699
Renata: A 4. Okay

376
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.960
P17: Because it takes longer.

377
00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.190
Renata: Because you gotta do the uploading yourself?

378
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.820
P17: Right.

379
00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:47.360
Renata: Okay.

380
00:35:48.465 --> 00:35:53.019
Renata: What would make it a 5. Very easy for you?

381
00:35:54.110 --> 00:36:08.780
P17: Well, if they would have captured that I had the drug coverage and didn't have to go back. That would have made it a 5, probably because if it's like, I'm thinking, because it's saying, upload, you put the card on the table and you just

382
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.499
P17: push the upload button. It's uploading it.

383
00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:20.229
Renata: Right. Okay, thank you for that feedback. So I'm gonna go ahead and click continue at this point.

384
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:35.089
Renata: So on this page, this is the last page that we're gonna look at today. I'm gonna have you review your application for CHAMPVA benefits everything that we filled out so far. So you can go ahead and just boss me through

385
00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:42.139
Renata: what you'd like me to do on this page? We're not going to click the submit button at the bottom, but just let me know what you'd like to do to review it.

386
00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:57.200
P17: I got another one of those calls. So everything's being messed up. Okay, Signer. Sponsor.

387
00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:11.050
P17: Well, I would have to go. I would go through each one before I submitted it, just to make certain the information was correct, even though I did that once before, I'd want to do it again before I submitted it.

388
00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:17.139
Renata: So do you want me to open all of these sections up so that we can look at the information and make sure it's accurate?

389
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:29.169
P17: Yes. Well, if that's I mean, that's what I would normally do if we're short for time. We don't have to. But that's what I would normally do.

390
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.099
Renata: No, we can definitely stay a little bit longer. I'll go

391
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.720
Renata: here and expand these.

392
00:37:34.355 --> 00:37:37.810
Renata: So let's take a look at the signer information first.

393
00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:43.610
P17: Susan, Smith, United States, okay.

394
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.370
P17: Okay.

395
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:56.860
P17: Okay.

396
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:05.110
P17: Okay.

397
00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:06.939
Renata: This is all this, all seems like - 

398
00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.120
P17: That's all what I'm recalling what we put in.

399
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:11.050
Renata: Okay.

400
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:15.470
P17: Okay.

401
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:19.859
P17: MB,

402
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:28.960
P17: okay, okay, cause you put no, that's fine. Yeah, it's all right. That's good.

403
00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:40.300
Renata: Okay, so let's say, you realize that you put your husband's birth date in wrong. How would you go about editing that? At this point.

404
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.190
P17: Now

405
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:55.619
P17: I'd have to. Where the husband's birth date is. There'd have to be an edit box, and I would need to check on click on the edit box and then put the new birthday in.

406
00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.729
Renata: Okay, so you click that edit box right here?

407
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:59.560
P17: Correct.

408
00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:14.269
Renata: Okay, got it. And like, I said, we're not gonna be submitting the form today. But let's say that we did. We signed Susan Smith's name. Here we certified that this was all accurate, and we click, submit! What would you expect to happen next?

409
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.270
P17: Well, then, you wait for a response.

410
00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:21.080
Renata: Okay.

411
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:27.690
P17: And if they if they don't have all the information they need, or you did something wrong, they'll let you know.

412
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:40.579
Renata: Alright! How soon would you expect to be notified by CHAMPVA about receiving your application?

413
00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.379
P17: Just receiving it, not approving it, receiving it?

414
00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.782
Renata: Just receiving it. We'll get to approving it next.

415
00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.910
P17: Well, the VA works awful slow, so I would hope I'd know in a month.

416
00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.769
Renata: That they got it?

417
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:58.390
P17: Yep.

418
00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.669
Renata: Okay, and.

419
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:13.730
P17: Ideally I'd like it at least in like 2 weeks. I'd like, you know, if I could put a time out there, I'd say 2 weeks, but I think by a month they should definitely have let us know that they received it.

420
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:25.489
Renata: Okay. So if I'm hearing you correctly in an ideal world, you'd like CHAMPVA to let you know within 2 weeks, "hey, we received your application." But you'd be okay up to a month. That's within your realm of expectations?

421
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:26.340
P17: Right.

422
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:35.950
Renata: Okay, and how would you expect to get that notification that they received your application? Would that be email, text message, a letter in the mail?

423
00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:38.449
P17: Well, I'd like an email.

424
00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.820
Renata: Okay.

425
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.189
P17: That's what I would want.

426
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:48.230
Renata: Okay. Would you want a copy of your application at that time as well for your records?

427
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.519
P17: To have a copy would be great.

428
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:57.699
P17: What I normally do is before I send anything. I'm taking pictures of it.

429
00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.730
P17: because it's my proof of what I've sent.

430
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:06.100
Renata: Okay. So you would take pictures of the screen that we're on right now to make sure that you have a copy?

431
00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.660
P17: Yes.

432
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:21.149
Renata: Okay, got it. So now we're going to talk about expectations, about being notified about a decision being made on your application. So how soon would you expect to know whether CHAMPVA is approving you for the program?

433
00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:27.950
P17: I would expect that it would be done within 60 days.

434
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:34.690
Renata: Okay. So within 60 days of them receiving the application?

435
00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.730
P17: Well, 60 days from when I mailed it I'd expect to have an answer.

436
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.200
Renata: Got it. Okay.

437
00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:51.259
Renata: And would you want to receive any status updates in between submitting it and getting a notice that you've been approved?

438
00:41:56.257 --> 00:42:06.719
P17: Not necessarily cause, I think I would expect if there's something that they're not understanding or is incorrect, they would notify me right away so I can

439
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.990
P17: correct it, or add something to my application.

440
00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:18.180
Renata: And how would they be notifying you if something was missing? Would that be an email, or a letter, or...?

441
00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.710
P17: I'd say, email.

442
00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:21.990
Renata: Okay, got it.

443
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:26.140
Renata: I think that's much quicker than the mail cause I've come to find out

444
00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:31.420
P17: if the VA sends you a letter, it could be sitting in that office

445
00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:38.790
P17: for one or 2 days before somebody picks it up and takes it to the mailroom before it even gets out.

446
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:47.429
P17: So I'd want an email. They could do it right away before they close the file so they get what they need to have. I'd want an email.

447
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:57.469
Renata: Okay, you'd want that email, and I think you mentioned you'd want some way to be able to provide that information like without having to submit another form. Is that correct?

448
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.720
Renata: Yes, okay.

449
00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.740
P17: Correct.

450
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:15.060
Renata: All right. One last question for you, and then we'll stop sharing the screen, and we'll start to kind of close out. But on that 1 to 5 scale, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to review your application for Champ, BA. Benefits on this page.

451
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.359
P17: That was easy. 5.

452
00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:25.889
P17: It was a 5. Okay, got it. Thank you. I'm gonna stop sharing my screen. We just have a few more questions for you before we wrap up.

453
00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:26.540
P17: Okay.

454
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:31.340
Renata: Let me just close.

455
00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.509
Renata: I have too many things open on my computer.

456
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:45.849
Renata: alright. So overall, was there anything that you saw today that worked well for you?

457
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:56.669
P17: Well, I definitely think the application for the most part's easy to fill out.

458
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:58.270
P17: So, for me.

459
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:59.590
Renata: Okay.

460
00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:08.670
P17: I think there's there's a lot of veterans that I know that would have to have somebody help them with it, if not.

461
00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.499
P17: do it for them.

462
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:11.710
Renata: Okay.

463
00:44:12.813 --> 00:44:22.200
Renata: and would you expect that they would need help from like the CHAMPVA 1-800 number, or from like American Legion? What would that assistance look like?

464
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:30.340
P17: Well, I would probably be better to have somebody sitting down with them than to call in on the phone and trying to do this.

465
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:31.260
Renata: Okay.

466
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.961
P17: Whether it be a friend, a family member, the Legion.

467
00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.879
P17: That's what I think.

468
00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:42.119
P17: One on one speaking with them.

469
00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:49.360
Renata: Yeah, was there anything that you saw today that was unclear or that did not work well for you?

470
00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:58.259
P17: Well, when you had mentioned that other form number, that

471
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:06.000
P17: if it was written on anything that I was reading prior to this, I never saw that number.

472
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.549
P17: The 1010 I saw, but not the second number you're mentioned.

473
00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.330
Renata: The 10-7959?

474
00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:15.450
P17: Yeah. Do not know what that is.

475
00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:40.990
Renata: Okay, it. It doesn't matter at this point like, I said, we're not testing knowledge or ability. We're just curious, but good to know that that was not something that you'd encountered before. So now that you've gone through the online application, is there any more information or research that you would advise veterans or spouses of veterans to do that you would put on that 1st page you saw?

476
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:48.040
P17: No.

477
00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:50.350
Renata: Okay.

478
00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:59.120
Renata: And what are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in the form when you were filling it out? Not enough, just right, too much?

479
00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:07.330
P17: No, I think the information was all pertinent to an application for what they're requesting.

480
00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:10.460
Renata: Okay, so, just right?

481
00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:12.550
P17: Yes.

482
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:18.560
Renata: Okay. Last question for you. Any questions for me before we close out?

483
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:20.140
P17: No.

484
00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:38.610
Renata: Okay, I wanna circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners. And just to remind you, we remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing. And we only use these videos with Va. Part partners for the purposes of improving va.gov.

485
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:46.129
P17: No, I, like that part I I you can definitely share it, and

486
00:46:46.750 --> 00:47:14.400
P17: I think they need to make the MyHealtheVet easier, though overall easier. The old format was easier to get. It would. If you have that blue button, it would click up a box that had appointments, medications, messages. I don't see that box anymore. I have to like. If I want to see appointments, I actually have to put in the search screen

487
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:17.170
P17: appointments. Then there's this.

488
00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:24.999
P17: all these sites that come up till I finally find the one that says, Go to your appointments, and it's

489
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:36.389
P17: it's more difficult now in that respect. The only improvement I've seen is the labs are identified now exactly what they are and not what type of

490
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:41.860
P17: blood they used, or plasma or serum to get the test.

491
00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.090
P17: so that they should look at.

492
00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:48.150
Renata: Well, we don't work on the MyHealtheVet portion of the site

493
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.600
P17: Oh.

494
00:47:48.600 --> 00:48:07.121
Renata: But I would happily, I will happily pass your feedback along to the team that works on that, and I'm sure that they would really appreciate, to know the ways that they can continue to improve it. So I just wanna thank you for sharing that. And I again, I'm really sorry that it has been frustrating with the changes that have been made. I apologize.

495
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:29.729
Renata: But at this point, [P17], I wanted to say we really appreciate that you hung in there and took the time to join us today. I know we had some bumps getting everybody connected this morning, but it really really helps. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure that it really works for veterans and their family members. So really, truly, thank you.

496
00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.159
P17: Oh, you're welcome!

497
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:58.390
Renata: Yeah. Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note. There's going to be a little blurb in the thank you. Note that you can pass along to veterans and their family members any that you know, to allow them the chance to sign up to participate in future research studies like this one. And so, you know, if you know anybody, please do pass that along. But at that thank you so much again. Enjoy the rest of your day and the rest of your week. And yeah, thank you.

498
00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.829
P17: Well, thank you. You have a good day.

499
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.459
Renata: Yeah, you as well.

500
00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.769
P17: Hmm, bye-bye.

501
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:04.530
Renata: Bye.
