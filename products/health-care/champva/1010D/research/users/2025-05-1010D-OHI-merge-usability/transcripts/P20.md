1
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.820
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.450
P20: I am.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.499
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.280
P20: I am.

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:29.810
Renata: All right. So before we look at that coded prototype that I told you about, just a few warm up questions. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

6
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.930
P20: I have not.

7
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.829
Renata: You've not all right. And do you intend to apply for CHAMPVA benefits for a spouse or dependent in the future?

8
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.770
P20: Yes.

9
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.170
Renata: Okay, and why are you planning on applying in the future, out of curiosity?

10
00:00:46.180 --> 00:01:03.710
P20: So lots of different reasons. Number one, they're the they're for my bonus kids. They're my bonus dependent kids their situation has changed, and so as much assistance as possible for them is going to be being requested. Take, for all options and all avenues.

11
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.830
Renata: Okay.

12
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.260
Renata: Got it.

13
00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.800
Renata: Thank you for sharing. Do you have a va.gov account?

14
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.100
P20: I do you mean like do the id me? And the login? Yes, I do.

15
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.210
Renata: Yeah. What has been your experience with logging into the site?

16
00:01:23.732 --> 00:01:30.999
P20: You mean the initial, like the MFA, the Multi factor authentication, or you mean just using the site?

17
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.180
Renata: Just logging in.

18
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.164
P20: Okay, it's a pain in the in the butt.

19
00:01:39.443 --> 00:01:40.216
P20: There's

20
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:58.709
P20: on the PC. I can understand the the MFA and the the how to log in and the multiple password. And then we're gonna text you. And then we're gonna do this. And we're gonna do that all that blah blah, right? That's understandable because you don't know what PC, you're at. But if I'm on my phone

21
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:08.220
P20: and or I could, you know, if if we could say, "Hey, this is a trusted advice." Move forward with it right? But like on my phone, if I'm logging into the VA app

22
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.370
P20: and it says, okay, we're gonna text you now just to make sure that you're you.

23
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.999
P20: So you're gonna text the device that I'm using

24
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.590
P20: to make sure that it's me like that seems counterproductive. Right? Like.

25
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.609
P20: if I sold this phone and I'm logging in, you're gonna text, this device to see if

26
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.939
P20: I'm this, you know that. That's where I'm a little confused from that perspective. But if we're not.

27
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.560
Renata: Hmm.

28
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.119
P20: Talking about that if we're just talking about in general.

29
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.720
P20: you know. Besides that, Miss Lincoln, how's the show? Besides that it was, it's fine to log in.

30
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.519
Renata: Okay. And what tasks are you logging into va.gov for?

31
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.575
P20: All tests, looking at my records, looking at my appointments

32
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.012
P20: looking at messages, looking at what are

33
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:16.710
P20: the big thing is, there's a lack of information that's out there. So the only thing that I actually can do is go to the VA.Gov site to see like what are my benefits? What are what are options? What are what's available? If

34
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.192
P20: and the reason why? There's a disconnect is because

35
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.610
P20: anyways, maybe you didn't want to know that but so I look into that. prescriptions, renewables.

36
00:03:30.828 --> 00:03:36.570
P20: My medical records. I don't know if I already said that you know. My information, you know

37
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.009
P20: about the majority of it.

38
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.239
Renata: Okay. And how often would you say, are you logging into va.gov?

39
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.739
P20: 5 times a day, 4 times a day.

40
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.839
Renata: Okay. Got it.

41
00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:05.679
P20: Well, I mean, they're getting an email. "Hey, somebody replied, your message. You gotta you gotta log all the way back in to see the message" or "here's the appointments coming up." Wait a minute where

42
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.669
P20: it's supposed to be at the main VA, but it doesn't.

43
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.620
P20: The the message didn't give me like a room. So then it's

44
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.010
P20: I gotta log into the VA, okay, where am I going at in the VA [medical] center?

45
00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:27.439
P20: like, so I gotta figure that out or what's appointment was this today? Because there's like 5 of them. And you know, one's here once there. So you know, locations from that perspective.

46
00:04:28.624 --> 00:04:29.589
P20: or

47
00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:42.713
P20: hey did the results for my testers come back, you know what's going on with that? Or Oh, shoot! I need to do a refill. So I'll request that, or Hey, when is my refill need to be done? So then I'll look into that.

48
00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:50.289
P20: you know that's okay, the majority of those types of interactions.

49
00:04:50.880 --> 00:05:11.644
Renata: Got it. And I just wanna circle back. You mentioned that there's not a lot of information out there for a lot of like Va programs and services. Is that on va.gov, or like off like non official va services like, what's the the difficulty there for you? And sort of Where are you going for that information? Sorry for the double barreled question.

50
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:19.908
P20: No, it's okay. So I have my rating, I see what my rating is. And okay, what does that mean? Right? So

51
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:32.550
P20: you you now qualify for this, or here's the commissary, or here's access to this or oh, you should have gotten $150,000

52
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:43.870
P20: cost reduction on your property for tax purposes. And like, so like, here's all this stuff that you have available. Right? We'll just call here in this. Here's this bubble of stuff.

53
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.609
P20: Now the VA site will have some of that and then

54
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.230
P20: well, I'm moving forward. So let's say it has.

55
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.220
P20: Here's we'll call it arbitrary. 20 things.

56
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.930
P20: The VA site has 10.

57
00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:23.230
P20: Here's this VA group that I'm part of, or I'm also part of the ERG employee resource group the military. ERG, I'm 1 of the chairs at my work. So I work with other vets. Other companies, 5 Fortune 500 company ERGs, right. So it's like the [companies]. We're all doing this, and then we're talking, "Oh, hey? You know I did this thing."

58
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:31.869
P20: "What?" "Yeah, well, what rating are you?" "Well, I'm this rating." "Oh, well, you should have been able to do this." I'll go back to the VA site and

59
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:42.609
P20: you know it may or may not be listed, but it's like, "Hey, here's this property tax reduction." But over here it, either, if it's not listed, it'll be

60
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.525
P20: here.

61
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:56.419
P20: It's listed in this weird way that you're like, okay. So I have this benefit and don't really know much about it, right? Or I'll copy and paste all my benefits into Google.

62
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:06.960
P20: what does this mean? Right? It doesn't. The VA site, if it has it sometimes it's not clear, or it may not have it at all. Okay. So then the next question is, Well.

63
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.965
P20: what

64
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.112
P20: What does that mean, then? So like,

65
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.924
P20: I'm trying to be general without getting into specifics. I

66
00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:30.690
P20: there's the exchange website. Right? You can order kind of like Amazon. It's the online version of the commissary, right?

67
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.640
P20: Not listed on the VA side, anywhere. Well, it's because it's not VA sanctioned. Well, what it is, though.

68
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.109
P20: because if you go to the site and you talk. And they're like, Yeah, we're a legitimate site.

69
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.420
P20: But

70
00:07:44.610 --> 00:08:04.129
P20: Well, then, how come it's not listed on the va.gov site like. So there's there's information that's out there that sometimes you gotta. It's not what you know. It's who you know. Sometimes it's there, you just gotta be able to read it properly or differently, or interpret it differently. Or sometimes it's

71
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.430
P20: in a completely different setting. Where

72
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.960
P20: Well.

73
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:26.759
P20: Oh, a different setting. So like, now, there's these, all these Facebook groups that are like, "Hey, did you know your benefits like, here's these things." And there's the Youtube videos. And like, here's all the stuff. This is where you can go. Oh, okay, you know you.

74
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.199
P20: So it's a disconnect of information.

75
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:51.039
Renata: Got it. Thank you for sharing, and I'm sorry. That sounds like a frustrating experience, but the feedback help helps us to improve veterans experiences. So we really appreciate it. Just a few more questions for you before we get to that coded prototype I mentioned. So what assistive technology are you using?

76
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.839
P20: Right now it's either magnification or talk back.

77
00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:10.919
Renata: Okay, and I think for the purposes of today's session, you said, we're gonna be using screen magnification on the the desktop. Okay? How would you rate your level of experience with screen magnification? Beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert?

78
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.120
P20: Well, it's always hard to say

79
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.809
P20: I'm an expert, right? But I mean 

80
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.169
P20: I do computers. So I'm very familiar with the computer. So.

81
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:28.259
Renata: Okay, alright. And how about for talkback? That same rating for the level of experience?

82
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:41.710
P20: Same, it's just an equal level of frustration. So let let's call myself an expert with talk back. And I'm just as much frustrated with that same level of right. Oh, I'm an expert. And here's my level of frustration, right? So it's.

83
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.450
Renata: Got it. And how long have you been using screen magnifiers and talkback?

84
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.150
P20: How long have I been admitting it, or how long have I been using it?

85
00:09:52.964 --> 00:10:02.449
P20: No. So 2019 is when I was like, "Do I need to do this?"

86
00:10:03.296 --> 00:10:10.230
P20: And then. So I started in 2019. And then I think.

87
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.350
P20: now it's okay. I've accepted that. I use it. I've

88
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.410
P20: told people that I use it. I think that was 2022

89
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.210
P20: is when I started openly admitting type of stuff.

90
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:31.990
Renata: Okay, and have you ever shared your screen in zoom while using a screen magnifier before?

91
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.499
P20: Yeah, so I've

92
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:49.969
P20: I've done several of these VA studies before. And so that's that's that's where my familiarity with trying to talk or listen to you and also work with the talk back. I've realized

93
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:57.870
P20: if we can avoid it, awesome if you need me to do it, and you want my feedback on it. Awesome. We can do that moving forward, and I'll switch

94
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:04.090
P20: I may not, you know I don't. I don't know but I can.

95
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:12.229
Renata: Okay. Well, I wanna make sure that you're comfortable with whatever we do. So screen magnification is totally fine. I'm so.

96
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.560
P20: I'm actually comfortable with it. My

97
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:23.289
P20: goal is not my comfort. My goal is to improve the experience for people that

98
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:28.490
P20: maybe don't have the computer experience or don't have the option to sit there and switch back and forth.

99
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:34.580
P20: or that will take a screenshot and swap out. So I will suffer through the pain 

100
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.360
P20: to improve the experience. Does that make sense.

101
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:53.480
Renata: Yeah, I mean, it's totally your call. We are, you know, we're talking with other folks who use assistive technology. So you know entirely up to you at this point. But I do wanna just double check would you like to? Okay, we'll use this.

102
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:53.930
P20: Magnify.

103
00:11:53.930 --> 00:12:05.499
Renata: Alright, so at this point I'm gonna be dropping a link into the chat which I'd like you to open in your browser and then share your screen in zoom. Let me know when you are ready for that.

104
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.560
P20: Ready for you to drop in the chat. I'm ready.

105
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.640
Renata: Okay.

106
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.670
P20: And.

107
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.829
Renata: Then, once you have that open, you can start sharing your screen.

108
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.869
P20: Can you see my screen?

109
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:55.479
Renata: I can see your screen perfect. Okay, just a few things to be aware of before we get started. This is our testing site. So you don't have to worry about the information you have. You enter in here affecting your VA information or benefits, and nothing you click on will have any bearing on your benefits, either, as we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, such as social security numbers. If you don't feel comfortable using real information.

110
00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:23.930
Renata: There's some screens in this form where you may be asked to upload documents. We're not submitting this form. So we're not going to be submitting anything to the Va. But when we get to those screens I can provide you with a sample Pdf. To upload, or if you have a, you know, just like a random non pii document on your desktop. You can also use that. You don't have to make a decision. Now, I'll remind you when we get to those screens that you have a choice there, and I can provide those at that time. But any questions for me before we get started.

111
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.430
P20: Not at this time.

112
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:35.699
Renata: All right, so you can scroll up and down, but without clicking on anything yet. I'd just like you to take a look at the information on this page. Let us know any initial thoughts that you have.

113
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:48.969
P20: Standard VA page, standard color, standard layouts. There's typically always a site maintenance somewhere that's going on.

114
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:57.840
P20: I feel enriched and embolded for being here like I like. What kind of feedback do you want?

115
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.319
Renata: No, just reading through it. Is there anything that stands out to you? Any questions you have?

116
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.730
P20: Not at this time.

117
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:17.749
Renata: All right. So I have a few questions for you before we jump into this form. Do you know, if you're on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

118
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.599
P20: I will.

119
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:27.799
P20: I'm basing it on a title of the page. I would, I would assume so.

120
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:43.210
Renata: Okay, and I want you to look at those 3 links that are above the the heading that you just highlighted. The the 1st one says, "va.gov home," "Lvc Champa," "1010 d Extended." What if anything, does 1010 d Extended mean to you?

121
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:53.079
P20: So this is going to be the home page, the sub child page. And this is a child page, and this "1010 d Extended" is the form that we talked about, that we're going to be

122
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:58.220
P20: looking at, to use, to request or to apply for the CHAMPVA benefits.

123
00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.170
Renata: Okay

124
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:08.919
Renata: And if you were on va.gov, filling this out for your spouse and dependents at this time, what research would you do before applying for the CHAMPVA benefits?

125
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:14.880
P20: I'd go over here and say, Hey, VA form 1010 d. What is this? Why do I need this?

126
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:22.079
P20: I would also look at, hey? Here's this, what am I looking at for here? Google, this.

127
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:45.510
P20: how does this work? What are... What can I gain? What are the benefits? How does this apply? Does this impact current existing insurance? Does this supersede? Can I use them both at the same? Are they one individual like. So I would have all of those types of questions. But before I actually went to apply for it, that would be all the research that I would do

128
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.310
P20: like before that. Does that make sense?

129
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.819
Renata: Okay, is that what you're asking...

130
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.380
P20: I mean.

131
00:15:50.747 --> 00:15:59.160
Renata: Just checking my understanding. So you, what you're saying is, you do all of that research before landing on a page like this, where you would be starting the form. Is that accurate?

132
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:06.319
P20: Yeah, in order for me to be here, I would have to know. Well, I take that back if I'm just randomly clicking on the VA

133
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:13.820
P20: dot gov site, and it brought me here. It'd be like, Oh, okay, let's let's apply for the right I guess that's 1 way to do it. But

134
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:20.069
P20: and typically, in order for me to apply for benefits, I would have to,

135
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:26.740
P20: I would do all this type of work first, before I got here.

136
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:34.320
Renata: Got it. Okay. Yeah. Do you know how to check your eligibility for CHAMPVA benefits?

137
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.059
P20: Well like you mean.

138
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:44.400
P20: Do I know that this link right here takes me to that? Or are you asking in general?

139
00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:51.149
Renata: More or less. Yeah, I mean, if you're aware of how to check your eligibility, we don't have to click on that link today.

140
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.080
P20: Yeah, I would have just clicked there.

141
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:54.800
Renata: Okay.

142
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.239
P20: I mean, that would have been one of the Googlings that would have

143
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.350
P20: given me that information. I would have had to obtain that

144
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:24.000
P20: through here, as far as I understand, or I could call the VA. And ask them, "Hey, what are my options? What am I eligible to?" And then they would tell me "Hey, do you know there's a site you want to go? Do it," and I can say yes or I can say no, I'm having issues with the website itself, and then they'll walk me through it from their end. I've done both of those, not with CHAMPVA, but with both of those as options before.

145
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:30.728
Renata: Okay, so you've called the 800 number to say, like, "Hey, am I eligible for this program or benefit?" Okay.

146
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:47.370
P20: Or what's going on with my claim, or what's going on with whatever, and they can say, "well, you can go back here," and I'll say, "well, I'm having some issues with technology to make that happen," and they'll walk me through it on their end, and they're very besides, the wait time right? That they're waiting for that. But they're very

147
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.130
P20: customer service. But

148
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:00.259
P20: What's the word? Bedside manner? They're very helpful.

149
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.400
Renata: Okay

150
00:18:02.057 --> 00:18:11.789
Renata: And based on the content on this page. What information do you think you're going to need to fill this application out for spouse or dependent family members?

151
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:17.290
P20: Well, 1st off to see if we're eligible, even start moving forward. And then, once you

152
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:29.670
P20: ascertain that you are, you know. Get your here's what you're gonna need to apply. So I'm gonna need to do all this. And if I really have issues with that, I can click here and it'll walk me through. Here's pictures. Here's the

153
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:37.520
P20: I. Well, let me rephrase that from my understanding of clicking on similar links to say, find out what documents you're going to need.

154
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.600
P20: It'll take me to a page, and I'll have pictures, and I'll do all this type of stuff.

155
00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:52.680
Renata: Okay, and if you were on va.gov, filling this out for real today, would you have that information on hand, or would you need to stop at this point to go collect that documentation?

156
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:59.450
P20: This far in my journey with the Va. It would probably behoove me to already have that.

157
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:03.120
P20: Now I've worked with people that

158
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:13.009
P20: don't still have that, even though, that they've applied for several different things. And all this type of stuff. I'm not one of those type of people. I keep everything digital, and

159
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.710
P20: I'll have everything in a folder on my computer or my phone

160
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:24.449
P20: depending on where I'm filling it out from my preference for filling out forms like this would be at my computer, though.

161
00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:39.599
P20: For several different reasons. One, I could do magnification. I don't have to use talk back. But number 2, it's so I can save the page, save the data, create a paper trail all that type of stuff, and store it on my home server as opposed to

162
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:47.729
P20: potentially doing like a screenshot, getting the screenshot lost somewhere, and all the other photos that are on my phone or lose the phone or

163
00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:54.329
P20: any of those type of things. My core source of backup baseline data is my PC.

164
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.709
Renata: Got it. Got it.

165
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.989
P20: When I'm doing a form like this, 

166
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.969
P20: I prefer to wait until I'm at my PC.

167
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:18.049
P20: If I'm just requesting, like prescription, or Hey, if I need to do a message, or Hey, I'm doing something. I can do that on the fly checking an appointment. I can do that on my phone. But if I'm submitting a claim or requesting benefits, or even requesting an Id.

168
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.780
P20: I would do that from my PC.

169
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.329
P20: As opposed to on my phone.

170
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:38.939
Renata: Okay, just one more question for you about this page on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the CHAMPVA application you are about to begin, based on the information you see on this page?

171
00:20:40.718 --> 00:20:43.510
P20: Loaded question, how do I feel about

172
00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.049
P20: the process that I'm about to do?

173
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:55.289
P20: 5. How do I feel about what CHAMPVA is, and what the benefits are, and all that type of stuff? 1, because nowhere on this page does it talk about

174
00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.549
P20: what it actually is or what you're applying for.

175
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:14.759
Renata: Okay. So to take it from that 1 to a 5 in terms of information, you'd need it to explain what CHAMPVA benefits are, the, you know, explain who's eligible or the cost sharing. That's sort of some of the information? Okay.

176
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.670
P20: And I'm assuming right for a little bit additional clarity. That's what's on this chart.

177
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.850
P20: Okay? So I'm not saying that. No, it's a 1, just because it stinks. Well.

178
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.399
P20: strictly to the question that you asked me, right

179
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:42.230
P20: here. How do I feel about what I'm about to do? Right? If it's the process of creating an application enrolling to 5 what I'm enrolling for to one. But I'm

180
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.589
P20: sure that that information is on this page, and that then it will become a 5.

181
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.719
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you.

182
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.770
P20: That 2

183
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:56.390
P20: and a little. Is that, too, like dude? Pick it up a notch like, in fact, is that too deep.

184
00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:14.129
Renata: No, no, we appreciate that level of detail. So at this point, I'm gonna have you scroll down the page a little bit further. There's a big blue box that says, sign in with a verified account underneath the sign in there's a link that says, Start your form without signing in. I'd like you to click that link without yeah, that one.

185
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:32.589
Renata: All right. So at this point I'm going to have you start filling out the form as if you were applying for a spouse and one other family member like a dependent child. I'll let you know when we're going to stop to ask some questions, but to help orient you, we're going to complete the 1st 3 sections of the form

186
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:47.830
Renata: just a few reminders. This is our testing site. You don't have to worry about the information you're entering, affecting your benefits, but feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, and as you go through the form. Please remember to think out loud. We'd like to hear any reactions as you're experiencing them.

187
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.570
P20: Awesome. Okay, and you said, I'm a veteran filling it out for my spouse and my dependent?

188
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.629
Renata: One, yeah, one dependent.

189
00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.910
P20: Perfect. Okay

190
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.849
P20: And I'm okay, just to freely keep going?

191
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.970
Renata: Go ahead and keep going. I'll let you know when we need to stop.

192
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.490
P20: The 3rd

193
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.990
P20: I didn't see grand Poobah muckety muck is that.

194
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:26.010
Renata: And we get that we can, we'll let the engineers know that they can add that. Yeah.

195
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:29.330
P20: Yeah.

196
00:23:43.484 --> 00:23:44.636
P20: Let's do that.

197
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.769
P20: Sorry. Page 2

198
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.080
P20: billing addresses in the United States. Uncheck the box.

199
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:48.890
P20: Oh, I can read let's do.

200
00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:53.200
P20: I was like, what? Oh, that makes sense.

201
00:24:54.670 --> 00:25:02.879
P20: I'm reading this too quickly and going too fast. Okay, so alright. Why, if I hit continue

202
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:07.860
P20: now.

203
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:18.170
P20: so I'm on one of 6, and even though I'm on page 3, should that be 3 of 6? Is that because it's a prototype? Should this be advancing, or is this all sub-steps of part one?

204
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:27.240
Renata: It's a great question. I'm going to be a little annoying, and answer it with another question which is based on what you're seeing in the form, what are your expectations with that?

205
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:41.549
P20: Well, if we have a progress bar and I'm clicking through and going continue, I would like to see some type of progress somewhere, stating that I'm at something right? So if this is all part, if this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of the signer information.

206
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.620
P20: you could say that you're while you're on 1:

207
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:53.379
P20: 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, right. Give me, if there's a progress bar, show me the actual progress.

208
00:25:54.130 --> 00:26:00.879
P20: Right? Otherwise, I mean, I have no problems. Just keep continuing and clicking through. But if you're gonna have a progress bar, actually show me

209
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:06.066
P20: like, sorry. Let me restate that. That's a little April ish?

210
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:13.809
P20: if it's setting the expectation of a progress bar.

211
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:24.150
P20: But then I've clicked on it 3 times, and there's no progress. I would have questions. What am I actually progressing towards? Is this all part of the the 1st step? And if it is.

212
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:29.519
P20: can there also be an indication that, hey, this is

213
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:35.740
P20: page 3 of of 5 of this 1st part. Right. Give me some type of.

214
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.159
Renata: Okay, got it. Appreciate that feedback.

215
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:48.350
P20: Okay.

216
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.670
P20: Oh, okay.

217
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.660
P20: Now, I have questions.

218
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.159
Renata: Alright! Let's hear them!

219
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.359
P20: Something real quick. Can I go back to the previous page? Sorry to add

220
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.620
Renata: Go ahead.

221
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:16.179
P20: Because I want to know. And I'll just do this real quick.

222
00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.210
Renata: That's fine.

223
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.419
P20: Okay, so how come

224
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:44.980
P20: like this is neat, I like this splash page. Right? This is what you're about to do. Now we're going to enter information about this blah blah! We're gonna move forward. How come this splash page wasn't here for part 1 of 6?

225
00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:54.239
Renata: Okay, so you would be expecting a similar splash page for signer information as seeing for sponsor information?

226
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.180
P20: Sure I mean it just a little

227
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.640
P20: like I. This was neat. I like this.

228
00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.310
Renata: Okay.

229
00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:05.179
P20: Maybe. Hey, this, we're about to ask you right? A quick heads up type of thing.

230
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.730
P20: And then still, the okay. So if this is 2 of 6, and I'm continuing.

231
00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:15.159
P20: give me a progress of 2a, 2B, 2C. Whatever

232
00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.610
P20: build the database. Yep, I like that.

233
00:28:21.932 --> 00:28:27.030
P20: Wait. I'm sorry if you need enter the sponsor's Name. Okay? Excellent.

234
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:33.820
P20: Alright. So January, 1,900. Pretty old. There.

235
00:28:41.475 --> 00:28:48.379
P20: This is another reason why I like to do the information on a computer. So I can hit back hit duplicate like doing this right

236
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:54.169
P20: when you're doing it on your phone, it's 1 page, one page like you can do other tabs, but it gets cumbersome.

237
00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:55.480
Renata: Okay.

238
00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:04.220
Renata: So our test system is a little bit finicky, and it won't take one through 9 consecutive. But if you flip the 8 and the 9. It's perfect.

239
00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.009
Renata: Just a little trick of the trick of the trade, there.

240
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.200
P20: All right.

241
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.439
P20: Do I need to? Here? I'll just

242
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.969
P20: this in chat, if I need to reference it

243
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.440
P20: outside, that when I was I,

244
00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:36.880
P20: for whatever reason I missed that outside. Mailing address.

245
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.530
P20: What was this one?

246
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.390
Renata: So I see you've gone over to the the duplicate tab that you made. You're looking at it again?

247
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.238
P20: I have questions. So

248
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.030
P20: I've already filled out my information,

249
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:11.240
P20: and now I see that in it I already said, "we pre-populated fields that are already based on the previous questions." My question is, why, why is this even here?

250
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:12.870
Renata: Okay.

251
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:23.999
P20: If if I did this here, why, even like we pre-populated, awesome. That's helpful. But the page itself doesn't even need to be here, since it's my like I was like I was looking to see

252
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:30.839
P20: Sorry to verbalize my thoughts right like, maybe this said, "Hey, what is your

253
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:36.389
P20: living address," you know, and this one now is saying, "what's your mailing address" like? Sometimes it's different, right?

254
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:50.370
P20: But this said, "your mailing." This is asking for the the exact same field names, exact same title, exact same information. So if you're just gonna repopulate, why, even this is a waste of real estate waste of a page. Just take the page out.

255
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.819
P20: Okay, so like the web page itself, doesn't need to exist.

256
00:30:55.220 --> 00:31:05.269
Renata: What I'm hearing is like, if you were able to redesign the form, would there be like a button that's like, "is it the same address?," and we just skip this, or would we just skip this page entirely?

257
00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:05.870
P20: Just skip.

258
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:06.420
Renata: Which?

259
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:11.760
P20: I skipped the whole page, since you're asking me the exact same question.

260
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:18.929
P20: Just skip the page. And the reason why that's important, right? From a user experience.

261
00:31:19.405 --> 00:31:25.280
P20: And I've used the "my mom" test a lot in these VA studies, right. So when my mom,

262
00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:35.089
P20: my mom will call me up, and she's like, "Hey, the computer is doing something stupid again." "Well, what did it do?" "I don't know." "Well, what was the last window you clicked?" "I don't know, I stopped reading," right?

263
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:43.559
P20: Her attention span for frustration, her patience is already at a minimum. So when she starts submitting

264
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:52.560
P20: forms or filling out stuff like after page 3, she just stops comprehending and reading, and she's just trying to move forward right?

265
00:31:52.850 --> 00:32:02.769
P20: So the goal here would be, even though she didn't do anything, even though she didn't enter in any information, she still had to come to the page,

266
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:09.720
P20: read through it, waste brain energy and activity, and then click on the button to hit, continue, and she's like "I'm done."

267
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:10.800
Renata: Got it.

268
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:17.430
P20: It wasn't that big of a deal like, but to her she's already frustrated and and checked out.

269
00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:23.100
P20: okay, mom, you know, hey, just share screen, you know. Call me, and we'll do it together right? So

270
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:33.179
P20: if this is the exact same, I would say, just take out the page altogether. One less click, one less page for somebody to have to read through like, especially if you're on a talk back.

271
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:46.189
P20: You have to sit there and click each field for it to talk to you, and you have to listen to it like this, would be it just to confirm like, yep, okay, that is my street address yet. Yep, right.

272
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:51.380
P20: because if I have to use talk back and I'm not able to skim through this like and have to listen to it

273
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:58.729
P20: that would irritate me. And I'm not my mom right? So well, I mean, I guess I am getting

274
00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.574
P20: older. Get off my lawn, right. But anyways

275
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:08.809
P20: So talk back would be even more frustrating with this sorry.

276
00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.763
Renata: Got it. No, thank you for sharing. That's good for us to hear.

277
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:18.120
P20: Same thing with the contact information you already asked me this. So please, right.

278
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:18.800
Renata: Okay.

279
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.400
P20: Like

280
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:29.580
P20: same thing alright. So now I'll ask you again, like the splash page you're gonna add up to 25 applicants. Continue moving forward?

281
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.710
P20: "Enter your information..."

282
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.990
P20: "enter my information and the information of any other applicants you want to enroll."

283
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.850
P20: That doesn't...enter your information?

284
00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.140
P20: So that's me?

285
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.610
P20: Am I entering?

286
00:33:53.300 --> 00:34:01.399
P20: But this is my applicant, so this should be my spouse, or this should be my dependent. So this statement is confusing, confusing. Why would I enter my information?

287
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:02.770
Renata: Okay.

288
00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.250
P20: So is this is this, do I enter my name?

289
00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:13.040
P20: But then down here? No, this is for the applicant, so this would have to be my wife, or my spouse, or my dependent.

290
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.840
P20: even though...

291
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.149
Renata: How much.

292
00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.749
P20: Here, it says, "enter your information."

293
00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:26.439
P20: it should say, "enter the information like the information of any applicants you want," like.

294
00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.320
Renata: Okay.

295
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.979
P20: Okay. Now I'm confused. Should this be me, or should this be the spouse and the dependent?

296
00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:42.500
Renata: I'm gonna do that annoying thing where I ask a question for your question again. So based on the content you're reading, what is your understanding of what it's asking for here?

297
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:47.370
P20: The applicant information I should be entering is my spouse or my dependent.

298
00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:58.169
P20: like I saw that applicant information I should now enter plus it says "Cancel adding this applicant," "continue" right. Everything on this

299
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.850
P20: except for everything but this

300
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:13.410
P20: stuff, it, everything. This is like I'm expecting. This is all about the applicant. But then, when I read this, "enter your information."

301
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.449
Renata: Okay. So that's the point where you're getting that confusion?

302
00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.079
P20: We can see somewhere. Yeah, like.

303
00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:23.299
P20: But there's only once one applicant to Field. So where should I be? Am I entering

304
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:30.380
P20: the 1st name of my information, And my spouse like, is this, too? Is this supposed to be 2 people? Like that's where I got confused.

305
00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:38.569
Renata: Got it. Okay, for the sake of today's session, let's add the spouse and the dependent in this section. But thank you for giving that feedback. That's very useful.

306
00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:46.150
P20: So she is junior, her birthday...

307
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:50.760
P20: She's an aquarius, so...

308
00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:55.289
P20: And then, just like in the media, she's much younger than I.

309
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:58.579
P20: Okay, not bad.

310
00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.959
P20: No, not I don't mind. Anyways, we're gonna move on

311
00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:09.210
P20: my sarcasm is, my humor is dry. Okay,

312
00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:59.190
P20: so is this page. Is this page? Is this page supposed to confirm, validate the existing information?

313
00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:08.109
P20: Or what is the point? What is the objective of this page? And before you ask me a question for my question. I would be expecting that, if you're gonna do that. Sorry.

314
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:18.039
P20: I would be expecting, if I have to look at this, it would say, "could you please confirm the applicants mailing address?" Otherwise the last page just said.

315
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.850
P20: "Do you want to use the same?" "Yes," move on

316
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.219
P20: again. This page would seem to be unnecessary.

317
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:42.411
Renata: Okay, I am gonna ask you a question, but not the question you expected, which is, would you rather have it say, "confirm, Jane A. DOE Jr.'s mailing address"? Or would you rather have after that dropdown, we skip this confirmation page altogether? [P20 nods to agree with skip confirmation page]

318
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.670
Renata: Okay, yeah. Great. Okay.

319
00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:55.799
P20: Now, if we do need a confirmation, would it?

320
00:37:56.130 --> 00:38:00.970
P20: And I've seen this on similar VA.gov forms.

321
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:07.830
P20: "Here's all the information that you entered. Can you confirm it?" Right? So at the very end, right before you hit submit.

322
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:12.489
P20: there's to be basically a confirmation page. So since we're going to do that there.

323
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:19.629
P20: We don't need to do this one. We don't need to do that other one. We don't need to do all of these other because we're gonna have one at the end, typically.

324
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.460
P20: so I would say, Yes, just skip this altogether.

325
00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.220
Renata: Got it. Thank you.

326
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:32.980
P20: Because again talk back would be a pain. Oh, pain!

327
00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.260
P20: It would go each line through this,

328
00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.380
Renata: Okay, Yup, Yup.

329
00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:55.099
P20: and you would have to click on it so right you would have to click on each field that's required. You have to see that it's required. Click on it. Listen to it! Oh, I clicked the wrong field, or I click the same like the screen is so small. So I clicked on the same field twice. And no, I want the bottom one like, Stop, you know.

330
00:38:57.178 --> 00:39:00.761
P20: If you couldn't tell, I'm frustrated with, never mind, anyways, we're gonna.

331
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.900
Renata: There were some. There were hints, there were signs.

332
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.780
P20: Yeah. Subtle, subtle hints.

333
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:18.230
P20: I bury Peter Griffin. Yes, we have more questions. Yeah. So sure that's.

334
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:24.960
Renata: And out of curiosity, if you're filling this out for real on va.gov, would you put your contact information here, or your spouse's contact information?

335
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.749
P20: That's a good question. It would, since it's

336
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:31.440
P20: Jane DOE's contact information, should be her contact info.

337
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:33.420
Renata: Okay. I'm just curious.

338
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.340
P20: But

339
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.760
P20: But what I've witnessed and seen with working with other vets is that

340
00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:54.809
P20: And older generation would be, no, she's not going to read it. She's not going to go to that email address. I'm going to be the point of contact for my family

341
00:39:55.030 --> 00:40:02.169
P20: so that that would enter their information every single time it's contact information.

342
00:40:02.793 --> 00:40:03.320
Renata: Got it.

343
00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.880
P20: What I would do is different from what I've seen other individuals.

344
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:13.990
P20: So I entered it here because it was auto-fillable, and I just wanted to move forward.

345
00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:18.519
P20: But typically I would put my spouse or my dependents'. Well,

346
00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:26.699
P20: I wouldn't put my dependents' information in there because they're not ever going to check. That's not reliable for them to check their email.

347
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.959
P20: So for the dependent, I would put mine

348
00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:35.759
P20: for my spouse, I would put theirs. But I've seen others do. No, it's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.

349
00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:36.490
P20: Right?

350
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:37.160
Renata: Okay.

351
00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:38.890
Renata: Noted.

352
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.490
P20: Oh, that's right.

353
00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.270
P20: Where's Jane [Doe]?

354
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.419
P20: And here's her birth certificate.

355
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:50.300
P20: Continue

356
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.009
P20: Oh, good call, because we never actually.

357
00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.619
P20: it's weird that we're doing it this late. But okay.

358
00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.860
P20: that would wait. Wait. Oh, date of marriage!

359
00:41:12.953 --> 00:41:16.349
P20: You better know it if you don't know the exact date. Do

360
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:19.721
P20: you usually do your homework.

361
00:41:20.846 --> 00:41:23.907
P20: Oh, that's right. She was born in 2000. So

362
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:26.621
P20: there would have to be

363
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.309
P20: 2025.

364
00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:38.880
P20: Okay, anyways. Sorry I was laughing, my own humor anyways moving on.

365
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.000
P20: hang on! I want to fine.

366
00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.459
Renata: You're clicking that edit button?

367
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:12.210
P20: Yep, so the reason for my thoughts.

368
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:19.310
P20: I just entered 6 pages of information, and I only have, what is this, 5 fields that I'm looking at?

369
00:42:19.991 --> 00:42:23.500
P20: So if I'm reviewing my applicants shouldn't.

370
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:24.890
P20: If this.

371
00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:30.870
P20: if

372
00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:46.860
P20: all the pages of information that it's provided, and there's only 6 fields. Does that mean the other fields were not applicable, were not important, or they were not retained, so I went to hit edit to see if it would show me all the 6 pages which it started to do. So I canceled it.

373
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:50.510
P20: but it was just weird. 

374
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:55.699
P20: If these are the 6 fields that are important enough to confirm,

375
00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:03.327
P20: Did I really need 6 pages of data for said spouse? Or is it like, that's

376
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:15.750
P20: That's a super interface question rather than because

377
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:20.229
P20: it's the government. It's the VA. So there would need to be

378
00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:24.149
P20: 62 different pages of information about your your spouse.

379
00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:26.549
P20: but I still have that question.

380
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:31.210
P20: Are these the only ones that are pertinent, or valid, or required, or needed?

381
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.860
P20: For this form? And the other is just

382
00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:42.219
P20: retained information? Like, sorry. So I'm verbally processing my own question, my own concern as I'm asking it.

383
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:43.010
P20: Oh.

384
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.740
Renata: All right.

385
00:43:44.140 --> 00:44:01.479
P20: As I fill out this form, are these the only 6 fields that are required for the form, and the other 5 and a half pages are needed for paperwork retention about the spouse that may or may not be used or access later on?

386
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:07.530
P20: Or are all 6 pages and like, do? Does that make sense? Does my question? Does my concern?

387
00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:29.180
Renata: Yeah, yeah, I think I understand what you're talking about. Let's talk, though, about like ideal world here, magic wand situation. What would you want to see in that "review your applicant" box for Jane A. DOE...Jane a DOE. I haven't had enough caffeine today...for your spouse in this situation. What would you want to see there, in terms of content?

388
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:35.150
P20: If I'm reviewing the applicant, it would be all the information they just provided.

389
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.750
Renata: Okay, so you like, all of it?

390
00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:55.270
P20: Yes, because and well, so I here's 6 fields, but I need to review my applicant. So that means in order for me to go and do. Here's our social. Here's our, this, here's or that. Here's like, here's all the information I just provided. Now I have to click edit open up a new page.

391
00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:01.830
P20: Right, redo all of that in information. Again, if you want me to review it, I have to do the due diligence of reviewing it right or

392
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.100
P20: I'm not reviewing it. Then don't even ask me.

393
00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:05.800
Renata: Got it.

394
00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:10.759
P20: And from a user perspective, it just means, now I have to click on a link

395
00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:16.639
P20: and open up a page like, here's your process. And when you're about to edit

396
00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:28.619
P20: or review your applicant, you're deviating from the main process flow. You create another process flow. You're going to new pages. You're like doing all this. And then when let's say it's all, then you got to come back to this point. And

397
00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.679
P20: so there's from a user experience, 

398
00:45:34.076 --> 00:45:40.740
P20: That's my road bump, my speed bump, there.

399
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.770
Renata: Got it.

400
00:45:41.984 --> 00:45:45.629
P20: So either show me all the information that I need to review, or don't show me any.

401
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.090
P20: And then confirm to me at the end.

402
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:58.854
Renata: Okay, alright, noted. If you go ahead and add one more applicant to this like I mentioned it at the start of this section, a dependent child.

403
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:01.890
P20: So here's the other thing.

404
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:02.710
Renata: Okay.

405
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:07.020
P20: I click on. Here's reviewing. And again, I'm gonna go back to talk back.

406
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:10.219
P20: talk back. I want to click on this.

407
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:14.400
P20: There's only 6 fields. I need to review the rest of it now I have to hit edit.

408
00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:36.350
P20: Now a new window is going to come through talkbacks. Gonna give me the description of the page, and it's the same the page one of 6. And then I have to click on each field. I have to hit. Next talk back is going to give me the splash introduction of that second page. I'm gonna have to go through each of the fields right? So if if we're talking about you tech assisted technology like

409
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.510
P20: this.

410
00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:51.263
P20: not only does creating a separate process flow, now it interrupts the user experience. Now you add assistive technology in there, and it's gonna even slow down or weigh down that additional

411
00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:54.410
P20: new branch. All right.

412
00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:55.699
P20: I'm gonna move on.

413
00:46:57.373 --> 00:47:02.379
P20: "Enter the applicant information for the applicant you're applying for." See, now, this makes sense like

414
00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.570
P20: the other sentence was so weird.

415
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.090
P20: How come this one's fine?

416
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:14.859
Renata: So you want this sentence on that other one that was mentioning your information or the the applicant?

417
00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:18.430
P20: I don't really need this one. I'm just saying this one's clear.

418
00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:20.370
P20: And then my question got it.

419
00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.400
P20: How come?

420
00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:26.280
P20: Why is why is there a different set of text?

421
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:42.479
Renata: Well, this is our our prototype of the final experience. It's not the final, the the final final V 20, or whatever that's going to go to production. So there are a couple of little quirks in the content and stuff that we might see through here.

422
00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:44.220
P20: Was this intended?

423
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.970
P20: Was it.

424
00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:58.160
Renata: I don't believe it was intentional. I don't believe that the the difference in the description was intentional, but of the 2 of them. If I was to ask you to rate the the 2, would you prefer the second one or the 1st one?

425
00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:06.560
P20: And the reason why? I asked that is because each of these others, when you ask me for my mailing address, then you ask it for me again, and then you ask the great and

426
00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.659
P20: the text

427
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:18.129
P20: has stayed the same. And in this prototype I don't know if this is dude, let it go move on right. But this is the only one that had

428
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.880
P20: alternate text.

429
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:23.619
Renata: For this page of the form?

430
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:31.560
P20: Right. My mailing address send the contact information was the same. It looked like it was just reproduction of the page. This one looks like it's like you

431
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:43.060
P20: for a spouse applicant information. It's this. And instead of copying it over for spouse, you just recreated it from a from a developer perspective. Sorry my mind is going developer, like when you created these pages

432
00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:54.350
P20: was a lot of these mailing information copy/paste. Here's where we have this. We have this template, and for contact for applicant information, we have this one for the spouse, and instead of

433
00:48:55.010 --> 00:49:01.269
P20: duplicating it for the the dependent looks like you just generated a whole new page.

434
00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:06.807
P20: Sorry, anyways, whatever. I want to move on.

435
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:09.280
P20: John Jay, Jack!

436
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:18.940
P20: Jack, a whole Jack DOE junior.

437
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:24.690
P20: No, no, you know what he's gonna...

438
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.019
P20: Make me sound anymore.

439
00:49:28.655 --> 00:49:34.590
P20: And Jack, Jack, why, actually, I like that, Jack. Jack. No, because he still needs to have DOE.

440
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:42.339
P20: Anyways. Jack-jack was born in 2020 shotgun wedding 2024.

441
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.560
P20: Boom.

442
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:05.870
P20: yeah. Like this page where you Jane A. DOE's

443
00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:13.280
P20: address like it. It looked like you, replicated, duplicated every single time, except for the applicant page.

444
00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.320
P20: Again, take this off. It's not needed, so I have to talk back.

445
00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:24.650
P20: Oh!

446
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.420
P20: Did every page have a cancel? Adding this applicant before.

447
00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:37.510
Renata: Gonna do that annoying thing again. What do you recall? They all had that cancel button?

448
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:38.819
P20: No, that's why I'm asking

449
00:50:39.535 --> 00:50:44.730
P20: I recognize it some places, but I don't know if I remember seeing it at all places.

450
00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:45.650
Renata: Got it.

451
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:47.979
P20: I don't know.

452
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:54.180
P20: I, anyways, it's neat.

453
00:50:54.280 --> 00:51:02.569
P20: I like it that it's here because you're like, oh, wait a minute. I don't maybe. Oh, you know what would actually be better in this line of thought.

454
00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:10.550
P20: Shoot! I don't have his mailing address. Can I save progress and come back later?

455
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:16.170
P20: Right. So I like how you have cancel and we're done. No, no, forget it. He's not in the will anymore. He's done.

456
00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.000
P20: I like that.

457
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.899
P20: But could we also have a button? Could you just.

458
00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:24.621
P20: honey-do list, can we? Can you just

459
00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.109
P20: Can we create a save and come back later button?

460
00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:35.658
Renata: Yeah. So we're doing the unauthenticated version of this. So this would be like if you were on va.gov, and didn't log in.

461
00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:59.270
Renata: But if you were logged in, you'd have the ability to save in progress. And at the beginning of the form, I think on that very 1st page that you looked at in the form it said you could log in because there's a lot of information. Do you think that's sufficient. Or would you want that reminder in a couple of places in the form like, Hey sign in, maybe, maybe, save or.

462
00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:05.969
P20: How about if you need to save and come back, please sign in?

463
00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:18.680
P20: right. I do remember that Blurb and I do understand the difference. And that's well, you know, Dude, that's the brakes of not logging in right, that that's your own. Suck it right. But I'm sorry.

464
00:52:20.293 --> 00:52:25.979
P20: Forget about it. Right? Anyways,

465
00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:32.400
P20: be a little bit more professional here. Mental note to myself.

466
00:52:32.982 --> 00:52:37.830
P20: So I apologize. But just something

467
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:42.894
P20: if you need to save and come back. Please sign in

468
00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.040
Renata: Got it.

469
00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:49.460
P20: You know, just something anyways, continuing phone number.

470
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:55.639
Renata: And I think you mentioned before, for here you'd probably put your contact info, because this is a dependent? [P20 nods] Okay.

471
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:21.095
P20: No, it can't be a stepchild because she was younger.

472
00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:25.099
P20: so yeah, it would have to be viable.

473
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.380
P20: Sorry I'm trying. I'm over analyzing this fictitious family that I just created.

474
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:44.750
P20: Could be stepchild. But no, she's only 25 at this point 24 when the child was born, and it's not like she had children, or maybe actually drama, she does. This is her child from sorry, anyway.

475
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:50.340
P20: Now to move on upload birth certificate, upload a file.

476
00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:58.820
Renata: So I mentioned before, I can give you a dummy Pdf to upload. Would you like me to provide that at this point? Okay, I'm gonna drop that in the chat.

477
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:00.000
P20: Could I

478
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:07.250
P20: upload it's required, so can I hit? Oh, you must upload a file. Actually, you know what? Let me just grab. I'm not.

479
00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:14.389
P20: Let's grab actually no go ahead and give me something.

480
00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:15.050
P20: There it is.

481
00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:16.310
Renata: Alright, so I put a Pdf.

482
00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:17.490
Renata: in the chat

483
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.519
P20: I got it.

484
00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:25.439
Renata: And we can use this same Pdf file for any other pages that request a file to be uploaded.

485
00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:26.460
P20: Sure.

486
00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:44.420
P20: Okay, sorry. So I was just seeing if I could break your page. I uploaded it.

487
00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:51.670
P20: Check the box right that it's uploaded, and then, if I deleted it, would it allow me to continue? And it did not. It caught it, so I re

488
00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:54.850
P20: uploaded it, and I've moving forward.

489
00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:56.070
Renata: Got it.

490
00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:59.479
P20: Upload proof of marriage one.

491
00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:19.630
P20: Okay

492
00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:22.880
P20: Oh, okay.

493
00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:25.870
P20: I was like what I'm like, wait.

494
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.509
Renata: Yeah, so what is this page asking for, in your own words?

495
00:55:30.418 --> 00:55:32.900
P20: Sorry. So I was reading that I was like, wait.

496
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:39.719
P20: Jack, was the biological. No, that's right, because we switched over because of drama that I, in my.

497
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:42.929
Renata: Love keeping track of our fictional families that we invent.

498
00:55:43.154 --> 00:55:44.950
P20: What was going on. I was like no.

499
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:45.410
Renata: Yeah.

500
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:56.799
P20: Wait. No, because we wanted drama, and the hamster wheel was turning. It was on lunch, a little bit. Had to jump back in the wheel. It took me a second but anyways, it's the marriage license to show that

501
00:55:56.950 --> 00:56:01.750
P20: Jane and John DOE are married because

502
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:08.360
P20: this Jack Jack is actually Jane's biological, and it's John's bonus child. Okay.

503
00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.310
Renata: Got it. Okay.

504
00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:11.019
P20: You asked me for what? My

505
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:16.939
P20: in my own words, sorry, so fictitious family, moving on.

506
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:32.359
Renata: All right, I'm going to have you stop here. I'm going to ask a couple of questions. So on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this initial section of the form.

507
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.840
P20: Absolutely easy. You said 5 was easy?

508
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:36.450
Renata: 5 was very easy. Yeah.

509
00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:37.420
P20: Yeah, 6.

510
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:41.930
Renata: Okay.

511
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:42.330
P20: Oh!

512
00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:42.920
Renata: Yes?

513
00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:47.959
P20: Oh, sorry for serious. It would be a 5, but with talkback.

514
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:51.370
P20: It would bring it down to maybe a 1 or a 2.

515
00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:52.460
Renata: Okay.

516
00:56:52.460 --> 00:57:05.590
P20: Because over the the additional confirmations, and then the reading. And then here's the additional steps. And like with talk with the assisted technology, it wouldn't be as easy right?

517
00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.950
P20: And I don't.

518
00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:16.849
P20: Are, are you familiar with using talkback on on a phone at all, as a developer person?

519
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:27.810
Renata: Haven't used it personally, but I've been in sessions where folks are using it, though, so I'm familiar with it, with walking with other folks through these forms. And these experiences? Yeah.

520
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:43.819
P20: Yeah. So in introducing talkback or assisted technology really does change the level of ease of use for any particular web page. Right? So, hey, how easy was this? This was a 5, right? Because I got to blow it up because I got to do it on the PC.

521
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:46.979
P20: But switching on your phone and going this like.

522
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:56.170
P20: if you get a user that's like, if you had me do this solely on my phone and using talk back my experience numerical value would

523
00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:57.899
P20: 1 or 2 right.

524
00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:05.639
Renata: Okay. So if we were doing this on talk back, what would bring it from that 1 or a 2 up to that very easy, that 5?

525
00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:23.052
P20: Perfectly valid question. Thank you for asking that. It would be the less amount of fields that I had to had talk back, read back to me. Right? So that would be the taking those additional pages out, taking the additional redundancy questions out, taking out right that that

526
00:58:25.569 --> 00:58:33.329
P20: at minimizing, reducing, minimizing, minimizing the 

527
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:43.519
P20: well, also the buttons, though too minimizing the and then the validation process and having to edit to a new page.

528
00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:52.889
P20: What would be needed to bring it to a 5? It would be a better streamlining of these forms.

529
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:56.469
P20: That would be I and I don't mean it to sound

530
00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:04.825
P20: you know pompous from that perspective, but it would be, but

531
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:08.930
P20: it would be a redesign of that of the

532
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:11.929
P20: of the process flow of all the pages.

533
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.629
Renata: Okay, so few things.

534
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:15.260
P20: But I'm using sorry.

535
00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.340
Renata: Oh, please go ahead!

536
00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:24.540
P20: When I'm using talkback, you you have to click

537
00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:31.969
P20: each field for it to read through, or if you don't want to do that it just reads the whole entire page.

538
00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:32.730
Renata: Hmm.

539
00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:35.610
P20: And so if you're validating information.

540
00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:42.309
P20: Okay, okay, okay. Oh, oh, wait! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on, you know. That's not right. You know, and

541
00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:47.459
P20: or you have to listen to it to like. With this it would read through.

542
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:52.680
P20: I either have it set to read through the whole page. I have to sit there and intently listen.

543
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.900
P20: or I have to click on each

544
00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:01.540
P20: each field for it to read me to. So it this.

545
01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.150
Renata: Got it.

546
01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:15.909
P20: From a user experience. This process, this 5 is really easy to do on a PC. How could we do this for a mobile? Or how could we use assistive technology?

547
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:20.474
P20: how would we get it up to a 5 brainstorming?

548
01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:29.570
P20: like, I said, reduction of additional pages reduction of buttons, and continues a reduction of fields that need to be validated or filled out.

549
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:37.639
P20: But the the challenge here, I see, is the person is not logged in.

550
01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:41.000
P20: So kinda you get what you pay for like.

551
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:58.409
P20: Buddy, or person, if you don't, if you have issues with your assistant technology, and it's a 1. Then maybe you should log in for it to pull. All of this information, and all you have to do is click and listen right? Because it's pulling it from your profile.

552
01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.560
P20: So maybe

553
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:14.750
P20: from a user experience, it's not just a hey. If you don't log in. You're not gonna save it's hey? If you don't log in and you're using assisted technology.

554
01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:18.389
P20: this is really not the option for you, right like.

555
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.590
P20: if they're even gonna read that right?

556
01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.400
P20: So it it would be something like that, I guess, is, where? How do you get to a 5

557
01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.129
P20: with a person choosing not to log in. It's it's a challenge.

558
01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.130
Renata: Okay. Well, okay.

559
01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:46.840
P20: Is there a way that you can pull information from the users phone? If you don't want to log in, do you have this information available that you could pull from, you know, I don't know, because then you're gonna get old that don't have.

560
01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:52.140
P20: Well, I don't label the open. You're gonna get people that just don't have the information. I don't know.

561
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:54.329
P20: anyways sorry. I don't know how much time.

562
01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:57.980
Renata: Good news is, we're not having you redesign it at this point. We just wanted to know your

563
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:07.459
Renata: feedback on that. That's quite alright. At this point you can click no on. Do you have another applicant to add and hit Continue.

564
01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:11.249
P20: Why did it do that?

565
01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.769
Renata: That might be a little quirk of the system.

566
01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.060
P20: And now you're not doing it.

567
01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:20.270
P20: And I go back to previous page.

568
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:27.019
P20: Okay, so let's see, are you gonna do it again?

569
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:29.840
P20: No. Why did you do it that one time.

570
01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:31.610
Renata: Hmm.

571
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:36.439
P20: Why did you just do it again? You wait! What?

572
01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.649
P20: Hold on?

573
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:46.210
P20: Oh, wait!

574
01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:47.749
P20: You weren't joining.

575
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:48.900
Renata: Interesting.

576
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:56.479
P20: But if I click here oh, hey, sorry. I don't know if

577
01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.279
P20: is that. Okay, that I took the time. Apparently. If you click, yes, it'll

578
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:05.849
P20: you have clickable fields that are outside the radial buttons.

579
01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.250
Renata: Interesting.

580
01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:20.929
Renata: interesting observation. Thank you for for stopping there and and playing around with it. But yeah, you can go ahead and click. Continue, we'll definitely show this to our engineers.

581
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:25.460
P20: Oh, you have. Oh, wait! Hold on a second. You have multiple.

582
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:34.309
P20: Okay, maybe this is just the same field.

583
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:41.650
P20: Sorry that was me going. Look all the sarcasm and stupid, dry humor.

584
01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:46.160
P20: Maybe it wasn't so bad of a thing, because I provided value. Add

585
01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:53.730
P20: that that oh, that was me tooting my own parent, too. So I apologize. Okay, anyways, we're moving on.

586
01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:04.429
Renata: Alright before you fill this question out. I just like you to take a look at this page and let me know if you have any questions, if anything stands out to you?

587
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.650
P20: Anything stands out.

588
01:04:11.328 --> 01:04:18.060
P20: So this is asking if any of the applicants, either my spouse, my child, have medicare, and if they do I need to report it?

589
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.460
Renata: Okay,

590
01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.569
P20: Would that be an example? Of what stands out.

591
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:40.650
Renata: Oh, I mean, we're just asking if anything does, again. We're not testing knowledge or abilities. Staying on this page for just a minute, thinking back to what you saw on the very 1st page we looked at today. Do you remember if it mentioned Medicare at all?

592
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.280
P20: It did not.

593
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:45.650
P20: Well, let me rephrase that. I don't remember it.

594
01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:46.390
P20: Re.

595
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:47.240
Renata: Okay.

596
01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:52.500
Renata: And why do you think it's asking for Medicare information?

597
01:04:55.250 --> 01:05:02.180
P20: Because, it's it's a form of insurance that would either supersede, replace or

598
01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:08.640
P20: What is it called postpone? It would offset

599
01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.350
P20: offset some of the benefits that you get.

600
01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:13.039
P20: As far as I understand.

601
01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.290
Renata: Alright

602
01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:15.749
P20: Are you looking up.

603
01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:32.520
Renata: Up at the top of the page next to the VA Logo. It says, "1010 d Extended CHAMPVA application," and then in parentheses, it says, "includes 10-7959c". What does 10-7959c mean to you? If anything.

604
01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:36.669
P20: It's 1 of the new forms for Medicaid, if I'm correct.

605
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:46.030
P20: Oh, no, I was completely right. I was way off.

606
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:50.489
P20: So, okay. So I have.

607
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:56.239
P20: I don't know. I have questions, but maybe I'm outside. Sorry I will wait, for I will only answer the question you've asked.

608
01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.570
Renata: No, go ahead. You can ask your question.

609
01:05:59.483 --> 01:06:02.899
P20: So right? So

610
01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:08.620
P20: from from this perspective, like, here's here's that form right. But if I go back to this.

611
01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:28.380
P20: the concern the confusion, the whatever I have right is, apply for CHAMPVA benefits, and you were looking at 1010 d. Right? So here it all is, nowhere in this form does it talk about Medicare. Right? Here's all this stuff. And then all of a sudden, to continue.

612
01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:40.229
P20: now step 4 of 6. We're bringing in Medicare information. Wait a minute, you didn't inform me of that. I didn't know. Here's all the stuff that I'm going to need to have. Here's what you need to apply.

613
01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:45.140
P20: Nowhere in here does it say that you need that? So why are we adding that now, does this?

614
01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:51.169
P20: Does this prevent my application? Does this offset my application? Will this null and void my applications?

615
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:58.539
P20: And the fact that I didn't log in? I chose not to log in, so it's not going to save my information. But now

616
01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:00.869
P20: shoot! I don't have this ready.

617
01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:09.319
P20: What am I going to do now? Like? There's there's a bunch of unneeded drama that I can now see entered into the equation.

618
01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:14.660
P20: So that's point number one, and then point number 2 like, now

619
01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:20.910
P20: here, we've entered like you. Just here's the extended application now includes this right?

620
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:23.880
P20: Why?

621
01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:31.670
P20: in this initial splash page, why did it not say Hey, by the way. As you go through this, it's only going to take 15 min.

622
01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:42.860
P20: Right? Here's all this stuff that you need. We're actually also going to include. Here's this additional form. And here's the additional documentation you're gonna need for that form that's required

623
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:48.859
P20: to finish this application right? So it's kind of a not a catch 22

624
01:07:49.692 --> 01:07:54.479
P20: false advertising a catfish type of thing. Right? So that's like.

625
01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:54.820
Renata: Okay.

626
01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:59.380
P20: It lured me in. And now it's not what you told me. It's gonna be.

627
01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:10.979
Renata: Okay, so what would help set your expectations either on that initial page or where we're at right here, where it's asking about medicare to sort of

628
01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:22.429
Renata: let you know, like, we're filling out actually 1010 d. And and also this other form which may or may not include Medicare information like what what would be useful to you?

629
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:27.029
P20: Gather your information. Here's what's needed to apply like

630
01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:31.049
P20: in this 1st splash page like, give it to me right?

631
01:08:31.210 --> 01:08:38.130
P20: And then, so that it's a 2 part. Answer right 1st off is, inform me.

632
01:08:38.975 --> 01:08:52.420
P20: Let me make the choice. If I want to continue moving forward right? Because, I continued, without signing in, because I was like, Oh, yeah, I got all this information. I'm fine. And now I kind of catfished and and and and

633
01:08:52.819 --> 01:08:53.750
P20: you know.

634
01:08:54.247 --> 01:08:59.249
P20: Shoot. I don't have this information. Now I'm gonna have to do this all over again. Right? So give it to me here.

635
01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:04.189
P20: And then, once we're here right in the process.

636
01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.069
P20: So

637
01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:19.729
P20: again, I'm still having problems with how you guys are counting how you folks are counting the 4 of 6 or the 4 of whatever the steps. Right? Here's the progress and such like. That's so problematic. But when you get to here

638
01:09:29.529 --> 01:09:42.200
P20: like, I said, so it's going to be a 2 part, right? Is this information? And I don't know enough about 10-7959c, right? Is this information required? I know it's required.

639
01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:48.229
P20: Is it required, in order to complete the application for CHAMPVA?

640
01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:49.880
Renata: Okay.

641
01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:55.599
P20: Is this medicare required in order to complete the CHAMPVA application?

642
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:58.298
P20: If it isn't, but it just

643
01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:04.874
P20: it's not required, but it will slow down the process, or it's not required, but it will

644
01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:11.229
P20: a cause, deviations or cause delays over here

645
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:18.849
P20: Then give me the option to move forward. Hey? By the way, we've talked about this right? We added the splash screen.

646
01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:23.280
P20: But when you get to this point, if you have this, or if you don't have this.

647
01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:28.269
P20: Give me the choice to continue submitting the application for CHAMPVA.

648
01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:32.039
P20: even though I even though I'm not adding this information.

649
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:38.589
P20: and then give me the warning that submitting it may delay outcomes because they'll have to ask for it later on.

650
01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:39.550
P20: right?

651
01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:47.230
P20: Because what that allows me to do is shoot. I don't have the information, but I still need to get this in today.

652
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:56.410
P20: I'm at the deadline. I might have cut off. I'm at a whatever like. Here's my timeline. I need to submit this. I know it's going to delay the process, but

653
01:10:56.630 --> 01:11:00.309
P20: what I can then do is go back, get all that information

654
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:10.789
P20: and then come back. Maybe edit my application, or maybe do an addendum to my application, or send it in kind of like. When you have your taxes, you file your taxes, and you're like, Hey.

655
01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.119
P20: deductions right?

656
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.620
P20: Well, you could

657
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:22.730
P20: file your taxes and then just amend the deductions later on. So give me, if that's possible. Give me that option as well.

658
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:29.800
Renata: Okay, that's really useful. You can go ahead and select no and click Continue for this page.

659
01:11:31.727 --> 01:11:36.360
Renata: This is just a little bug, you can go ahead and click no on that page as well.

660
01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.440
P20: Thank you.

661
01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.860
P20: Alright sorry. Click! No on this. What.

662
01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:50.704
Renata: Yeah, and then click, continue, this is a bug. This page shouldn't be showing up here.

663
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:51.820
P20: Okay.

664
01:11:53.610 --> 01:12:15.969
Renata: all right. So when you click, continue at this point, I would like you to go ahead and assume that you have a private health insurance plan for both your spouse and dependent child. Go ahead and add that plan now, and like, I said, before you can use fake information you can use that file I provided to you for uploads, and I'll stop you when we're gonna talk again.

665
01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:20.720
P20: I'm gonna do a similar call that we just did with Medicare.

666
01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:21.670
Renata: Okay.

667
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.900
P20: This is

668
01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:35.300
P20: nowhere in this initial splash page. Or is it saying that I also need any existing medicare Medical insurance information, private medical insurance?

669
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.040
Renata: Okay. So you want them more explicitly called out, Okay.

670
01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.410
P20: Yep, now

671
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:46.569
P20: I know it right. We talked about it in the beginning, right? I know, because I've been doing research and like, Hey, this is what I need to do.

672
01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.820
P20: But from here again

673
01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:56.609
P20: report other insurances. If you don't have this, now go ahead and hit continue. You can always come back like, give me an option to continue moving forward.

674
01:12:56.870 --> 01:13:10.399
P20: I do have other health insurance, I just don't have it now. Right. Give me an option to say. Still submit now, even though I know what's gonna delay. But at least I get my ticket in. I get my ticket number right.

675
01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:10.740
Renata: Okay.

676
01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.590
P20: Now serving blah blah right? So

677
01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:22.580
P20: That's frustrating anyways. And you said, do yes, and continue?

678
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:23.810
Renata: Yes, please.

679
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:29.219
P20: Alright the script.

680
01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:36.070
Renata: And just a quick time check. We're about 9 min to the end of the session. Do you have a couple of minutes to go over, or do you have a hard stop?

681
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:42.190
P20: Do, because no, no, I don't have a hard stop. I do have more time for you, because I was a little loquacious and.

682
01:13:42.688 --> 01:13:46.610
P20: Talk a lot. So no problem. No, no, that's totally fine.

683
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:50.310
P20: Different rabbit trails like dude. Shut up! We're on a time clock.

684
01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:55.459
Renata: No, no, your feedback's been very helpful we just want to be mindful of your time.

685
01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:57.790
P20: Wow!

686
01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:58.990
P20: Wait what?

687
01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:08.084
P20: Oh, never mind. Sorry. yeah, I got help me. No

688
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:13.820
P20: I think it's an HMO.

689
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:16.210
P20: I don't remember

690
01:14:18.001 --> 01:14:26.439
P20: for, provider we're just gonna move forward. "Cancel adding this plan," what happens if I cancel adding this plan?

691
01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.499
P20: Does this start me back over?

692
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:36.540
Renata: Where do you think it would start you back over in the form?

693
01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:40.900
P20: Do you want me to do? "You have other health insurance? Yes or no?"

694
01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.120
Renata: Got it

695
01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.770
P20: I would hope that's where it takes me. Can I try it?

696
01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:46.260
Renata: Okay, yeah. Feel free!

697
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:50.250
P20: Okay, perfect.

698
01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:53.009
P20: Sorry all

699
01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:03.950
P20: sorry. I'm gonna try to sake of time. I'm gonna move forward.

700
01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.429
Renata: Oh, no, you're fine! You're fine!

701
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:07.679
P20: Insurance termination date. Okay? Yeah.

702
01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.240
P20: January one.

703
01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:15.522
P20: In the year 3000. Okay, seriously fine.

704
01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.690
P20: You won't let me create it. But you'll let me.

705
01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.410
P20: Oh, sorry my what?

706
01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:29.160
P20: That doesn't make any sense.

707
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:32.189
P20: What happens if my insurance ends next.

708
01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:34.800
P20: So what does it make me...

709
01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:41.389
P20: To be October to October? No? Well, no, because it's January to January this because we're in 2025.

710
01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.729
P20: And you're right.

711
01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.650
P20: This should be. Oh, 2025! Wait!

712
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:50.029
P20: Hold on!

713
01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:01.920
P20: Sorry! Hold on! I was trying to do now, the insurance termination date.

714
01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:12.830
P20: If I have my own private insurance right now.

715
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:13.320
P20: And.

716
01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:21.770
P20: Right. It goes from January to January. I sign up in October. That's when the enrollment period, and then your insurance starts from 2025 to 2026.

717
01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:29.410
P20: So let's say, if I did 2025, right? It lasts a year.

718
01:16:31.190 --> 01:16:40.580
P20: My termination date is well. No, I see. Maybe. Okay, cause it would. The new one starts. So

719
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:47.359
P20: technically, this would be the calendar year, because the next year is when it would start again. 

720
01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:54.499
P20: Oh, yeah, yeah, this doesn't make any sense. Please provide a valid current or past date for termination.

721
01:16:56.310 --> 01:17:09.749
Renata: Okay. So just to make sure that I'm understanding correctly. So you're you're thinking about policy dates as being from like January 1st of the given year to the 31st of December of the same year, so.

722
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:10.740
P20: Policy is, yeah.

723
01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:21.059
Renata: Okay, alright. So you're expecting to be able to put in a future date here to indicate like, "Hey, it's July. But I have health insurance through the end of the year." Is that correct?

724
01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:21.660
P20: Yeah.

725
01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:22.570
Renata: Okay.

726
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:27.370
P20: Because, even though, even though we're in July right now, I'm submitting the application

727
01:17:28.635 --> 01:17:43.479
P20: I don't want to say we all know the VA is not really very fast. So whenever it gets around to doing the application and getting to this, who knows if it's gonna be January? If it's going to be August, September, October, November, December right?

728
01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.669
P20: Who knows how long this is gonna take?

729
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:56.400
P20: So I'm not going to go and terminate my health insurance right now, because I've applied for that, or I submitted an application for this. So this should be able to accept

730
01:17:56.710 --> 01:18:02.150
P20: my actual termination date, which is December 2025.

731
01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:08.029
Renata: Got it. Okay. The form might let you allow to advance without

732
01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.320
Renata: a current date. Let's see if it'll let you. If you click continue.

733
01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.730
P20: Secretly change the sugar in this coffee. Let's see if they notice.

734
01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:18.040
Renata: No? Okay, that might be.

735
01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:23.439
Renata: Yeah. Let's let's put 2024 in and see if it'll let you advance just for the the sake of time.

736
01:18:23.690 --> 01:18:33.699
P20: Here's a question: it's knowledgeable enough to say, Hey, get a normal date. But look at this. I started in 2025, but it ends in 2024. And we're all okay with this?

737
01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:39.810
Renata: Right, so you would expect it to give you a an error message there like these need to be?

738
01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:45.030
P20: The termination date can't can't end. Can't be before you actually even start it.

739
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.419
Renata: Got it. Okay? Noted.

740
01:18:48.330 --> 01:18:57.759
P20: Well cause it was doing it so fine with everything else. Right it has to be with. And here's the year that it has to be between. It's a fictitious year. You can't do this. You can't do that. So

741
01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:06.080
P20: anyways, we're gonna move on through. Yes, we're gonna continue.

742
01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:07.580
P20: No, nothing.

743
01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:13.460
P20: Continue application, which I've been. There has a good password in both of them.

744
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:16.919
P20: Oh, I'm sorry, Field.

745
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:18.109
P20: Keep going.

746
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:20.090
Renata: So them is fine. Yeah, you can keep going.

747
01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:25.399
P20: Upload, a file, upload a file.

748
01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:30.220
Renata: Alright gonna pause you here.

749
01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.589
P20: And same thing. Why, if there's only these 3 fields

750
01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:35.200
Renata: Yeah, to see all of them?

751
01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.720
P20: Is blah blah all that stuff blah blah.

752
01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:49.809
Renata: Okay. So question here, it's that 1 to 5 scale again on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the Medicare and Health Insurance section of this form.

753
01:19:51.021 --> 01:20:04.270
P20: Same answer applies: 5, unless I was using assistive technology, then it would be a 1 even though there wasn't as many pages. The process is still the same. The other addendum I'm gonna add into there is.

754
01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:18.379
P20: I did not like the additional hey, here's health insurance. Here's Medicaid. Here's Medicare, right? Here's all these additional things that weren't on the initial splash page. So besides, it being a 5 or one, it's still a thumbs down with

755
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:23.190
P20: with this whole part of the process.

756
01:20:23.530 --> 01:20:29.930
Renata: Okay, this felt like a bit of a gotcha, it sounds like you weren't prepared to see this. And it it was okay. Got it. Thank you.

757
01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:35.899
P20: Give me, and then also give me the chance to submit this without this information, and allow me to come back to it later.

758
01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:37.970
Renata: Okay, got it

759
01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:42.100
P20: Right, not save not save actually submit.

760
01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:48.280
P20: Right? I'm not talking about saving the information and coming back to it, I'm saying, actually submit the application

761
01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:53.650
P20: and then doing an addendum later on. Hey? If you do know and you have this.

762
01:20:53.910 --> 01:21:03.460
P20: we're submitting it. But you're gonna have to create an addendum to add, you know, there's gonna be more work for you later. Are you okay with that? Okay? Good. So that's why sorry.

763
01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:05.632
Renata: Got it. Yeah, you can go ahead and click, continue.

764
01:21:06.256 --> 01:21:15.999
Renata: So we're not going to be submitting this form. This is the last page that we're going to look at today. But I'd like you to just review your application for champion benefits for your spouse and dependent.

765
01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.770
P20: This goes back to the assistive technology.

766
01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:26.820
P20: This is going to be a pain in the butt. Oh, and it's all different format, too.

767
01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.540
P20: Okay. So signer information, wait.

768
01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.969
P20: Why is the signer information in the con and the sponsor information?

769
01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.820
P20: If I already checked that?

770
01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:38.700
P20: Never mind, I'm gonna move on.

771
01:21:39.176 --> 01:21:42.580
P20: Yeah. So this is just gonna be a pain. You said to review this again.

772
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:45.419
P20: Here's the 6 fields, 5 fields, whatever

773
01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:50.877
P20: and the edit. I've already shared my opinion about that.

774
01:21:51.850 --> 01:21:53.699
P20: What else did you want me to validate?

775
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:58.599
Renata: Just go ahead and validate the application. But we're not going to click the submit at the bottom.

776
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:05.279
P20: Yeah, this would be a pain for talkback to go through.

777
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:06.720
Renata: Okay.

778
01:22:09.370 --> 01:22:10.260
P20: But it.

779
01:22:11.464 --> 01:22:22.269
P20: Yep. HMO, yep, yep, child, spouse date of birth. Yep, okay.

780
01:22:29.170 --> 01:22:37.773
Renata: Alright. So, aside from the other, like the things you've already mentioned, like not showing all of the fields. It's pretty standard and nothing else standing out to you?

781
01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:48.240
P20: Yeah. Yeah. Again, 5 of ease of use and 5 of of usability without assistive technology.

782
01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:49.260
Renata: Okay.

783
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:59.079
Renata: got it. Let's say you accidentally input some information wrong like your spouse's middle name without clicking on anything. How would you fix that at this point?

784
01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:02.520
P20: Spouse right here. Go to edit.

785
01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:14.050
Renata: Okay, and like, I said, we're not gonna be clicking the Submit application button today. But if you did click that and submit this application. What would you expect to happen next?

786
01:23:15.829 --> 01:23:38.869
P20: I entered an email in there. So I would expect some type of generated communication to the spouse contact information, the child contact information and me as the sponsor slash also as the signer. So I would want 2 emails from a signer and sponsor, plus, I would get Jane would get hers, and and I would get Jack's, so I should get 3, and she would get one.

787
01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:40.519
Renata: Okay, got it

788
01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:51.819
P20: And then also the email should have a Hey, here's the information. You validated it already. Here's all the stuff. But again.

789
01:23:52.110 --> 01:24:11.792
P20: here's the email. If you notice anything different, click on this link to go back to your application. Click on this link. Oh, you! You now found your Medicare, your Medicaid, your your whatever additional information click on this. If you need to do an addendum like in the email, there should be options. If you need contact information like, here's all.

790
01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.439
P20: you know, this, this type of stuff.

791
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:26.030
Renata: Okay, got it? And how soon do you expect to be notified about a decision on your CHAMPVA application?

792
01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:32.223
P20: My expectation, 9 to 14 months.

793
01:24:32.850 --> 01:24:36.789
Renata: Now is that an ideal world, or is that realistic.

794
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:37.460
P20: I'm patient.

795
01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:38.820
Renata: Okay. Alright

796
01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.650
P20: What I want it to be.

797
01:24:41.504 --> 01:24:45.210
P20: So they're what I would want it to be, and not to be flippant

798
01:24:45.837 --> 01:24:55.370
P20: what I would want it to be right. A standard VA form getting submitted takes anywhere between 6 to 8 weeks. Right? So you have that here's our token standard, plus

799
01:24:55.670 --> 01:25:03.539
P20: all the the firings, like everyone's short staffed. Sorry I'm gonna move on. So there should be a

800
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:09.270
P20: here's our standard 6 to 8 [weeks]. If you have any questions, please contact this number

801
01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:15.910
P20: right? So here's your custom, your token, your your

802
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:21.950
P20: your your common response right? But

803
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:30.929
P20: then my expectation based on this was my insurance ends December [2025],

804
01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:40.019
P20: so I would need a response prior to the termination. The end date of my insurance, right?

805
01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:40.510
Renata: Okay.

806
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.300
P20: So here's your typical.

807
01:25:43.650 --> 01:25:46.579
P20: And then here's my cutoff point. So I would like

808
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:53.500
P20: that answer to be somewhere in there. And let's say that's not an option.

809
01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:59.080
P20: When I go to put in my termination date of current existing insurance.

810
01:25:59.630 --> 01:26:03.800
P20: give me some type of disclaimer, or notice or warning to say, Hey.

811
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.550
P20: this is going to take 9 months.

812
01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:09.469
P20: and your termination is next week.

813
01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:22.869
P20: You're going to be without insurance for this long. Are you aware of that, are you okay with that? If you have any questions that please contact this and you can go get, you know, if if you need to purchase personal something.

814
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:26.540
P20: So the duration. Here's your 

815
01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:29.430
P20: your token duration. 6 to 8 weeks.

816
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:38.449
P20: firewalled with, or or subjugated with the determination of my existing health insurance, or any existing health insurance.

817
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:45.609
P20: And here's options, because this process is going to be longer than that. Here's options, should you still want to do this.

818
01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.769
P20: Like that's you asked, my expectation.

819
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:56.300
Renata: Yeah, would you want to receive a status update, while your application is being processed?

820
01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:18.159
P20: So. And I'm gonna pick up my phone here. Any claim, anything that you do, the Va site gives you: "Here's your status" and you can go and click on the status, you'll get an email status of that claim change. You get an email to set the other same. My expectation. And the reason why I bring up the claim. My expectation is that existing process

821
01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:21.289
P20: I would expect it to apply here as well.

822
01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:22.410
Renata: Okay.

823
01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:29.330
P20: And so, however, all of these things that are already in existence, I would expect them to be also used

824
01:27:29.770 --> 01:27:30.520
P20: here.

825
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:46.069
Renata: Okay. So like, I said, we're not gonna be submitting this. And we're done with the screen sharing portion. You can go ahead and click, stop screen sharing. And I just have a few more questions for you as we wrap up. So overall. Was there anything in the session today that worked really well for you?

826
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:51.070
P20: Your guidance.

827
01:27:52.012 --> 01:27:53.156
Renata: Thank you.

828
01:27:54.610 --> 01:28:00.059
Renata: Was there anything unclear, or did that didn't work well for you that we haven't already discussed?

829
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:04.820
P20: Yeah, well I thought it was pretty vocal with all the things that didn't work.

830
01:28:05.474 --> 01:28:09.674
P20: But it's the healthcare, medicare, right? It's the

831
01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:16.500
P20: being able to submit without it's the streamlining it for an assisted technology.

832
01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:26.699
P20: And taking out the the redundant pages, the redundant buttons, the redundant continues.

833
01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.059
P20: I think that was everything.

834
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:36.489
Renata: Okay. And what are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in the form? Not enough, too much, just right?

835
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:37.932
P20: Just right, yeah,

836
01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:38.880
Renata: Okay.

837
01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.490
P20: Fully locks perfect interest rate.

838
01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.669
Renata: Any questions for me?

839
01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:50.969
P20: What happens now like you have more applicants to review and stuff, and like.

840
01:28:53.484 --> 01:28:55.679
Renata: You mean with this form, specifically, or...?

841
01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.610
P20: How does this work study like? Is this helpful like?

842
01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:05.050
P20: When does it roll out to production?

843
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:07.259
P20: You know all that type of stuff.

844
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:09.289
Renata: So we're 

845
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:11.359
P20: Matter, though I mean I could ask them. But it doesn't matter.

846
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:16.319
P20: So no, I guess I don't have any questions unless you want to. Sorry.

847
01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:43.320
Renata: I mean. So we're currently in testing right now with veterans and family members. We're currently sort of trying to figure out what improvements we need to make to this experience, so that it is as clear as possible before it goes to production. And then, yeah, yeah, so the all of the feedback we gathered from sessions like the one that you participated in today will inform what the eventual form will look like. So yeah, your your feedback is super duper, helpful.

848
01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:49.069
P20: Awesome does. So here's a question that I've kind of asked on several of these

849
01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:58.539
P20: things. Right? Use case tests. And I know you said that my answers are going to be recorded and then burned after use, right burned after.

850
01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:02.550
P20: But it it.

851
01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:16.199
P20: Let me vocally verbalize my question, formulate my question. So all the information that I kind of spot out today about this particular form like that?

852
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:26.689
P20: Isn't that able to be used for any form that we're doing with it? That we that you and your team are doing for the Va.

853
01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:45.809
Renata: So if there's generalizable findings, things that we think would be useful beyond the scope of the specific form that you looked at today, we share those with relevant teams with va.gov, we want to make sure that across the site we are improving the experience for veterans and their family members.

854
01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:52.588
P20: So any findings that you take today will still be pushed forward and used for additional projects or or?

855
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:55.030
P20: and improvements later on.

856
01:30:55.280 --> 01:31:09.415
Renata: Potentially, yes, yeah, we. And and we give feedback on those. So yeah, so just last question here for you, I wanna circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip with this of this session with our Va partners. Okay,

857
01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:11.884
P20: Look at this user.

858
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:16.240
Renata: Is there any part of our discussion today you would not want shared in a video clip.

859
01:31:18.615 --> 01:31:20.344
P20: That one part where I

860
01:31:23.130 --> 01:31:25.889
P20: I can't remember what I said, but it was something that was

861
01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:34.849
P20: It was a flippant remark that was a little outside. Never mind, you know what fine I'm fine.

862
01:31:35.630 --> 01:31:41.559
Renata: Okay, if you change your mind or anything you can contact Perigian. But yeah.

863
01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:46.340
P20: Oh, from that perspective! No, no, but I did apologize for when I made the remark.

864
01:31:46.700 --> 01:32:15.909
Renata: Okay, that's totally fine. Well, at this point I we really appreciate you taking time out of your day and your week to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is really helpful as we continue to work on the site to make sure it really works for veterans. So thank you. Lastly, Paragene will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb in it that you can pass along to other veterans, that you may know to provide them with a chance to participate in future research studies like this one. But with that, thank you so much again, and have a great rest of your day and week.

865
01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:23.200
P20: You as well, and I I appreciate the time talking to me and sitting through my colorful

866
01:32:24.816 --> 01:32:26.550
P20: opinionated responses.

867
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:29.890
Renata: Well, we really appreciate it. Yeah, please take care.

868
01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:31.100
P20: Right, Buddy.
