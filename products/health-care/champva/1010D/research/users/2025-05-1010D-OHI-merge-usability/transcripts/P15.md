1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.365
Renata: Hmm.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:10.189
Renata: okay, I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

3
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.329
P15: Yes, that's fine.

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.890
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our session today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

5
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.469
P15: Yes, it's okay.

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.829
Renata: All right. So before we look at the website, just a few questions for you. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.209
P15: I have CHAMPVA right now. I've been using it for a couple of years.

8
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.450
Renata: Oh, great: would you mind sharing with me what it was like applying for the CHAMPVA program?

9
00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:44.900
P15: I believe we applied for it...

10
00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:51.509
P15: I don't know if it's 2019, several years ago.

11
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:54.730
P15: I don't remember the specifics.

12
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:16.310
P15: but I remember that when we became eligible we were informed through a VSO, and so they just told us about it. But they didn't actually help us apply. So I must have done the research on my own, and I would imagine that I completed some type of application for myself.

13
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.690
Renata: And my daughter, because she's also covered.

14
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:33.110
Renata: Okay, got it. So there's multiple people in your household who have CHAMPVA? Okay. You mentioned a VSO, and that they didn't help you. Did anybody assist you with the actual application process?

15
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:58.970
P15: No, that we did on our own. I remember they mentioned it to my husband like they went over the benefits that he was eligible for, and this was one of them. So then I went in and I started looking up like on the va.gov website and inform myself as what I needed to do, and so I wanna say that I filled out the application, sent it in, and then, you know, we got approved.

16
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:13.970
Renata: Got it. Have you or anyone else in your household -- It sounds like your daughter -- submitted a form 10-7959c, otherwise known as the other health insurance certification form? And if you don't recall, that's also fine.

17
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:23.460
P15: Yes, we fill out that form where you have to indicate other health insurance we have. So yes, I'm familiar with the form.

18
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.979
Renata: Okay, did you submit it with your 1010d application? Or afterwards, if you had like a change in coverage?

19
00:02:31.132 --> 00:02:41.350
P15: I don't remember when we submitted it, but, I know that that they always want to know. We're covered. We have primary insurance.

20
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:59.770
P15: The black or private, and then we have CHAMPVA, would be our secondary. So I know that that form comes into play. They want to know, like, if you have any other coverage, because they always wanna tap into that 1st before CHAMPVA comes in and pays so

21
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:13.822
P15: At what point we filled it out I really can't remember, but I know we've done it before. I know our primary insurance sends us the form every year. Okay, do you have any other coverage? So we submit that. And then

22
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.390
P15: when we send in for claims.

23
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.240
P15: We...I believe we have to send that form in, as well.

24
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.630
Renata: Okay.

25
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:34.660
Renata: Got it. So it sounds like you said you filled out a paper version of the form when you applied for CHAMPVA. Did you submit that by mail or by fax?

26
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.890
P15: I want to say that I did it by mail.

27
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.970
Renata: Okay.

28
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.200
P15: And I'm

29
00:03:44.200 --> 00:04:03.499
P15: sorry. My, I've been dealing with health issues. So my memory is a little like I don't recall like mail, or if it was like through email, because I know there's a lot of stuff that you can do like interactively and send the application like online. So I'm not a hundred percent sure if I mailed it in, or if I did it online.

30
00:04:04.322 --> 00:04:07.160
P15: but I did complete that. Obviously.

31
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:26.399
Renata: It's totally fine, like, I said. We're not testing your knowledge. I hope you feel better soon. But we're just curious sort of any of the the broad strokes that you might remember. So it's totally fine if you don't recall the the details of anything. So I think you mentioned that you've had to submit claims before?

32
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.530
Renata: Have you had to mail those in or...?

33
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:40.079
P15: Yes, I've had to...let me explain that. Okay, so I'm fine. I have my local doctors here. My doctors are able. It was a little bit of a hassle

34
00:04:40.080 --> 00:05:04.950
P15: as far as getting these doctors on board with having to file claims, because a lot of times, you know, especially in this area down here where we live, some of the doctors are not really familiar with CHAMPVA, so there's been a little bit of a learning curve, and so I don't have any problem now. My doctors will take the CHAMPVA, they'll process the claims.

35
00:05:05.376 --> 00:05:13.060
P15: The issue comes in with my daughter. My daughter is in college, and the university that she's at,

36
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:37.089
P15: they don't know how to process these claims, and it's a shame because she's using government benefits to attend school, and they pay for her tuition and so forth. But they're not on board with learning how to process these these claims. And so what happens is, she goes to the health center. She has to pay $25, which is their copay out of pocket.

37
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:44.970
P15: And so what we do after that is, after a while after she pays it, she will request an itemized statement

38
00:05:45.382 --> 00:05:54.159
P15: from them, and then I send a claim, and I don't remember the number of the form. So I send the [CHAMP]VA claim form. I send in the EOB.

39
00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:20.459
P15: and I send the itemized statement to the VA, to CHAMPVA. And it is a long, long process to get it paid. It's months; anywhere from 6 to 9 months for them to pay me back. Reimburse me my $25. Her medication is covered. The pharmacies are equipped to handle that, but it's just her copay that we've done that for years.

40
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:34.269
Renata: I'm sorry to hear that, but I appreciate you sharing those experiences. It's really useful for us to know. Have you used the online version of the CHAMPVA claims form, or just the mail in version of the form.

41
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:40.199
P15: I actually this last one that I did. I did the well, okay.

42
00:06:40.350 --> 00:07:09.620
P15: you go online, you're able to use the interactive form. But there's no way for you to send it electronically. You still have to print it out and mail it in. I don't know that there's any version -- I've called CHAMPVA several times to get statuses to get...there's no way of you tracking. Once the claim leaves you mail it off, there's no way of tracking it electronically to find out what the status is. The only thing you can do is call the 1-800 number

43
00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:15.750
P15: and they will give you a status update if they have one.

44
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:29.180
Renata: Got it. Okay. Again, I really appreciate hearing what your experiences with this with the program have been like, just a few more questions for you before we look at the demo tool. Do you have a va.gov account?

45
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.387
P15: Yes, I do.

46
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.709
Renata: And what has your experience been with logging into the site?

47
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:44.698
P15: It's still...It still needs work. It still needs improvement. Every so often,

48
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.186
P15: you know, you have to reset your password.

49
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.120
P15: Now you're using ID.me

50
00:07:53.560 --> 00:08:02.683
P15: to sign in. So that's been a little bit easier, but lately id me has gone through some changes as well and

51
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:13.850
P15: like, for example, yesterday I got an email from the VA and it says, "your email address on healthyvet.com

52
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:33.690
P15: does not match another email address that we have on file" or something like that. "Can you go into the VA website and confirm your email address?" So I go into the VA website. I look at the address, it's the same email address that I've used for years. So I don't know why they sent me that email. So here, I'm thinking. Oh, my God! Something happened. But

53
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.700
P15: there still. It still needs a lot of work, I think.

54
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.769
P15: I think that there have been some

55
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.350
P15: positive things that they've rolled out, but it still needs work.

56
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:53.460
Renata: Got it. And how often are you logging into va.gov, on average?

57
00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.729
P15: Like on a monthly basis, maybe once a month.

58
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.370
P15: Maybe more times. Well.

59
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:36.649
P15: no, maybe about 2, 2, 3, I would say about 3 times, because sometimes it's alerts that they send you. Sometimes it's like, Have they mailed my husband's prescriptions? And I go into the website to check on that because I'll get the tracking, and then I'll stop getting it, or whatever. And then I want to go and see, or does he have refill. So I check. I check for that for refills. Sometimes I check for his appointments because they're on there.

60
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.660
P15: And that's primarily, I think, what I check for.

61
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:52.389
Renata: Okay, got it? So at this point, we're gonna take a look at that demo tool I was telling you about. Are you comfortable sharing your screen in zoom, if I was to give you a link to the tool?

62
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.620
P15: Yes.

63
00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:10.749
Renata: Okay, and I can walk you through if you have, if you need any help with troubleshooting but gonna give you a moment to close any notifications or anything else you have open. Whenever you're ready, please click and open that link that's in the chat, and then share your screen. Once you have it up.

64
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:17.059
P15: Okay? It says where it says, staging

65
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.340
P15: dot va.gov. Is that the one?

66
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.350
Renata: Yes. Please. Yeah.

67
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.430
P15: Okay, that one.

68
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:30.459
P15: Okay, I'm in there. How do I share this now with you?

69
00:10:31.027 --> 00:10:51.339
Renata: You'll need to go back into the zoom app. If you're if you can go back to it. There should be an area in the zoom app, like with 3 buttons, 3 dots and if you click on that, it should give you a whole list of options of things that you can do, and one of them should be share screen.

70
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.140
P15: Okay.

71
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:18.840
P15: I'm afraid of closing this one. I'm at. I'm over at the screen where it says, where it has that link that you wanted me to go into I'm afraid of. I don't know if I'm gonna but there's an X on there, so I don't know if I need to X that out to get back to zoom.

72
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:25.159
Renata: Oh, yeah, you can click it. That's the chat. You can click the x on it, and it should close the chat if it

73
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:30.840
Renata: accidentally quits you from Zoom, I'll let you back into the zoom room, and we'll we'll troubleshoot from there. But...

74
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:38.810
P15: Okay, how do I? Okay, I'm back onto the main screen that we were at earlier. How do I share to you? Said I don't see anything there, so that I could share.

75
00:11:39.337 --> 00:11:58.459
Renata: There should be a row of icons at the bottom of the app. If there's not, there should be like a little menu that's 3 dots. And if you click on the 3 dots it'll open up the menu of options. It'll be things like changing your audio and video participants chat one of those options should be share. It's a little icon that has, like an up arrow.

76
00:11:59.818 --> 00:12:05.801
P15: I see the little arrow, but I don't see anything that share.

77
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.460
P15: Oh, gosh!

78
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.629
P15: I see that

79
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:22.169
P15: I don't see anything. I'm sorry it says Zoom, and then it has a little arrow right next to it, like a down arrow.

80
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.660
Renata: Oh, okay.

81
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.870
P15: Video share. Okay, share screen. Sorry about that.

82
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:30.379
Renata: No worries.

83
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.140
P15: And screen broadcast. Start broadcast?

84
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.170
Renata: Yes.

85
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:34.970
P15: Okay.

86
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:50.390
Renata: Okay, it has started. So I'm gonna have you now, on your phone switch back to the browser where you have that that link open. If you could do that for me, please.

87
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.429
P15: Okay, go back to the browser.?
88
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:14.548
Renata: If you have like a home button on your phone, or a way to go back out to sort of like where all of your apps are?

89
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.319
P15: Okay, where? Where? Okay? I'm at the home. What did you need me to do there?

90
00:13:19.862 --> 00:13:25.030
Renata: Go back to the browser where you have that that link open that I gave you.

91
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.999
P15: Oh, okay. That was.

92
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:44.189
Renata: Alternatively, I can share it again in the chat so that the chat opens up and you can click it from there. Would that be helpful.

93
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.010
P15: Yes, please, cause I don't see it.

94
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.570
Renata: Yeah, no problem.

95
00:13:49.778 --> 00:13:55.090
Renata: If you could click on my face that's in the top corner, maybe?

96
00:13:59.188 --> 00:14:06.191
Renata: and if you go down to the little speech bubble icon at the bottom that says Chat, you can click. Okay, there.

97
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.420
P15: Okay.

98
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:15.215
Renata: Yeah, and click on that link. Okay, perfect. So now we're in so just a few things before we get started.

99
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:32.080
Renata: so like, I said before, this is our testing site. You don't have to worry about anything you fill in going anywhere. We're not submitting anything. It won't have any bearing on your benefits as we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, such as social security numbers.

100
00:14:32.330 --> 00:15:01.689
Renata: There may be a couple of screens where you're going to be asked to upload documents. We're not submitting this form, and this isn't going to any Va systems. So nothing you upload here is going to be sent to the Va. When we get to those screens. I can provide you with a document to upload, or you could just like upload a random photo that you have. You don't have to make a decision. Now, I'll ask you when we get to those screens, but just wanted to let you know that you have the option. Any questions for me.

101
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:02.475
P15: No.

102
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:13.440
Renata: All right. So just scrolling through the page, don't click on any of the links, but just just scrolling through it. Take a look at the information here, and let us know your initial thoughts.

103
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.209
P15: I mean, it seems pretty straightforward.

104
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:36.900
P15: Make sure.

105
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.109
Renata: Okay, nothing unusual

106
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:56.619
Renata: or unexpected? From the 1st time that you you filled out the the 1010 d?

107
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:06.049
P15: I wish I could maybe see the form, because, honestly, I don't recall, like

108
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.559
P15: like the form how it looks, but I'm sure they asked us for

109
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:17.620
P15: like personal information like it says on there, and proof that maybe, that

110
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.846
P15: that we are related. Somehow we got the benefits because of my husband.

111
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:24.760
Renata: Okay.

112
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.110
P15: Obviously we're eligible, my husband is is veteran, and

113
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:34.420
P15: he's disabled, and I don't know if you know this, but in order for you to get CHAMPVA

114
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:43.499
P15: and you probably do know this, you have to be a hundred percent disabled. And that's how we were able to qualify.

115
00:16:44.192 --> 00:16:46.280
P15: So I mean it

116
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:56.230
P15: just looking at the website. I mean, it seems pretty straightforward. You check on there whether it says there to check eligibility. So I'm assuming that

117
00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:01.139
P15: it'll be a list of what requirements you need to meet.

118
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:11.499
P15: I don't know if you have to upload anything at this point here. You may also need to submit...Oh, yeah, you're gonna have to submit supporting documents to them,

119
00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.030
P15: I guess.

120
00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:34.550
P15: for this for somebody that maybe is not that tech savvy? Somebody older and stuff. It may be a challenge. I mean, I probably could apply online. I think I can figure that out on my own. But I guess for older people I can see how. Maybe it'd be a little bit more challenging.

121
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:52.341
P15: and they'd have to do that, and they'd have to do the paper form, and so forth. But it it would be good. I guess, if these VSOs, or and I'm sure maybe the VA, does have people there in their office that can help you with this

122
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.139
P15: At that time when when we applied 2019.

123
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.320
P15: Yeah, I guess I did have a little bit more time on my hands.

124
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:09.850
P15: I had changed careers around that time. So I probably yeah did it on my own and and sent it in.

125
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:22.420
Renata: Got it. So just a few questions for you on this page before we start looking at the the form and filling it out. Do you know, if you are on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

126
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.399
P15: Yes, because it clearly says on the screen, on the very top.

127
00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.039
Renata: Got it. Okay. And if you were on va.gov..

128
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:43.294
P15: But I mean, I think, but for somebody that maybe didn't know the word CHAMPVA, maybe they could put a little bit more information there as to

129
00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.780
P15: what these benefits are for.

130
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.410
P15: I mean, maybe.

131
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.509
Renata: Okay, like spelling out what CHAMPVA means?

132
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:58.620
P15: Yeah, what CHAMPVA means, or these are benefits, for these are health insurance benefits, for

133
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.170
P15: I don't know disabled veterans or...

134
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:03.210
Renata: Okay.

135
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.300
P15: I think that I think that's the only people that qualify. I want to say I'm not...

136
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:15.060
P15: I don't know. I don't know if there's any other people that are not 100% that would qualify for these benefits. I don't think so.

137
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:25.970
Renata: Okay, got it. Do you know how to check your eligibility for CHAMPVA benefits for you and your daughter, based on the content on this page?

138
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.880
P15: Like, if we're still eligible like today?

139
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.719
Renata: Yeah, yeah.

140
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:50.379
P15: Honestly, I've never done that online because I don't think you can do that. I don't know. I've always what I do is I call the CHAMPVA number, it's a 1 800 number. And because we've had issues, we've had issues, not with myself, but with my daughter, because what happens is

141
00:19:50.610 --> 00:20:11.150
P15: she goes to school right? So she's always cut off. So the the fall semester runs from August all the way through December, and then there's a gap period there from mid December till mid January, where the VA sometimes would cut her off from benefits, because technically

142
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.630
Renata: Oh

143
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:37.229
P15: Not in school, and so she had. She would have to send in another recertifying form. So you know she always had issues with her ears, and so she was constantly having to go. And I blamed it on these dorms because they were old dorms. They probably had mold and stuff, and so she was always having ear infections, and allergies and stuff. So she was having to go back to the health center

144
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:44.630
P15: repeatedly. So there was times where I would need to find out. Do they still have her

145
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:51.439
P15: you know, insured or not? And so we'd have to call the 1-800 number to find out if she was still covered.

146
00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.539
P15: and they would tell us

147
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.140
Renata: Okay.

148
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:58.130
P15: But I've never been able to [check if we're still eligible]. Honestly,

149
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:07.130
P15: there's very limited information that you can get regarding your CHAMPVA benefits as far as like eligibility.

150
00:21:08.247 --> 00:21:17.469
P15: Finding out if you're still eligible and still covered online. I've never seen it do that. And it doesn't give you information on claims, either. And I know I've asked

151
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:29.019
P15: when I call the 1-800 number. Have you all done anything to the website to include information regarding your benefits? You know, statuses of claims, and they're like, no, you have to call in

152
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:30.790
P15: so.

153
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.220
Renata: Got it.

154
00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.469
P15: That's something that they really need to improve on, because it's

155
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:43.970
P15: it's, you know, very...It's not very conducive. And you have to call and wait. And sometimes there's a wait, especially right now. I called recently

156
00:21:44.950 --> 00:22:01.159
P15: What did I call about? Oh, I called about a claim and I called really early. I called at 8 o'clock, and it told me that they had a bunch of people in line, and they would call me an hour later. Well, they called me a little bit over an hour. But

157
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.869
P15: yeah, that's 1 of the things that they really need to work on.

158
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:30.010
Renata: Yeah, I again, I really appreciate you sharing your experiences because that feedback really helps us to make this a better. You know, experience for folks like yourself and your daughter. So you mentioned some of the possible documents and information you'll need to fill out the 1010d. If you were filling this out for real on va.gov today, would you need to pause and gather that documentation and information, or would you have it on hand?

159
00:22:32.744 --> 00:22:35.659
P15: I probably have to look for the information.

160
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:36.890
Renata: Okay.

161
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:59.959
Renata: that's totally fair. If you can click that link that staging link again, the staging.va.gov. I have one more question for you on this page, and then we're going to start filling out the form on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the CHAMPVA application you're about to begin? Based on the information on this page.

162
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.420
P15: Hmm!

163
00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:07.690
P15: I'm informed so maybe a 3.

164
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:14.510
Renata: A 3. Okay. And what would take it from a 3 to a 5, meaning like very informed?

165
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.949
P15: Maybe um, including a little bit more information on the main screen.

166
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.880
P15: Okay.

167
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:34.109
Renata: Oh, anything in particular, any particular information you would want to see there? That would that would make you feel more informed?

168
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:47.620
P15: Well, just like, for example, for people that that think they qualify. Well, I mean, I know they'd have to click on that link. But again for them to explain, maybe, what CHAMPVA benefits are.

169
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:52.520
Renata: Okay, got it. So at this point, I'm gonna have you...Oh, go ahead.

170
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:59.710
P15: I say, that is because sometimes they send you stuff. And okay, this is a benefit or whatever. And you have to do a lot of reading

171
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:11.169
P15: to then get to the nitty gritty, and then you find out that you don't even qualify. You know what I mean? If maybe they put it on there like, okay, this is a benefit. And this is a benefit solely for

172
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:20.849
P15: a hundred percent disabled veterans. So that way, if somebody were to come in and say, Oh, I think I potentially qualify for this, and they start

173
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.120
P15: looking into it, and then to be disappointed later that they don't.

174
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:34.550
P15: I mean, I don't know that that's happened to me where I go through the whole steps, and I'm reading everything, and then to find out that this is not even a benefit that

175
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.720
P15: that but I mean, I guess it's time I mean.

176
00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.689
P15: I guess I would want a little bit more information.

177
00:24:44.050 --> 00:25:00.450
Renata: Yeah, I get that. That'd be very frustrating to get to the end and to find out you're not qualified at this point. If you could scroll down a little bit on the screen. There's a blue box towards the bottom, and I'd like you to click on the link that says, start your form without signing in.

178
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:31.399
Renata: All right. So at this point I would like you to fill out this form as though you're applying for yourself and for your daughter. I'm going to let you know when we're going to pause, and I'll ask you some questions. But to help orient you, you're going to be filling out sections one through 3 of the form. Just a few things to bear in mind. Like I said before, this is a testing site, and we're not submitting this. So any of the information you enter into the application. It's not going anywhere, and you can use fake information for sensitive questions.

179
00:25:31.858 --> 00:25:40.790
Renata: And as you go through the form, I'd like you to please think out loud. We'd like to hear any reactions that you're having as you're experiencing, though, going through.

180
00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.629
P15: Okay. So this one I just select?

181
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.010
P15: "I'm a veteran"

182
00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:57.439
P15: Okay, I'm not the veteran, but usually when I fill these out, I pretend like I'm the veteran, because my husband will never fill out any of this stuff.

183
00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:03.729
Renata: Okay, that's good to know. So that's what you would put here today if you were doing this on va.gov?

184
00:26:04.613 --> 00:26:05.496
P15: Yes.

185
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.349
P15: And so here, you want me to start typing in my information?

186
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:11.360
Renata: Yes, please.

187
00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:26.659
P15: Can I step out like for like 10 seconds? My husband's yelling at me.

188
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.570
Renata: Yeah. Go ahead.

189
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:37.009
P15: [Redacted]

190
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:57.282
P15: Sorry I didn't think he was gonna come back early, but he's back.

191
00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:59.520
Renata: Oh, it's quite all right.

192
00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:06.600
P15: Okay, sorry about that. Okay, okay, continue?

193
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.021
P15: I guess it wants me to enter the code manually or

194
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.470
Renata: Hmm, yeah, I don't think I've seen this bug before. It might just be a bug with our test system.

195
00:27:51.470 --> 00:28:00.410
P15: No, no, I think it's I don't know if it wants me to enter it. I'm you know how it saves it on your phone, and I just typed it. So I don't know if it wants me to type it like manually.

196
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.329
Renata: Yeah, maybe give that a try. I apologize. Our test system is a little bit touchy.

197
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:06.850
P15: No, I.

198
00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:07.220
Renata: So.

199
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:15.400
P15: I don't think it's your test system. I think it's just I mean, this is straight from the VA, so I'm thinking that sometimes that happens that where they don't take

200
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.730
P15: oh, shoot

201
00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.810
P15: already there prefilled

202
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.580
P15: Oh jeez.

203
00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.649
P15: I don't know like why my information popped up there for sponsor.

204
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.080
Renata: Hmm.

205
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.759
P15: Sponsor would be my husband, cause he's a veteran.

206
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.489
Renata: Got it. Okay. So you're inputting your your husband's information in now?

207
00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:26.349
P15: Yeah, I've been putting his information. Cause he's he's a sponsor.

208
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:27.360
Renata: Got it.

209
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:36.636
Renata: And like I said, you can use a fake number here. You just can't do 1, 2, 3, 4. It's gotta be like not sequential numbers.

210
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.509
P15: Okay. Address. Okay. Brought me back to my mailing address.

211
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.329
P15: I don't know why.

212
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.640
P15: Continue.

213
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.489
Renata: So, seeing that is a bit confusing, at this point?

214
00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:58.490
P15: Yeah.

215
00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.010
Renata: Okay.

216
00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:03.839
P15: It brought back my contact information. Add applicants.

217
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.780
P15: okay, that would be my daughter

218
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.020
P15: She's gonna have the same mail[ing address].

219
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:42.900
P15: can you?

220
00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.820
P15: Hey! It knows the mailing address.

221
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.850
P15: Okay? And brought back and brought back the address that I had entered. So that's easy.

222
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.570
P15: Her phone number

223
00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.739
P15: email address.

224
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:12.560
Renata: And are you putting her phone number and email address in? Or are you putting yours in like, what? What would you typically do?

225
00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:18.041
P15: I would typically put hers. But I'm putting in a fictitious number.

226
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.949
Renata: Yeah, I'm just curious.

227
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:26.147
P15: But I did put my cell number in my email. So I'm still identifiable.

228
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:36.370
P15: Just one status, child dependent status...biological.

229
00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.099
P15: Oh, one is "enrolled," "plans to enroll in..." Okay.

230
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.964
P15: Oh, this was an issue we had late this. Well, you probably don't want to know about this. But

231
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:13.460
P15: yeah. They asked for a lot of information from the school

232
00:32:15.126 --> 00:32:15.823
P15: And

233
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:24.550
P15: They want a certifying letter that she's enrolled, and we had a situation. Well,

234
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:32.730
P15: where we have to go back because they want the start date and the end date of every semester and

235
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:40.260
P15: and the expected graduation date. I remember. Oh, that was an issue. I remember recently, when we had to,

236
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:47.489
P15: she was trying to get her ID. But anyway, it is a lot of information that they ask for, like

237
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.990
P15: you know, from the dependent, like the child.

238
00:32:51.290 --> 00:33:01.310
Renata: Yeah. So if I'm hearing you correctly, this was a this was a struggle when you initially enrolled in the CHAMPVA program. Have you had to send additional versions of this letter to CHAMPVA, or...?

239
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.449
P15: Yes, we have to send every like. Remember, when I was telling you that

240
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.800
P15: after every semester there's a Gap period?

241
00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:19.239
P15: And we've had cases where she has to go to the doctor in between that period, and then she's gone, and then she's told, hey,

242
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:34.712
P15: you can't fill this prescription because it just, you know, CHAMPVA is not paying for it, because they, you know, you're not eligible. And so we've had to send this letter in, and sometimes they've been very specific as to

243
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:45.490
P15: the dates, and so forth, and the form that's sent in, and then the time that it takes for them to process it. So that's been very challenging.

244
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:58.109
Renata: So if you were to be applying for CHAMPVA today, for you know, on VA.gov, for yourself and your daughter, would you have to stop at this point and go call the school and request a letter, or do you already have that on hand?

245
00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:13.070
P15: No, you'd have to call the school, and it would be a hassle right now to try and get it, because it's during the summer. And so yeah, it it. You'd have to stop here, you know, and and just wait for you to get that letter from the school.

246
00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:19.520
Renata: Okay. And typically, how long has it taken when you've reached out to the school to get a copy of the letter back just out of curiosity?

247
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:31.424
P15: Well, we've gotten the letter back, and then the letter doesn't have all the specific information that they're wanting, and so they may reject it, you know.

248
00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:35.996
P15: and so they may say, No, it just depends on who

249
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:39.150
P15: I mean you talk to, because

250
00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.909
P15: like, if I needed to like, for example, right now

251
00:34:44.460 --> 00:35:01.229
P15: I'd have to call CHAMPVA, I'd have to tell them. Hey, can you please rush this? Try to get it if I did have the letter and try to get her approved, because, you know, she's ill, and so forth. Sometimes they have been accommodating. They have

252
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:10.300
P15: you know they have speed it up the process, you know, to get her eligible. It just depends on who you're talking to when you call.

253
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:20.310
Renata: Got it. And on this page any anything in those bullet points that you don't recognize that you've been asked to provide before in a school letter just out of curiosity?

254
00:35:20.718 --> 00:35:24.389
P15: Let's see, the last 4 digits of [Daughter's] social

255
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:33.340
P15: start and end dates. Enrollment status, expected graduation date. All of that info. Yeah, that's always the information standard information I was asked for.

256
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:46.429
Renata: Got it. So this is one of those screens where it's asking you to upload a file. You can either upload a random thing from your phone, or I can provide you with a dummy file. It's completely up to you. We're not going to be submitting this today. So it's not going anywhere.

257
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:48.160
P15: Oh.

258
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:57.489
P15: we couldn't upload your file because we can't accept this type, maybe because it's a picture?

259
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:08.280
Renata: Yeah, maybe see if you can do a a file instead of a jpeg, that might be the issue. We've had that before. If you click, choose, file instead. Yeah.

260
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:09.220
P15: And

261
00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.840
P15: here all this stuff is like personal stuff.

262
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.500
P15: Oh.

263
00:36:34.984 --> 00:36:37.989
Renata: , I can also provide a document in the chat again, if you would prefer?

264
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.420
P15: Okay, let me see, I don't know what this is like.

265
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:45.159
P15: See if I can upload that. I don't know what that is.

266
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.330
P15: Oh.

267
00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:54.650
P15: just hold a moment. Okay, I uploaded something.

268
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.379
Renata: Okay, you can go ahead and click, continue.

269
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.230
P15: Okay, do you have any other applicant? No.

270
00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:15.619
Renata: All right. I'm going to stop you right there and ask you a question. So on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this section of the form?

271
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:28.150
P15: I would say it's as far as entering information. That's easy. But what's harder is having to

272
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:36.109
P15: gather information, I guess I mean, but that's going to be required because they have to check that. You're eligible. But I would say, probably a 4.

273
00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:42.800
Renata: A 4. Okay. And if what would make it a 5? What could we improve it to make it that 5?

274
00:37:50.970 --> 00:38:03.290
P15: like when I had to re-key in it like when I you know, when I had to re key in the information over again. Like my address, I had already keyed it in, and then it wasn't taking it.

275
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:04.029
Renata: Okay.

276
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:06.180
P15: Maybe.

277
00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.909
Renata: Alright, that is fair. 

278
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:24.560
P15: Some of the questions were repetitive. You could have a little link where it says like for my daughter, when it said her mailing her address or home address, they could have had, like a little link, a little box to check there. Okay, it's the same address as mine, so it'll copy it over.

279
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:26.819
Renata: Okay, so it skips, showing it to you again?

280
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.380
P15: Yeah.

281
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.730
P15: Because I had to reenter it again.

282
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:44.760
Renata: Got it? Okay. So I take a look at this page for me. Please. Don't. We're not gonna move forward in the application yet, but just take a look at it. Let me know if you have any questions any impressions, anything that stands out to you?

283
00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:54.209
P15: This one where it says Medicare.

284
00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.500
P15: You have any Medicare to report for one or more applicants?

285
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.410
P15: Oh.

286
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:12.990
P15: I mean, I know they ask for it, because if you have Medicare, I think they don't cover you, or something like that. But

287
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:18.440
P15: they've always asked this question like, Do you have Medicare? Is somebody covered through Medicare?

288
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.140
Renata: Okay.

289
00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:19.719
P15: Because I seen it

290
00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.070
Renata: You recognize the question.

291
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:26.850
P15: Yes, I recognize it because I think that if you have Medicare.

292
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:32.640
P15: that's already a government program and can't claim a government program. So I don't think you can have both, so I think

293
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:36.969
P15: it offsets the CHAMPVA. I'm not too sure, but I've seen this question before.

294
00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:52.890
Renata: Okay. And could you scroll up to the top of the page for me, please? Next to the Va. Logo, it says, "1010d Extended CHAMPVA Application (includes 10-7959c)." Does it that mean anything to you?

295
00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.750
P15: No, I've never. I've never seen this. No, I mean extended an extended application.

296
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:06.100
P15: Maybe maybe it's extended because you have medicare. I'm not sure. Honestly, I don't know what this is.

297
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:17.030
Renata: Okay, that's totally fair. We're just curious. What if it means anything to folks thinking back to the information you saw on that 1st page. Do you know why it's asking you the Medicare question here?

298
00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:24.720
P15: Kind of what I said earlier, because I think that if you have Medicare

299
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:45.090
P15: you may not qualify, you cannot have, you cannot have. They always say that like, where have I seen? Where, I guess on this chat, that oh, I think I've seen it on the claim form when I send in the claim form they ask you, is this person covered like by Medicare or something? And then that thing? I think that's where I've seen it.

300
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:49.629
Renata: Okay, got it. If you could

301
00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:57.429
Renata: it looks like your screen is showing a call. If you could go back to the your browser for a moment. Please.

302
00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:02.910
P15: Okay, I don't wanna let me see. Okay, there back to the zoom.

303
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:06.281
Renata: Yeah. Back to the browser where you have the form open.

304
00:41:07.513 --> 00:41:11.629
P15: Do I go back to staging where it says staging, because that came up.

305
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:23.039
Renata: Yeah. If you go back to staging it might take you. There we go. Okay, perfect oh, dang it took you if you hit the back button, will it take you back to the page you were on.

306
00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.339
P15: The back one?

307
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:39.359
Renata: There we go. Okay, perfect. That way. We don't have to fill out the whole 1st part of the form again. So if you were filling this out for real today, would you need to go gather any health insurance information before proceeding with the form? Or do you have that on hand?

308
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:42.720
P15: No for this, no cause. We don't have medicare, so I just hit no.

309
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.305
Renata: Okay.

310
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.109
Renata: Yep, so I'm going to have you hit. No on this question, and then click, continue.

311
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:53.449
P15: Do you have any notice of disallowance?

312
00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:59.469
Renata: Have you ever seen anything like this with CHAMPVA before?

313
00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:05.780
P15: Notices. Do you have a notice of disallowance, denial, or other proof of Medicare? No, I've never seen this question.

314
00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.380
Renata: Okay, let's go ahead and hit no, and then hit continue

315
00:42:12.588 --> 00:42:20.350
Renata: so for this I would like you to add a health insurance plan for yourself and your your daughter.

316
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:25.420
Renata: and you can X out of that, that should not have popped up for you. I'm very sorry.

317
00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:29.910
P15: Okay, that's fine. Okay. So I do have health insurance. So yes, and then continue?

318
00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:30.490
Renata: Yes.

319
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:36.270
P15: We have a well...

320
00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.070
P15: okay, continue.

321
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:51.250
P15: You have insurance now. I don't know if this is for myself or for my daughter.

322
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:54.390
Renata: Do you have the same or separate health insurance plans?

323
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:55.519
P15: We have separate.

324
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:56.295
Renata: Okay.

325
00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:02.829
P15: I mean, technically, we have the same. It's the same. Well, it's [insurance provider], but mine

326
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:10.830
P15: mine is through the school district, and my daughter's is through the State.

327
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.530
Renata: Okay.

328
00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:13.420
P15: They're both [Provider], but they're not.

329
00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.160
Renata: Got it.

330
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:14.790
P15: Yeah.

331
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:24.019
Renata: So like different group and policy numbers? Okay, so if you were doing this for real, you'd have to add separate health insurance for each, right?

332
00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:29.029
P15: Yeah, I wish it would have been specific, like, okay, this is health insurance for

333
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:34.319
P15: you? And then, like, cause like, here, I'm confused. Which one would I enter? I guess.

334
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:42.660
Renata: Okay, I'm gonna be a little annoying based on the information you've seen so far, like, which which plan would you be expecting to add at this point?

335
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.879
P15: Mine because I entered my information first.

336
00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.780
Renata: Okay, so let's go ahead and do that and see what happens.

337
00:43:56.230 --> 00:44:07.930
P15: Like here. It'd be annoying like the Start date. You don't ever really. They never really tell you the start date like on your and if you go back to your insurance card, your insurance card, you know how it renews every year. So they put the...

338
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:17.769
P15: So I don't. I'm just gonna guess here, because, you know. But if I were to be doing this I'd be annoyed because it's asking me for the insurance start date.

339
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.750
Renata: Got it. I appreciate that feedback.

340
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:28.690
P15: I mean, you may find the story on the declarations page of your insurance policy. If you don't get an insurance policy, you just

341
00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:31.499
P15: 2019. I don't know.

342
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.819
P15: Okay, insurance termination date. Well, it hasn't been terminated.

343
00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:39.160
P15: Oh, they want a date.

344
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.910
P15: So yeah, I would find this is really annoying because we don't.

345
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:47.620
P15: Okay.

346
00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.389
P15: What type of insurance is this? Yes, through the employer.

347
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.029
P15: Any additional comments about the applicants?

348
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:59.210
P15: No.

349
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:05.630
P15: okay. Now it does say applicants. Other health insurance. Oh.

350
00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.730
P15: okay, now it does say [Daughter]

351
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:12.909
Renata: Okay, and you were expecting to add yourself or...?

352
00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:17.030
P15: No, no, that's fine. This one is fine. I just wish the other one would say.

353
00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:22.500
P15: I don't know my name insurance for [P15], or something, so I know which one to enter.

354
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.930
Renata: Okay at the beginning, when you're adding the

355
00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:25.610
P15: Yes.

356
00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:26.479
Renata: The health insurance? Okay.

357
00:45:26.732 --> 00:45:30.019
P15: Do I add? Do I add my daughter's, or do I add mine?

358
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:35.910
Renata: Yeah, that makes sense. For the purposes of today. We'll just do your daughters. So that's fine.

359
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:43.190
P15: So upload the health card for her?

360
00:45:44.222 --> 00:45:48.327
Renata: Yes. And again, we can just use a a fake document here.

361
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.309
P15: Upload the back.

362
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.160
P15: I guess it didn't upload the back.

363
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:12.440
P15: Oh, can you...PPO?

364
00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:25.440
Renata: All right. I'm going to stop you here. I've got that question again, with the scale on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the Medicare and Health Insurance section of the form?

365
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:28.769
P15: I would say at 3.

366
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:29.500
Renata: Okay

367
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.810
Renata: And what in particular, made this a 3?

368
00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:43.960
P15: Just I didn't like that again, I didn't know when it was asking me about insurance. I just wish it would have specified whose insurance I was gonna enter first I mean.

369
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:51.579
P15: I entered mine because I had entered my name first, but I wish it would at least tell you insurance, for on our interest, so that you

370
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.150
P15: I don't know. I asked for.

371
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.610
Renata: Okay.

372
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:54.010
P15: Okay.

373
00:46:54.160 --> 00:47:01.930
Renata: Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you for that. So I'm gonna have you select no on other health insurance report and click continue.

374
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:14.470
Renata: So this is the last page that we're going to look at today. Like I said, we're not actually going to submit the form. So we're just going to end here. But I'd like you to please review the application for CHAMPVA benefits that you filled out.

375
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:19.969
P15: Okay, okay, signer is for me. Okay, so

376
00:47:54.951 --> 00:47:59.510
P15: well, report other health insurance.

377
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:02.750
P15: Where's mine?

378
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:08.560
P15: Okay. So did it come up under mine.

379
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:14.280
P15: I don't see. You know I entered my information for my own health insurance, but I don't see it on the app.

380
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:25.160
Renata: Oh, got it. We're not gonna click on it. But if you were, if you noticed that on VA.Gov, when you're filling that out. How would you add your your plan back in?

381
00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:27.359
Renata: Do you know how to do that?

382
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.320
P15: Let me see where the insurance add another plan.

383
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:41.019
Renata: Okay, you don't have to click on that today. But

384
00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:49.610
P15: But you see how it didn't. I thought I had entered my insurance first, st and then I entered my daughter's, but I don't see that it popped up here.

385
00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:52.540
Renata: Yeah, I do see that. Yeah.

386
00:48:57.011 --> 00:49:09.150
Renata: so I have a few questions for you before we wrap up with this, so you're not going to click that submit form button. But if you were to submit the form, what would you expect to happen next?

387
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:17.139
P15: I would expect to get something indicating that my application had been received.

388
00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:26.100
P15: I would expect for it to show it here on this app, and then I would expect that they would send me an email indicating that I've submitted an application.

389
00:49:26.657 --> 00:49:33.459
P15: And what and what I and what the turnaround time would be for me to get a response.

390
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.980
P15: That's what I would expect.

391
00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:45.239
Renata: Okay? Well, that that leads into my next question, which is, how soon would you expect to be notified by the CHAMPVA program about a decision about your application.

392
00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:59.010
P15: Within 30 days, I mean the sooner the better. But I know I mean I would expect I would love 2 weeks, but I know that gonna happen? Usually it takes them. What 30 days I don't know, does it? I don't know. Do you know the answer to that question? Is it.

393
00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:05.939
Renata: Well, we're asking, because we'd love to know what what folks expectations are, you know, in an ideal world.

394
00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.379
P15: 2 weeks. I would love 2 weeks, because

395
00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:20.800
P15: I mean, people get sick. People need to go to the doctor, and and many, some people are on maintenance, you know, medication that they need to take regularly. So

396
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.709
P15: yeah, I mean, CHAMPVA has been good. I mean, I know

397
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.450
P15: it's really helped us, I mean, especially when you have

398
00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:49.680
P15: primary coverage like we do. This is, you know, we don't pay. I recently had surgery, and I've had surgery before using CHAMPVA. And you don't pay a penny, and you don't pay a penny for your medication, either. I mean, there's stuff that needs to be improved on. But it's still a great program.

399
00:50:50.460 --> 00:51:05.620
Renata: That's great to know. So I have one more question for you, and then we can stop sharing screen. It's that 1 to 5 scale again, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to review your application for champion benefits on this page?

400
00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:18.849
P15: I would say probably a 4, because there's always room for improvement.

401
00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:24.730
P15: There's no way that I could score it as a 5. There's still some little things that could be fixed to make it

402
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:29.430
P15: a little more user friendly, a little bit easier to understand.

403
00:51:29.965 --> 00:51:33.719
P15: So I would probably grade it maybe a 4.

404
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:39.780
Renata: Okay. And anything in particular you want to call out with those little tweaks that would make it a 5?

405
00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:50.769
P15: Just, you know, not having to reenter, re-key that information that you've already entered for it to be more specific when it's asking for information. Who is the

406
00:51:51.499 --> 00:52:10.200
P15: I guess applicant that you're asking information about be more specific. Okay, this is or listed when we entered. You know, when I 1st started entering my information. Okay, this is applicant number one. Okay, that's me. Okay, applicant number 2. That's you know, the daughter, the child

407
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:16.569
P15: be specific, so that when you're entering information, you know what? Where that information is supposed to be entered.

408
00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:32.360
Renata: Okay, got it. I really appreciate that. So at this point we are done with the form. You can stop sharing your screen and and go back to the zoom. And at any point you can also close it out of your browser. But, just a few more questions for you before we wrap up.

409
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.480
P15: Okay.

410
00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:47.460
Renata: All right. So what were your thoughts about the amount of information provided on the form that you saw today?

411
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.190
P15: The amount information?

412
00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.680
P15: I mean, it seems

413
00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:06.659
P15: I mean, it seems like they ask for a lot of information. But

414
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:16.185
P15: I mean, I guess that's what's required, so that they can make sure that they're approving the people that are really eligible.

415
00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:23.579
P15: just for me, the challenge has always been like the stuff from school just getting that information. It's just,

416
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:28.046
P15: you know, very time consuming. I don't mind it.

417
00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:31.360
Renata: Yeah.

418
00:53:33.384 --> 00:53:43.660
Renata: I wanted to circle back to something you mentioned earlier in our conversation. Actually, just a quick time check. We're almost the top of the hour. Do you have a couple more minutes, or do you have a hard stop?

419
00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:44.870
P15: No, no.

420
00:53:44.870 --> 00:54:00.359
Renata: okay, I yeah. So I wanted to circle back to something that you mentioned earlier in the in the call. You said that when you submit your claims form that you're submitting the health insurance information with it. Is that correct? You're always submitting your health insurance info along with the the claims, information?

421
00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:17.539
P15: I'm sending what I'm sending. Okay? So I'm sending an EOB from [insurance provider]. So the EOB says, Okay, date of service. Okay, this is what we paid. So I'm sending in the claim form, and I don't know the number of the claim form, but it's for reimbursement.

422
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:32.010
P15: It's pretty easy to fill out. You can do it online. You can do whatever. So we fill that out. I get an itemized statement from my daughter's the help center, and then I send the EOB from [insuranc eprovider]. I think it's 3 things that I sent.

423
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:41.009
P15: and that's it. Send it off to Denver for processing.

424
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:56.659
Renata: So if I'm hearing you right, it's the claims reimbursement form, the EOB from [insurance provider], and the itemized bill from your Daughter's School Health Center. Are you sending in any other forms with health insurance information? With that or just those 3 documents.

425
00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:07.349
P15: Just those 3 documents, because the eob has all of our information as far as the [insurance provier], the Id Number, all that. The group number. Everything is on there.

426
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:18.859
Renata: Do you recall if you've ever received a a letter from the CHAMPVA program saying, "Hey, we don't have enough information about your claim like, could you send us more information"?

427
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:25.769
P15: There was one claim that they denied.

428
00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:30.670
P15: because the primary insurance said that it was not

429
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.850
P15: that they couldn't cover the the

430
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:51.560
P15: the visit because it wasn't under the plan, or it wasn't a covered benefit or something like that. So they came back and told us we can't pay you, because your primary insurance said that they wasn't covered, so because they don't cover it, we don't cover it. It's only happened one time.

431
00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:57.619
Renata: Okay, and and that was the end of it. You just you. You didn't resubmit anything?

432
00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:00.189
P15: No, I just left it as is. That was the only one claim.

433
00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:04.589
Renata: Okay, got it. Any questions for me before we close out?

434
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:11.930
P15: No, no, I mean, I like these kind of surveys, because

435
00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:19.679
P15: really you don't get that many surveys, I mean from Chat va, or I mean, sometimes you get like.

436
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:42.680
P15: you know, when you call them. And it's like, Okay, how did we do on our call? Like, you know? I mean. Sometimes you get like a little email, but it's very brief, and it's good for them to know what they what they can improve on and help hopefully make it easier for people down the line that are applying for this benefit. I've told a lot of my husband's friends about it.

437
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:53.499
P15: because there's still not a lot of knowledge regarding these programs. And sometimes, yes, you have vsos that do your job and and inform.

438
00:56:53.630 --> 00:57:17.090
P15: But it's like, after they help you with the claim. It's like you're on your own. You know what I mean. You kind of have to figure things out. So I've you know, I've kind of try to help out people that don't know about the program, especially my husband's friends that just got awarded a hundred percent. And I'm like, Hey, you need to go into. You know, the va.gov, go into chat. Va.

439
00:57:17.595 --> 00:57:24.440
P15: there's an application there. You can fill it out online, or you can print it out and get it done. But

440
00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:29.249
P15: there's a lot of people that still don't know, especially in this area where we live. [State].

441
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:50.050
Renata: Yeah. Yeah. I just wanted to circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners, and to remind you, we remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and we only share these videos internally at Va. With the purpose of improving the va.gov experience.

442
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:51.260
P15: Yes, that's fine. You can share.

443
00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:56.049
Renata: Okay, is there any part of our discussion today that you would not want shared in a video clip?

444
00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:57.700
P15: No.

445
00:57:58.010 --> 00:58:22.949
Renata: Okay, well, we really appreciate you taking time out of your day and your week to share your thoughts with us. It's really helpful for us as we continue to work on the site to make sure it really works for veterans and their families. So thank you. Lastly, Perigian is going to be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans and family members of veterans, you may know, to provide them with the chance to participate in future research studies like this one.

446
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:30.749
Renata: And with that, thank you so much. Again, have a great rest of your day and and week, and and we really appreciate it. So thank you.

447
00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.880
P15: Thank you. Thank you, Bernarda. I appreciate it.

448
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.590
P15: Yeah, alright. Take care you, too.

449
00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:36.420
Renata: Bye.

450
00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.220
P15: Bye-bye.
