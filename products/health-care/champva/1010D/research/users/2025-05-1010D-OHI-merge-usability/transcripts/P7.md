1
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:10.259
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording, and I would just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.930
P7: Yes.

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:20.319
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.950
P7: Yes.

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:31.180
Renata: All right. Okay, with that out of the way. Just some questions before we get to that demo tool that I mentioned before. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

6
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.790
P7: Personally, or my wife?

7
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.710
Renata: Oh, well, both of you, I suppose.

8
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.470
P7: I have not, because I'm a hundred percenter.

9
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.689
P7: and my wife is in CHAMPVA, she's enrolled

10
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.099
Renata: Okay. How long ago did your wife enroll in CHAMPVA?

11
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.699
P7: I think it would be around 2013. I'm not 100% sure. Whenever I got my 100 rating.

12
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:16.699
Renata: Okay, got it. I have a few more questions about that experience. And again, we're not testing knowledge or abilities. So if the answer is, I don't know or don't remember. It's totally fine. Do you recall if anyone such as a veteran service organization, family member or friend helped your wife fill out that application for CHAMPVA benefits?

13
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.910
P7: Only I did.

14
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.769
Renata: Only you did? Okay. And aside from your wife, is anyone else in your household currently enrolled in CHAMPVA?

15
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.650
P7: No one else in the household.

16
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.160
Renata: Okay, got it.

17
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:40.579
Renata: And do you recall if, when your wife applied for CHAMPVA benefits, if the 2 of you filled out a form called the other health insurance certification, or Form 10-7959?

18
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.400
P7: That's a memory test. I don't recall. Whatever was required to be filled out was filled out.

19
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:58.449
Renata: Okay, got it? And I'm assuming y'all filled out a a paper Pdf version of the form. Do you recall if you mailed that in or fax that in handed it in somewhere.

20
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.440
P7: If it could have been done electronically, that's how it would have been done.

21
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.720
Renata: Okay.

22
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.729
P7: Otherwise it would have been mailed.

23
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.720
Renata: Okay, and do you remember anything confusing or frustrating about the application process?

24
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.700
P7: No.

25
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.830
Renata: Okay.

26
00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:26.839
Renata: Do you know if your wife has submitted any medical or pharmacy claims to CHAMPVA while she's been enrolled in the program?

27
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.690
P7: Yes.

28
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.350
Renata: Okay, and

29
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.970
P7: Yes, I know, and yes, she has.

30
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.510
Renata: Okay, got it. And do you know anything about what that experience has been like for your wife?

31
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.710
P7: And so far as the claims, because we're both also have Medicare

32
00:02:47.194 --> 00:02:51.569
P7: her providers submit the claims as far as for her healthcare, directly.

33
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.570
Renata: Okay.

34
00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:57.570
P7: They usually submit the medication

35
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.079
P7: once, unless it's a renewal, and then it usually she calls the provider and uses the mail pharmacy.

36
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.800
P7: There's been no issues with it that I know of.

37
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:14.639
Renata: Okay, just making sure to check my understanding. So the providers and the pharmacies are are sending the claims directly to CHAMPVA, no issues there?

38
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.189
P7: The providers are, and their prescriptions are also being submitted that way.

39
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.069
Renata: Okay, got it. Just a few more questions for you. Do you have a va.gov account?

40
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.849
P7: I do

41
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.620
P7: and I don't like it.

42
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.330
Renata: Well, that leads into my next question. What has been your experience with logging into the site?

43
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.020
P7: It used to be simple until they started this 3rd level of verification.

44
00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:46.500
P7: I do not like that.

45
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.710
P7: I'm 70, almost 79.

46
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:58.490
P7: So I'm not as computer literate with telephones. And if you heard my other comment about not playing guitar anymore, my fingers don't work that good anymore.

47
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.659
P7: So I'd have to try when I'm logging in to either go to my email

48
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.690
P7: to be able to get a code number for the 3rd log in or go to my phone and get a text. And I don't text much

49
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.240
P7: is a pain in the royal butt.

50
00:04:14.765 --> 00:04:20.970
P7: And because I don't really have a lot of confidence in the security systems to begin with.

51
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.400
P7: and I should probably qualify that for you.

52
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.659
P7: When I was coding many years ago, in my youth

53
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:38.180
P7: I was coding high level security stuff. So it was going through NSA at the computer security agency for C-2 level stuff.

54
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.320
P7: including this encryption algorithm stuff. So it also indicated to me how insecure everything is.

55
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.380
P7: So I don't buy into the stuff of you're doing this for my own benefit.

56
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.039
P7: I have since found there are some ways to avoid those hassles to a degree.

57
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.580
P7: but I don't trust them, for instance, that you can request 10 numbers or id

58
00:05:02.444 --> 00:05:07.150
P7: carry them around with you. So they're not secure and use those instead of the 3rd

59
00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:13.270
P7: but you can also use external programs, and I forgot what they call them, but

60
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.220
P7: the one I'm using is 2 fa guard.

61
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.550
Renata: Hmm.

62
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.479
P7: So it will provide the number for me ahead of time, so I can stick that in there, instead of having to go through the 3rd stage.

63
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.069
P7: So that's my real big beef with it. I liked it better when it was just

64
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:42.230
P7: me setting my own security protocols and using a login id and a password and I - 

65
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.760
P7: You asked the question strictly, for va.gov correct not id me?

66
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.000
Renata: Correct. Yeah.

67
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.500
P7: Okay.

68
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.020
Renata: Okay.

69
00:05:49.660 --> 00:06:03.280
Renata: got it. And I'm sorry to hear that it's been a pain in the butt, in your own words, but you know we always appreciate when folks tell us about these frustrating experiences. It's the best way for us to improve things. So thank you for sharing.

70
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.279
P7: Maybe it's an age related thing, because I'm also ing [group] down at the VA outpatient clinic.

71
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.030
P7: and you'll hear these kind of comments from all the older vets.

72
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.900
Renata: Hmm.

73
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.629
P7: Who are not as computer literate as the younger vets. We don't live on our cell phones.

74
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.630
P7: So they are making it more difficult for older veterans sometimes.

75
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.710
Renata: Yeah, and what tasks are you logging into va.gov for?

76
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.930
P7: But let's see.

77
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.530
P7: I go into MyHealtheVet part now that I used to just use my healthy bet for prescription renewals

78
00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:47.899
P7: checking lab tests, reports X-rays.

79
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.400
P7: My medical records.

80
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.050
P7: Travel benefits.

81
00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:03.009
P7: That's another pain, at least out here and sometimes letters or documents.

82
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:11.370
Renata: Okay. How often would you say you're logging into va.gov on a regular basis?

83
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.870
P7: At least once a week, if not more.

84
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.999
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you.

85
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:33.000
Renata: So now we're going to take a look at that demo tool I told you about before, and I'm gonna drop a link in the chat which I'd like you to open in your browser, and then you can share your screen and zoom like we talked about before, and I can help walk you through that process. But.

86
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.510
P7: I'll need it.

87
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:42.129
Renata: At this point. If you can silence any notifications and close anything else that you might not need, and then let me know when you're ready for that link, and I'll drop it in the chat.

88
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:49.279
P7: Okay, close that program close this program. Hang a minute. Go to save that.

89
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:59.020
P7: Okay, I think I'm ready. I've just got my browser on in the Zoom Meeting.

90
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:07.180
P7: I don't know if I close the browser with the zoom going, but anyway, I see that link.

91
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.400
Renata: Yeah, go ahead and click on that.

92
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:15.050
Renata: or copy and paste it into your browser, and once it's loaded if you'll share your screen.

93
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.399
P7: Did something where it said, You're chatting. I'm not chatting.

94
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:25.110
P7: Oh, there it is over there. Okay, let me see if that'll work open. Link.

95
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.390
P7: Okay, I see the link. But I don't see you anymore. There you are.

96
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.999
Renata: Okay, you got back to zoom.

97
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.220
P7: Yeah, I've got that. But you're on top of the browser.

98
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:47.241
Renata: Hmm, okay, and then you'll have to share your screen. We can't see your browser yet.

99
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.930
P7: Okay, how do I share this screen?

100
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:52.740
Renata: So.

101
00:08:53.192 --> 00:08:56.359
P7: There's a key, isn't there? Alt. S.

102
00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:12.229
Renata: I don't know if there's a key, but I know that when you're in zoom there's a row of icons at the bottom like it says, audio video participants. And in the middle of those icons is a big green button that has an up arrow that says share. And you can click on that.

103
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.760
P7: I see that?

104
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.460
P7: And it says, Okay, application windows.

105
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.900
P7: Did that do anything.

106
00:09:28.555 --> 00:09:37.389
Renata: I think you'll have to select the browser window that you want to share, and then there's a button in the bottom, right? That says like, start broadcast, or start, share.

107
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.890
P7: Okay.

108
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:40.910
Renata: It's thinking

109
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.630
P7: Is it working?

110
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.769
Renata: It did work, perfect.

111
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.530
P7: Okay.

112
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:59.030
Renata: Alright. So just a few things before we start filling the form out to be aware of. This is our testing site, like I said before, so you don't have to worry about the information we enter going anywhere, and nothing that we click on in this form will have any bearing on your benefits.

113
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.420
P7: Okay.

114
00:09:59.681 --> 00:10:14.330
Renata: As you go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers. If you don't feel comfortable using real information, and I mentioned this to you at the beginning. But there are a few pages that you might see in this form that ask you to upload documents.

115
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:37.410
Renata: as we're not submitting the form, nothing you upload here is going to have any bearing on anything. When we get to those screens that ask for a file to upload, I can provide a sample Pdf for you to use, or you can use a random picture or file on your desktop whatever you feel comfortable with, and when we get to those screens I'll just remind you of that option when the time comes. But any questions for me?

116
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:37.990
P7: No.

117
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:38.720
Renata: Okay.

118
00:10:39.409 --> 00:10:46.940
Renata: so you can scroll up and down on this page, but without clicking on anything. Just take a look at the information and let us know your initial thoughts.

119
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.849
P7: Looks like it's a little oversimplified.

120
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.970
Renata: Okay.

121
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:09.030
P7: Add, I see that on a lot of the VA stuff now on the new VA websites

122
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:16.660
P7: I tend to prefer: give me a list and let me just go where I want to go, and don't try to walk me through it. But that's me personally.

123
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:24.230
Renata: Got it, and explain to me a little bit more what you mean by oversimplified. What does oversimplified here mean to you?

124
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.010
P7: Again

125
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:33.980
P7: I'm used to analyzing information on my own and

126
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:43.329
P7: going to places where I want to go when I want to, as opposed to having somebody walk me through. Here's a perfect example. I don't know if you're familiar with turbotax, as a tax program.

127
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.179
Renata: I am.

128
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:54.970
P7: They have a "here, we'll walk you through everything and do it," or "do it manually." I always do it manually, because I can select what I want when I want it.

129
00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:01.639
P7: So as I look at this, find out if I'm eligible for CHAMPVA, I probably wouldn't be on the website if I didn't think I was eligible.

130
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.200
P7: and I can do a search to find out the eligibility.

131
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.130
P7: or at least I used to be able to go on to

132
00:12:09.764 --> 00:12:15.590
P7: the va.gov sites and get all kinds of information depending whether whether it's benefits

133
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.659
P7: you know, pay rate, whatever it is. I know how to search on that page.

134
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.760
Renata: Okay.

135
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:29.979
P7: So to me, this is kind of for the idiots that can't maneuver through the web page itself.

136
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.069
P7: It's a polished interface.

137
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.210
Renata: Okay.

138
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:41.779
Renata: got it. So a few questions for you about this page. Do you know, if you're on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

139
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:47.460
P7: Well, it indicates, "find out if I'm eligible." So that doesn't mean you could actually apply.

140
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:56.009
P7: But I mean what I'm looking at so far just is telling me. Here's what I have to have to try to apply, find out if I'm eligible and so forth.

141
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.400
P7: But I don't know that it allows me to actually apply.

142
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.770
P7: So there is something that says, "Start your application," but that's at the bottom.

143
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:24.830
Renata: Okay, got it. And at this point I'd like you to scroll back up towards the top of the screen. And right below that big site maintenance, blue box. There's 3 links, it says, "va.gov Home," "Lvc Champva" and "1010 d Extended." My question here is, does Va Form 1010 d Extended mean anything to you?

144
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:25.909
P7: Not at all.

145
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:43.100
Renata: Okay, totally fair. And you mentioned doing research before landing on a page like this? Typically so what research would you do if you were applying for CHAMPVA benefits for your spouse today, before you got to this page?

146
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:48.860
P7: I would have probably done a Google search or equivalent. I use DuckduckGo now, and a couple of other search engines

147
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:55.650
P7: and just apply for CHAMPVA and see what results came up and work my links from there.

148
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:56.840
Renata: Okay.

149
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:04.110
Renata: I'm curious. Do you typically, look @ the va.gov links, or non-va sources? A combination of the 2?

150
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:12.639
P7: It depends. If I can find a va.gov link. Automatically, I will probably go there as a better source of information

151
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.400
P7: or more reliable source, I should say.

152
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:21.040
P7: but sometimes, if I see it pop up at some other kind of a link, I may go look at that.

153
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:29.690
Renata: Okay, got it. And what information do you think that you're going to need today to fill out this application for your spouse?

154
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:38.880
P7: I would probably think they'll need to know my information as the sponsor, that

155
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:47.709
P7: if she's applying under my sponsorship that I'm eligible, or she's eligible through my sponsorship, meaning I'm 100 or

156
00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:53.810
P7: then probably her social security number and other information whether she has any other insurance.

157
00:14:54.915 --> 00:14:58.769
P7: Because that'll depend whether they're secondary or primary for coverage.

158
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.350
P7: Oh, that would be my initial thoughts.

159
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:14.520
Renata: Okay. And do you happen to have all of that information on hand? Or would you need to pause and go find all of that documentation, if you're really applying for CHAMPVA benefits for your spouse today?

160
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:22.840
P7: If I was really applying for it, I'd probably turn around. Go on my desk drawer, and I probably have dates of birth and all that information, social security number for her as well as myself.

161
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:44.280
Renata: Okay, so it's pretty close on hand, but you'd go grab it. Okay, one last question for you on this page before we get rolling with the application on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the CHAMPVA application you're about to begin, based on this page's content?

162
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.559
P7: I'll read it more thoroughly.

163
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.310
P7: Personal information

164
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.320
P7: looks to me like it's pretty

165
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.889
P7: self-explanatory of what you're gonna need.

166
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.219
P7: but that's because I just read it. I hadn't read it before.

167
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:12.990
Renata: Okay. Before you double checked and read it, what would you give it on that 1 to 5 scale where 5 is very informed?

168
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.840
P7: What am I reading again? What, my.

169
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:26.470
Renata: The information that you see on the page, and and how informed it makes you feel about starting the application?

170
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:35.230
P7: My 1st impression looking at the page is, it? Didn't tell me much of anything because I felt it was oversimplified personally.

171
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.259
P7: so I didn't read in detail.

172
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.170
P7: Now that I read the detail, it seems to have everything.

173
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:47.379
Renata: Okay? So you'd rate it closer to that 5 on the rating scale, or a 4, a 3?

174
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:52.329
P7: Reading it in detail, I'd say probably at least 4.

175
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:53.075
Renata: Okay.

176
00:16:54.340 --> 00:17:10.709
Renata: got it. Thank you. So at this point I'd like you to scroll down a little bit further on the page for me, and at the bottom of the blue box below, where it says, sign in or create an account. There's a small link that says, Start your form without signing in. If you'd go ahead and click on that for me.

177
00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:12.759
P7: Done.

178
00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:29.199
Renata: All right. So at this point I'd like you to start the form as if you were applying for your spouse and one other family member like a dependent child. I'll let you know when to pause, and we'll do some questions. But to help orient you, we're going to go through the 1st 3 chapters of the form just.

179
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.130
P7: So I'll be clicking. Continue after I click a box?

180
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:49.689
Renata: Yeah, yeah. And I'll let you know when to pause. So just a few things as a reminder. Again, this is our testing site the information doesn't go anywhere, and you can use fake information for sensitive questions. And as you go through the form, please remember to think out loud. We wanna hear any reactions you're having as you're experiencing them. But you can go ahead and get started.

181
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.550
P7: I'm applying on behalf of my spouse and a child.

182
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.009
Renata: Yes, please.

183
00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.010
P7: I don't see a box that accurately describes that

184
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:07.650
P7: the middle box says I'm a veteran applying benefits from my spouse or dependents not. And okay.

185
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:16.100
Renata: So at this point, if you were on va.gov for real today you'd be. Would you stop? Would this be a stumper, or what would you do?

186
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:22.250
P7: I'd probably want to go find out what they wanted, because a lot of these things could get completely screwed up if you check the wrong box.

187
00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.639
P7: and you're not able to go back and correct.

188
00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:25.890
Renata: Okay.

189
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.180
P7: So I would. If I were

190
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.779
P7: writing the program I would give more than one check box.

191
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:37.740
P7: It would say, "I'm applying for my spouse." Check another box, "I'm applying for dependent." In addition.

192
00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:38.870
Renata: Okay.

193
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.579
P7: To make it clearer. What I'm trying to apply for.

194
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.260
Renata: So you would have 4 boxes there instead of just 3, is what I'm hearing?

195
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.600
P7: Yeah, to make it clear, because you use the term

196
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.590
Renata: Okay.

197
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.450
P7: Spouse OR dependents.

198
00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:03.000
P7: but if you put spouse AND dependents that would presume I'm doing both, so I wouldn't use that box if it was only a spouse.

199
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:09.340
Renata: Okay? Well, for the sake of today's session, I'm gonna have you select that one and press continue.

200
00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.120
P7: Okay, done. Your name.

201
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.660
P7: suffix.

202
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.550
P7: They don't have the right suffixes. I'll leave it off.

203
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:32.420
Renata: Which one

204
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.190
Renata: were you looking for out of curiosity?

205
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.190
P7: So esquire.

206
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.570
Renata: Oh, okay, got it.

207
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.763
P7: Well, there are doctors, I mean, there's a lot of things, Phds

208
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.359
P7: They're missing, but I don't see them

209
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.960
P7: as essential. Personally, I don't really care. My ego, isn't that big

210
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.569
P7: But you're gonna put all those suffixes.

211
00:19:52.380 --> 00:20:01.480
P7: There are people that would be bothered that you don't have Phd. Or Md. Or Od, or Esquire, or Jd. Or any of those kind of things.

212
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:10.350
P7: So I usually just... military base outside US. Now, country

213
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.380
P7: very nice. US is at the top.

214
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.003
P7: So, scrolling through the whole world, we can

215
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.330
P7: oops.

216
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.949
P7: I can't type either.

217
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.650
P7: That went back to the same sponsor stuff.

218
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:29.440
Renata: Okay.

219
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.530
P7: Date of birth.

220
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.080
P7: Okay.

221
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.129
P7: okay, this is a killer right here to start with

222
00:22:06.338 --> 00:22:10.489
P7: for mailing address. You're saying required street address.

223
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:19.170
P7: There are places in this country where mail does not get delivered to street addresses. I happen to live in one of them.

224
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.520
Renata: Okay.

225
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.939
P7: So we have po boxes. So our mailing address is a po box.

226
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:29.610
P7: because there's no mail delivery or pickup at residential addresses.

227
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.219
P7: so you won't have a street address

228
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.870
P7: if you're asking for a mailing address.

229
00:22:35.741 --> 00:22:39.260
P7: That can become confusing when you're making that required.

230
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:46.750
Renata: So if you were using real information here, you would just put the Po box number in that 1st line, or what would that look like?

231
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:51.470
P7: I would do that, but I don't know if your system would accept it.

232
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.000
Renata: Okay.

233
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.245
P7: A Po box.

234
00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:04.649
P7: We run into this as a regular problem where we live here, because people some try times try to authenticate addresses using a postal search.

235
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.784
P7: and the postal search will tilt using a residential address.

236
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:16.959
P7: So if you're saying mailing address, that's self explanatory, it's the address where we take mail.

237
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:23.000
P7: so it shouldn't really say street address should say, address, 

238
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.989
P7: or indicate that po boxes are acceptable.

239
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.039
Renata: Got it. Thank you for pointing that out.

240
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.880
P7: I run into it all the time. People don't want to ship to it. So

241
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:41.260
P7: okay, add applicants.

242
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.180
P7: You want me to play with it or just hit continue?

243
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.579
P7: I don't know what cancel button if that works or doesn't.

244
00:24:29.175 --> 00:24:33.290
Renata: I think it does. But then you'd go back to that applicant screen so you can go ahead and click.

245
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.710
P7: I just had to continue.

246
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.969
Renata: Might give you trouble with that, because it's consecutive numbers. If you flip the last 2 digits to 9, 8.

247
00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:49.830
P7: Okay.

248
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.379
Renata: You'll avoid getting an error message.

249
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:04.790
Renata: Yeah, there we go. Sorry. Our our test system can be a little finicky when you give it fake socials.

250
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.629
P7: Well, I don't know if there are consecutive ones. Is it

251
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.529
P7: Point of fact? Does have the same mailing address as another person?

252
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:28.380
P7: Oops. See now we're in same thing. It picked up the mailing address as a street address.

253
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:37.010
P7: I don't remember the form now, for sure, but I think that was line. One

254
00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.830
P7: of the address was the physical address line 2 is the Po. Box.

255
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:46.139
Renata: Okay, so what would you want to see here? Then, instead.

256
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:51.160
P7: Well what they should do. If I have 2 lines filled out on an address when I drop it.

257
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.360
P7: they should give me both of those, or just let me manually enter it.

258
00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.340
P7: I'm using address line one, address, line 2.

259
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:07.449
P7: I should be able to select among them that they're asking for an address selection.

260
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:14.410
P7: But we'll just use the address. Okay.

261
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.809
P7: see? Now, we're into the mailing address.

262
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.109
P7: Okay, we're using the full detail there.

263
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.330
P7: Okay.

264
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.730
P7: wonder what it will do.

265
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.320
P7: It's a different number.

266
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.970
P7: Is it going to tilt if I don't put in an email address?

267
00:26:51.941 --> 00:26:58.469
Renata: You can go ahead and click, continue and see. Would you prefer to enter an email address for the spouse here, or just skip on?

268
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.729
P7: So I was curious. What would happen if you didn't have one.

269
00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:06.799
Renata: Oh, okay, got it. Yeah, you should be able to continue. It's not required for the applicant.

270
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:14.760
P7: Oh, people are not gonna like you with this one sex listed at birth.

271
00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.499
P7: I'm being facetious on that these days.

272
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.870
P7: I don't even know what all the letters stand for.

273
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.189
P7: Let's see what [spouse's] relationship.

274
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.890
P7: Okay.

275
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:07.960
P7: now, you said I was supposed to be applying for [spouse] and a child. So do you want me to say?

276
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.029
P7: Add another applicant?

277
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.610
Renata: Yes. Please. Yeah.

278
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:12.350
P7: Okay.

279
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:39.020
P7: here, let me pick one. [Name]

280
00:28:54.930 --> 00:29:03.620
P7: I was curious as a minor child. They don't always have a social security number, but it's requiring one.

281
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.310
P7: Unless you're an undocumented migrant.

282
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:16.970
Renata: Yeah, unfortunately, you'd have to provide something at this point. But again, you can use fake information for this.

283
00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:25.450
P7: Oh, yeah, I was just pointing out. It's an issue, I think, with your form, because if you're putting children in there, they don't always have social security numbers.

284
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.250
Renata: Got it. Okay. I see.

285
00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.629
P7: So they should track it back to the date based on the date of birth.

286
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:31.860
Renata: Okay.

287
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.170
P7: Okay, so

288
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:45.529
P7: [SSN]

289
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:50.890
P7: okay.

290
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:07.299
P7: And see, we're back to the same thing as far as mailing address. They're only providing line one, not line 2,

291
00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.800
P7: same issue here with phone number and email addresses. If it's a child.

292
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:40.989
P7: Oh, I mean, teenagers have phones these days, but a minor child, 8, 9 years old won't.

293
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.300
Renata: Okay, so.

294
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.780
P7: Hopefully. Nobody calls that number.

295
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.819
Renata: No like, I said. We're not. We're not submitting anything.

296
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.629
P7: That was my office number of years ago, before I retired.

297
00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.138
Renata: Oh, got it. Okay.

298
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.529
P7: That pops up.

299
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.850
P7: Somebody else has it by now.

300
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:38.369
P7: I'm having a problem with this question for a couple of reasons, but blame that on me.

301
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:46.849
P7: There is no legal difference between a biological child and an adopted child for anything, including dependency for medical coverage.

302
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:47.770
Renata: Okay.

303
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:54.960
P7: Legally adopted, and a lot of children don't know they've been adopted or may not know it.

304
00:31:55.830 --> 00:32:03.439
P7: whereas there could be a difference between a stepchild who isn't adopted may not qualify as a dependent for coverage, so I can see that.

305
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.050
P7: But I think that asks for

306
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.510
P7: problems or questions. If you're going to distinguish between biological and adopted.

307
00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:13.580
Renata: Okay.

308
00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.469
P7: Unless there's a legitimate reason.

309
00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:19.000
Renata: Got it.

310
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:36.630
Renata: Alright. I'm gonna pause you right here before we keep going any further in the form. So just 1st of all, quick question was there. Aside from the things that you've already mentioned, anything else that was difficult, unexpected, unusual, that popped up in the this 1st 3 sections of the form?

311
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.780
P7: Unexpected, no unusual little bit like I mentioned, but nothing different.

312
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.270
Renata: Okay.

313
00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.699
P7: And no, I didn't see anything particular that I haven't already mentioned.

314
00:32:49.960 --> 00:33:03.140
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. I'm going to ask you another scale question. So on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. how difficult or easy was it to fill out this 1st section of the form?

315
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:03.900
P7: 5.

316
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.040
Renata: Okay.

317
00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.479
P7: Real information and didn't have to think of phony stuff.

318
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:26.719
Renata: Yeah, got it. Okay. So you can click "No" for that question "Do you have another applicant to add" and click continue. And then I'm going to have you pause on this next page before clicking on anything. Just take a quick look at what it's asking you, and let me know if anything stands out.

319
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.560
P7: Okay

320
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:45.490
P7: The 1st question itself is not clear, "do you have any Medicare plans to report?" So

321
00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.980
P7: what they're really asking is there an applicant that is on Medicare?

322
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:54.819
Renata: Okay, so would you rephrase it that way?

323
00:33:55.330 --> 00:34:00.150
P7: Well, yeah, I mean, do you have any Medicare that's saying, do you have any dog food to report? I mean, it's

324
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:01.470
P7: yeah.

325
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:05.680
P7: The grammar is confusing.

326
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:11.339
P7: It's easier to say, "is any one of the applicants on Medicare?"

327
00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:12.790
Renata: Okay.

328
00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:28.939
Renata: thank you. So I just like you to take a look up at the top of the page next to the va logo. It says, "1010d Extended CHAMPVA Application," and then in parentheses, it says, includes 10-7959c"

329
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.520
Renata: Do the does, 10-7959c mean anything to you at all?

330
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.899
P7: Not really.

331
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:44.540
Renata: Okay, that's totally fair. And thinking back to the information you saw on that 1st page, why is the form asking you about Medicare?

332
00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:52.960
P7: Because CHAMPVA is a secondary carrier. If you have medicare as opposed to other forms of insurance.

333
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:55.100
P7: So, if.

334
00:34:55.739 --> 00:35:02.300
P7: If you have any other form of insurance, you would probably drop it if you're not on Medicare, for instance, and my wife was on

335
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:06.269
P7: [health insurance provider], and was 50 years old

336
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:14.570
P7: and became eligible, for CHAMPVA would be a primary carrier, so there'd be no point in spending money to continue with [health insurance provicer].

337
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.939
P7: But once you're on Medicare

338
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:22.819
P7: CHAMPVA automatically becomes a secondary carrier. It's just like a Medicare supplement to Medicare.

339
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:23.640
Renata: Okay

340
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.239
P7: So it's important to know that.

341
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:36.879
Renata: So if you were filling out this application for CHAMPVA benefits on va.gov, today, would you need to stop and collect Medicare documents at this point, or would you have those on hand?

342
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:43.959
P7: Well, I know that my wife does have Medicare. It depends what information they ask. If they ask for her Medicare number,

343
00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:49.050
P7: then I'd probably have to go get her Medicare card because I don't think I have it written down in my data book.

344
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.110
Renata: Okay.

345
00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:50.520
P7: Put in mind.

346
00:35:51.190 --> 00:36:10.960
Renata: Got it so for the purposes of today's study, I'd like you to imagine that your spouse and that other family member have both Medicare as well as private health insurance plans. So I'm going to have you go ahead and fill out this next section, adding plans, Medicare and private health insurance for both of them. Then I'll stop you again when we get to the end of that.

347
00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.420
P7: I don't know that you can have. Well, that's not true.

348
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:19.579
P7: You can have private insurance as a Medicare supplement, but you can't have it as a

349
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.800
P7: primary medical coverage. If you're on Medicare, period.

350
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.940
Renata: Okay.

351
00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:31.259
P7: I mean, that's just the way it works because it'd be double benefits.

352
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.839
P7: So I'll add it to there. You want me to add it to the minor. Anyway.

353
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.250
P7: Medicare doesn't go to minors.

354
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:45.969
Renata: Yeah, I would like you to imagine that both of them have it for the purposes of today. I know that that might not be.

355
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.360
P7: It's letting me.

356
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:47.760
Renata: Realistic.

357
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.809
P7: One box.

358
00:36:49.413 --> 00:36:55.989
Renata: I see. So in an ideal world you would want to be able to check both here to indicate "Yes, both have Medicare plans"?

359
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.739
P7: You know it, toggles between the 2.

360
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.850
Renata: Okay.

361
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:02.489
P7: See? I don't know. Can you see that what it's doing.

362
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:08.489
Renata: I can. Yeah, for the sake of today. Let's just start with adding one for [spouse], and we'll we'll see what happens.

363
00:37:19.153 --> 00:37:21.430
P7: Let's see, do I want to put Part C?

364
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:28.969
P7: No, you're not listing part D, which should be included.

365
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.350
Renata: Okay.

366
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.349
P7: Your prescription coverage.

367
00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:38.539
Renata: So would you want the ability in an ideal world? Would you want to see Part D here as well?

368
00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:40.410
P7: I think it's essential.

369
00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:41.100
Renata: Okay.

370
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:41.770
P7: Because

371
00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:52.290
P7: if a person's on Medicare and looking at CHAMPVA, 1st of all, you're required to have A and B to get CHAMPVA secondary. If you're on Medicare

372
00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:57.430
P7: you can't stop B, and if you're gonna get medical

373
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:07.950
P7: your medicine coverage under CHAMPVA, you would drop part D, but they may want you to have proof of credible coverage for pharmacy benefits.

374
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.080
P7: Which is quite easy.

375
00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.270
P7: Whereas part C is just an alternative.

376
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:20.260
P7: It's possible to have part A only because that's free.

377
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:25.560
P7: and you could drop part B, but not if you're getting CHAMPVA you have to have part B.

378
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:26.730
Renata: Okay.

379
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:29.459
P7: But I don't know if the average person is gonna know that.

380
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:37.290
Renata: Yeah. Well, you can go ahead and click any plan for the sake of this and we'll keep going.

381
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.325
P7: Okay, hit, continue?

382
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.660
Renata: Yes, please.

383
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:40.960
P7: Okay.

384
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.790
P7: Oh, gee, I'm not.

385
00:38:49.900 --> 00:39:01.260
P7: We'll make it [date] effective date.

386
00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.060
P7: I'm not trying to crash your program. So

387
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:29.190
Renata: All right. So what what is this page asking you for in your own words?

388
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:34.550
P7: To copy a government ID. Big time problem.

389
00:39:37.822 --> 00:39:44.110
P7: Most people don't realize it is against the law to copy any government issued id form

390
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.439
P7: under Federal law.

391
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.379
P7: There are some exceptions.

392
00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:54.479
P7: but if I just looked at this first, I might say that's illegal. Can't do it.

393
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.800
Renata: Okay.

394
00:39:56.228 --> 00:40:00.079
P7: If this qualifies under an exception, and it might.

395
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.340
P7: because the Government's asking for it.

396
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:06.490
P7: they should indicate that it's an exception for copying

397
00:40:09.771 --> 00:40:18.920
P7: things with Id.Me and other people. They want you to copy government ids, and I think it's a misdemeanor under Federal law. But I can't remember the law right now, off the top of my head.

398
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.429
Renata: Oh, interesting! So this is one of those

399
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:33.530
Renata: is one of those pages I mentioned, where I can provide you with a sample document to upload. Would you like me to do that? Or do you have like a a random photo that you want to upload where we're asking for the card?

400
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.810
P7: Let me go look at my desktop and see what I've got.

401
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:36.555
Renata: Okay.

402
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.570
P7: Had so much junk.

403
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:44.649
P7: I have to look and find something, but it's faster than uploading, I know.

404
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:47.380
P7: Let me go here.

405
00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:50.880
P7: There.

406
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:05.020
P7: okay, that's a picture. Now, if I can figure out how to upload it.

407
00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.240
P7: Upload file.

408
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:15.189
P7: Oh, no. Just took me to a different place. I don't like that

409
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:24.059
P7: I don't know. It's gonna let me do this.

410
00:41:26.035 --> 00:41:30.279
Renata: If you know the file name, you can input it in that search field or.

411
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:35.830
P7: Try to drag it over into there. It won't let me drag it. That's terrible. I'm gonna have to go back to that other folder.

412
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.120
P7: Okay, not a problem.

413
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.129
P7: Resize. Zoom is out. Let me just pick any old thing.

414
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.070
P7: How about that one?

415
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.350
P7: Did you get it?

416
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.430
Renata: It. Yeah, it looks like it worked.

417
00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.050
P7: Are you going to ask me

418
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:10.970
P7: What it is.

419
00:42:12.871 --> 00:42:14.680
Renata: I don't want to pry.

420
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.120
P7: No, no, you can.

421
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:18.730
P7: That was taken in Vietnam.

422
00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.050
Renata: Oh, really.

423
00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.750
P7: It's a gunship.

424
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.280
P7: c-119.

425
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:31.899
Renata: Oh, wow! Is that is that more more recent visit, or an older photo?

426
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.789
P7: Oh, no, that's older. That's a C119 gunship.

427
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:44.460
Renata: Okay, got it. Okay, Well, you can upload the C 119 for the back of the medicard as Medicare card as well. That second upload file.

428
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.610
Renata: So

429
00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.280
P7: Continue?

430
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.350
Renata: Yes, please.

431
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.660
P7: Oh, now it's asking about Part D

432
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:07.180
Renata: Okay.

433
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.400
P7: I'm gonna say no.

434
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.539
Renata: Okay, okay, yeah, that's perfectly fine.

435
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.140
P7: Another plan to report for one or more applicants.

436
00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:36.490
P7: You didn't you say we were? Gonna do both Medicare and private carrier?

437
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.680
Renata: Yes, for today.

438
00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.389
P7: Okay. So then I have.

439
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:43.459
P7: This is asking me to report for another applicant.

440
00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.640
P7: But the child can't have Medicare.

441
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:56.574
Renata: Okay, so would you click yes or no in this situation, if you were on va.gov doing this?

442
00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.620
P7: So I would say no.

443
00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.969
Renata: All right. Doesn't have medicare?

444
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.920
Renata: Okay, let's go ahead and click. Continue and see what happens.

445
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:10.789
P7: [dependent] was not listed as having Medicare.

446
00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:31.579
P7: I'm not being overly picky, but if you're listing a dependent child that doesn't have Medicare, because they're not eligible.

447
00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:39.860
P7: then this whole section do I have a notice of disallowance, denial, or other proof of ineligibility.

448
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:41.430
Renata: Yeah.

449
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.420
P7: They need to link it to the date of birth of the dependent to determine if they're minor.

450
00:44:48.860 --> 00:45:05.539
Renata: Yeah, this is actually a known bug. So it's it's not reading the dependents date of birth correctly. This shouldn't be appearing for a minor but good eagle eye that you caught that, so you can go ahead and click. No, for the question.

451
00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.319
P7: Okay, and continue?

452
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.440
Renata: Yes, please.

453
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.879
P7: Okay. Now, we're doing other health insurance.

454
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.360
P7: And you wanted me to do this?

455
00:45:16.451 --> 00:45:18.959
P7: For one or both of them.

456
00:45:19.798 --> 00:45:24.530
Renata: Well, based on what you're seeing on this page. Do what do you think?

457
00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:28.969
P7: Well, I could do it for either or both of them.

458
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:30.250
Renata: Okay.

459
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:34.540
P7: So if I said Yes, then

460
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.549
P7: I could go now into a private plan for the minor.

461
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.130
Renata: Okay, got it

462
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:46.440
P7: Be thinking that way. But oh, let me use that.

463
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:48.870
P7: What do you want to get.

464
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:57.319
Renata: And just a quick time check. We're about 6 min to the top of the hour. If you were to do, you have time to to stay a couple of extra minutes, or do you have a hard stop?

465
00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.339
P7: No, I'm doing good.

466
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.179
Renata: Got it. Okay.

467
00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:05.280
P7: I'm because I'm talking. I'm finding these issues. So if you want to know them, I'm gonna call it.

468
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.350
Renata: Any demo.

469
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.970
P7: [Insurance provider]

470
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:18.519
P7: Oh, now, that's gonna be tricky, because I forgot what date I put down to the kids age

471
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:29.540
P7: I know what I'll do.

472
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:35.940
P7: I think it was 2022 I put for the age so that shouldn't tilt it.

473
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.869
Renata: I think so too.

474
00:46:38.855 --> 00:46:45.400
P7: But that would be another factor.

475
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:54.039
P7: because, as you're going through this many screens, I can't tell what I put down in reality, I would know how old the kid was when birthday was.

476
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:55.540
Renata: Right.

477
00:46:55.801 --> 00:47:01.300
P7: And what did I actually started it? But if I put the wrong date down it could tilt the whole program.

478
00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.829
Renata: I don't know what they have for verification.

479
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.380
P7: Termination. It's not terminated.

480
00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:13.130
P7: Continue, employer. No, it's private.

481
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.650
P7: Do you want me to put anything in here, or just say, continue?

482
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:26.900
Renata: If you don't think that you would put anything in here, then you can leave it blank.

483
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.230
P7: I don't think I would.

484
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.250
Renata: Okay.

485
00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:33.749
P7: Which applicant is the [Insurance] plan. We got it

486
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.799
P7: okay, and they want the health card to be uploaded. So here we go again.

487
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:45.870
Renata: Yeah, you can use the same right?

488
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:46.550
P7: The gunship

489
00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:47.660
Renata: Okay.

490
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:53.230
P7: I have other. I have lots of other stuff there, but

491
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:59.169
P7: I've got that one located so.

492
00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.780
Renata: All right, I'm gonna stop you right here and ask more questions.

493
00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:08.140
Renata: Okay.

494
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:19.489
Renata: so that 1 to 5 scale again, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the Medicare and other Health insurance section of the form.

495
00:48:20.918 --> 00:48:25.430
P7: For me, I would say a 3.

496
00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.600
Renata: Okay.

497
00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:29.540
P7: Partly because of the knowledge that I already have.

498
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:34.450
P7: and what I see is program or problems in it. I don't know what a person

499
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.959
P7: that doesn't understand the program would do.

500
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:38.230
Renata: Okay

501
00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:43.499
Renata: And what in your mind would take it from that 3 to a 5 being very easy?

502
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:49.270
P7: Simplifying the sequence of questions and interaction.

503
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:50.710
Renata: Okay.

504
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:53.489
P7: Separate pages sometimes can make things

505
00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:58.210
P7: complex because you have to remember back to what you answered earlier.

506
00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:04.220
P7: Now, again, this is a sample thing. So I'm not using real data that I would probably know.

507
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:09.710
P7: Oh, and I think that's where the problem comes in.

508
00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:25.989
Renata: Okay. So in terms of like simplifying it. So that we're we're putting things on the same screen. What would that look like for you for the Medicare and health insurance portions. Does that mean putting all medicare and health insurance on the same page? 

509
00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:29.690
P7: Personally, I would rather see it per person.

510
00:49:30.368 --> 00:49:35.200
Renata: I'm doing my spouse, and I'm listing the insurance for my spouse there, and I can see it.

511
00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:42.820
P7: And then the child and I'm keeping them, you know, Consolidated together.

512
00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:54.210
P7: plus I was doing it for real. And I'm looking at a lot of different document. I go. Okay, I got this piece, fire this pile of paper over here. I'm going back and forth rather than just going straight through with one at a time.

513
00:49:54.830 --> 00:50:16.490
Renata: Okay, got it noted. You can go ahead and click no, on other health insurance report and click continue. Okay, so this is the last page that we're going to look at. Like I said before, we're not actually going to submit the form today. But on this page I'd like you to just review the application for chant Va benefits that you've filled out for your spouse and dependent.

514
00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.120
P7: Okay?

515
00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:21.509
P7: So what I'm seeing, Signer sponsor applicant.

516
00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.629
P7: there's the button that should be a bigger button. Expand all.

517
00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:55.780
Renata: Okay.

518
00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:08.880
Renata: got it all right. Just a few questions for you on this page. Let's say you accidentally put some information, input some information wrong like your spouse's middle name. How would you go about fixing that.

519
00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.660
P7: Well, I'd go here 1st and hit the edit button.

520
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.749
Renata: Okay, got it. You don't have to click on it today.

521
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:18.760
P7: Sponsor that wasn't spouse, but that's

522
00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:23.009
P7: I mean, as long as the edit button is prominent.

523
00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:35.569
Renata: Okay, got it and like, I said, we're not gonna click the submit button at the bottom of this page. But if you did submit the click, the submit form button. What would you expect to happen next?

524
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:37.700
P7: Get a receipt for submission.

525
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:38.950
Renata: Okay.

526
00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.250
P7: Something that says you've submitted it.

527
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:50.610
P7: Yeah. And depending upon protocol, expect an answer whatever period of time, or you know something to indicate what the next step would be.

528
00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:59.739
Renata: Okay. And that leads into my next question, which is, how soon would you expect to be notified about a decision being made on your application for CHAMPVA benefits?

529
00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.509
P7: I can't really answer that, because I see 2 different options.

530
00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:10.579
P7: But I'm dealing for personally

531
00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:19.460
P7: as a hundred percent disabled veteran other than them verifying my status. She's automatically entitled to coverage period, so I would expect a pretty fast response.

532
00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.560
Renata: Okay.

533
00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:31.400
P7: If there were any exemptions or exceptions to providing champion coverage, then they would have to underwrite the application.

534
00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.330
P7: and I would expect to have

535
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:37.779
P7: something in the vicinity, probably 7 to 10 days, or less.

536
00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:48.790
Renata: Okay? So that's on the underwriting side of things. But if if there's no issues with it and it's automatically eligible, you're expecting a pretty quick turnaround. What what are we talking about in terms.

537
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.559
P7: Something within 24 hours.

538
00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:52.580
Renata: Okay

539
00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:56.140
P7: Because I don't take manual. It shouldn't take much manual intervention.

540
00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:01.240
P7: If you have all my information, you should. Well, I shouldn't say that. Not with the Va.

541
00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:08.180
P7: Theoretically, they should be able to run my social security number and have it authenticate and behave that I'm 100%.

542
00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:12.110
P7: Okay, automatically trigger the application.

543
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:19.079
P7: But the VA has a problem between health insurance and benefits, talking to each other on their computers. So.

544
00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:38.260
Renata: Well, like, I said, this is an ideal world scenario. So it's good to know what the expectation is. So one last question for you on this page. It's that 1 to 5 scale again, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it for you to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits?

545
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:45.150
P7: I'm gonna say 4 only because the expand all button isn't big enough and prominent.

546
00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:45.820
Renata: Okay.

547
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:54.599
P7: As somebody who's almost 79 years old and has some arthritis and stuff. I hate clicking buttons that are unnecessarily the expand sections.

548
00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.840
P7: So if I'd have seen the expand all quickly, I'd just hit that first.

549
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.960
Renata: Okay.

550
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:08.069
Renata: got it so that we're done with the screen sharing portion of today's session. We're gonna wrap up. But you can go ahead and stop screen, sharing.

551
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:10.430
P7: Stop, share. Okay.

552
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:16.650
Renata: Just a few more questions for you. So overall. Was there anything you saw in the session today that worked well for you?

553
00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:25.660
P7: A lot of little things. I mean, the typing and box entry was easy.

554
00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:27.980
P7: Didn't have any problems with it.

555
00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.709
P7: Moving from field to field was easy and worked.

556
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:36.129
P7: You know, navigation work correctly.

557
00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:46.119
P7: The dropdown boxes were okay. But again, subject to whether you add or delete extra things that should be, in my opinion, in there or not in there.

558
00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:47.280
Renata: Okay.

559
00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:55.550
P7: The gender questions for me. We're very easy, but I think in today's society it's very difficult.

560
00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:56.830
Renata: Okay.

561
00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:57.480
P7: Of

562
00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:05.060
P7: and like I said, I truly don't even know what all the letters mean anymore. And I don't really care, because I don't have any prejudices.

563
00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:05.810
P7: But.

564
00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:06.370
Renata: Right.

565
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:10.620
P7: For instance, my granddaughter said. She's gender neutral. She told us that years ago I said.

566
00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:20.619
P7: [Name], I can give you general neutral. You got a boyfriend. You sleep with him, I mean, what's neutral about this picture? I don't understand it, but people otherwise may

567
00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:23.790
P7: be overly sensitive when you're starting to see

568
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:31.339
P7: birth gender as if it has a significance, and if it doesn't, I don't think that kind of question should be asked.

569
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:32.349
Renata: Got it.

570
00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:37.710
P7: Especially if they're military related. Now that our President is saying

571
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.710
P7: transgenders out of the service. I mean, there's a lot of

572
00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:48.270
P7: political issues there that I think you need to be sensitive when you're writing those kind of things.

573
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:57.960
Renata: Got it. Thank you for sharing. And what if anything was unclear or didn't work well for you that you wanted to share haven't called out so far?

574
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:00.000
P7: Nothing that I didn't already tell you.

575
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.840
Renata: Yeah.

576
00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:04.699
P7: I think I already told you as we went through the mailing addresses, is a big issue.

577
00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:06.030
Renata: Okay.

578
00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:13.710
Renata: got it. And what are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in this form? Not enough, too much, just right?

579
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:15.950
P7: You mean explanatory information?

580
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:17.900
Renata: Yeah. Explanatory information.

581
00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:27.950
P7: I think it was pretty good. What we didn't test, and it could be there would be. Is there a help or whatever? If somebody doesn't understand a question.

582
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:32.570
P7: I didn't notice that one way or the other, so I can't comment on it.

583
00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:35.030
P7: because I always think that's good to have.

584
00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.340
Renata: Okay.

585
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:45.399
Renata: And comparing this to when you and your wife originally applied for CHAMPVA benefits, how would you compare the experience you just went through today?

586
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:52.830
P7: I really can't, because it's been a number of years since we did it, and it wasn't a problem for me to do it back then. So.

587
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:58.369
Renata: Okay, got it. Any questions for me before we wrap up?

588
00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.960
P7: Nope.

589
00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:06.260
Renata: Okay. I just wanna circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of the session with our VA partners?

590
00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:06.870
P7: Oh, yeah.

591
00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:33.469
Renata: Okay, got it. Well, P7 we really appreciate you taking time out of your day and your week to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is super helpful as we continue to work on the site and making sure it really works for veterans. So thank you truly. Lastly, Perigian is going to be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to any other veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies like this. But with that, thank you so much. Again.

592
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:34.700
P7: Got a question on that.

593
00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:35.460
Renata: Oh, yeah.

594
00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:44.990
P7: Okay. A very good way to get the participation is if you send this to the managers of the outpatient clinics, to the voice of the veteran groups. I don't know.

595
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.380
Renata: Okay.

596
00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:46.510
P7: Nationwide.

597
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:49.729
P7: I go to the [city] VA outpatient clinic.

598
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:50.970
Renata: Okay.

599
00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:53.630
P7: We have a voice of the veteran group, and there's about

600
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.700
P7: 10 or 12 of us in there.

601
00:57:57.150 --> 00:58:02.709
P7: as well as some of the VA staff. So if you're looking for people that want to participate, that would be a good source.

602
00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:24.410
Renata: Oh, great well, I'll talk with Perigian before they send that. Thank you to you and double check. It's possible that they could give you a flyer that you could share, or just double check, that that link is one that you could share with all of those folks. But yeah, we'd we'd love it if you shared it with anybody, you know, at the outreach center or voice of the veteran. But yeah, with that, thank you so much. Have a great rest of your day and your week.

603
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:26.229
P7: All right, thank you. Bye-bye. Now.

604
00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:27.200
Renata: Bye.
