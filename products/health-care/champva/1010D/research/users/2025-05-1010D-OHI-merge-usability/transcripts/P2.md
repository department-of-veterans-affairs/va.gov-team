1
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:08.820
Renata: Alright. I have started recording. I'd like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.420
P2: Yes.

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.979
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion to share with our Va. Partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you.

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.860
P2: Yes.

5
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.810
Renata: Okay, we are done with all of the

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:34.129
Renata: the business upfront. So we're gonna we're gonna get. We're gonna get the show on the road. So before we look at the website, I just have a couple of warm up questions for you. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program?

7
00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:36.820
P2: No.

8
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.390
Renata: Okay, and do you intend to apply for CHAMPVA benefits for you or your your family in the future?

9
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.260
P2: No.

10
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.410
Renata: And why not?

11
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.729
P2: I am on tricare for life. Wife's on tricare prime. I'm retired. Military.

12
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.840
Renata: Got it.

13
00:00:56.454 --> 00:00:58.809
Renata: Do you have a va.gov account?

14
00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.850
P2: Yes.

15
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.249
Renata: And what has been your experience with logging into the va.gov Site?

16
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.519
P2: It sucks.

17
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.450
Renata: I'm sorry to hear that any anything in particular that sucks, or just the whole experience?

18
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.780
P2: MyHealtheVet was awesome.

19
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.070
P2: I could get on my phone with the VA app, use my thumb. Everything was perfect

20
00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:28.299
P2: they recently started doing away with that login and going to

21
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.090
P2: 2 other forms of of logging in. And I think one of those is gonna go away.

22
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.150
P2: So.

24
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.910
P2: They're getting a more secure login, and

25
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:54.330
P2: it worked. It wasn't broke. There was no need to fix it, but they did. Anyway, change is not

26
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.290
P2: a good thing.

27
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.114
Renata: Yeah, I hear you thank you for sharing that. And I'm sorry. It's been a difficult transition.

28
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.729
Renata: How often and for what tasks. Are you logging into va.gov?

29
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.649
P2: To check claim status up about once a week or so in the past

30
00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:23.679
P2: now mainly just to look at medical stuff.

31
00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:30.609
P2: But it. It seems to take them a while to get medical information entered.

32
00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.929
P2: even though they say you could look at your records. You can't see everything.

33
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.539
Renata: Okay, like an after visit summary, is that what you're referring to? Or.

34
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.270
P2: Yes, I could go to MyHealtheVet with the blue button.

35
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.209
P2: and I could see what they would write down in my visits.

36
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.729
P2: And now I'm not seeing as much information.

37
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.619
Renata: Got it. Okay, again, I'm sorry to hear. That sounds like a very frustrating experience, but I appreciate you sharing it with me all the same.

38
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:20.040
Renata: So the for the next portion of the session. We're gonna be looking at that demo tool that I referred to before. In order to do that, I'd like you to share your screen. But I wanna double check. Are you comfortable with sharing screen on zoom.

39
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.180
P2: Yeah.

40
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:34.140
Renata: Okay, great so I'm gonna give you just a moment if you've got any other browser windows open or notifications, just close those and let me know when you're ready for that link. I'll put it in the chat.

41
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.970
P2: Okay.

42
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.590
Renata: All right. I have shared the link.

43
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.730
Renata: Once you've got that open and loaded, you can share your screen and let me know if you need any assistance.

44
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.580
P2: All right.

45
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.100
P2: How do I share.

46
00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:17.389
Renata: On your browser, not on your phone. At the bottom of the zoom application. There should be a bunch of icons. There should be a bright green one, with an up arrow that.

47
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.669
P2: Oh, share, screen.

48
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.740
Renata: Yeah.

49
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.020
P2: I have a laptop and 2 monitors.

50
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.810
P2: The zoom is on 3.

51
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.390
P2: The VA thing is on 2.

52
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.660
Renata: Okay, so you'll probably have to select sharing the 2 monitor.

53
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.469
Renata: and I see it perfect. There we go.

54
00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:18.440
Renata: Alright. So just a couple of heads out before we jump in. This again is our a demo tool, and we're on our testing site. So you don't have to worry about any information that you enter going anywhere. This isn't. This isn't attached to any Vigo systems. So nothing you click on this form is going to have any bearing on your benefits

55
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:44.589
Renata: as we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers. If you don't feel comfortable using real information. There's a few places in the form where it's gonna ask you to upload documents. When we get to those points I can give you a dummy document to upload, so I'll just stop you and ask you that when we get to those any questions for me, though, before we jump in.

56
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.430
P2: No.

57
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:55.449
Renata: Alright. So, without clicking on on anything at this point, I'd just like you to take a look at the information on this page. Tell us your initial thoughts, questions, anything that comes up for you.

58
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.530
P2: That seems pretty straightforward.

59
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.020
P2: No typical VA site.

60
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.590
Renata: All right, anything in particular that makes it straightforward.

61
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.119
P2: Now it says, to apply for benefits, and then it's got the steps on what to do.

62
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.810
Renata: Got it.

63
00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:45.469
Renata: If you scroll back up to the top of your page there you might notice that there's a little thing that says "1010D Extended." What does that mean to you? If anything.

64
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.730
P2: Don't have a clue.

65
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.269
Renata: No clue. Okay, that is fair. Do you know how to check your eligibility for CHAMPVA benefits for you and your spouse or dependent children?

66
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.129
P2: I just click on the link that says what the requirements are.

67
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:08.869
Renata: Okay, dnd what information do you think you're gonna need to fill out the champa application for your spouse and children today?

68
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:19.720
P2: Social [security numbers], probably something from the military.

69
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.740
P2: Oh, I don't know. Branch of service, time served, something like that.

70
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.410
Renata: Okay

71
00:07:29.893 --> 00:07:36.620
Renata: any documents that you think you might need to provide? Along with that information on this application.

72
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.430
P2: Dd-214.

73
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.930
Renata: Okay.

74
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.300
Renata: Anything other than your discharge papers?

75
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:56.519
P2: I don't know if it's based on finances. If it was, then there'd be financial stuff.

76
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.860
P2: I've never dealt with CHAMPVA. 

77
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:13.729
Renata: Totally fair. If you were to do some research before filling this form out, is there a place on this site or on this page where you would go to look for more information about what you need?

78
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.269
P2: I'd just click. See where it says, "find out if you're eligible"

79
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.490
P2: and see what the requirements are.

80
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:41.710
Renata: Okay, so you click that got it. So based on the information that you just said socials, military information potentially your Dd-214 and finances. Do you happen to have all that information on hand, or would you need to pause it and go find those documents if you were really applying for chanva benefits today.

81
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.240
P2: I have 2 dd-214s.

82
00:08:49.836 --> 00:08:56.070
P2: Right under my laptop and the financial stuff

83
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.329
P2: I just have to print out.

84
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.389
Renata: Got it

85
00:09:01.862 --> 00:09:05.390
Renata: So you've you have most of that stuff on hand.

86
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.890
Renata: If you were to do this.

87
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.439
P2: Yes, or easily accessible.

88
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:18.299
Renata: Okay, so I'd like you to scroll down to the bottom of the page. Now, and there's a place that says, start your form without signing in

89
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:24.999
Renata: underneath that that blue button that says sign in or create an account. Yeah, go ahead and click that.

90
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:41.260
Renata: and just to wrap up before we start filling out the form, that last page on a scale of one to 5 with one being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the application that you're about to begin? Based on the content you read.

91
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.719
P2: Say that again.

92
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:57.630
Renata: Sorry on a scale of one to 5, with one being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed you feel about the Champ application based on that page you were just looking at?

93
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.950
P2: About 4, I guess.

94
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.399
Renata: Okay. And why would you give it a 4?

95
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.510
P2: Change, pretty simple.

96
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.610
Renata: Sounds fair enough.

97
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:40.890
Renata: all right. So on the screen that you're on. I'd like you to start this form as if you're applying for your spouse and one other family member like a dependent child. I'll let you know when to pause, and I'm going to ask questions at that point. But to help orient you. We're going to do about 3 sections of the form before we stop. Just a couple reminders again. It's a testing site.

98
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:54.850
Renata: You can use dummy information. None of this goes anywhere. We're not submitting it, and as you go through the form, I'd love it if you could think out loud. We want to hear any reactions, questions, comments as they're coming up. And you're experiencing them.

99
00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:00.990
P2: Okay, so it's gonna be applying for benefits for my spouse or dependents.

100
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:02.890
P2: Correct.

101
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.150
Renata: Yeah. Go ahead.

102
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.249
P2: Okay, now, just hit that. Then continue.

103
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.480
Renata: Yes.

104
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.400
P2: I'll wager the cost.

105
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.210
P2: I'm not worried about that. Everybody can find that.

106
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:35.809
P2: You would think that the day and the year would have a drop down.

107
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.310
Renata: Is that what you would expect or prefer in this situation.

108
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:51.709
P2: I'm actually glad they don't, because on the [birth]year I have to spin, like on wheel of fortune to get all the way down to 1959.

109
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.570
P2: Yeah, the older you get, the further you gotta go.

110
00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.140
Renata: Yeah, yeah.

111
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.599
P2: Normally the file number and social are the [numbers].

112
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:30.400
Renata: For the purposes of today. You can just leave the file number blank if you, if you put something in for the social.

113
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.500
P2: I put dashes and it didn't. That was too many digits.

114
00:13:42.966 --> 00:13:43.980
Renata: Got it?

115
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:57.330
P2: Okay, seems easy.

116
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.890
P2: I actually know my wife's social security number. A lot of people don't.

117
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:43.209
Renata: That is true. I think my husband does not know mine, and would not be able to get through this part of the the session.

118
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.250
P2: Wow!

119
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.730
P2: I made up a number, but it don't work.

120
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.600
P2: Okay.

121
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.329
P2: He's your.

122
00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.230
P2: I'm not going to say

123
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.900
P2: a child, too. It's just a spouse.

124
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.960
Renata: Yes, please, if you could add one child, that would be great.

125
00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.030
P2: No clue.

126
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:08.399
Renata: Any any questions or issues coming up? Aside from not

127
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.329
Renata: knowing your dependents Social security number off the top of your head?

128
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:25.099
P2: Other than the political correctness of the Form. No.

129
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.030
P2: Oh, even if you make up a number.

130
00:17:39.651 --> 00:17:42.180
P2: I can't make up a number

131
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.440
P2: because it wanted has to be a valid number.

132
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:54.169
Renata: Yeah, maybe. Maybe try something with no double zeros in the middle.

133
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.039
Renata: There we go. The sometimes our test site is a little.

134
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.420
P2: A bit.

135
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.690
Renata: Finnicky, so.

136
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.250
P2: 0.

137
00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:06.380
Renata: Yeah.

138
00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:13.830
P2: Same address.

139
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.589
P2: At one time I knew my son's phone number.

140
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.150
P2: Now it's all on the phone.

141
00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:41.049
Renata: So if you were filling this out to, you know, for real on va.gov, would you need to pull your phone out to double check that number?

142
00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:41.580
P2: Yeah.

143
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.339
Renata: Okay, how about email address.

144
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:52.679
P2: I would have another tab open, and I'd go to my address book, and it would be there.

145
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:54.450
Renata: Got it. Okay.

146
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.349
P2: But it would be old.

147
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.989
P2: I've never seen that before.

148
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.070
Renata: The what, which thing before?

149
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.999
P2: Whether they needed to know if it was biological, step or adopted [dependent].

150
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:52.489
Renata: Interesting. Do you have any idea why that question might be asked on this application?

151
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.030
P2: No unless they needed.

152
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:09.250
P2: Now, if a doctor needed medical information, if it's not biological, then my history wouldn't matter.

153
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:16.829
P2: But if there's a family disease, and it's biological. Then the family history matters.

154
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.909
P2: But other than that, I don't know.

155
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:28.620
Renata: Okay, any other questions that we asked about the your wife and dependent child that stood out to you, or just that one?

156
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:33.610
P2: No! Oh, that was just an observation that I've never seen.

157
00:20:34.625 --> 00:20:37.240
P2: No, it all seems pretty simple.

158
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:51.520
Renata: Okay, before we keep going, I have a question for you. So on a scale of one to 5, with one being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this section of the form?

159
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:52.830
P2: Oh, that was easy.

160
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.699
P2: 5 was easy, very easy.

161
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.330
Renata: But yeah, yeah.

162
00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:58.499
P2: Yeah, no problem at all.

163
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:04.000
Renata: Okay. What anything in particular stand out is very easy to you?

164
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:10.759
P2: No, it's just normal information that you should already know.

165
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:16.610
P2: And your name, your address, your phone number, either you already have that. What's all written

166
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:22.269
P2: the social security. If he was living at home.

167
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:26.300
P2: then I would still have it, because he's a dependent on taxes.

168
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:32.029
P2: and if he's not living at home. I'm not claiming him unless he's a student, maybe.

169
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.189
P2: but if if I was claiming him

170
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:41.480
P2: then I would still have his social for tax purposes, so I would have the info.

171
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:52.609
Renata: Okay, thank you for sharing so you can click no to that question on your screen that says, Do you have any more dependents to add and click, continue.

172
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:53.370
P2: Okay.

173
00:21:53.750 --> 00:22:03.119
Renata: And before we go any further I'd just like you to take a look at this page in the form, and let me know if anything stands out to you, questions, concerns, comments.

174
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.150
P2: No no question.

175
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.250
Renata: Alright! Do you know what this section of the form is asking for?

176
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.740
P2: If I have Medicare for me or anybody else that I'm claiming.

177
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:36.639
Renata: Okay, thinking back to the information you saw on the 1st page of this form, do you remember any mention of Medicare being required?

178
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:37.850
P2: No.

179
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:52.989
Renata: Okay. And if you were filling this out on an application for CHAMPVA benefits on va.gov today, would you have medicare or health insurance information on hand? Or would you need to pause at this point to go collect more documents?

180
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.280
P2: I would have it.

181
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.780
Renata: Okay, got it

182
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.530
P2: I am on Medicare.

183
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.250
Renata: Okay.

184
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.459
P2: And I have a card in my wallet somewhere.

185
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.202
Renata: Oh, got it

186
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.980
Renata: So you just have to go find wherever you put your wallet and grab that?

187
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.830
P2: Right over here.

188
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:14.860
Renata: Okay

189
00:23:15.722 --> 00:23:35.729
Renata: So for the purposes of today's study, I would like you to imagine that both your spouse and dependent child have medicare as well as private health insurance. So go ahead and fill these sections out for both your spouse and your child, and like I said, there might be some upload screens, and we'll talk about what to do when you get there.

190
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.329
P2: Only one at a time.

191
00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:08.509
P2: If I needed to do this for real, I probably wouldn't know

192
00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:20.070
P2: But right now I I don't. I know personally, we have Medicare, or I have Medicare A and B,

193
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.040
P2: and that's it.

194
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.030
Renata: Okay.

195
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:30.360
Renata: But in real life you might go grab those cards out of your wallet to just double check.

196
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:35.199
P2: Well, I don't know what part C is

197
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:44.889
P2: and part A could be possible.

198
00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.620
P2: but I'm required to have A and B,

199
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.900
P2: because I'm on tricare for life.

200
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.279
P2: Tricare requires that.

201
00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:07.389
Renata: Got it. Well, for the purposes of today you're welcome to pick any plan just just for enrolling your spouse in for this application, and for your dependent child.

202
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.650
P2: They would do the same.

203
00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:49.640
P2: I would think.

204
00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.269
Renata: Off the top of your head are yours the same for part A and B?

205
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.160
P2: I believe.

206
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.760
Renata: Okay.

207
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:09.210
Renata: I'm just curious, it doesn't affect today's filling this out for your your spouse for this session.

208
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:30.750
Renata: Alright. So, as I mentioned before on these upload screens. I can provide you with some dummy documents so you don't have to upload anything, or if you have just like a random photo on your desktop to upload. We're not even going to be submitting the form, so it's not going anywhere. But what would you prefer.

209
00:26:33.567 --> 00:26:34.909
P2: Let me see.

210
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.670
P2: And I drag and drop.

211
00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.680
P2: Oh, yeah.

212
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.770
P2: basically none do it this way.

213
00:27:50.250 --> 00:28:01.169
Renata: Just out of curiosity. Do you already have scans of your Medicare card? If it was asking you to upload it, or would you have to like, take a photo at this point?

214
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.209
P2: I'd either take a photo or scan it.

215
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:06.640
Renata: Okay.

216
00:28:07.098 --> 00:28:09.389
P2: Had the my printer scam.

217
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.139
Renata: Oh, fancy all right!

218
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:21.620
P2: Oh, Medicare part D.

219
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:26.130
P2: I currently don't. I don't have that because I don't need it.

220
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.150
P2: Does it matter what I pick?

221
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.649
Renata: It doesn't matter. You can click no, just for the sake of time. Today.

222
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:40.559
P2: We have another yeah. Cause I gotta gotta add this up right.

223
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:41.799
Renata: Yes, please.

224
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.980
P2: Do the same thing. A and B.

225
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.230
P2: I want to say everybody at the same time.

226
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.180
P2: See if that takes.

227
00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.920
P2: I should have gone with a smaller image.

228
00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.759
Renata: That's all right.

229
00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.309
P2: These are trail cam pics. We had beavers.

230
00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.470
Renata: Oh, that's cool!

231
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.490
P2: Pages, those 2.

232
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.260
P2: Nothing else.

233
00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:03.319
Renata: All right. And like I said, I'd like you to also include a health, a private, a different health insurance plan for both of your applicants.

234
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:07.249
P2: For both of them.

235
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.350
Renata: Yes, please.

236
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.310
P2: Okay.

237
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.860
P2: And here I am clueless.

238
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:27.990
Renata: For the sake of today's session. You can. You can select any of those you could select. Hmo up there up at the top.

239
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:29.080
P2: Yep.

240
00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:30.030
P2: Okay.

241
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:22.639
P2: Okay. Now, the insurance termination only enter this date. If a policy is inactive, if the policy is inactive.

242
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:30.229
P2: then I don't have a policy. I wouldn't have said yes, that makes no sense.

243
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:40.629
Renata: Okay. So if you were to fill this out on via.gov, you wouldn't expect to see a question asking about an inactive or termination date.

244
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:46.229
Renata: Okay. So today, would you fill that section out, or would you leave it blank.

245
00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:54.100
P2: I would leave it blank, because it says, only enter if it's inactive.

246
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.849
Renata: Okay, so let's go ahead and leave it. Leave it blank and continue.

247
00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:15.929
P2: Let's say I see the info here.

248
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.729
Renata: Okay, I'm gonna stop you here. I've got a question for you.

249
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:12.400
P2: Correct.

250
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:25.580
Renata: So on that scale of 1 to 5 again, with one being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to add Medicare and health insurance plans on this application?

251
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:27.090
P2: That was easy.

252
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:28.560
Renata: All right.

253
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.219
P2: If I was doing it for real, and I didn't have it with me.

254
00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.609
P2: the wife would know it'd be in a file cabinet somewhere.

255
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.810
P2: and we keep all that organized.

256
00:33:42.215 --> 00:33:46.929
Renata: If I had to pin you to a number, would it be a 4 for easy or 5, being very?

257
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.669
P2: 5. Piece of cake.

258
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.230
Renata: Got it.

259
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:51.570
P2: Pretty straightforward.

260
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:59.419
Renata: Great to hear. You can go ahead and click no, on other health insurance plans to add and go to the next page.

261
00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:11.779
Renata: So without clicking. Submit. I'd like you to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits for your spouse and dependent child, and remember to think out loud. Tell me any thoughts, questions, concerns.

262
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:22.820
P2: Okay. So my information is there.

263
00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:27.090
P2: Sponsor information is me.

264
00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.199
P2: So it should be the same

265
00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.349
P2: spouses info

266
00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:44.069
P2: the applicants.

267
00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.210
P2: At least they got both the applicants together.

268
00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:51.459
P2: So that's better.

269
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:58.760
P2: Yeah. Medicare info seems pretty simple.

270
00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.840
P2: Other health insurance. Yeah.

271
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:16.849
Renata: All right. So let's say that you maybe accidentally input something wrong. The the start date of your Medicare plan for your wife. How would you fix that.

272
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.229
P2: Start date for the wife on the Medicare.

273
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.809
P2: That's the edit and edit it.

274
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:43.710
P2: I would just click the edit button and

275
00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:49.590
P2: see what it said, see if it gives me the option which it should.

276
00:35:50.910 --> 00:36:05.370
Renata: Alright. You don't have to click it. I'm just curious where you would go to do that. So we're not going to submit the form like I said. But if you did submit this application for champion benefits right now, what would you expect to happen next?

277
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:23.270
P2: I'd get an email. Well, I get a pop up telling me I could print it

278
00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.279
P2: right off the bat.

279
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.829
P2: I'd get a email telling me it was done.

280
00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:36.530
P2: That's about it.

281
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:46.188
Renata: Okay. And when you get that pop up to print out like the submission page, do you usually do that for your records, or just save the email, both/neither?

282
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:47.560
Renata: Okay.

283
00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:56.099
Renata: got it. Thank you. And how soon would you expect to be notified about actions being taken on your CHAMPVA Application?

284
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:59.320
P2: Within 10 days.

285
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.780
Renata: Okay.

286
00:37:01.781 --> 00:37:14.030
Renata: and I'm going to ask you that one to scale rating one more time before we wrap up, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it for you to review your application for CHAMPVA. Benefits.

287
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.220
P2: Oh, all that was the I'd say a 5.

288
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:17.703
Renata: 5. Okay.

289
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.170
P2: Not difficult.

290
00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:30.599
Renata: Good. Great to hear. So you're not going to submit the application today, and we're done with looking at the form so you can go ahead and stop screen sharing now, and we'll just wrap up with a couple more questions.

291
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:36.200
Renata: All right.

292
00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:36.850
P2: Okay.

293
00:37:37.642 --> 00:37:43.959
Renata: So overall, was there anything that you saw in the application in this session that worked well for you?

294
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:55.839
P2: No, I mean it all seemed pretty straightforward, I mean, would it?

295
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.470
P2: Keeping some some of the info.

296
00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:06.290
P2: so that when I come back to put my name again. It's already there, but

297
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.469
P2: I think most places do that.

298
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.320
P2: Got it. Okay every time I talk. So I gotta pause.

299
00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:30.989
Renata: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that I again. I really appreciate that you hung in there with us to get through the the technical difficulties at the beginning we're almost done. Is there anything that was unclear or didn't work well for you in the CHAMPVA application? You just completed.

300
00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.799
P2: No, it it seemed pretty straightforward.

301
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:36.750
Renata: Okay.

302
00:38:37.452 --> 00:38:44.529
Renata: What were your thoughts about the amount of information provided in this form? Not enough. Just right, too much.

303
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.770
P2: All it did was ask questions.

304
00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:02.220
P2: So it it told you the information that it needed.

305
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.629
P2: and then just you just provided it.

306
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:26.700
Renata: Okay, thank you. So, knowing what you know now about this form, is there any research that you would have done ahead of time to prepare to fill out this application or that you'd recommend another veteran do for filling out the CHAMPVA Application?

307
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:37.890
P2: I would look at rates, how much it costs! What does it cover?

308
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.939
P2: Is there something better.

309
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:44.490
Renata: Okay rates, meaning, like the...?

310
00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:44.810
P2: Money.

311
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:45.350
Renata: Cost.

312
00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:46.140
P2: How much it costs.

313
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:46.950
Renata: Role, okay.

314
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:47.320
P2: Yeah.

315
00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.060
Renata: Got it?

316
00:39:48.648 --> 00:39:52.589
Renata: Anything else that you would look up or research ahead of time?

317
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.689
P2: No, just what does it cost? What does it cover?

318
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.560
P2: Okay, if I go somewhere? Am I still covered?

319
00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:06.890
Renata: Okay.

320
00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:11.489
Renata: Alright. Do you have any questions for me before we close out?

321
00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.850
P2: No, all that seem pretty simple.

322
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:35.430
Renata: Okay. I just want to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners, and just a reminder. We remove all the information that could be used to identify you, and we only share it internally at Va. For the purposes of improving va.gov, and our other digital experiences.

323
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:43.179
P2: Yeah, I'm okay. With that they would probably wonder why I paused so much.

324
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:49.220
P2: But that's because of the computer and the phone. And I'm hearing myself speak.

325
00:40:50.850 --> 00:41:16.440
Renata: Well, the good news is, we are now done, and so you are. You will not have to hear the echo any longer. I'm so sorry that you were hearing yourself echo in the background. But I just want to say again, sincerely, thank you for hanging in there with the technical difficulties and taking the time today to share your thoughts with us. It's so helpful and valuable to us as we continue to work on the site. And we really want to make sure that it works for veterans.

326
00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:37.419
Renata: And lastly, Perigean is going to be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, you can pass along to any other veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies like the one you took part in today. But with that thank you so much again. Enjoy the rest of your day. Happy Independence Day, and I hope you have a really great rest of your week.
