1
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:09.399
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.470
P19: Yes.

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:20.290
Renata: Alright. Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you? [NO]

4
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:32.299
Renata: Okay, thank you. So before we look at that demo tool, I mentioned just a few warm up questions for you. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

5
00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:35.189
P19: No, but I've heard about it.

6
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.190
Renata: Okay. Are you intending to apply for CHAMPVA benefits in the future?

7
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.320
P19: Yes.

8
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.095
Renata: Okay. And why are you

9
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.480
Renata: planning on applying in the future?

10
00:00:50.527 --> 00:00:56.419
P19: From what I know about it. It. It's pretty much like supplemental

11
00:00:56.986 --> 00:01:03.379
P19: insurance. So like, whatever you're like, you have an employer, or just like

12
00:01:03.943 --> 00:01:08.670
P19: Medicare, or something like that. It covers the the difference of whatever

13
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.779
P19: your primary insurance doesn't cover. I don't know if that's

14
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.279
P19: correct, but that's what I've heard.

15
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.656
Renata: Okay. Oh, like, I said, we're not testing knowledge or abilities. So we're just curious what you've heard about it

16
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.300
Renata: so

17
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.880
Renata: let me see. Sorry lost my place in my notes where my questions are. Do you have a va.gov account by chance?

18
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.080
P19: Yes.

19
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.840
Renata: And what has been your experience with logging into the site?

20
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:49.140
P19: usually I do do it through like ID me, that program and

21
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.589
P19: it can be kind of annoying sometimes, but I guess it's kind of like reassuring that

22
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.010
P19: there's some security in the login process

23
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.710
P19: cause I have to go through that process like every time every time I log in pretty much.

24
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.370
Renata: Hmm, okay. And what tasks are you logging into va.gov for?

25
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.430
P19: To check appointments, check like benefit summaries.

26
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.650
P19: Oh, like, we're checking like my remaining benefits for different things.

27
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.880
Renata: Okay. And how often would you say you're logging in?

28
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.840
P19: Maybe 2 or 3 times a month, maybe.

29
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:51.089
Renata: Okay, got it. Just a few more questions for you before we get rolling with that demo tool. What assistive technology are you using?

30
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.250
P19: Screen reader.

31
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.080
Renata: Okay. And that's the the Microsoft Screen reader?

32
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.730
P19: Yes.

33
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.555
Renata: Okay.

34
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:08.450
Renata: and how would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader, beginner, intermediate, advanced,  expert?

35
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.080
P19: Beginner.

36
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.050
Renata: Okay.

37
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.040
Renata: And how long have you been using a screen reader?

38
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.510
P19: Maybe

39
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.810
P19: maybe around like 6 months, maybe.

40
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.199
Renata: And have you ever shared your screen in zoom while using a screen reader?

41
00:03:28.365 --> 00:03:28.910
P19: Yes.

42
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.450
Renata: Okay, and is there anything else that we can do to support you during this session?

43
00:03:34.835 --> 00:03:35.400
P19: No.

44
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:54.750
Renata: Okay, got it. So at this point, we're gonna take a look at that demo tool. And I'm gonna have you open a browser and share your screen in zoom. We can help walk you through any of that. But at this point I'd like you to close any other applications you have open any notifications, silence them, and when you're ready for that link, let me know, and I'll drop it in the chat.

45
00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:03.420
P19: Okay, if it's okay, I'm gonna grab my mouse really quick, because my trackpad is having issues with it. So.

46
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.990
Renata: Yeah, no problem!

47
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.780
P19: [pause]

48
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.250
P19: Okay, alright.

49
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.780
P19: We're all good now.

50
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.640
Renata: Okay. I have shared that link in the chat.

51
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.890
P19: That's in zoom?

52
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.329
P19: Okay. I opened it up. Now what?

53
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.360
Renata: Okay. And once you've got it open, if you could share your screen.

54
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.830
P19: Okay, apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

55
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.899
Renata: And let me know if you need any troubleshooting with getting zoom screen sharing. Set up.

56
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.910
P19: Just hit share right?

57
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.740
Renata: Yeah, hit share.

58
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.320
P19: Okay.

59
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:26.459
Renata: All right. I can see your screen now, so just a few things to go over with you before we get started. Here. As I said before, this is our testing site. So you don't have to worry about information that you enter going anywhere, and nothing you click on in this form will have any bearing on your benefits as we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, such as social security numbers if you don't feel comfortable using real information.

60
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:54.140
Renata: And in this form you may be asked to upload some documents, as we're not submitting the form, and it's not attached to your benefits. Nothing we upload here is getting sent to VA. But when we do get to those screens that ask for a file to upload. I can provide you with a sample Pdf to use, or you could upload a random like photo or document that you have on your desktop. You don't have to make a decision. Now, I'll remind you when you get to those screens that you have that option. But I just like to let folks know ahead of time. Do you have any questions for me?

61
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.910
P19: No.

62
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:05.190
Renata: Okay. So you can go ahead and scroll on this page. But I just like without clicking on anything to take a look at the information, and let us know what your initial thoughts are.

63
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.719
P19: Looks. I mean, pretty much exactly what I'm used to looking at about the VA.

64
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:24.990
Renata: Okay, and do you need to use your screen reader in order to navigate at this point?

65
00:07:26.122 --> 00:07:29.260
P19: Yeah, I probably would start it now.

66
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.329
Renata: You can go ahead and do that.

67
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.470
P19: Benefits.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.689

69
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:19.819
Renata: That's okay. And if you need any help with getting the screen reader going, our my colleague Maria, can help with that as well.

70
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.880
P19: Okay.

71
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.880
P19: gotta try to close it and reopen the link.

72
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.499
Renata: Yeah, if that yeah, we can go ahead and try that.

73
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.440
P19: Not the.

74
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.220
P19: So we're.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:02.520

76
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:14.130
Renata: of your browser window and delete where it says introduction. So just as 1010 d Extended that might bring the page back. Let's see if that helps.

77
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.830
Renata: Yeah.

78
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:27.386

Renata: Yeah, I'm curious. Do you have Microsoft Narrator? Or do you just use the read aloud function within your browser?

P19: Just the read aloud function.

103

Renata: Okay. Maria, do you know how to get Narrator to work?

104
00:11:22.574 --> 00:11:35.699
Maria: Correct, if you hit the basically the I was gonna say, Microsoft, but the windows button, and then you type in narrator, then you should be able to find it natively in your operating system.

P19: Yeah.

127
00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:04.789
Maria: That makes sense that makes sense.

128
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.220

129
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.585
Maria: Yeah, no worries, no worries. A narrator is a

130
00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.989
Maria: screen reader, it's not quite the. It's not quite the read aloud function.

131

P19: Okay.

132
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.270

137
00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:05.599
Maria: Oh, yeah, no worries, I mean, if you don't usually use Narrator, then just using the read aloud function as you usually navigate, the pages would be

138
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.429
Maria: sufficient. Renata, if you have any thoughts on that.

139
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:38.649
Renata: Yeah, we'll see how how much we can do with the read aloud function in the browser. I don't wanna to force you to use a tool that you're not used to using, P19. So we can go ahead and and just move forward with our questions. And you can set aside the narrator at this point. So I'm just gonna ask you some questions about the information on this page. Do you know if you are on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

140
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:40.760
P19: Yes.

141
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.599
Renata: Okay. And how do you know?

142
00:15:44.263 --> 00:15:48.130
P19: By seeing the "apply for CHAMPVA benefits."

143
00:15:48.960 --> 00:16:03.850
Renata: Okay, and above where it says, "Apply for CHAMPVA benefits." There's 3 small links. They say, "va.gov home," "Lvc CHAMPVA," and "1010 d Extended." Does 1010 d Extended mean anything to you at all?

144
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.270
P19: No.

145
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:16.009
Renata: Okay, that is totally fair. If you were filling this out on va.gov for your spouse or dependents, what research would you do before applying for CHAMPVA

146
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.160
Renata: program?

147
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.770
P19: just finding out the basics of like

148
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:34.229
P19: what all is covered when it comes to the benefits, oh, where I can use it.

149
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.680
P19: Or

150
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.170
P19: How long it lasts, things like that.

151
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:45.040
Renata: Okay. And do you know how to check eligibility for your spouse or dependents?

152
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:53.260
P19: Yeah. It's usually a link. I guess it's right here.

153
00:16:53.770 --> 00:17:02.420
Renata: Okay, we're not going to click on the link today. But just curious. And what information do you think that you'll need to fill this application out for your spouse or dependents?

154
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:10.509
P19: Names, birthdates, social social security numbers, stuff like that.

155
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:18.510
Renata: Okay. And do you have all that information on hand? Or would you need to pause? If you were really filling this out to go collect that information?

156
00:17:19.115 --> 00:17:20.289
P19: I would need to pause it

157
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.379
P19: To go

158
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:36.079
Renata: Got it. One more question for you on this page, on a scale of 2 to 5, with 2 being poorly, and 5 being very well how informed you feel about the application you are about to begin? Based on the information on this page.

159
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:51.517
P19: so fairly confident. I mean, it's mostly from like past application experiences.

160
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.429
P19: with the Va, okay, it's pretty like straightforward.

161
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.920
P19: So I can't see this being like too much different.

162
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.259
Renata: Okay, so on that one to 5 scale, would you rate it a 4 or a 5?

163
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.780
P19: 5 being what that like easiest?

164
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.100
Renata: Yeah, yeah.

165
00:18:11.874 --> 00:18:13.890
P19: Yeah, I'll say 4.

166
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.680
Renata: Okay? And what would take it from a 4 to a 5, in your opinion?

167
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.881
P19: Maybe just making like

168
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:33.040
P19: like finding out if I'm eligible like that, this link right here, making this a little more like noticeable.

169
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.410
P19: I didn't really notice it at first

170
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.419
P19: I feel like if I was

171
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.799
P19: going to apply, I would kind of be.

172
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.091
P19: Usually I'm just like scrolling pretty fast.

173
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.700
P19: So yeah, maybe like making that a little bit bigger.

174

267
00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.660
P19: Click here to report.

268
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:05.499
P19: One of our applicants.

269
00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:07.520
Renata: Okay

270
00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:15.900
Renata: And thinking back to the information you saw on that 1st screen today, do you know why the form is asking you this information?

271
00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:25.070
P19: Because that would be primary

272
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:30.219
P19: like the Medicare will be the primary, and the CHAMPVA will be like the supplemental.

273
00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.280
P19: Oh, if if I remember correctly.

274
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:57.720
Renata: Okay, like, I said, we're not testing knowledge or abilities. Just curious. If you scroll up a little bit on this screen, up up at the top, where the Va. Logo it says, "1010D Extended CHAMPVA Application," and then in parentheses, it says, "includes 10-7959c." What does 10-7959c mean to you? If anything.

275
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:08.519
P19: Nothing. Really. I just kind of familiar with it, just because I know

276
00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:15.740
P19: I mean the VA, they kind of use like a number system for their forms.

277
00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:20.486
P19: Oh, but that's I mean, other than that. Really nothing.

278
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:39.290
Renata: Okay, so it means a Va form. But the specific Va form, okay, got it. Thank you. So asking that a question about documents, if you were filling this out on va.gov for real today, for a spouse and a dependent family member, would you need to go collect Medicare or health insurance information? Or would you have that on hand?

279
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:47.529
P19: I would try to have it on hand if I knew I was filling this out. So yeah, probably have it on hand.

280
00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:56.069
Renata: Okay. But if like, if you were really filling it out right now, would you have that like in your in your wallet, or something to like. Grab quickly? Or would you need to like, pause

281
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.250
Renata: and look?

282
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.680
P19: Yeah, we need to go get it. Yeah.

Renata: Okay, anything in particular that made it a 5?

374
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:46.120
P19: Just the the amount of information

375
00:47:46.757 --> 00:47:50.139

P19: Okay.

382
00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:44.340
P19: So show me my information.

383
00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:50.870
P19: One that I entered initially, or the mailing address.

384
00:48:51.530 --> 00:49:02.069
P19: That's all correct contact information as well. I was kind of confused about this how

385
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:10.109
P19: the signer could possibly be different from the sponsor. But I just didn't understand the

386
00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:19.469
P19: how that could be distinguished, I mean, between the signer and the sponsor. But I don't know if that's important or not. But

387
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:29.810
Renata: Well out of curiosity. If you were able to wave a magic wand and make that clearer, like, what would you suggest that could make it

388
00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:36.339
Renata: more easily identifiable that, like signer and sponsor, are, this could be the same person, but could be different?

389
00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:43.420
P19: Maybe

390
00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:56.740
P19: maybe put like it's saying something like signer information.

391
00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.129
P19: if different from sponsor like in the case of like a

392
00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:04.130
P19: I don't know. Like a power of attorney or something like that.

393
00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:09.425
P19: It was just that part was kind of confusing. I just

394
00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.380
P19: because I didn't know what the difference was between the signer and the sponsor.

395
00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:22.640
P19: So yeah, maybe something like that, like signer information, if different from sponsor.

396
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:23.540
Renata: Okay

397
00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.290
P19: And like, kind of given the option.

398
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:32.799
Renata: So if I'm hearing you correctly. If you were filling this out for real on va.gov, you could then click like

399
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:40.019
Renata: I'm the sponsor, and it would just skip you past signer information, since you're the same person?

400
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.220
P19: Yeah

401
00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.839

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:30.930
P19: Probably I wish I could

431
00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:35.409
P19: if I can just go back the I think I still have it pulled up, even though it's frozen

432
00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.040
P19: quality.

433
00:54:50.684 --> 00:54:53.060
P19: The only thing would be like I, said the

434
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:56.471
P19: the signer and the sponsor information like

435
00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:03.609
P19: to me that's like the only like thing that's kind of confusing about it. Everything else was

436
00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.510
P19: pretty easy to understand.

437
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:15.399
Renata: Okay, got it. So just thinking about your overall what you saw today in the session. What worked well for you?

438
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:28.030
P19: Color, just the the amount of information that I had had to enter. That was like extremely helpful.

439
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:33.340
P19: It's always, I mean, I'm sure most people would agree. It's like pretty.

440
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:38.290
P19: it's pretty annoying to have to like sit there and enter like

441
00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:46.520
P19: bunch of your information that a lot of times seems kind of pointless when it comes to filling out applications.

442
00:55:47.157 --> 00:55:50.332
P19: So I feel like it was like real straightforward with

443
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:52.559
P19: when it came to that stuff.

444
00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:58.410
Renata: Okay. So in terms of the amount of information provided in the form, you'd say, it's like, just right?

445
00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:07.900
Renata: got it. And what was unclear, or did not work well for you, that you that you saw in the session today?

446
00:56:09.708 --> 00:56:17.170
P19: Just that the signer and sponsor distinguishing between those 2.

447
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:19.269
Renata: Okay, that was all?

448
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:36.399
Renata: Got it, and thinking about the information you saw on that 1st page, now that you've been through the application. What research would you, or information would you tell veterans that they need to do to prepare before completing the CHAMPVA application?

449
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:42.740
P19: Having your dependents like information

450
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.650
P19: on hand, so you can just

451
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:57.090
P19: fill it out like in a straight shot without you mean stopping in the middle and want to grab it, and same thing with medical cards. Just make sure you have all that information available to you.

452
00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:58.480
Renata: Okay.

453
00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.670
P19: Fill out the application.

454
00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.550
Renata: Got it, and any questions for me?

455
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:04.730
P19: No.

456
00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:22.959
Renata: All right. So at this point I just want to say, Thank you so much. We really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today, taking time out of your week. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans. So thank you.

457
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:38.720
Renata: Lastly, Perigan will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, you can pass along to other veterans, you may know, to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies like this one. And with that Erin, thank you so much, again enjoy the rest of your day and your week. We thank you.

458
00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.730
P19: Thank you. I did have one question.

459
00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:42.890
Renata: Oh, yeah, sure.

460
00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:50.979
P19: I recently moved. So what I need to update my address with you guys or with. But I just reach out directly to

461
00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:54.060
P19: Peregrine through like email?

462
00:57:54.905 --> 00:57:58.264
Renata: Yeah, you can reach out directly to them.

463
00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:06.348
Renata: I otherwise would just be me telling them to email you. So if you already have an email with them, you can you can just shoot them a line.

464
00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.390
P19: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.

465
00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.530
Renata: Yeah. Absolutely have a great week.

466
