1
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.650
Renata: Okay, I've started the recording, and I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.530
P9: Yes.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:20.450
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.130
P9: Yes.

5
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:30.999
Renata: Okay, thank you. So we're going to start with a few questions before we jump into that coded prototype. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

6
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.840
P9: No.

7
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.129
Renata: Okay. Do you know anything about CHAMPVA, or is this your 1st time hearing about it?

8
00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:40.974
P9: I'm vaguely familiar about it. But

9
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.450
P9: my wife is not very interested in this, so

10
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.779
P9: I didn't pursue any of this.

11
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.180
Renata: Got it. Did anybody at any point tell you that you and your wife were eligible for it? And you just opted not to. Or...

12
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.369
Renata: what was that like?

13
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.159
P9: No, I know enough to say I could be eligible for it, but

14
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.160
P9: my wife is particular about her healthcare

15
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.149
P9: and she's not a big tricare fan

16
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.099
P9: and she can't get treatment at the VA. So this would be

17
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.310
P9: a 3rd option but we have private health insurance for her.

18
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.870
Renata: Okay.

19
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.760
P9: So if she's happy with the [Insurance provider]

20
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.639
P9: that I pay for each month to cover her. Specifically, I have so much insurance.

21
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.550
P9: I mean, it's just like pick one, you know, when I go to the doctor or she goes to the doctor. So

22
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.449
P9: I'm interested to see if you know, maybe

23
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.019
P9: there's more here that'll save me $500 a month, so we'll see.

24
00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:02.319
Renata: Okay, got it. So you kind of already answered this question, ut would you consider applying for CHAMPVA benefits for your wife in the future?

25
00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:04.771
P9: Yeah, as long as

26
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.530
P9: the quality of service meets her expectations.

27
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.640
P9: I'm all for saving money.

28
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.299
Renata: Got it.

29
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.720
P9: Is there a fee for CHAMPVA?

30
00:02:19.888 --> 00:02:26.449
Renata: No, there's not a a fee for it. It's a cost sharing program. So it works kind of like a coinsurance for.

31
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.030
P9: Right.

32
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:37.039
Renata: Qualifying spouses and dependents. So if your wife already has insurance, they would Bill CCHAMPVA for the remainder, potentially, of a bill.

33
00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:42.590
Renata: do you have a va.gov account by chance?

34
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.330
P9: I do

35
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.820
Renata: Alright! What's your experience been with logging into the site?

36
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.630
P9: No problem. Been using it for a couple of years now.

37
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.999
Renata: Okay. And how often are you logging into va.gov?

38
00:02:58.195 --> 00:03:02.590
P9: Now probably twice a month.

39
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.905
Renata: Okay.

40
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.839
P9: Past. It was weekly at least, or daily, almost.

41
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:17.279
Renata: Oh, okay, any anything changed with what benefits or programs you're doing that? Would that would drop it down to twice a month from that more regular.

42
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.450
P9: Well, in November I was elevated to a hundred percent disabled.

43
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.790
P9: So prior to that, it was, you know,

44
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.939
P9: trying to secure that 100%

45
00:03:31.554 --> 00:03:38.850
P9: lots of questions, lots of back and forth with me in the Va. Once I was designated 100%,

46
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:47.669
P9: all I really needed to know was prescriptions. I use it a lot for prescription refills and messaging, messaging

47
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.020
P9: My PCM.

48
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.676
Renata: Got it. Okay, thank you for sharing

49
00:03:53.388 --> 00:04:02.640
Renata: so at this point, done with the questions, we're gonna start looking at that coded prototype, I told you about. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen in zoom?

50
00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:05.549
P9: Yeah, I can do that.

51
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.334
Renata: Okay.

52
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.700
P9: That was what I was working on.

53
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:16.019
Renata: Yeah, I'm just gonna give you a second to close anything or silence any notifications. When you're ready for that link, let me know, and I'll drop it in the chat.

54
00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:20.009
P9: Okay, all right, I'm ready.

55
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.740
Renata: Okay, there is the link.

56
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.440
Renata: And if you have any issues, let me know. And I can help troubleshoot.

57
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.739
P9: And are you seeing my screen?

58
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:52.709
Renata: Not yet. If you click into zoom, there's a whole line of icons at the bottom of the application, and one in the center of the screen is a big green button with an up arrow that says, Share, if you can click on that.

59
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.500
P9: Alright! How about now?

60
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.090
Renata: Wonderful.

61
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:16.440
Renata: Okay, so before we get rolling and filling out this form, just a few things to be aware of. Like I said before. This is our testing site. So you don't have to worry about any information going anywhere, and nothing we click on is gonna have any bearing on your benefits. We're also not submitting anything today.

62
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:32.520
Renata: as we go through the form, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, such as social security numbers. And there's a couple pages in the form where you might be asked to upload some documents, as we're not submitting the form, and this isn't attached to your benefits or any Va systems

63
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:54.510
Renata: you can use a random like picture on your desktop if you want, or I can also provide you with a sample document in the chat to upload when we get there. But I'll let you know any questions, though, before we we get rocking. Okay, you can go ahead and scroll up and down but with no clicking on anything at this point. Just take a look at the information on this page and let us know your initial thoughts.

64
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.710
P9: It's pretty much in line with all the other VA pages.

65
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.130
Renata: Okay.

66
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.570
P9: That's good.

67
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:10.079
Renata: Nothing unusual or or anything you're curious about, have questions or concerns about on this page?

68
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:20.530
P9: No, it's again, I like standardization. I'm very familiar with this type of page

69
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.180
P9: in the VA website.

70
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.830
Renata: All right.

71
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.119
Renata: So I have a few questions for you. Do you know, if you're on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

72
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.933
P9: Well, I know I'm in the right spot to check my eligibility.

73
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.700
P9: so I would probably start there at Number One. That link.

74
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.970
Renata: Okay, you would click on that "Find out if you're eligible for champion benefits" link.

75
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.870
P9: Yes.

76
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.340
Renata: Okay and we're not gonna click on it today. But if you were to go to that page, what would you expect to find there?

77
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.069
P9: Something that looks quite like this page

78
00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:07.820
P9: and you know it would do its thinking, and probably give me a yes or no answer. Yes, it would take me to the forms and all that. No, and it's we're done.

79
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.060
Renata: Okay.

80
00:07:09.718 --> 00:07:25.559
Renata: Well, I'd like you to scroll up a little bit now. Above that big sign that says, apply for CHAMPVA benefits. There's 3 links, and one says 1010d Extended. You don't need to click on it. But what does 1010d Extended mean to you? If anything.

81
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:33.060
P9: I don't know. I would assume. You know. I assume it's a form.

82
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:39.890
P9: I would recommend, you know, putting the word form in front of that 1010d.

83
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.770
Renata: Noted.

84
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.650
P9: Form, but.

85
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:57.130
Renata: Thank you for that feedback. If you were on va.gov, filling out this form for your spouse today, what research would you do before completing a form and applying for CHAMPVA?

86
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:03.109
P9: I would double check the cost of my [Insurance provider] 

87
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:14.399
P9: payments. I turned 65 next month. So my my tricare costs are gonna go down to 0. So I would do some.

88
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:22.390
P9: you know, cost benefit analysis. How much money could I save with this, and what kind of benefits would my wife get

89
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:29.629
P9: with CHAMPVA enrollment? So like I said, she's very particular about

90
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.700
P9: the health care that she receives. She doesn't like tricare

91
00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:39.370
P9: as long as this doesn't look like tricare to her, I could probably convince her.

92
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.650
P9: Say, let me do it.

93
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.389
Renata: Got it. Happy early birthday, b the way.

94
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:58.960
Renata: So it sounds like you would be researching the program and the costs and benefits of it, but also looking at your existing healthcare plan and some of the associated costs with it as well, and sort of doing an analysis between the 2.

95
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.349
P9: Yup, exactly.

96
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:16.169
Renata: Got it. So you already mentioned that eligibility link. So I'm gonna we're gonna breeze right past that. But what information based on what you see on this page what information do you think you will need to fill out on this application for your spouse?

97
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.379
P9: Probably social security, name, all that

98
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:27.659
P9: normal stuff. And maybe what's my disability percentage

99
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.380
P9: right now? What is my rating?

100
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:37.649
P9: Although that might not be relevant, really. But that's

101
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:43.249
P9: it. Maybe also, information about

102
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:49.459
P9: do I currently have insurance for my spouse? And if so, what is it, and things like that.

103
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:57.669
Renata: Okay. I'm curious, you said you mentioned that you thought that disability rating might not be needed. What would make you assume that?

104
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.689
P8: Well, does it matter? I mean, I know I get some special

105
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.090
P9: treatment being at a hundred percent

106
00:10:05.912 --> 00:10:09.010
P9: but I would think CHAMPVA is

107
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.979
P9: open to everybody, from 10% on up.

108
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.560
P9: I would guess, but I don't know.

109
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:32.779
Renata: Got it, and the information that you mentioned social security, disability, information, health insurance. Would you happen to have all of that on hand, or would you need to pause if you were really filling this out on va.gov, and go collect all that information?

110
00:10:34.017 --> 00:10:39.072
P9: I would have to pause just slightly. I have it all on my computer, but

111
00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.620
P9: going and getting it, you know.

112
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:58.889
Renata: Got it. Okay, I got one more question for you before we start filling this out on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the application you are about to begin, based on this page's content?

113
00:11:00.698 --> 00:11:06.629
P9: Well, I would read the the page a little closer here. It tells me about, you know.

114
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.839
P9: birth dates of security config supporting.

115
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.999
P9: Okay, I'm sorry. What was your question again? 1 to 5. On what?

116
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:28.639
Renata: 1 to 5, 1 being poorly 5 being very well. How informed! Well, how informed do you feel based on the information you see on this page about the application.

117
00:11:29.766 --> 00:11:32.150
P9: Pretty good. I mean 5.

118
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.549
Renata: Okay.

119
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.019
P9: Once I see the application, you know that that may change.

120
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:56.000
Renata: Of course. Yeah, no, we're just basing this off of what you're seeing right now. It's it's subject to change, totally. Get it? At this point, if you could scroll down a little bit for me, and in the bottom of that blue box, you see, there's a link that says, start your form without signing in if you could go ahead and click that

121
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:27.229
Renata: all right. So for this next section, I'd like you to start the form, as if you're applying for your spouse and one other family member like a dependent child. I'll let you know when to pause, and we'll ask some more questions. But to help orient you, we're going to fill out about 3 sections of the form. Just a reminder again, this is a testing site. Nothing. Nothing's going anywhere. You can use fake information. And I'd like you as you're going through the form to think out loud. We'd really like to know any reactions you're having as you're experiencing them.

122
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.000
P9: Okay.

123
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.369
P9: So I would pick the middle one.

124
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.490
Renata: Okay.

125
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.859
P9: Want me to continue. Just go through these.

126
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.880
Renata: Yep, I'll let you know when to stop.

127
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.100
P9: All right.

128
00:12:39.397 --> 00:12:43.219
P9: I'm just gonna put in some stuff there.

129
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.779
P9: that's probably a drop down.

130
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.770
P9: Oh, I would make that a drop down there.

131
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.340
Renata: Okay, noted.

132
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.410
P9: Country.

133
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.750
P9: I like that. You put United States up front.

134
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.749
P9: so I hate going to look for it.

135
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.100
P9: So I need to go with a real number there.

136
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.779
P9: I'll give you my real phone number just.

137
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.390
Renata: It can still be fake. It just needs to be 10 digits.

138
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.979
P9: Yeah, that's fine.

139
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.399
P9: And I'll give you the real email address in case you need it.

140
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.189
P9: Looks like my caps lock is on

141
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.670
P9: sponsor.

142
00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.690
P9: No, no, no, okay.

143
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.449
Renata: No questions about that last page?

144
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.930
P9: No. But let me look at it just again.

145
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.270
P9: Sponsors name social security number and status.

146
00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:22.919
P9: Okay, the status being maybe disability level rating.

147
00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:29.650
Renata: I'm going to be really annoying, and answer your question with a question, is that what you assume, based on the content that you just read?

148
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.119
P9: Yeah, that's what I assume.

149
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.509
Renata: Okay, then let's go with that, and you can click continue.

150
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:49.489
P9: Date of birth. Okay, so this is the sponsor's information.

151
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.870
Renata: And what does sponsor mean to you?

152
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:00.950
P9: I'm sorry?

153
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.380
Renata: What does a sponsor mean to you?

154
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.440
P9: Me!

155
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.580
Renata: Okay

156
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:33.679
Renata: Oh. It's just our demo system. It gets a little a little annoying if you enter multiples of the same digits. So if you make it like 1, 1, 2, 2, you know, or do it slightly out of chronicle order, whatever. Yeah, it should work.

157
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.920
Renata: Yep, there we go.

158
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.050
P9: Okay

159
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.579
P9: And my mailing address. I like that. It's pre-filled.

160
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.410
P9: [SPOUSE NAME].

161
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.900
P9: Okay?

162
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:13.460
P9: And I'll give you her real [birth] date here.

163
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:49.779
P9: Okay, for some reason this just feels redundant. This page.

164
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.150
P9: Okay.

165
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.940
P9: we've kind of gone under. I have to go back and look at the pages again. But it's like.

166
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.469
P9: you know you could, you could say something here like

167
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:08.369
P9: "is your wife..for mailing address, different than what we have on file?" And we have the the address

168
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.500
P9: here on the screen

169
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:16.999
P9: to show, because her address is on file. It's same as me. But or maybe even a question like that.

170
00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.880
P9: is it the same as the sponsor. Go ahead.

171
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:33.640
Renata: Yeah. So on that previous page, the page you were just on it asked you if you want to go back, there's a backlink at the top. Yeah, it says, does the does wife have the same mailing address? And you should use the same.

172
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:33.970
P9: Mail.

173
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:34.450
Renata: address?

174
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:34.890
P9: Yeah, yeah.

175
00:17:35.194 --> 00:17:44.319
Renata: So would you expect in an ideal world if you say, use the same address that it wouldn't show you that page with everything filled out. It would just skip?

176
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.540
P9: Yes, agreed

177
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.860
Renata: Got it.

178
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.289
P9: Yeah, that's that's why I felt this was redundant.

179
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:51.890
P9: Okay.

180
00:17:52.220 --> 00:18:00.169
P9: but I can see the need, you know, if I wanted to add my daughter or somebody else who would live somewhere else. Then possibly.

181
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.500
Renata: Right.

182
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.310
P9: Okay.

183
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.579
P9: Oh, I guess that's the area code.

184
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.209
P9: So it still isn't like that. Huh?

185
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.150
Renata: Oh, I think there's 1 extra digit at the end of the phone number.

186
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.610
P9: Oh, yeah.

187
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.020
Renata: If you delete.

188
00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:36.390
P9: That's.

189
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.380
Renata: 5, yeah.

190
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:37.869
P9: There we go!

191
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:38.530
Renata: Go.

192
00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:58.100
P9: Okay, you know, these are easy questions to answer. So I'm not real concerned that you know I'm not

193
00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:04.370
P9: that they're not pre-filled in for me, but having that.

194
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.170
Renata: Okay.

195
00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.550
P9: Oh, go ahead, no? Well, let me go back

196
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:21.289
P9: no, that's that. That's probably a smart page to have, because you don't know if I'm doing a child or spouse up until here

197
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:31.620
P9: and that, okay, I get okay, I get needing a phone number.

198
00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.590
P9: Yeah. And this one was pre-filled.

199
00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.260
P9: So that's fine.

200
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.880
P9: Oh, okay. Now you got me.

201
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:54.160
Renata: Like, I said. We're not testing your knowledge.

202
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.910
Renata: Anything you put there is fine.

203
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.610
P9: Well, this is one where I'd have to go

204
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:06.459
P9: get it, cause my memory sucks, and I have a hard time remembering the year.

205
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:12.230
P9: But I would guess that if you don't know exact.

206
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.799
P9: Okay, that's fine.

207
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.990
Renata: Okay

208
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:29.450
Renata: So for the purposes of today, I'm gonna have you add one more dependent, like a child. You can use fake information for this, as well.

209
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.560
P9: Guess I gotta get her a birthday present here soon.

210
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.350
P9: Alright.

211
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.900
P9: So here I'd have to think about it. You know she's an adult.

212
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.320
P9: but she's gonna not know some things. She doesn't have any

213
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:35.969
P9: interaction with the VA. So I would say, I'll handle it all, you know. Send anything to me, and I'll figure it out by calling her, or whatever

214
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.680
P9: that makes sense.

215
00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.950
Renata: Yeah, so you would wanna put

216
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:41.590
P9: Okay.

217
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.909
Renata: your child's mailing address as yours?

218
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.400
P9: Yeah, if I sent it. If we had the VA send this stuff to her

219
00:21:48.747 --> 00:21:59.420
P9: and it took a little while, because I'd probably call her up and say, Hey, by the way, you're gonna get some stuff in the mail. But if it took a while she may forget about it, and just throw it away, you know, so

220
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.440
P9: safer just to send it all to me.

221
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:04.300
Renata: Got it.

222
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.330
P9: And

223
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.450
P9: oh!

224
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:28.979
Renata: And if you're really filling this out today, would you put your wife and dependent child's phone number and email address or your phone number, email, address?

225
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.949
P9: Yeah, I would. I would put in the mind what?

226
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:39.819
P9: Let me go back because we said, You know, hey, send this stuff to me here.

227
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.358
P9: Where did we do that?

228
00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.190
P9: That's the mailing address. So

229
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:56.210
P9: we said, yes, has the the same mailing address meeting. You're gonna send it to me so but here

230
00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:08.829
P9: you know, I, my child, probably couldn't answer any questions about VA or CHAMPVA or tricare, or anything. So here, I would put.

231
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.139
P9: you know. Do do you want

232
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:21.519
P9: you, you know, like on your your tax forms, you know. Did you do it? Or do you want someone else to talk about your tax forms. I put something drop down, you know.

233
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.249
P9: Do you want us to contact you with questions? Or the child?

234
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.130
Renata: Got it. Okay.

235
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.989
P9: What now, I put in her birth date.

236
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:52.320
P9: I assume this. Is there any limits on how old someone can be minimum or maximum

237
00:23:52.510 --> 00:24:00.169
P9: age? Given that we're answering these questions, I'm sure at this point it's determined she's eligible.

238
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:08.800
Renata: I'm gonna do that annoying thing again and answer your question with a question, is that your assumption, based on how the form has gone so far?

239
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.189
P9: Yeah, I'm like, okay, I got.

240
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.340
P9: I feel like I feel like it's kind of like, you know.

241
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:26.039
P9: you know, I'm talking about a child or something, you know, but I don't mind clicking a button and hit continue.

242
00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.220
Renata: Okay.

243
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:35.029
P9: So this page I you know it would annoy me very little, but I do it now, here's where

244
00:24:36.305 --> 00:24:39.530
P9: okay, that makes sense there

245
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.820
P9: and birth certificate. You want me to upload something?

246
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:52.899
Renata: Yeah, if you have a random photo or file on your desktop, like I said, we're not even gonna click, submit on this. Just it's ideal.

247
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.659
Renata: if it's a smaller file size.

248
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:08.027
P9: Well, let me find something that's not too

249
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.989
P9: here, I'll give you my hyatt reservation.

250
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.910
Renata: Perfect.

251
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.130
P9: Okay.

252
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.710
P9: A marriage certificate.

253
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.450
P9: Feels like every time I turn around, I have to prove I'm married, you know, but

254
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:40.059
P9: I guess it's helpful for the VA. You know, if I give it to you here, you know you don't

255
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.480
P9: so I would do it. But I'd be like really.

256
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:48.039
P9: I mean? How many times do I got to prove to the VA that I'm married?

257
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:55.990
Renata: So out of curiosity, you've had to prove relationship to your spouse before with other VA applications?

258
00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.449
P9: I think that's more of a general statement. It feels like.

259
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:04.120
Renata: Everybody's wanting me to prove that I'm married. I'm like.

260
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.620
P9: I got it. And I don't know if I had to previously prove

261
00:26:10.548 --> 00:26:13.100
P9: that, I was married to the VA. But

262
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.719
P9: I would do it, but I'd be like, okay, you know.

263
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:18.369
Renata: It'd be frustrating?

264
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:25.140
P9: Yeah, a little bit, you know, like, especially if I got all the way through this stuff. And then you say, Nope, she's not eligible

265
00:26:25.852 --> 00:26:27.089
P9: like, you know.

266
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:34.020
P9: Okay, fine. But I would do something like that.

267
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:38.200
Renata: Okay. And for this you can upload the same document, or a different one.

268
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:38.610
P9: Yeah.

269
00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:39.847
Renata: Whatever you'd like,

270
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:50.910
P9: But I understand why you might want to see it. It saves the VA from having to go look for it, or whatever you know. Here it is again.

271
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.270
Renata: Okay.

272
00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.750
P9: Okay. Another.

273
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:54.620
Renata: Applicant.

274
00:26:54.770 --> 00:27:08.769
Renata: We're going to pause here before we go any further. So on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this section of the form?

275
00:27:10.084 --> 00:27:18.340
P9: Besides, the I'm gonna take the frustration parts out the little, the little annoyances. And I would say it's a 5. It was easy.

276
00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:23.869
Renata: Okay, if we add those annoyances back in, would the number be any lower? Would it be a 4?

277
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.180
P9: Yeah, a 4.

278
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:45.050
Renata: Okay, got it? You mentioned before that, like, you've already given a lot of this information like address and stuff information about your spouse? If this was pre filled in the form, where would you expect that to be coming from? Would it be coming from your your disability benefits paperwork, or your profile, or...?

279
00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:52.870
P9: Yes, and yes I mean the VA knows about my spouse.

280
00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.270
P9: I think that information's in my profile.

281
00:27:56.791 --> 00:28:02.249
P9: Yeah, it's probably coming from my profile's where I say, and it would be, tell me.

282
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:06.599
P9: tell you know I don't know

283
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:15.579
P9: if it told me it was pulling it from my profile, maybe a button to say, you know, if this information is not right.

284
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:19.250
P9: click here to update it, or or something, but.

285
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:19.620
Renata: Okay.

286
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.520
P9: I would assume it was coming from my profile.

287
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:32.999
Renata: Okay. And if that button existed and it said, "click here to update it," would it update it in this form, or would it pop you over to your profile to update it just out of curiosity?

288
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:43.859
P9: Well, I would hope it would take me to the profile, because it's like, you know, I want to get to the root cause of why it's pulling bad data. I want to get good data in.

289
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.219
P9: you know, from the profile because a lot of stuff gets pulled from the profile.

290
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:58.259
Renata: Got it. Okay, thank you for sharing at this point you can click no on other applicants to add and hit the continue button.

291
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:10.109
Renata: So before we go any further, I'd just like you to take a look at this page. Let me know if anything stands out to you, or you have any questions.

292
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:18.850
P9: So even so, when I turn 65 in a few days, I'm going to get Medicare.

293
00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:24.930
P9: So any of the applicants. I'm not an applicant.

294
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.900
P9: I'm just trying to see if this one really is talking about me.

295
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:36.010
P9: Do I have, I'll have Medicare report for any or more applicants.

296
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:41.580
P9: Maybe a reword here might be in line, you know.

297
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:48.130
P9: "Does the sponsor have any Medicare to report?

298
00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.210
P9: for him or herself, or one or more applicant applicants?"

299
00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.300
P9: I think that's what you're getting at, you know.

300
00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.800
P9: Do you want me to filter myself out? Or are we talking about

301
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.419
P9: the people I'm trying to get CHAMPVA for?

302
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.150
Renata: Okay.

303
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.700
P9: Does that make sense?

304
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.361
Renata: That does make sense. Yeah, thank you for that feedback.

305
00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:18.120
Renata: So based on your understanding. What is this section of the form asking you to fill out?

306
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:28.139
P9: Does anyone...does my wife or my child have Medicare is what I'm thinking it's asking me.

307
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:35.689
P9: because I would say, even though I'm filling the form out applying for them. I think that

308
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:42.880
P9: CHAMPVA would probably want to know, you know, if it's my wife or child.

309
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:45.930
P9: so I would almost say, No, there,

310
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.909
P9: But it with a reword, it be very clear, you know.

311
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.669
P9: Does the sponsor have any medicare to report?

312
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:56.400
P9: Oh, but.

313
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.509
Renata: Got it. Okay.

314
00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.020
P9: So.

315
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:10.879
Renata: We're not going to start this section quite yet. I got a couple more questions for you, thinking back to that 1st page that we looked at. Do you remember it mentioning Medicare or health insurance at all?

316
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.690
P9: No.

317
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:27.210
Renata: Okay. And if you scroll up a little bit higher on this page at the top, next to the VA Logo, it says "1010 d Extended, CHAMPVA includes 110-7959c." Does any of that mean anything to you?

318
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:32.449
P9: No, I would assume that that is a form number.

319
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.405
Renata: Okay

320
00:31:34.273 --> 00:31:38.510
Renata: And is it the same, or different from 1010d Extended?

321
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:45.790
P9: I do not know. So I would again say, tweak that banner to say, and "VA form

322
00:31:47.555 --> 00:31:50.709
P9: this and this," and then just make it all one.

323
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.049
P9: you know one parentheses around it.

324
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.240
Renata: Okay.

325
00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:08.859
Renata: thank you for that feedback. If you were filling this out on champion, this application for champion benefits on va.gov, today, would you need to stop and collect more documents at this point, or would you be ready to fill out this section?

326
00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.789
P9: I think I'd be okay.

327
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.240
P9: I could go on.

328
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:32.790
Renata: Got it so for the purposes of today's study, I'd like you to imagine that your spouse and your dependent daughter both have Medicare as well as private health insurance. So I'd like you to fill this out with a Medicare and private health insurance plan for each of them, and then I'll stop you and ask you some more questions.

329
00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:33.480
P9: Sure.

330
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:40.069
P9: So yes, and continue alright. Which applicant?

331
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:43.050
P9: all right, you said both of them?

332
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.582
P9: Okay, that makes

333
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:52.980
P9: Why did it? Let me choose both, or what if it is both?

334
00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.720
P9: You know I can't choose both here.

335
00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:01.630
P9: It may be a 3rd radio button, you know. "Both."

336
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:02.590
Renata: Okay.

337
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.380
P9: But

338
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:12.300
P9: cause I'd be like, come on, you're gonna ask me more questions that I'll have to repeat myself again.

339
00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.229
P9: But it it should it should allow me to select either both.

340
00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.839
P9: or have an option to select both.

341
00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:24.929
Renata: Got it. Okay. Let's just pick one of them for now and click, continue.

342
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:25.590
P9: Okay.

343
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:34.539
Renata: And if you don't know since this is a fictional scenario, feel free to pick any of the following options, it doesn't need to be.

344
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.600
P9: This is where I would have to. Probably, you know.

345
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.070
P9: double check with my wife, or whatever.

346
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.360
Renata: Okay.

347
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.889
P9: I'd have to stop and and just validate my answer there.

348
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.030
P9: Okay,

349
00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.300
P9: okay. So this is my wife.

350
00:34:00.588 --> 00:34:04.530
P9: Again, I'd have to get the information from her on that.

351
00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:09.600
P9: but

352
00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.390
P9: it could be her birthday. So I'm just.

353
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:22.270
P9: I think I remember something about that. It starts on her birthday.

354
00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:30.199
P9: the month, 1st day of the year of the month for her birthday, so

355
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:40.279
P9: that one would take me some thinking about card for hospital and medical submit a copy, you know.

356
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.290
P9: here is, okay.

357
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.359
P9: Okay. That makes sense.

358
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:57.750
Renata: Nothing confusing about that explanation about what you need to provide?

359
00:35:00.997 --> 00:35:02.370
P9: Submit a copy

360
00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.880
P9: of my original. Okay, now it's clear, because I just got this in the mail for me.

361
00:35:09.433 --> 00:35:12.769
P9: But I'd have to stop and scan it, and all that.

362
00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:17.300
Renata: Got it.

363
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.550
P9: And this is not for me. This would be for...You may want to make it clear here

364
00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:30.690
P9: "upload your spouse's medicare card," or you know "your child's medicare card," and I'm like.

365
00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:31.210
Renata: Got it.

366
00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:35.039
P9: You talking about me or them? I would assume them.

367
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:41.359
P9: But it it's easier to not assume, you know. Just let me. Oh, it's talking about my wife still.

368
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.619
P9: let me put my wife's card up.

369
00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.040
Renata: Okay

370
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:50.660
Renata: And you can use a just a random document for these uploads again. Or I can provide something.

371
00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:55.390
P9: Now, if my reservation gets canceled at the Hyatt...

372
00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:00.005
Renata: I promise neither Jamie nor I will do that to you.

373
00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:07.810
P9: That's fine. Upload the back. Okay, separate files. That's good.

374
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:11.849
Renata: You like that they're separate spots?

375
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.100
P9: Yeah, because one

376
00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:21.120
P9: Because I don't like having to go find a Pdf program or combine them and then save it as a document.

377
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.490
P9: you know, I'd just rather scan it twice and send 2 different things. I would probably name the files, you know, front

378
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:34.130
P9: in parentheses and back in parentheses. Just so. I know what they are.

379
00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.429
Renata: Got it.

380
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:47.010
P9: And then continue. Part D. Prescription to provide or update.

381
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:56.450
P9: Okay? And I would say, let's see.

382
00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.419
P9: do drugs come with CHAMPVA?

383
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.579
Renata: Like prescription costs?

384
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:05.340
P9: Yeah.

385
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.400
Renata: Yeah, it covers prescription as well.

386
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.024
P9: Okay, cause she doesn't. She has to use her [insurance provider]

387
00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:16.409
P9: to get the drugs, and then Tricare pays a portion.

388
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:18.840
P9: I would.

389
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.030
P9: So let's just pretend that she's getting her drugs.

390
00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.020
P9: We're paying extra for that.

391
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:25.660
Renata: Okay.

392
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.730
P9: Carrier, and

393
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.869
P9: see, I'm not very familiar about Medicare yet.

394
00:37:37.703 --> 00:37:42.650
P9: I thought that this would be the name of the you know the government.

395
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:47.030
P9: I thought it was the government providing all this stuff for me.

396
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:53.350
P9: Your insurance carrier is your sure it's company.

397
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:58.350
P9: So again, this this page would be a stumper for me.

398
00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:04.020
P9: I have to go get the information, because apparently I have a wrong assumption in my head.

399
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.109
P9: and you may find your effective date.

400
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.239
P9: So again, I would find the card

401
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:20.539
P9: where I'm gonna assume it's her birthday.

402
00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.590
P9: Okay

403
00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.779
P9: Got it.

404
00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:47.300
P9: So that information is it on my red, white and blue card about part d.

405
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:52.810
Renata: I mean again, I'm gonna ask, would you assume it would be on the red, white, and blue card.

406
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:59.440
P9: I would think so. I didn't sign up for Part DI only signed up for A and B for me.

407
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.189
P9: but it's like.

408
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:07.269
P9: you know. Why not? If you're giving me a a card that shows me more medicare benefits.

409
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.190
P9: Give them all to me, you know. a BD

410
00:39:11.893 --> 00:39:16.769
P9: I would assume it would have been on there. So if I looked at her card, and it wasn't there.

411
00:39:18.235 --> 00:39:25.720
P9: I would probably say no, and say, I'll deal with it this problem later, if she's if it is.

412
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:31.060
P9: if she has it. But again, I don't know enough about Medicare

413
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:41.050
P9: to ensure that I'm making, you know, a hundred percent accurate responses here.

414
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.030
Renata: Got it. Okay, thank you for sharing.

415
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.939
P9: Regional Hospital medical coverage.

416
00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.680
P9: Okay.

417
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.060
Renata: All clear there?

418
00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:55.070
P9: That part. Yes.

419
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:55.830
Renata: Okay.

420
00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.970
P9: You have another.

421
00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:04.940
P9: Here comes my wife. She's been. She's been eavesdropping. Hey! This is HIPAA stuff.

422
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:12.460
P9: No, no, you're lucky. I signed IPAA contracts in my previous job.

423
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:19.089
P9: I'm on this. I'm giving feedback on a experimental

424
00:40:19.933 --> 00:40:25.940
P9: page that they're setting up. Do you have another plan to report for one or more applicants?

425
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.740
P9: Again, I'm doing the typing. So am I the applying?

426
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.390
P9: Or are we talking about

427
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:40.339
P9: the applicant ease? If that's a word, you know, or we talk to my wife and child.

428
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.780
P9: It's not real clear to me here, so.

429
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:47.599
Renata: Question, would you reword this in any way to make it clearer?

430
00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:57.490
P9: I would I do. You have another plan to report for your or your wife and child?

431
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.430
Renata: Okay.

432
00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:02.980
P9: There, you know. Have it. Have it auto fill

433
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:10.189
P9: in here, you know, depending on the previous responses. If I had 25 different people.

434
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.040
P9: I don't know if they listing them all would be

435
00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.158
P9: good. There, do you have

436
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:25.509
P9: Yeah. Listing them all would be awkward if you had 25, but having 2,

437
00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:31.720
P9: you could very easily say, Do you have any more to report for your spouse and child?

438
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:33.140
Renata: Okay.

439
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.246
P9: I don't know. That would take some thought on how to rename that. But

440
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.060
P9: again, I'm like, am I the applicant?

441
00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.600
P9: How about? How about if we define that

442
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.489
P9: earlier on on one of the pages.

443
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.229
Renata: Who an applicant is.

444
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:54.679
P9: Yeah, "from this point on, you are the applicant."

445
00:41:55.470 --> 00:42:03.940
P9: you know. If you're filling this out on behalf of the people, they would be the people.

446
00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.930
P9: the beneficiaries of my benefits.

447
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.299
P9: Okay, does that make sense.

448
00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:17.680
Renata: Yeah, would beneficiaries actually make more sense here? If you, as the veteran, were filling this out like, Do you have beneficiaries?

449
00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.140
P9: No.

450
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.590
Renata: Medicare Plan for.

451
00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:20.180
P9: No, I was.

452
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.300
Renata: Beneficiaries.

453
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:28.220
P9: I was. I was thinking in bad choice of words when I said it, because when I think beneficiary, I think money.

454
00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:29.030
Renata: Okay.

455
00:42:29.558 --> 00:42:32.199
P9: So we'd have to think,

456
00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.800
P9: do you have another plan to report for

457
00:42:39.202 --> 00:42:43.240
P9: the folks that you're applying for?

458
00:42:44.073 --> 00:42:44.696
P9: The

459
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.789
P9: the people listed, you know, to this point, or something like that, it would definitely I'd have to think about it.

460
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:59.609
P9: But I definitely think it needs to be clear or define applicant. You know you are not the applicant.

461
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.750
P9: You know the people that you're

462
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.320
P9: doing this for are the applicants.

463
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.309
P9: But again, I think I'm applying.

464
00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:09.810
P9: On their behalf.

465
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.869
Renata: Well, we will definitely wordsmith this.

466
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:14.230
P9: Yeah.

467
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:22.879
Renata: Taking your feedback into account, so we really appreciate it in the interest of time. I'd like you to hit that. Yes, and add a Medicare plan for your dependent child.

468
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:25.240
P9: Okay.

469
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:32.419
P9: Now, is it possible that that would be the same as my spouse's?

470
00:43:34.389 --> 00:43:43.559
Renata: With Medicare they would be different. Each individual has a unique card. But good question.

471
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:49.730
P9: So they're gonna be different. And I would just fill this in

472
00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.519
P9: and I don't know when the effective date would be. But.

473
00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:56.720
Renata: Okay.

474
00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:02.319
P9: Hopefully, that would be on the blue card. But see, my daughter does not live with us.

475
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.800
P9: and I'd have to call her and say, find your blue card

476
00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.429
P9: and tell me the dates. You know.

477
00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:10.930
Renata: Got it.

478
00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:20.730
Renata: and I just want to do a quick time check as you're filling this out. We're about 10 min to the top of the hour if we were to keep you a couple of extra minutes. Is that a problem?

479
00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:25.710
P9: No, it. It just reinforces the fact that I'm a verbose.

480
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:26.880
Renata: Oh

481
00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:34.109
Renata: You are giving us lots of great feedback. So we appreciate it. So yeah, let's keep going with this section.

482
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:41.989
P9: Okay, yeah, I don't mind. I have nothing planned like I said, 6 Saturdays and a Sunday.

483
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:50.280
P9: Yeah. And I like being a beta tester

484
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:54.240
P9: I'm kinda I've been in this field before, so

485
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:58.130
P9: people at my last job know you want

486
00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:03.579
P9: You want to see if it breaks, give it to P9. P9 will break it, you know.

487
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.409
P9: Because I you know, I'm looking for those things to break it.

488
00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.869
Renata: We love when folks break stuff here, so we really appreciate it.

489
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:18.430
P9: Because my unit, I had a section under me that did this kind of stuff, you know, designed

490
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.359
P9: web pages and applications and things like that.

491
00:45:24.102 --> 00:45:26.329
P9: Say, yes, there?

492
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.452
P9: okay, you might.

493
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:39.479
P9: You may on this one and the previous one for my spouse, say

494
00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:46.740
P9: "your insurance carrier is your insurance company. This information can be found on your red, white, and blue card," or something.

495
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.210
Renata: Got it. Okay.

496
00:45:49.859 --> 00:45:51.139
P9: Oh, cool!

497
00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:00.290
P9: I'm trying to. My theory is answer their questions before they even get asked.

498
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.890
P9: If that makes sense.

499
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.210
Renata: Right, yeah.

500
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:11.929
P9: You know, because that's the kind of quote like, where am I going to find this again?

501
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.290
P9: Okay.

502
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:38.579
P9: I wonder if it'd be helpful to say in the very beginning.

503
00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:44.490
P9: "you're going to need to supply scans of your Medicare

504
00:46:45.373 --> 00:46:48.200
P9: front and back," you know. Cause I

505
00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:52.610
P9: you know, at this point I'd have to stop, and they'll do all the scanning

506
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:55.360
Renata: Right.

507
00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.519
P9: If I knew upfront that I'm going to be having to do this. I probably have them somewhere on my computer.

508
00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.080
Renata: Got it.

509
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:11.979
P9: Another plan to report, no.

510
00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:22.150
Renata: So, for here I'd like you to add a private health insurance plan for your spouse and dependent child. So please click Yes.

511
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:23.570
P9: But let me go back.

512
00:47:24.122 --> 00:47:30.140
P9: We also. She's all my wife is also covered under tricare, although she doesn't use it.

513
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:37.639
P9: So when you get here, I'm like, do you have another plan to report?

514
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:40.850
P9: You might want to say

515
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:46.109
P9: "reporting tricare is not necessary," or to include Tricare.

516
00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:51.790
P9: to have another plan to include Tricare, to report for one of your applicants.

517
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.030
Renata: Got it.

518
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.530
P9: I am asking because.

519
00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:01.139
P9: You know. How does tricare fit in all this? Do you have other health insurance?

520
00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:03.190
P9: So I would say, yes.

521
00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:12.270
P9: hmm!

522
00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:24.440
Renata: And for today it doesn't matter which one we select. But do you have any questions, or is there anything confusing about this.

523
00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:25.820
P9: Well.

524
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:41.160
P9: yeah, at this point I'd be calling my wife in and saying, What does this mean to you? Because it's not a HMO. It's not a PPO. It's it's none of that. It's just insurance, am I not understanding? And that concept right?

525
00:48:41.696 --> 00:48:44.189
P9: It almost feels like there should be.

526
00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:46.957
P9: Here she comes.

527
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:55.139
P9: What would I say about your [insurance provider] for this type of question here?

528
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:56.830
P9's Wife: The PPO.

529
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:58.400
P9: It is a PPO.

530
00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:04.280
P9: I did not know that I probably answered this wrong by saying other. There.

531
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.649
Renata: Got it. Okay.

532
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:11.670
P9: Okay, get this.

533
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:20.259
P9: and I hope, like "you can find the state in the decolarations page." That's that's good. Tell me where I can find it.

534
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:21.200
P9: you know.

535
00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.870
P9: Oh.

536
00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.850
P9: this is the last date.

537
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:52.979
P9: Yeah, sorry I do. I get excited about doing this kind of stuff like I said, I'm trying to break it.

538
00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:55.119
Renata: We love, that.

539
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.350
P9: So I don't. I'm sorry if I'm taking more of your time.

540
00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.400
P9: If the policy.

541
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.670
Renata: No, no, it's alright!

542
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:06.369
P9: If...

543
00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:12.719
P9: Okay, got it. Let's see what happens if I don't put anything in there at all.

544
00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:26.549
Renata: So this is actually a known bug, and I love that you broke this. If you back out and make it nothing, you get that little

545
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:32.780
Renata: error message, but you can go ahead and click continue it'll let you continue to advance in the form.

546
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.600
P9: All right

547
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:44.369
P9: Now, here's another question. I get my [insurance provider] card. I pay for it out of one of my retirement.

548
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.860
P9: payments that I get from being a civil servant.

549
00:50:49.145 --> 00:50:50.140
Renata: Okay.

550
00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:54.939
P9: Even though I'm not working anymore as a civil servant. That's where it's getting paid from.

551
00:50:55.935 --> 00:51:06.910
P9:" Is this insurance through the applicant's employer or past employer?" I don't know. I would say no. Here I'm paying it, and it's just convenient that I'm having it withdrawn

552
00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.349
P9: from my my pension payment.

553
00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:11.560
Renata: Got it.

554
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.130
P9: The answer is yes?

555
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.060
P9: back to previous.

556
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.780
P9: No, it doesn't say previous employer.

557
00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.700
P9: It doesn't say the word "past" like I added that.

558
00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.580
P9: So maybe the word past goes in there, or something.

559
00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:40.250
Renata: That's what you would prefer is if it said, like "current or previous employer"?

560
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:44.499
P9: Yeah, or or something like that. But it's really

561
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:53.120
P9: that might just be over complicating it. It's just they're doing me a favor by just skimming the money off the top and paying [insurance provider].

562
00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:53.970
Renata: Got it.

563
00:51:54.291 --> 00:52:03.350
P9: So I guess the answer would be, no blah blah blah blah!

564
00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:17.280
P9: And again, let's see if it lets me pick both. Oh, cool, all right, that's good.

565
00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.559
P9: I don't need a checkbox for both. If it lets me do that.

566
00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:23.260
Renata: Okay.

567
00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:27.430
P9: Maybe change that other page to check boxes instead of the radio button.

568
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.010
Renata: Noted.

569
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.890
P9: More uploading.

570
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.609
Renata: Well, you're a pro at uploading the Hyatt reservation at this point. So.

571
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:43.620
P9: Yeah.

572
00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:48.260
P9: Alright.

573
00:52:48.260 --> 00:53:02.669
Renata: Okay, I'm going to pause you here. So I'm going to ask you that 1 to 5 scale question again, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the Medicare and Health Insurance section of the form?

574
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:11.729
P9: Assuming you fix you provide more information to kind of answer the questions that I have.

575
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:14.369
P9: you know, going on when I'm doing it

576
00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.429
P9: right now. I call it a 3.

577
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.060
Renata: That's true.

578
00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:26.719
P9: But you know, if you reword certain pages and all that, I would say, a 5

579
00:53:28.341 --> 00:53:33.184
P9: and I also, if there's a way to upload everything at once, you know.

580
00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:40.590
P9: maybe at the end. You say the following documents need to be uploaded, you know. You just

581
00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:44.760
P9: you just go down the list, you know, says, you know

582
00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:51.000
P9: red, white, and blue card for this the app, the spouse, or whatever front

583
00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:58.170
P9: back, and as you do them. Well, it wouldn't know unless you put a check mark. And this is the what the file I'm uploading.

584
00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:03.699
P9: But again, that might be too much right now to to implement.

585
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:14.859
Renata: Got it so. But in an ideal world, though, you'd have like a basically like an upload page with almost a checklist that was like Medicare card, health insurance card, birth..?

586
00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:15.680
P9: So I know yeah.

587
00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.100
Renata: Noted.

588
00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.669
P9: I know I yeah, so that I know I got them all.

589
00:54:19.266 --> 00:54:24.960
P9: But so I don't have to keep going back to that download. You know that place

590
00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:32.920
P9: to upload them all, but I might have to hunt for the cards, but that's my problem.

591
00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:33.930
Renata: Got it.

592
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:38.740
P9: Nice to know that you got itt. I gave them everything they need as far as scans.

593
00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:42.390
P9: Alright. Do you have any other health insurance to report?

594
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:48.130
Renata: You can go ahead and click no here and hit continue. We've got one more page to look at.

595
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:49.830
P9: Right, I would.

596
00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:55.979
P9: The the topic of Tricare hasn't been really addressed at all anywhere in there.

597
00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:04.510
P9: because I have Tricare and my, I have. I have one plus, you know, sponsor plus one.

598
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:05.430
Renata: Okay.

599
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:09.519
P9: So it's a whole nother topic there. Okay, review and submit.

600
00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:21.660
Renata: Yeah. So on this page. Like I said, we're not actually going to be submitting this today. But if you could just walk through and review the application that you've filled out so far, and let me know what comes up for you as you're reviewing it.

601
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:26.819
P9: Okay.

602
00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:39.190
P9: this area here at first, st just like confused me. You know, I was thinking, why doesn't it say your name, colon?

603
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.161
P9: And there it is, [P9].

604
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:50.220
P9: having them so far away. I get it now. But it just made me pause for a second to say.

605
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:55.640
P9: Okay, why are they all the answers already over here? Why aren't they closer to

606
00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:58.980
P9: what they're asking for? But.

607
00:55:59.090 --> 00:55:59.870
Renata: Got it.

608
00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:02.399
Renata: It's almost like there's too much white space here

609
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.240
Renata: for you?

610
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:03.560
P9: Yeah.

611
00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.790
Renata: Okay.

612
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:09.480
P9: I don't know what it would look like if you put a call in there, and it had the answer here.

613
00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:14.990
P9: yeah, and then have all your white space down here, just in case their last name is.

614
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:18.859
P9: you know, Vietnamese, and 18 characters long.

615
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:20.750
Renata: Got it.

616
00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:27.869
P9: Mailing address got it contact, and it seems less important now that you know.

617
00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:31.949
P9: like for this stuff. But it's just my personal

618
00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:34.260
P9: My personal preference

619
00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:38.920
P9: desire would be over. If I was designing it, I would put it more to the left.

620
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:52.470
P9: Okay, okay, okay. Sponsors, contact information. Good. spouse.

621
00:56:54.020 --> 00:57:05.409
Renata: So is this alignment here for your wife and child more, what you're talking about for your information as well. What you'd like to see where it's. It's all sort of left justified?

622
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.610
Renata: Okay.

623
00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:08.200
P9: Yeah.

624
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:10.010
Renata: Got it.

625
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:14.799
P9: I like that. I can go back if I need to. If I miss somebody

626
00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:20.470
P9: here, your plan. So that yeah.

627
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:27.239
P9: yeah. But you you would have to put a statement somewhere to

628
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:40.309
P9: say to address Tricare. This does not include tricare, or you do. You should list tricare. If you have tricare is everybody that you're really giving this to is a veteran.

629
00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:45.480
P9: and they're all familiar with tricare or have had it.

630
00:57:46.644 --> 00:57:49.679
P9: But it's not talked about anywhere in here.

631
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.200
P9: I'm gonna break it for you.

632
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:04.495
Renata: So we're not gonna hit that submit button. But

633
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:07.480
Renata: you did appear to break it.

634
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:08.940
P9: Well.

635
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:19.269
P9: yeah, I'd have to go back on the application. Yeah. Normally, I'd be putting my real name in there. So what you're asking for

636
00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:29.650
P9: adds space. GGG, let's see, I still didn't like it.

637
00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:32.429
P9: Oh, there's an S there.

638
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.629
P9: Okay, so yeah, it works. If I really

639
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:41.269
P9: put my correct information in there. So okay, where to now?

640
00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:53.660
Renata: Oh, we're gonna just stay put here. I got a couple of questions for you. So if you were submitting the form today, you clicked that submit form button, what would you expect to happen next?

641
00:58:54.410 --> 00:59:05.769
P9: A validation page saying, "Congratulations you successfully applied for CHAMPVA for

642
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:11.100
P9: spouse and child," you know, names [SPOUSE] and [DEPENDENT].

643
00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:17.249
P9: You will be receiving an email for your records" or something.

644
00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:24.010
P9: But I would know that I could always go back in here. There should be a record of this somewhere in my va.gov

645
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:26.210
P9: paperwork.

646
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:31.979
Renata: Got it. So would you expect to have a place where you could download a copy of the application? Either?

647
00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:35.070
Renata: Yeah, submission page or profile, or something?

648
00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:40.339
P9: Yeah, especially, you know, you don't have to send me an email. If you're gonna give me

649
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:43.859
P9: "you can download your application here," you know

650
00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:46.769
P9: Yeah, I'd like that.

651
00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:54.520
Renata: Okay. And once you've submitted the application, how soon do you expect to be notified about a decision being made on it?

652
00:59:54.520 --> 01:00:02.270
P9: Hmm, good question. I don't know again something that you probably should just make a statement about normally

653
01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:07.480
P9: it's based on volume or something.

654
01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:12.900
P9: But "our normal processing time is 90 days" or whatever.

655
01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.449
P9: Yeah, I'd like to know that.

656
01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:22.510
Renata: And in an ideal world. How quickly would CHAMPVA get back to you with a decision on your application?

657
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:30.730
P9: If I made no mistakes on this form, I would say 2 weeks

658
01:00:31.968 --> 01:00:36.790
P9: if they had to come back to me and say, this doesn't make sense

659
01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:43.309
P9: here, you there's no record of this app account, or whatever I would say, 30 days.

660
01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:44.130
Renata: Okay.

661
01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:55.219
Renata: And if there were any errors, would you expect to get a notification from the the CHAMPVA program telling you what what you need that was missing or something? Yeah, yeah, okay.

662
01:00:55.580 --> 01:01:08.659
Renata: got it. So I've got one more question for you. It's at scale again from 1 to 5. 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits on this page?

663
01:01:09.442 --> 01:01:11.689
P9: Easy. Very easy. 5.

664
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.670
Renata: Okay.

665
01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:27.969
Renata: great that's the end of the screen sharing portion. You can go ahead and stop screen sharing and close out this browser window. I just have a few things to ask you before we wrap up, though. So overall. Was there anything you saw in the session that worked well for you?

666
01:01:30.056 --> 01:01:37.400
P9: The familiarity that it looks like with va dot gov's page.

667
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:38.400
Renata: Okay.

668
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.790
P9: And MyHealtheVet, and all that I like that the VA is kind of got this same standardized format

669
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:46.970
P9: on their stuff.

670
01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:53.070
Renata: Okay. And was there anything, unclear, or that didn't work well for you that you'd like to call out?

671
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:57.350
P9: Well again, what do we do about tricare?

672
01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.960
P9: You know we'd have to address tricare

673
01:02:00.389 --> 01:02:05.310
P9: cause. I don't know if it goes in there or not, because you don't talk about it at all.

674
01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:14.959
P9: So that's probably the only thing besides the the rewording of a couple of questions. But

675
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.430
P9: for the most part easy.

676
01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:28.910
Renata: Okay. And knowing what you know. Now, having filled this form out, what research would you suggest veterans do before filling out the CHAMPVA application?

677
01:02:30.464 --> 01:02:33.109
P9: Also. One other thing I thought of just now.

678
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:38.350
P9: I you maybe might want to tell them upfront. There is no cost for this

679
01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:45.500
P9: or something like that, and this. This will not affect your benefits, sponsors, benefits.

680
01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:55.229
P9: because if there's a cost for CHAMPVA, then I wouldn't even probably that probably needs to be way up in the beginning of the form, if there's a cost.

681
01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.990
P9: I'm sorry. What was your what was your question?

682
01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:09.690
Renata: No, I mean you answered it. Great! I was asking, knowing what you know now, because you filled the application out. What research or information. Would you give veterans before they start the CHAMPVA application?

683
01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:18.609
P9: Definitely more information on the program. What's covered what's not, you know. I'm sure they have a handbook or something.

684
01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:23.600
P9: Give me a link that I can download the handbook and and kinda page through.

685
01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:39.510
Renata: Okay, got it. One more question about like when your application is pending after you've submitted the form, how would you like to receive notifications about the status while while you're waiting to get a decision from CHAMPVA on your application?

686
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:43.810
P9: Well, if we told them, when you can expect, you know, no problems.

687
01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.650
P9: 2 weeks with problems or questions. 30 days.

688
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:58.039
P9: If you bust one of those timelines and send me a note saying what's going on. But if you're still on the timeline, I don't want to know. You know I'm fine.

689
01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:01.385
P9: you know, I get enough email as it is.

690
01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.806
P9: I would just assume you're you're working it. But

691
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:12.550
P9: if it gets to be day 21, I'm thinking to myself, well, there must be a problem here.

692
01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:14.359
P9: Okay.

693
01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:26.230
Renata: And on day 21. Would you expect to get that notice from champion about like pending status text message email in your profile a letter, what any combination of those, or or what?

694
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:34.920
P9: Yeah, that that would be nice, you know the email. But if I logged in the va.gov and looked at the status of my application.

695
01:04:35.592 --> 01:04:43.840
P9: You know, as long as it said, still in progress, or something, or you know.

696
01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.079
P9: because I don't want to bug people needlessly.

697
01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.120
Renata: Right.

698
01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:52.890
P9: But if it's did you find a problem? Are you gonna be

699
01:04:53.070 --> 01:05:03.710
P9: on day 30, saying, you need to do this, this and this? Or are you still working it, or is it? Did you bust the timeline because of the sheer volume of applications coming in?

700
01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:10.319
P9: I don't know. But I like knowing what's going on, and I think you just do that on the page.

701
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:11.400
Renata: Right.

702
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.879
P9: You know va.gov.

703
01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:23.000
Renata: Got it. Last question for you before we wrap up. What were your thoughts about the amount of information provided in this form? Not enough, just right, too much?

704
01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:26.820
P9: Oh, not enough!

705
01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:27.870
Renata: Okay.

706
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:30.000
Renata: And for those reasons that we discussed?

707
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.119
P9: Yeah, I don't know anything about CHAMPVA. So I'd like to know, what what is it? Does it cost?

708
01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.910
P9: What do we get for all that.

709
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:44.480
P9: And yeah, that's probably the biggest

710
01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.329
P9: status of tricare. And all those questions we've all talked about.

711
01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:56.670
Renata: Alright. I wanna circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?

712
01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:57.680
P9: Yeah, fine.

713
01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.440
Renata: Alright. Any part of this discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?

714
01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:06.722
P9: My actual hyatt reservation.

715
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:10.140
Renata: No, it's not, of course.

716
01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:20.900
Renata: Well, P9, I really appreciate you taking time out of your your day and week to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback's so helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans.

717
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:41.089
Renata: So thank you! Perigean is going to be sending you a thank you. Note in your email. It's going to have a little blurb at the bottom that you can pass on to other veterans, you may know, to provide them with a chance to participate in future research studies like this and break stuff. But with that, thank you so much again. Enjoy the rest of your day and your week. We really appreciate it.

718
01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:43.917
P9: Yeah. Good job so far on this. This is very

719
01:06:44.969 --> 01:06:48.759
P9: you're quite a quite a ways along on this. So

720
01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.840
P9: no, this is good, and keeping in mind for future breaking.

721
01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:58.669
Renata: Absolutely. You're gonna be at the top of our list to break stuff, and I'm sure engineers will love that too. So.

722
01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:04.110
P9: As long as as long as you're okay with my verboseness, if that's a word.

723
01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.929
Renata: Yeah, yeah, absolutely alright. Well, take care. Thank you.

724
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:09.310
P9: You later.

725
01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:11.369
Renata: And yeah, yeah.

726
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:15.230
P9: Yeah, I like doing this kind of stuff. So please, keep me in mind.
