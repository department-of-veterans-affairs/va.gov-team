1
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.719
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.410
P6: Yes.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:19.309
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.010
P6: Yes.

5
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:30.730
Renata: Okay, thank you so much for answering my questions. So before we look at the website, just a few, just a few warm up things to talk about. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

6
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.790
P6: No.

7
00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:33.610
Renata: Okay.

8
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.864
P6: That's

9
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.690
P6: That's different from the Va disability program, isn't it?

10
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.670
Renata: It is. That's correct.

11
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.360
P6: Okay. Okay, no, not that. I recall.

12
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.685
Renata: Okay.

13
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.329
Renata: Do you ever recall it being brought up to you in the past? As a benefit that 

14
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.789
Renata: you or your family was eligible for?

15
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.340
P6: No.

16
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.330
Renata: Okay.

17
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.260
Renata: Alright. Any

18
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.110
Renata: idea of whether or not you intend in applying for CHAMPVA benefits for your family in the future?

19
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.240
P6: I don't know, because I don't know enough about the program.

20
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.050
Renata: Okay, totally fair. Couple other questions for you. Do you have a va.gov account?

21
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.850
P6: I do

22
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.710
Renata: Okay. And what has been your experience with logging into the site?

23
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.579
P6: Honestly, since they made the changes to the site, I preferred the old login better.

24
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.383
P6: It's okay. They they made changes that

25
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.689
P6: I don't know how people with less in Internet skills would be able to negotiate

26
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.550
P6: or navigate rather the site.

27
00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.739
Renata: And and when you say the changes, are you referring to the the new login account types or...?

28
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:09.190
P6: Yes, yes, and and what they did with the the Va site for

29
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.959
P6: all the different things that I'm eligible for, you know appointments and that kind of thing. The benefits.

30
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.537
Renata: Got it. I'm thank you for sharing, and I'm sorry that things are not as good as they were before, but it's really good for us to hear this feedback.

31
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.479
Renata: How often are you logging into va.gov?

32
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.210
P6: Oh, at least a few times a week.

33
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.109
Renata: Okay. And for what tasks are you visiting the site for?

34
00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.065
P6: To oh,

35
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.469
P6: Get a prescription, or to send a message to my primary care.

36
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.469
P6: or to or to print some of my medical records

37
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.760
P6: on the on the Blue, whatever it's called.

38
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.899
Renata: The MyHealtheVet of things, or...?

39
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.190
P6: Yes. Yeah.

40
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.800
Renata: Okay. Got it all right. Those are all my warm up questions before we jump in and start looking at stuff.

41
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.400
P6: Okay.

42
00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:19.010
Renata: So in just a moment I'm gonna drop a link in the chat which I'd like you to open in your browser and share screen in zoom, and I can help walk you through that unless you're

43
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.390
P6: Yeah.

44
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.409
Renata: Comfortable with that. Okay.

45
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.390
P6: Well, no, I might need your help.

46
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:34.910
Renata: Okay. So gonna give you a moment. If you have other browser windows open, or anything that you don't want visible on your screen to close it. But when you're ready that link is in the chat.

47
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.630
P6: Okay, and just click on it?

48
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.549
Renata: Just yeah. Just click on it once it's loaded in your browser in the zoom there's a

49
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.590
Renata: green button at the bottom that says, Share.

50
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.229
P6: Whoops. Oh, I lost everybody. -Oh!

51
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.140
P6: I don't see anybody.

52
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.590
Renata: Oh no!

53
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.020
P6: I see the apply for CHAMPVA benefits.

54
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.559
Renata: Okay? What type of device are you on windows or apple?

55
00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.679
P6: It's a windows.

56
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:19.509
Renata: Okay. If you go down to the dock that's down at the bottom of your screen, there might be a zoom application open if you click on that, you should probably.

57
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.940
P6: Okay.

58
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.630
Renata: It it should be.

59
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.070
P6: And there you are. Okay.

60
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:32.819
Renata: Okay, perfect. Now, while you're in zoom at the bottom of the zoom app, there should be a row of icons. There should be a green one in the middle, with an up arrow that says, Share.

61
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.700
P6: Okay, go ahead.

62
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.039
Renata: Click, that. Yeah.

63
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.700
P6: Okay.

64
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.709
Renata: And it should give you some options of what you'd like to share, and you should share your browser, and it should show that CHAMPVA benefits.

65
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.330
P6: it's is that. Have I done that correctly?

66
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.410
Renata: You have. That's perfect.

67
00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.585
P6: Okay.

68
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.230
Renata: Thank you for bearing with us.

69
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.760
P6: Oh, that's fine!

70
00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:17.470
Renata: So a few things before we start playing around with this form to be aware of. Like I said before, this is our testing site. So you don't have to worry about any information that we're putting in today going anywhere. And

71
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.109
Renata: then you click.

72
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.089
P6: Is going to have any bearing on your benefits.

73
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:50.909
Renata: Okay, as we go through the form today, you can feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers. There may be a couple of screens that you see where you'll be asked to upload documents, as we're not submitting the form, and this isn't attached to your benefits. Nothing you upload here is actually going to be sent to Va, when we get to those screens that ask for a file upload, you can either upload like a photo that you have on your desktop, or I can provide you with a sample document to use

74
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.690
P6: Okay.

75
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.800
Renata: Don't have to answer that question yet. I'll remind you, when we get to those pages, that that's an option. But.

77
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.160
Renata: Any questions for me?

78
00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.849
P6: Not yet. Okay.

79
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:12.899
Renata: Okay, alright. So let's let's get rolling without clicking on anything. I'd like you to just take a look at the information on this page, and let us know your initial thoughts, questions, anything that comes up for you.

80
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.899
P6: Am I allowed to scroll down just to see?

81
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.339
Renata: You may scroll down. Yes, absolutely.

82
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.180
P6: Okay.

83
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.910
P6: no. Looks fairly easy.

84
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:39.360
Renata: Alright! Do you know, if you're on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

85
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:49.999
P6: I would assume so, since it says, "apply for CHAMPVA benefits."

86
00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:05.500
Renata: All right. I wanna draw your attention to the 3 little links that are at the top of your page right now. They see VA.gov Home, and "Ivc champva," "1010d extended." What does 1010d extended mean to you? If anything.

87
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.460
P6: Nothing.

88
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.870
Renata: Nothing. Okay.

89
00:07:08.698 --> 00:07:19.440
Renata: If you were to go on va.gov today and actually fill this form out for you, your spouse and dependents. What research would you do before applying for and completing a form like this?

90
00:07:21.484 --> 00:07:28.399
P6: To figure out exactly what I'm applying for, because I don't. I don't really know anything about it.

91
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:36.819
Renata: Alright and in an ideal world like what? What sort of information would you want to see on va.gov about that?

92
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.469
P6: The application process. How long it takes?

93
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:54.629
P6: The approval process, what I would need to go through to get that. And if it's

94
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.370
P6: if I'm eligible,

95
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.319
P6: Would the benefits be worth it

96
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.670
P6: to me and or my family?

97
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.750
P6: My spouse?

98
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:15.959
Renata: I'd like to follow up on on what you just said, what? What would make a benefit worth it, or not worth it for you and your family?

99
00:08:18.235 --> 00:08:25.079
P6: The ease of using the benefit.

100
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:27.600
Renata: Okay.

101
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:40.880
P6: For example, where, let's say, this is for my spouse, where he would have to go, to be able to use whatever benefits that he would be eligible, for through me.

102
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.220
Renata: Got it.

103
00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:44.590
Renata: Okay

104
00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:53.289
Renata: Based on the page that we're on right now. Do you know how to check your eligibility for your spouse For CHAMPVA benefits?

105
00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:01.589
P6: I would assume if I go to Number One and click on the "find out if you're eligible for CHAMPVA benefits" that would take me to where I need to go.

106
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:09.570
Renata: Okay, we're not gonna click on it today.

107
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.555
Renata: I know.

108
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:22.419
Renata: Based on this page, what information do you think you'd need to have on hand to fill this application out for your spouse?

109
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.539
P6: Let's see if I scroll down a little bit.

110
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.084
P6: Oh, go to number 2.

111
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:46.699
P6: All the information that's under number 2: the base, the birth, social security, numbers, etcetera.

112
00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:53.090
P6: and other documents that might prove eligibility.

113
00:09:53.620 --> 00:10:09.070
Renata: Okay. And thinking about that list of of things you might need to provide would, if we were actually filling this out on va.gov today for real, do you have that information and and those documents on hand? Or would you need to pause and collect it before filling this out?

114
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.029
P6: If you would need. Let's see.

115
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:31.389
P6: yeah, for example, that his health insurance cards I would need to get copies of those I would need to, you know, take a picture and then save it as Pdf. Or whatever that I could download it.

116
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:32.970
Renata: Okay.

117
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:41.269
P6: If I needed to download it, or if I just needed to look at the information so I could put it into a form. Then I would need to do that.

118
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:58.190
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. One more question before we proceed on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin? Based on this page's content.

119
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.210
P6: Oh, this looks fairly straightforward.

120
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.550
P6: Okay, so I'd give it a 5.

121
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:15.949
Renata: Got it. Thank you. At this point I'd like you to scroll down a little ways. And in the bottom of that blue box there's a link that says, Start your form without signing in, and I'll have you click that.

122
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:16.810
P6: Okay.

123
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.300
Renata: Okay.

124
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:40.329
Renata: So for the purposes of today's session, I'm going to have you fill this form out as if you were applying for your spouse and one other family member like a dependent child. I'm going to let you know when to pause to ask some questions, but to help orient you, you're going to start by completing sections one through 3 of the form

125
00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:53.449
Renata: and as a reminder, this is a testing site. So we're not submitting anything, and you can use fake information. And I'd like you to think out loud as you're going through this. We want to hear any reactions you're having as you're experiencing them.

126
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.060
P6: Okay. So I should go ahead and start.

127
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.679
Renata: Go ahead and start. Yes.

128
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.730
P6: Okay.

129
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.680
P6: let's see.

130
00:12:29.908 --> 00:12:32.420
P6: where's the US complete?

131
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.989
P6: Hang on just a second. I live country.

132
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.738
P6: Okay. I can't find the country

133
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.212
P6: either. I'm blind, or I can't see. I can't find the United States.

134
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:56.839
Renata: I think if you scroll all the way back up to the top, it's above Afghanistan.

135
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.439
P6: Oh, well, I don't see that.

136
00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.400
Renata: Oh, God!

137
00:12:59.673 --> 00:13:07.339
P6: Oh, okay, I have a black bar there that says this meeting is being recorded. Do I just need if I click on? Okay, it's not gonna take.

138
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.822
Renata: Yeah. If you click on okay, it'll just go away.

139
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.800
P6: There we go!

141
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.980
P6: Okay, there, we are United States. There.

142
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.640
Renata: Sorry about that.

143
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.840
P6: Thank you.

144
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.390
P6: Oh, I love Autofill.

145
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.730
P6: Please enter a 10 digit phone number with or without dashes.

146
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.710
P6: Okay, their information at the very interesting.

147
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.550
P6: Hmm!

148
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.979
P6: I have no idea if the information I just put in there was wrong or not.

149
00:13:57.475 --> 00:14:00.990
Renata: What's making you pause on that?

150
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:08.429
P6: Just like reading this. I enter the sponsor's name. Wouldn't that be me?

151
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:09.810
P6: The sponsor?

152
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:17.759
Renata: I'm gonna be a little annoying and answer your question with another question, is that is that what you assume, based on what you see on the page?

153
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.720
P6: Sponsor's name and date of birth.

154
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:29.310
P6: Yes, I would be the sponsor for my husband, but all the information I just filled in

155
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.380
P6: was for me, and I

156
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:42.620
P6: I don't know if I should have put his information in there, so shall I just continue?

157
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.640
Renata: Let's just continue with whatever assumptions that you have based.

158
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.070
Renata: No worries.

159
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.589
Renata: And and we'll see how it goes.

160
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:50.930
P6: Okay.

161
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:17.730
Renata: You might need to change up a couple of the numbers, because they won't let you do like

162
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.919
Renata: a perfect set of fives. Unfortunately.

163
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.580
P6: Okay. Alright. Yeah. What? I wasn't sure if I could put my own in there.

164
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.759
P6: There. Okay, your mailing address. Okay, I'm back to the same page.

165
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.650
P6: Sponsor information. All right. Same same stuff. Okay, continue.

166
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.460
P6: You add it.

167
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:49.570
P6: This includes related to sponsor. Okay.

168
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.520
P6: okay.

169
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:20.710
P6: no.

170
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.839
P6: you don't care.

171
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.699
Renata: And there's nothing confusing or standing out to you so far?

172
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:45.759
P6: No, so far it's fine. I just the the size of the font is a little bit small for me. That's why I keep moving forward.

173
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.220
P6: and

174
00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.440
P6: you have no.

175
00:17:58.295 --> 00:18:06.274
Renata: Actually, for the purposes of this, we're gonna imagine that you have a dependent child here to add. So if you could if you could say yes.

176
00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:06.970
P6: Okay.

177
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.579
Renata: And just, you know

178
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.350
P6: Alright.

179
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.950
P6: Okay.

180
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.250
P6: Oh, yeah.

181
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.660
P6: Okay.

182
00:20:17.126 --> 00:20:19.279
P6: Upload a

183
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:25.450
P6: copy of a birth certificate. Okay, I don't. What should I do? Just upload anything that I have...?

184
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.380
Renata: You can upload any random thing. Yeah.

185
00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.440
P6: Okay.

186
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.010
Renata: Probably something small.

187
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.600
P6: As in 228 kB.

188
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.440
Renata: I think that should be fine.

189
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.730
Renata: Let's see.

190
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:41.720
P6: Open?

191
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.050
P6: Is that acceptable?

192
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:50.089
Renata: That for the purposes of today's session. Yes, that's perfect.

193
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.756
Renata: Okay, alright.

194
00:20:53.346 --> 00:20:59.120
P6: So that would be for [Dependent]. Oh, yeah, [Dependent], okay.

195
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:04.609
Renata: Yeah. Did you have any questions about that or any confusion around?

196
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.432
P6: No, if I 

197
00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.210
P6: Upload a copy version. No, that's easy. That's easy to understand.

198
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.120
Renata: Okay.

199
00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:22.270
P6: I can continue upload. Proof of parents marriage. Okay, upload file.

200
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.810
P6: Oh, let's see

201
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:46.090
P6: And anything confusing here about why it's asking for the marriage certificate or...?

202
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:46.420
P6: No

203
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:51.169
P6: No, that's that's easy to understand. It would make sense that

204
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:56.570
P6: they need to know that I'm actually married to [Spouse name].

205
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:59.089
Renata: Okay, got it

206
00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.050
P6: Okay.

207
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:05.920
Renata: So we're gonna stop here for a moment. Okay, I have some questions.

208
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.330
P6: All right.

209
00:22:06.678 --> 00:22:17.129
Renata: But 1st I wanted to say, if the font size is too small on your keyboard, you can hit control and the plus sign, and that should increase the fonts.

210
00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.200
P6: Okay.

211
00:22:18.612 --> 00:22:26.189
Renata: So I wanted to stop and and give you an opportunity to do that if it would make it more comfortable for you to finish out the the session with a larger font size.

212
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:32.299
P6: Oh, will it do it here if I do it? Now? Control, use the plus sign. Okay.

213
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.160
Renata: Yeah, control. And the plus.

214
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.540
P6: Plus.

215
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.279
P6: Oh, oh, yeah, okay, cool.

216
00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:41.990
Renata: Alright.

217
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.650
Renata: So

218
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:56.840
Renata: of questions, yeah, of course, we want you to be comfortable while you're doing this. So on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being very hard, and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this section of the form.

219
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:09.329
P6: For me. Let's see, because I have OCD. There are some things that sometimes I miss

220
00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:13.189
P6: but that's me, not the form.

221
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.740
P6: So I would say it would. I'd I'd give it a 5. It was easy to complete.

222
00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:27.540
Renata: Okay, would this would there be any way to make it easier for you? For for things that that you tend to miss or that are....?

223
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:34.155
P6: No, I just need to pay attention when I'm when I'm doing things.

224
00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.220
Renata: Okay.

225
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:43.779
P6: Sometimes sometimes I get a little into my head and move forward without actually, despite the OCD.

226
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:51.310
P6: I think I have some mild, very mild dyslexia as well. It's in my family, so.

227
00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:57.059
P6: but not. It's not a critical thing so, but otherwise I think it's easy to fill out.

228
00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:11.259
Renata: Okay. Out of curiosity. What are things that you mentioned just now that there are things that you tend to miss because you kind of get into a flow. What are the sorts of things that you might miss when you're filling something out?

229
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:20.299
P6: If there's too much information on the page, that's that's challenging for me.

230
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.489
P6: because I'll look at something. And then.

231
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:41.719
P6: for example, I do a lot of crossword puzzles, but because there's so much information with the squares and everything. Sometimes I'll put something in the wrong area. So if there's too much data on the page, I might miss something.

232
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:47.090
P6: So. But this this is pretty straightforward. I like the white background.

233
00:24:47.996 --> 00:24:55.130
P6: That's easier to read and doing. The control plus making the screen larger is a bonus. So.

234
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.320
Renata: Okay

235
00:24:56.837 --> 00:25:01.750
Renata: So in terms of this page and reviewing your applicants, is this a

236
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.609
Renata: An easy way for you to review a lot of information here, or would there be a way that we could make this better and easier for you?

237
00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:17.230
P6: No, this is fine, because it's there's there's no extraneous information on this page. It shows me

238
00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.239
P6: who the applicants are.

239
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:32.179
P6: The information. And if I've entered something incorrectly, it allows me to edit it so, or if I decide that I don't want that applicant on there, I can delete that applicant. So so yeah, it's fine.

240
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.220
P6: Oh, I see.

241
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:38.950
Renata: Great at this point you can select no to that question of adding more applicants.

242
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.149
P6: When it 23 more applicants.

243
00:25:43.405 --> 00:25:43.670
Renata: Okay.

244
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:44.340
P6: Okay.

245
00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.149
Renata: We're not gonna fill out anymore. We're gonna leave the other. The other 23 blank.

246
00:25:48.827 --> 00:25:49.822
P6: Thank you.

247
00:25:50.601 --> 00:25:59.339
Renata: So before clicking through any anything else, I'd just like you to take a look at this page and let me know what your impressions are what stands out to you?

248
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:10.339
P6: The question is easy, as far as you know, any Medicare report for one or more applicants.

249
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:18.260
P6: Okay? Required to. Yeah, that's it's very easy to very easy to read again. There's no overwhelming information on this page.

250
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:19.520
Renata: Got it.

251
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.969
P6: And it gives me a chance to contact should I have any questions. So I like that.

252
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:31.300
Renata: Okay, do you use the call center when you have questions about stuff on va.gov, or things when you're filling it out?

253
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.969
P6: No, I haven't.

254
00:26:36.866 --> 00:26:45.820
P6: I just if it's anything like the VA [facility] in [CITY] you're on.

255
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.970
P6: you're on permanent ignore for at least 20 min, so.

256
00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.200
Renata: Got it.

257
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.150
P6: And and I don't know if that were would be the case here. But.

258
00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.750
Renata: Okay.

259
00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:11.090
Renata: So thinking back to the information you saw on that 1st page today, do you remember it mentioning Medicare or information about health insurance being needed for this form?

260
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:18.049
P6: Yes, it was asking for insurance cards, I think. Yeah.

261
00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:25.890
Renata: Alright, and I think you mentioned when we were looking at that page that you don't have those on hand you'd need to like. Go grab your husband's card to....?

262
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:26.830
P6: Yes, that's.

263
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.350
Renata: Either scan it, or or.

264
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.760
P6: Okay.

265
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:49.349
Renata: Check the information. Okay, yeah. So for the purposes of today's study, I'd like you to imagine that both your husband and your dependent daughter have both Medicare as well as private health insurance. So you're going to fill this next section out with those 2 plans for your 2 family members.

266
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.560
P6: That both of them have medicare?

267
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.569
Renata: For the purposes of today. Yeah.

268
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:55.000
P6: Okay.

269
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.039
Renata: Do that. Okay.

270
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.570
P6: Okay?

271
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:09.229
P6: Oh, applicant Medicare advice and Medicare insurance for okay, both.

272
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.100
P6: Oh, it's only at I can only pick one.

273
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.680
P6: Okay.

274
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.870
P6: let's go back.

275
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.170
P6: Oh.

276
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:36.950
P6: for A, and B, okay, okay.

277
00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.100
P6: Effective date.

278
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:56.220
P6: okay.

279
00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:00.710
P6: Let's see.

280
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:27.920
P6: Continue. Okay, that was easy.

281
00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.100
P6: Upload.

282
00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:45.540
P6: I can upload my card right? Just.

283
00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.030
Renata: Sure if you haven't. Yeah.

284
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.820
P6: Yeah. Okay, bear with me. Just a second

285
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:20.660
P6: oops. Wrong. One.

286
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:27.520
P6: Upload right on the file.

287
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.279
P6: Okay, that was easy.

288
00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.070
P6: Do you have a card?

289
00:30:41.295 --> 00:30:43.080
P6: Yes, he does.

290
00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.790
P6: Okay.

291
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.670
P6: Name of insurance carrier.

292
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.950
P6: That's

293
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.580
P6: I'll just use the same file.

294
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:51.730
P6: Do you have another plan to report for you?

295
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:57.590
P6: No.

296
00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.550
P6: okay.

297
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.160
P6: Oh.

298
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.970
P6: you okay.

299
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.920
P6: you said I should put both of them down

300
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.480
P6: for Medicare, but I only selected [Spouse name].

301
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.029
Renata: Yeah, so.

302
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.089
P6: So did I make a mistake here?

303
00:32:34.248 --> 00:32:44.091
Renata: Not at all. If you indicate that somebody doesn't have a plan, it'll ask you this if you'd like to go back and add a new plan.

304
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:46.199
Renata: you can scroll.

305
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:51.470
P6: But it only gave... I thought it only gave me the option to select [Spouse] or [dependent].

306
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.220
Renata: Okay.

307
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.919
Renata: So from your perspective, the section you just filled out.

308
00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.659
Renata: you weren't able to add, [dependent]?

309
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.750
P6: Correct.

310
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:10.890
P6: As far as as far as I recall, I had to pick one of the 2, so I picked [Spouse].

311
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:12.180
Renata: Okay

312
00:33:12.901 --> 00:33:19.889
Renata: So we can just proceed with this and feel free to indicate a notice of having

313
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.090
Renata: having or not having a notice of disallowance.

314
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.069
P6: Do you have a notice of something?

315
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:29.050
P6: No, okay.

316
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:36.720
P6: Should I pick? Yes, because I made a mistake or no?

317
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:38.220
Renata: Okay.

318
00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.680
Renata: And if you click, so.

319
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.600
P6: Okay.

320
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:51.739
Renata: So for this section I will have you add a private health insurance plan for both applicants. So for both [dependent] and [spouse].

321
00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:56.929
P6: Grab it.

322
00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.680
P6: Well, didn't I already do that with [Spouse]

323
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.030
P6: with his plan? Oh, yeah, with Plan D,

324
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.190
P6: was it that that's a private health.

325
00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:12.599
Renata: Okay. So at this point, would you just be adding one for [Dependent]?

326
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.692
P6: I guess.

327
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.000
Renata: Okay.

328
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:21.299
P6: But oh, gosh!

329
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:29.789
P6: Oh, I guess I do better when I'm dealing with facts as opposed to made ups.

330
00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.737
Renata: Yeah, fictional family members is tough.

331
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:38.951
P6: The applicant is enrolled in

332
00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:44.340
P6: A PPO

333
00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:59.190
P6: Okay, I'll just do that.

334
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:33.510
P6: No!

335
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.759
P6: Any additional comments... do I need to put comments in there?

336
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:47.459
Renata: Gonna do that annoying thing again and answer with a question. What do you think you would need to do here?

337
00:35:49.320 --> 00:36:01.649
P6: If I need to clarify something, I would. I would put comments in there if I've if I've added the documents correctly, or if I've added the documents correctly, and everything is

338
00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.499
P6: in order from the document standpoint

339
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:10.629
P6: I wouldn't need to have. I would not need to enter anything here. If I felt that

340
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.049
P6: there wasn't enough information on the documentation.

341
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.710
P6: then I would just put some comments and move forward.

342
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:28.230
Renata: Alright. Well, we will assume, for the purposes of today's session, that you feel great about everything you've uploaded so far, so we'll we'll proceed without any comments in that.

343
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.484
P6: Okay, good. It only gave me 200 characters, anyway.

344
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:33.280
Renata: Yeah.

345
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.598
P6: You have to be rather terse to fill that in.

346
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.070
P6: Oh, my, gosh, okay.

347
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.336
P6: Oh, good. We're on 5 of 6.

348
00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.530
P6: Yep.

349
00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:53.550
P6: Okay.

350
00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.000
P6: I'll just pick something here.

351
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:16.831
Renata: Seems like you're a pro at uploading backs and fronts of insurance cards. You know exactly what you're doing.

352
00:37:17.694 --> 00:37:19.445
P6: Yeah, I do.

353
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:38.049
Renata: All right. I'm going to stop you here before we go any further. So I'm going to ask that scale question again on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to fill out the Medicare and Health insurance section of this form.

354
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:43.250
P6: I would, I would say, very easy.

355
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:49.710
P6: based on the fact that if I were entering real information

356
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:56.950
P6: I wouldn't get confused, you know, as you said, the the fake people and all that kind of stuff it it just

357
00:37:57.050 --> 00:38:00.929
P6: confuses me a little bit. I'd give it a 5. It was pretty easy to fill out.

358
00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:10.970
Renata: Okay, good to know so I'm gonna have you click no, on that question about other health insurance to report.

359
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:11.390
P6: Okay.

360
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:28.619
Renata: And click continue, this is going to be the last. We're not actually going to submit the application today. This will be the last page that we look at. But I'd like you to just review the application for Champ benefits that you just filled out for your spouse and dependent, and let me know your thoughts.

361
00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:46.510
P6: You want me just to look at that one and not the others.

362
00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:51.279
Renata: You can look at the whole application before you on this page.

363
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.040
P6: OK.

364
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.390
P6: Okay, pretty straightforward.

365
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:43.400
Renata: Okay

366
00:39:44.065 --> 00:39:54.730
Renata: So I think you already mentioned this. But let's say that you accidentally input your husband's you know, middle name wrong. How would you fix that on this page?

367
00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.899
P6: Oh, let me see.

368
00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:08.659
P6: go to the under the applicant information review your applicants. I find his and then click on the edit button.

369
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:27.400
Renata: Okay, no, but you don't have to click on it. We'll stay on this page. So we're not gonna submit the form like I said before, but if you were to submit it today, what would you expect to happen next after you clicked that submit form button.

370
00:40:31.327 --> 00:40:38.889
P6: That everything would that I would get a confirmation that it was sent to whomever receives it

371
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.480
P6: on the on the website.

372
00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:51.650
Renata: Okay. And are you expecting that confirmation to just be a page on the on va.gov, an email, a text message, a a letter that's mailed to you?

373
00:40:52.660 --> 00:41:00.189
P6: Oh, I honestly don't know. I would assume that if I were to click on the submit form

374
00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:06.779
P6: I'd get something that came up on screen that says, Thank you for submitting your application. Blah blah

375
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.050
P6: And I did not see.

376
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:17.919
P6: I didn't notice any place else where it said I would get an email unless I requested it.

377
00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.840
P6: So I'm assuming that

378
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:27.980
P6: it would say in if I were to click on submit form. It would tell me.

379
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:36.750
P6: Thank you, whatever. We will send you an email to blah blah your address, etc. And

380
00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.420
P6: however long it takes to review the application

381
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:45.529
P6: process, and then I'd get some kind of a notification.

382
00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:55.899
Renata: Got it. That leads into my next question your response there. But how soon would you expect to be notified about actions taken on your Champs application.

383
00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.909
P6: Well, we're dealing with the with the VA here

384
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:10.139
P6: I have no idea I would just it could be

385
00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:14.750
P6: several weeks, and perhaps they would

386
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.619
P6: say that in the next page, if I were to click on submit form.

387
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:26.249
P6: Please expect to hear from us within the next 30 days, or whatever.

388
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:32.590
P6: So I have no idea how long it it would take for them to review the application.

389
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:42.229
Renata: Okay. And I know we're dealing with the VA here. But in an ideal world, how quickly would you want to hear about action taken on your application?

390
00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:44.739
P6: I would hope

391
00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.380
P6: Well, I have.

392
00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:57.819
P6: But my Medicare community provider out here

393
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:09.070
P6: they are the fastest that I've seen, you know if you get X-rays or, for example, I had a [procedure]. I got the test results today

394
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:14.080
P6: they're they're absolutely amazing.

395
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:23.400
P6: I would think but a couple weeks.

396
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.780
Renata: Okay.

397
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:34.280
P6: But I understand with, you know, everything that's going on with cutbacks and people leaving, and all that kind of stuff that it might take longer

398
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:41.090
P6: as long as I were given some

399
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:46.160
P6: amount of time to expect. You know.

400
00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:54.160
P6: if you haven't heard from us within the next, let's say 30 days.

401
00:43:54.670 --> 00:44:00.640
P6: I would hope to hear sooner, you know, within let's say 2 weeks to be fair

402
00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:11.740
P6: but that if I haven't heard within that period of time that I have some recourse as far as contacting them and getting some kind of a follow up response.

403
00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.050
Renata: Okay.

404
00:44:13.512 --> 00:44:30.160
Renata: and back to that real world scenario. So I know I just asked you in an ideal world what you'd want and you mentioned a lot of the the current sort of way that things work at Va, so would you expect to receive updates on your application as it's being processed?

405
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:33.820
P6: No.

406
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:48.399
Renata: Got it. So I'm gonna ask you that 1 to 5 scale one last time here. So 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits.

407
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.310
P6: It was, it was easy, so it's 5. I'd give it 5.

408
00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:51.960
Renata: Okay.

409
00:44:52.420 --> 00:45:02.209
Renata: Alright. Well, we're done with the task portion of this. You can stop sharing your screen, and I just have a few more questions to ask you before we wrap up.

410
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:03.390
P6: Okay.

411
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:10.039
Renata: Alright. So overall was there anything you saw in this session today that worked well for you?

412
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:28.659
P6: the the pages, as I said previously, the white background with the black print or the blueprint, is easy to read, and there's not an overload of information on each page. So I like that.

413
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:32.280
P6: and everything that I read was straightforward.

414
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:45.650
P6: So I I appreciate that if if there's if there's too much going on on a page. I just find it very intrusive as far as trying to hold my

415
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:49.939
P6: my attention span, so that so it was pretty easy.

416
00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:58.350
Renata: Okay, thank you. Was there anything, unclear, or that did not work well for you that you saw in today's session?

417
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:05.509
P6: Again. I think if if I were filling this out

418
00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:14.010
P6: legitimately and not as a a test product, I think it was straightforward.

419
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:29.500
P6: I would have been able to do it. You know, everything was was simple enough, and again there were no long statements where I would possibly lose focus on it. It was straightforward questions.

420
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:43.940
Renata: Okay. So now, having completed the form and knowing what you know, it asks you, is there any more information you would provide to veterans upfront on that 1st page about what they need in order to fill it out.

421
00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:53.500
P6: No, because it. If I remember correctly it it was listed on there what documents

422
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.670
P6: would be required to fill out the form.

423
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:59.529
P6: and that was, that was, that was easy.

424
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:08.449
Renata: All right. And last question here, what are your thoughts about the amount of information that was provided in this form?

425
00:47:10.589 --> 00:47:12.929
Renata: Not enough, just right, too much.

426
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:17.450
P6: No, no, it was. It was good, it was. It was pretty straightforward.

427
00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:18.200
Renata: Okay.

428
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.099
P6: It was easy easy to read, and

429
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:26.774
P6: the you know, and uploading stuff wasn't a piece of cake.

430
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:31.819
Renata: Do you have any questions for me before we close out.

431
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:41.509
P6: What's the what's the what's the goal of this particular project?

432
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:47.040
P6: Just to see how people are comfortable with the page.

433
00:47:48.030 --> 00:48:02.449
Renata: Yeah. So this form is live. A version of this form is already live on va.gov, and we, the team has made some improvements to it recently. And we wanna make sure that the improvements we've made 

434
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:10.020
Renata: we get veteran and veteran family members' input make sure that it. It really does improve things. So.

435
00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:20.520
P6: Okay, yeah, this this was. This was easy to use. It's, I think, my comments earlier about the va.gov as far as MyHealtheVet

436
00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:27.679
P6: is, you know I've I've had veterans benefits for 11 years.

437
00:48:29.001 --> 00:48:31.809
P6: They didn't give them to me for 25 years.

438
00:48:32.774 --> 00:48:39.870
P6: And so I was used to the old format, and then they changed it.

439
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:43.090
P6: So look something similar to this.

440
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:54.210
P6: but they removed a lot of stuff that what used to be available that is no longer there, and

441
00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:58.160
P6: I don't know who made that decision. But that's a different story. So.

442
00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:09.630
Renata: Well, I again, I'm I'm sorry that that's been a frustrating experience, but we really appreciate the feedback, and we'll be sure to let folks know who work on that experience. So thank you.

443
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:11.380
P6: Okay all right.

444
00:49:12.094 --> 00:49:18.960
Renata: I just wanna circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?

445
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.080
P6: Yeah, that's fine.

446
00:49:20.606 --> 00:49:24.630
Renata: And is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip.

447
00:49:25.911 --> 00:49:28.620
P6: No, no, I'm comfortable with everything.

448
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:44.299
Renata: Alright. Well, P6, we really appreciate you taking time out of your day to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is super helpful as we continue to work on the site and making sure it really works for veterans. Yeah.

449
00:49:44.535 --> 00:50:01.040
Renata: so Paragean is going to be sending you a thank you. Note, and in it there's going to be a little blurb. You can pass along to any other veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies like this one. With that. Thank you so much. Again. Enjoy the rest of your day and your week, and please take care! Thank you again.

450
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.270
P6: Thanks you as well. Alright, alright, bye.
