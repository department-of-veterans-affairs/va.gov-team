1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Renata: Let me find

2
00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:10.499
Renata: alright the recording button I have started the recording I'd like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.250
P18: Go ahead!

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:21.319
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that could be used to identify you?

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.270
P18: That's fine!

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:35.370
Renata: All right. Thank you so much, and we'll get started now. So a few questions for you before we look at that demo tool I mentioned before. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program?

7
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.729
P18: No, I haven't.

8
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.840
Renata: Okay, and do you intend to apply for CHAMPVA benefits in the future?

9
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.549
P18: I don't know if I qualify for it.

10
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.680
Renata: Okay, in your own words. What do you know what

11
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.899
Renata: what, what is your understanding of what the eligibility criteria is?

12
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.839
P18: I know you told me before, but I don't recall what it was.

13
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.589
Renata: Okay, that's totally fair. Like, I said, we're not testing knowledge or abilities.

14
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.500
Renata: do you have a va.gov account?

15
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.479
P18: Yes, I do.

16
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.910
Renata: Okay. And what has been your experience with logging into the site?

17
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.330
P18: It's been pretty simple except for the authentication process of getting a notification on my phone.

18
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.139
P18: Asked me if I logged into the website and clicked yes or no.

19
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.544
P18: And that's it. It goes to

20
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.366
P18: I don't even have to type in my username and pass because it goes to

21
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.550
P18: one option to log in is through Google. So it knows that I have

22
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.559
P18: save my Google password or username. And and so it does that.

23
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.735
Renata: Okay

24
00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.039
Renata: And how often and for what tasks are you logging into va.gov?

25
00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:57.030
P18: Tasks? My task is check my va appointments with the

26
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.750
P18: with the hospital, check my benefits. Payments.

27
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:13.510
P18: Sign in to enroll my children. There are eligible for dependent educational benefits

28
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.240
P18: which I'm in the process of doing right now.

29
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.840
P18: Oh, check my claim status, check my previous claims

30
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.110
P18: get VA letters and documents online.

31
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:36.460
P18: get my DD214 form. But actually, it doesn't come from them. I Googled it. It brings me back to the office of some

32
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.280
P18: other agency. But yeah.

33
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.419
Renata: Got it. So how often would you say, are you logging in on average?

34
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.870
P18: At least

35
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:56.300
P18: twice a week sometimes just once a week, but only to see if I have, you know payment coming and

36
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.800
P18: check my schedule, make them a new appointment for

37
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.230
P18: up you know, like a doctor at the hospital, and such.

38
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:25.970
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. And you mentioned when you signed up for this session that you use assistive technology to help you when you're when you're using like a a browser or a a web based device. What assistive technology are you currently using?

39
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.569
P18: Well, I have, like

40
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.720
P18: my vision. Is not that great? So sometimes the letter is kind of small, so if it's too small, I just use my iphone to

41
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.780
P18: to zoom

42
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.180
P18: to magnify it. Let's say I go go my phone and I go zoom zoom into some letters. If it's too small.

43
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.689
Renata: Okay, so you're like pinching the screen bigger.

44
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
P18: Using- using this type of thing and just

45
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.629
P18: aiming it onto the screen and to see it.

46
00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:05.729
Renata: Got it, and with a a desktop or or laptop computer like you're on right now, are you using any magnification to see things as well?

47
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.810
P18: Oh, yeah I don't know how that I think there's an option to on the on one of the browsers. You could

48
00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:19.209
P18: click on a hamburger option, and it shows a zoom in and out function.

49
00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.830
P18: I've done that as well.

50
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.050
Renata: Okay.

51
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.610
P18: Yeah.

52
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.779
Renata: All right. So you're you're increasing the the size of the text in order to read it?

53
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.860
P18: Correct, correct.

54
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:40.620
Renata: Okay, and how would you rate your level of experience with using a a screen magnifier? Or is that a beginner, or intermediate or advanced, expert?

55
00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:52.854
P18: Well, like I told you, there's 2 options to to do the magnify whether I use my phone to do so, or I've

56
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.910
P18: increase the text size from the browser. I guess.

57
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.059
P18: I have decent knowledge from one to 5. I guess it would be a 4/5 being expert.

58
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.180
Renata: So you'd say, maybe advanced at this point, then?

59
00:05:10.374 --> 00:05:14.590
P18: I don't think there's much to it from my experience.

60
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.670
Renata: Thank you.

61
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.410
P18: So I kind of know how the make the screen lettering bigger.

62
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.355
Renata: Okay.

63
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.569
Renata: And how long have you been magnifying your the text on your devices?

64
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.169
P18: Oh, for the last 2 years or so.

65
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.869
Renata: Okay. And have you ever had to share your screen in zoom while using the magnification before?

66
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.439
P18: I know how to share my screen on zoom. But

67
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.050
P18: yeah, that's is that what you asked me?

68
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.520
Renata: Well, sharing screen and zoom, while also magnifying like making the text bigger. Have you ever done that before?

69
00:05:55.743 --> 00:05:57.309
P18: Nobody's asked me to do so. No.

70
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:04.800
Renata: Okay, that's no problem we can. We can totally support with that. Is there anything else we can do to support you during today's session?

71
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.759
P18: I go with the flow.

72
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:28.210
Renata: Alright, okay, sounds good. So at this point we're gonna look at that coded prototype that I talked about earlier. So I'm gonna be sharing a link in the zoom chat at this point. I'd like you to open your browser. Make sure you have any notifications. Silence, and let me know when you're ready for that link, and I'll drop it in the chat.

73
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.928
P18: But when I open a browser you want me to go to

74
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.799
P18: the VA website or or not?

75
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.359
Renata: I'm going to share a special link with you. So you don't need to go to the Va website.

76
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.120
P18: Okay, go ahead.

77
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:49.109
Renata: Alright, and if you need any assistance we can help you. Troubleshoot getting zoom screen share. Set up.

78
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.310
P18: Okay, copy the link you provided to me. Right?

79
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.600
Renata: Yeah, you can click on it and open it in your browser.

80
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:58.570
P18: I'm kind of using Firefox.

81
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.990
Renata: Okay.

82
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.829
P18: Okay, I launched the page that you provided to me, and you want me to share my screen with you?

83
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.330
Renata: Yes, please.

84
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:33.459
P18: Says, content only screens entire screen. I believe it is.

85
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.170
P18: Let's see if this is correct.

86
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.949
Renata: All right. We can see it.

87
00:07:43.202 --> 00:07:56.630
Renata: You can go ahead and close that little blue box at the top that says, Site maintenance. Are you able to see everything on this page comfortably, or do you need help with increasing the magnification before we go any further?

88
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.640
P18: Yeah, I normally hit this.

89
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.709
P18: Well, I have all the

90
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:15.489
P18: so I have this whole task bar on the top. Here. Do I want to get rid of it.

91
00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:20.219
Renata: That one that says site maintenance. You can go ahead and click the X.

92
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.020
P18: Site.

93
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.520
Renata: In the right corner.

94
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.230
P18: Okay.

95
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:50.730
Renata: Yeah, that's fine. Alright, if at any point the magnification is not where you want it at and need assistance with it. Just go ahead and let us know. I wanna make sure that the page what you're looking at is readable to you and a comfortable magnification for reading we don't want you to be struggling to look at anything at any point, so just let us know, and we'll troubleshoot that at any point during the session today.

96
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.140
P18: Are you seeing my screen? I have this bar

97
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.770
P18: or do you see my screen?

98
00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.680
Renata: I can see your screen. What does the bar look like?

99
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.770
P18: It says, audio video participants. You don't see what I'm seeing?

100
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.310
Renata: I don't see that, that's probably part of the zoom. Is there a way for you to

101
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.369
Renata: hide it?

102
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.849
P18: Yeah, yeah. I got it

103
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.779
Renata: If you can hide it without quitting zoom...

104
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:30.900
Renata: Okay, so just a few things before we start looking at the page in front of you. Like, I said before, this is our testing site. So you don't have to worry about the information that you enter going anywhere. Nothing you click in this form will have any bearing on your VA Benefits

105
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:47.430
Renata: as we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, such as social security numbers, if you don't want to use real information. There may be a few places in this form where you're asked to upload documents, as we're not submitting the form, and it's not attached to your benefits.

106
00:09:47.430 --> 00:10:07.769
Renata: Nothing you upload there will be sent to the VA. When we get to those screens that ask for a file upload. I can provide a sample Pdf for you to use, or you could use something random from your desktop. You don't have to make a decision on that yet. I'll stop you when we get to those pages and ask the question again when the time comes. Any questions for me?

107
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.390
P18: No.

108
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:18.250
Renata: All right. You can go ahead and scroll on this page, but no clicking on anything yet. I'd just like you to take a look through the information and let us know your initial thoughts.

109
00:10:19.358 --> 00:10:21.392
P18: Yeah, this is the typical

110
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.030
P18: pages from VA. It tells you

111
00:10:25.648 --> 00:10:32.910
P18: eligibility criterias. And then then it tells you about qualifications, I guess

112
00:10:33.578 --> 00:10:40.219
P18: and then start an application. I just like to get right to it, and we'll sign in. And

113
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.330
P18: there's a some type of online application process.

114
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:50.250
P18: So I don't see it here. But maybe it's

115
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.599
P18: have to find out if you're eligible first.

116
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:58.450
P18: But in other pages I normally see a like a blue little

117
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.400
P18: squares all apply here so and so.

118
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:11.520
Renata: Okay. What sorts of pages are you seeing that on that the little apply for the blue boxes is apply for so and so?

119
00:11:12.185 --> 00:11:18.049
P18: What type of forms would I see? See this type of thing? Is that what you're asking me.

120
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.449
Renata: Yeah, where have you seen that on va.gov before?

121
00:11:22.035 --> 00:11:23.205
P18: A particular

122
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:30.500
P18: There's something called dependent eligibility assistance program. Chapter 35.

123
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.042
P18: That has that.

124
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.645
P18: Also.

125
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:41.926
P18: there's a way to message the VA, And well, that doesn't involve anything about filling out form. But

126
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:50.330
P18: yeah, the last I know is like I told you, it's a dependent eligibility online form.

127
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:58.669
Renata: Okay, got it. And typically, if you were filling a form out on va.gov, would you sign in in order to fill the form out?

128
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.819
P18: Yes, I would.

129
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:09.309
Renata: Okay. So a few questions for you about the content on this page. Do you know, if you're on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

130
00:12:11.624 --> 00:12:16.309
P18: Well, I have to click on eligibility and check if I'm eligible for it.

131
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:25.999
Renata: Okay, like I said, we're not gonna click on anything today. But we like to know where you'd go. If you scroll back up a little ways.

132
00:12:26.604 --> 00:12:40.790
Renata: You'll see above where it says, "Apply for CHAMPVA benefits" there's 3 links, one says, "va.gov home," "Lvc champva," and then one says "1010d Extended." What if anything does 1010 d Extended mean to you?

133
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.950
P18: Nothing. I'm not even familiar with what that is.

134
00:12:44.230 --> 00:13:01.510
Renata: Okay, totally fair. So if you were on va.gov, filling out this form for, say, a spouse and dependents today, what research would you do before starting the application for CHAMPVA benefits?

135
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.460
P18: Oh.

136
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:14.290
P18: I would. Well, I mean, I've used Google as well. But I type it in Google. And I would type in

137
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:21.140
P18: "eligibility criterias for CHAMPVA benefits for the VA" or something, and

138
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.689
P18: eventually leads me back to the VA Website. But it also has some.

139
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:32.539
P18: I think they have this Gemini AI type of stuff that gives you some random.

140
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.589
P18: some pertinent and or non-pertinent information.

141
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.907
P18: I don't know if that's why you're asking me. But

142
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:53.040
Renata: Oh, yeah, I mean, we're. I'm just curious, like when you're researching a new benefit for yourself or for your your family members for the VA. Like. What sorts of research do you do before you sort of send the form out?

143
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.270
P18: If I didn't find a correct, or if I don't have the

144
00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:04.459
P18: if I don't have, if I didn't find exact information or something that was clear to me here, like I said, I would use Google platform to.

145
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.159
P18: you know, type in a question or so, and see what it comes up with.

146
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:19.759
Renata: Okay. And you like to check that Gemini, like AI summary at the top of the Google Search page to see if if you're like heading in the right direction? Or.

147
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:27.110
P18: Right when I use Google, that's the 1st thing it gives you the top summary thing and things from Gemini AI.

148
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:35.229
Renata: Okay. And have you, has that been useful in the past? When you've been looking for eligibility, information about VA benefits and services.

149
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.230
P18: Yeah, it's been pretty helpful.

150
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.760
Renata: Okay, got it. So how

151
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:48.279
Renata: from this page would you check eligibility for CHAMPVA benefits for your spouse or dependents?

152
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:53.030
P18: I would have, I would have clicked this link right here. That's what I would have done.

153
00:14:53.220 --> 00:15:09.240
Renata: Okay. And I know it's tantalizing. But we're not going to click on the link today. Bbased on the information on this page, what information do you think you'll need to fill out in this application for CHAMPVA benefits for your spouse or dependents?

154
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:16.430
P18: Well, it needs my personal information. It needs my social security number, my date of birth and my

155
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:22.893
P18: my phone number home address copies of

156
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:32.900
P18: health insurance cards. Proof of enrollment documents from from my spouse, documents from

157
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:39.233
P18: for my children. I guess birth certificates be able to upload those

158
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:46.460
P18: and maybe like, if I was married it'd be marriage certificate and such.

159
00:15:46.950 --> 00:16:00.300
Renata: Okay. And if you were filling this out on va.gov for real today, would you have all of that information on hand, or would you need to pause and go collect that information before starting the application?

160
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:07.610
P18: I probably wouldn't have this information handy. I would have to go dig that up. Yeah.

161
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:18.099
Renata: Okay. And is that gonna take a while or like, is that something where, like you, you know where all of it is? And you could just go like quickly, just out of curiosity?

162
00:16:19.017 --> 00:16:24.730
P18: I know I have my son's birthday handy which is on paper format at home.

163
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:32.649
P18: Oh, well, I'm not actually married right now I have a domestic partnership. So

164
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.268
P18: so it's not applicable in that regard.

165
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:56.790
Renata: Got it. One last question for you before we start digging into the application itself on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin? Based on this page's content.

166
00:16:59.767 --> 00:17:03.270
P18: 1 to 5. You said right?

167
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.750
Renata: Yeah, 1 being poor and 5 being very well.

168
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:13.739
P18: Well, I feel, 4. Confident it tells me what I need to have so hopefully. That's what I need.

169
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:19.799
Renata: Okay, got it. And what would take it from that 4 to a 5 in your mind?

170
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:30.919
P18: Have more detail about what the next process is. And I just I just

171
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.199
P18: I just I just feel maybe it's a 4 instead of a 5. I don't know.

172
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:51.190
Renata: Okay, that's totally fair. So at this point I'd like you to scroll down a little bit. In that blue box below where it says, sign in or create an account. There's a link that says, Start your form without signing in if you would go ahead and click on that for me, please.

173
00:17:52.610 --> 00:18:10.369
Renata: Okay, so before you start filling this out, I'm going to give you the scenario that we're going to be using today. I'm going to ask you to start filling the form out as though you were applying for a spouse and one other family member like a dependent child.

174
00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:36.969
Renata: I'll let you know when to pause, and we're gonna answer some questions. But to help orient you, we're gonna fill out the 1st 3 sections of the form roughly, just a few things to keep in mind here. As I said before, this is our testing site. You don't have to worry about information going anywhere, and you can use fake information for sensitive questions. And as you go through the form, please think out loud. We'd like to hear any reactions you're having as you're experiencing them. And with that

175
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.210
Renata: go ahead.

176
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:48.259
P18: She told me I was applying for benefits for my spouse or dependent, so me as a veteran. I'm the veteran here. I'm applying for benefits, for spouse and dependent. So it's pretty

177
00:18:48.370 --> 00:19:06.770
P18: straightforward. I would click on. Continue, enter my information here, you know, and click on, continue interim

178
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.730
P18: addresses.

179
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:30.090
P18: Let me continue with this until I get to a particular point?

180
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:35.140
Renata: Yeah, I'll let you know when we're gonna stop so you can just keep going. At this point.

181
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.810
P18: And then it asked it asked me for my personal information. Now it's gonna ask me for

182
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.090
P18: Address.

183
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:12.070
P18: "We'll use your sponsor's name" the sponsor is me, I'm gonna guess sure which is the same as myself.

184
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:21.839
P18: I get lost here, I think, in the beginning asked for me to fill out my personal information. Then it says something about the sponsors information which is

185
00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.080
P18: the same person. I'm gonna guess.

186
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:48.650
Renata: Our yeah. Our test system's a little annoying. Okay, it let you through. Sometimes it doesn't let fake socials through. If they're they're too repetitive. But anything confusing here.

187
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.999
P18: Well, I said, in the beginning I asked for my information, and then they asked me, for

188
00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.570
P18: the sponsor was just the same person as myself, so

189
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.560
P18: If I'm not mistaken. The sponsor and myself are the same person.

190
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.740
Renata: Okay, got it

191
00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:15.540
P18: But then this is applicant information, the applicant would be, I'm a

192
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.629
P18: oh, am I the applicant? Just.

193
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.150
Renata: I'm gonna

194
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:31.800
Renata: a little annoying and answer your question with another question, based on the information that you're seeing in this form. What do you think? Do you think that you're the applicant or.

195
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.400
P18: Oh, well, 

196
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:39.610
P18: I'm doing it for my spouse and children, if not mistaken

197
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.110
P18: for the purpose of this task. Right?

198
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.130
Renata: That's right. That's the task. Yeah.

199
00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.120
P18: Okay. Then the applicant would be my spouse.

200
00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:50.970
Renata: Okay.

201
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:51.600
P18: That was.

202
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.040
Renata: Well, let's try that and see.

203
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.060
P18: Hmm.

204
00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.450
Renata: Like I said, let's try that and see.

205
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.940
P18: Okay,

206
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.909
P18: phone number is, you want me to put something into there?

207
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.140
Renata: Yeah.

208
00:22:37.432 --> 00:22:41.820
Renata: Yeah, you can put any like, I said. You can use fake information for this.

209
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:53.850
Renata: If you were filling this out for your domestic partner. Would you put your contact information there, or your partner's contact information just out of curiosity?

210
00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:01.030
P18: I would still put the applicant being my domestic partner, I'll put my domestic partners information there.

211
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.549
Renata: Okay, got it

212
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:10.279
P18: Oh, what's interesting. Well, I don't know if this is part of your research, but the 

213
00:23:10.831 --> 00:23:18.509
P18: domestic partnership is relative is relevant per State law. So each State has their own laws about

214
00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:24.950
P18: well, particularly the VA. And those that does not recognize the domestic partnerships.

215
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.539
P18: But that's beyond the realm of this study.

216
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.129
Renata: That's interesting. Thank you for sharing that. I wasn't aware.

217
00:23:44.796 --> 00:23:48.809
P18: do you want me to add a child, or I don't necessarily need to?

218
00:23:49.627 --> 00:23:54.549
Renata: Yes, if you could add one dependent child for me for the purposes of today's session.

219
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.324
P18: Okay.

220
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:33.440
P18: yeah. These forms are pretty repetitive, and I've seen it all. It's pretty routine.

221
00:24:34.234 --> 00:24:40.050
Renata: So, so, nothing standing out to you as unusual or or unexpected?

222
00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:44.620
P18: Oh, no, no, it's the same repetition.

223
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.770
Renata: Okay.

224
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:52.449
P18: But yeah, I recall filling out forms of this nature.

225
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.050
Renata: Got it.

226
00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.539
P18: This is tedious, but they need it

227
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.320
P18: upload proof of school enrollment.

228
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.850
P18: Upload file.

229
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.090
P18: Hmm!

230
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.760
Renata: So what is this page asking you to provide?

231
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.259
P18: Proof of him being in school.

232
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:39.540
Renata: Okay. And you mentioned that you you've been in the process of applying for education benefits for your dependents. Have you had to request anything like this from your children's schools, so far?

233
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.331
P18: Yeah, I'm in the process of doing that.

234
00:25:42.910 --> 00:26:02.980
Renata: Okay. So if you were filling this out for real on va.gov today, would you have a copy of the enrollment, like a certification of enrollment or a letter of enrollment? Or would you need to stop at this point and contact the school and say, "Hey, I need this letter"?

235
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.956
P18: Well, in my case.

236
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:14.540
P18: I just have to fill out a form and write down which school that my child is going to school at.

237
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.010
P18: and

238
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:24.619
P18: and they would verify with the school to see if that my child's in school I didn't have to, if not mistaken.

239
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:29.180
P18: upload the school certification.

240
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:34.289
P18: but I just have to write down what school they were going to, and when they were going to school.

241
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:52.240
Renata: Okay, got it. So like, I said, at the beginning of the this portion of the the session, I can provide you with a dummy Pdf with some some fake content in it to upload here, or, if you have like a random photo, you can also upload that. What would you prefer to do?

242
00:26:53.229 --> 00:26:56.939
P18: Well, whatever form you want me to upload, send it to me.

243
00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:01.830
Renata: Okay, I'm gonna attach a file in the chat.

244
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.860
P18: Okay.

245
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:25.488
Renata: So you should be able to from the zoom chat. There's a 3 buttons inside the chat that. If you mouse over it says more. One of the options when you click more should be to save the file.

246
00:27:26.134 --> 00:27:33.100
Renata: If you can go ahead and save it and just name it whatever you want, and then you should be able to upload it. When you go back to the browser.

247
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.670
P18: Are you not seeing what I'm seeing?

248
00:27:42.011 --> 00:27:49.078
Renata: No, if you click back into zoom, we can't see your zoom, but we can see your browser where you're on the the upload page.

249
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.030
P18: Oh, wow! Okay. I wasn't sure what you see.

250
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.910
P18: You can't see the files I have on my computer.

251
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.798
Renata: We can see the that it's open.

252
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.128
P18: Oh, I got you.

253
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:07.620
P18: Okay school enrollment form.

254
00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:14.460
P18: Well, it's a enrollment letter or school enrollment form. It's 1 of those 2.

255
00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:20.039
Renata: Yeah, I mean, do you know the difference between the 2 based on what you've seen on this page?

256
00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:28.039
P18: School enrollment certification. One is a school that signed off that he's going to school.

257
00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:33.699
P18: The other one is just a form that's not signed.

258
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:38.218
P18: That shows, like classes, that the the students enrolled in.

259
00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:46.339
Renata: Okay. Well, for the purposes of today, it's a fake doc, so you can put it as whichever go ahead and click continue.

260
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.630
P18: I had to upload a file or did that already, I don't remember, actually did.

261
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.580
P18: And then click on. It's been uploaded, so

262
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.549
P18: I don't have to upload another file. Just click, continue. It will know that.

263
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:17.269
Renata: Alright. So I'm gonna stop you here before we go any further. So on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this 1st section of the form?

264
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:22.693
P18: It's repetitive. It's easy it's 5. It just

265
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:27.269
P18: It's more tedious and been hard to do.

266
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:33.159
Renata: Okay, what would make it feel less tedious or repetitive in your mind?

267
00:29:36.215 --> 00:29:45.880
P18: Well, if I could do all 3 of my

268
00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:54.770
P18: If I could do side by side myself as a sponsor, the spouse and the child

269
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.790
P18: in the same page, and then be able to click

270
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:08.850
P18: and fill out the form in 1 shot and one page, rather than go to each section individually.

271
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:20.520
Renata: Okay. So having all of that content on the same page, instead of having to click through and see some screens, multiple times, is that correct?

272
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.730
P18: Yeah, I mean, I could. Yeah, I should be able to do that because, oh.

273
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.959
P18: the content information. It's also there for all 3.

274
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:34.730
P18: Yeah, and the social security numbers are for 3 people.

275
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:45.649
Renata: Got it. Thank you for that, so you can go ahead and click. No to that question do you have another applicant to add, and then click, continue

276
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:57.449
Renata: so before we keep going. With the form. I'd just like you to take a look at this page and let me know. What if anything stands out to you.

277
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:02.830
P18: Something about Medicare.

278
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.650
Renata: Okay. So this this page is asking you for Medicare information?

279
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:13.310
P18: Yeah, it asked me if I have 

280
00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:15.580
P18: any type of support from Medicare.

281
00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:33.249
Renata: Okay, and if you could scroll all the way up to the top for a moment, please. Next to the Va Logo, it says "1010d Extended CHAMPVA Application (includes 10-7959c)". What do those numbers, if anything, mean to you?

282
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.770
P18: Nothing doesn't mean anything to me.

283
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:48.390
Renata: Okay, that's fair thinking back to that 1st page that we looked at and the information on it. Why is the form asking you for Medicare information?

284
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.439
P18: Ask me that question again.

285
00:31:52.870 --> 00:32:01.670
Renata: Yeah. Thinking back to the 1st page that you saw. Why is the form asking you for information about Medicare?

286
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:10.179
P18: I don't remember what the 1st page said, but Medicare would mean that if I have Medicare

287
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:18.620
P18: you, you shouldn't be qualified to get additional support, because it's either one thing or the other. You you

288
00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:22.829
P18: can't get help from 2 different sources for the same purpose.

289
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:23.900
P18: I'm thinking.

290
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:48.440
Renata: Okay, got it. I like, I said, we're not testing knowledge or ability. So we're just asking like, if what you can remember, if anything. So if you got to this point in the form and it was asking for Medicare and other health insurance information, would you have health insurance cards and stuff on hand, or would you need to stop and and go find those again?

291
00:32:50.169 --> 00:32:55.389
P18: For my spouse. Yes, for my child. Yes.

292
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.250
P18: for me. I don't cause I don't.

293
00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.260
P18: I'm supported by the VA.

294
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.540
Renata: Okay.

295
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:25.139
Renata: got it. Thank you for the purposes of today's study. I'd like you to imagine that both your spouse and your dependent child have both Medicare and private health insurance. So I'm going to have you go ahead and fill out this next section for Medicare and Private Health insurance for both of those family members, and I'll stop you at the end of this section. We'll

296
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.620
Renata: chat again.

297
00:33:30.323 --> 00:33:35.309
P18: I don't remember. I guess it could be any of the Medicare. I don't know which one.

298
00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.339
Renata: You can just pick whichever one speaks to you. It doesn't matter, at this point.

299
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:40.210
P18: Hmm

300
00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:52.199
P18: effective date part being. It's the same thing

301
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.660
P18: I'd have to get it, but

302
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:13.560
Renata: Oh, I was gonna say for this one, you can once again just use the the dummy file that I gave you.

303
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:35.470
P18: It's not working right for some reason, but just hung up.

304
00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:37.839
Renata: Oh, interesting!

305
00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:41.379
P18: But this is a a fake platform right?

306
00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.465
Renata: Yeah, so there, there's gonna be some bugs in it.

307
00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:51.150
Renata: I wonder if could you click that back button next to continue.

308
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.179
Renata: and then maybe go back forward again. I wonder if we need to reload that page.

309
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.060
P18: No, it's it's not working.

310
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.240
Renata: Hmm.

311
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.830
P18: Do you have to get this going in order to put continue.

312
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:33.140
Renata: Yeah, maybe see if you can click continue if it'll let you go forward in the form?

313
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.020
P18: So I didn't upload another file. Here.

314
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.880
Renata: Oh, yeah, you can use the same one.

315
00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:55.139
P18: It won't move forward without the some type of upload which is not doing it.

316
00:35:56.123 --> 00:36:02.920
Renata: Okay, I might have to share my screen for us to go forward, because well.

317
00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.880
Renata: let me see.

318
00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:21.829
Renata: it looks like our dummy site is broken at the moment.

319
00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:22.995
P18: Oh!

320
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:32.614
Renata: That's an us problem. That's not anything that you did. So I think we're gonna have to call this session at this point.

321
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.050
Renata: unless

322
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:48.749
Renata: let me see if I can get a different version of the link up that we could look at.

323
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.257
P18: Oh, you're having the same issue with this?

324
00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.069
Renata: Yeah. When I tried to open it, it it told me that the whole thing is down.

325
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:11.910
Renata: I just wanna show you a couple more screens in the test environment. You can go ahead and stop sharing your screen. And I'm gonna show you a couple of things. And I'm just curious about to get your feedback on them.

326
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:35.929
Renata: just need a moment. Sorry about this. I guess our demo tool is having a case of the Mondays, so.

327
00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.039
P18: That's no big deal.

328
00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:57.920
Renata: Okay.

329
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:18.480
Renata: Alright. Can you see a mostly black screen that has a very narrow version of the va.gov Site on it?

330
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.689
P18: Yeah, I see it. I see it.

331
00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:30.785
Renata: Okay, I can scroll way in to make the font bigger. But this was the page that you were just on. I'm just in a different version of it. Stuff stuff that's in here is not going to be clickable.

332
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:32.900
Renata: But

333
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.209
Renata: let's see, I know this is breaking.

334
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:49.939
Renata: Okay, so we were at the point where you were uploading files here in this page.

335
00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.770
Renata: Why is this breaking?

336
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:07.189
Renata: No, this is breaking on my end.

337
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.140
Renata: Let me see if I can find.

338
00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.610
Renata: Just want you to look at one or 2 more screens.

339
00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.989
P18: Hmm. Okay. No problem.

340
00:39:41.370 --> 00:40:01.099
Renata: Okay, let's take a look at this screen. So let's imagine that we didn't have any bugs or issues with our our staging site. So you were able to add those Medicare and health insurance plans. This is what it would look like once you've added those any thoughts?

341
00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:07.460
Renata: feedback question comments about how it's presenting that information here?

342
00:40:08.521 --> 00:40:15.398
P18: As expected. It's got the effective date and end date, which is continuing

343
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.980
P18: policy members 1, 2, and 3,

344
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.100
P18: applicant 1, 2 and 3

345
00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:32.019
P18: well, technically, applicant, one would be myself, I believe. Applicant 2 is the

346
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.570
P18: spouse and applicant 3. Is this child? No,

347
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.389
P18: but technically well, in my case, applicant, one doesn't need the

348
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.749
P18: doesn't have health insurance through Medicaid.

349
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:45.670
Renata: Okay.

350
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.450
P18: Because he's already covered by the VA.

351
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:54.869
Renata: So in in your case it would just say, applicant 2 and 3, no applicant one here?

352
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:59.829
P18: Sounds. Yeah, sounds like that's what it would be. Because, it's only whoever has

353
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.060
P18: health insurance from external sources.

354
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:11.939
Renata: Okay. And would you expect to see health insurance and Medicaid plans? Medicare plans on the same page or on separate review pages?

355
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:14.480
P18: Same page.

356
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:18.619
Renata: Same page. Okay, got it. So

357
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:24.479
Renata: I'm gonna stop sharing my screen. And just I have a few more questions for you before we wrap up

358
00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:48.029
Renata: So I apologize for things going a little bit haywire, like I said. I think that our our Demos tool was having a case of the Mondays, happens to the best of us. So if you were to submit the form that you started filling out today, what would you expect to happen after you click the submit form or submit application, button?

359
00:41:49.180 --> 00:42:00.970
P18: Well, I seen it says, Well, I know, for seems to me when I apply for something I don't from the VA. There's no email confirmation that you apply for something that came through

360
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.219
P18: from my experience.

361
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:10.529
P18: Also, it's just as we see. But

362
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.539
P18: it'll be completed at the end.

363
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:18.660
P18: whereas if I sent a like a message to to the VA

364
00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:26.580
P18: I could see what I sent to them. But the point is, I'm saying there's not really a confirmation

365
00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.320
P18: email that says, "Oh, you applied for this, and you did this."

366
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.750
P18: I have not seen that from the VA. It just says at the end complete it.

367
00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.730
P18: And I find that to be.

368
00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.380
P18: Not that, not I don't like that. I just like that.

369
00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:42.790
P18: Yeah.

370
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:44.380
Renata: Okay, yeah.

371
00:42:44.740 --> 00:43:09.669
Renata: So I'm hearing a few things. One would be in an ideal world, you're gonna get an email that says "confirmed: you submitted the CHAMPVA 1010d application." I also heard you say, like, there's nothing really other than like, "Hey, you submitted this," would you want at that point, in addition to the email, like a copy of the application you just filled out, or what would, what in an ideal world would be the most support?

372
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:14.949
Renata: and make you feel confident that, like this went through and I know that that things are okay?

373
00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:20.480
P18: Well, I know at the end it will say, Oh, completed, and you click on. Maybe the blue

374
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:24.819
P18: button is all completed. But yeah, you're right about that.

375
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:30.719
P18: there should be a way to save a Pdf of what you what you input input it?

376
00:43:31.362 --> 00:43:33.939
P18: I haven't seen that before, like I said.

377
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:35.240
Renata: Okay.

378
00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.260
P18: From my knowledge.

379
00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:44.130
Renata: Do you ever screenshot the confirmation page or the review page, so that you have a a version saved to your records?

380
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.763
P18: I haven't done that

381
00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.559
P18: I haven't done that.

382
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:52.296
Renata: Okay, totally fair.

383
00:43:53.330 --> 00:44:00.129
Renata: and how soon would you expect to be notified about a decision being made on your application after you've submitted it?

384
00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.813
P18: How long would it take to get notified?

385
00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:12.540
Renata: Oh, no! A decision being made like about whether or not you're you've been approved for CHAMPVA benefits.

386
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.530
P18: Maybe 30 to 60 days.

387
00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:18.089
Renata: Okay, 30 to 60 days.

388
00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:28.199
Renata: okay, just a couple more questions for you, and then we'll wrap up overall. Was there anything that you saw in the session today that worked well for you?

389
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:35.490
P18: No, it's a routine that I'm familiar with. So I trust

390
00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:44.477
P18: it's pretty simplistic, the application process. It's it's a routine I've done. I've done before. It's repetitive.

391
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.360
P18: I'm sorry. What do you ask me? Is anything I felt good or bad about it?

392
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:54.219
Renata: Anything that you saw in the session that worked well for you.

393
00:44:55.044 --> 00:44:57.265
P18: If it didn't have that

394
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:05.579
P18: difficulty with the upload. And I've seen it happen as well. But the the website has gone down. I think it connects to some type of server

395
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:17.540
P18: so right? Or something like that. But it's it's it walks you through to each step. It tells you. You know what the criteria are, what what you need to have so

396
00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:29.184
P18: and but, like I said in the beginning, it should have be more detail about the CHAMPVA, what is I think you told me what it's for, but I still don't remember what it is. I have to look it up. But

397
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.409
P18: I don't think it. 

398
00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:38.499
P18: I'll look it up. I don't know if my spouse well, like, I said. She's not my spouse, but she's my

399
00:45:39.746 --> 00:45:40.879
P18: you know

400
00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:45.122
P18: Domestic partner and my child would qualify. I'll see if that's

401
00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:52.090
P18: I don't normally ask me that question. But yeah, it's it's pretty routine, I guess.

402
00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:52.610
Renata: Okay.

403
00:45:53.495 --> 00:46:10.914
Renata: and if you'd been on va.gov filling this out for real today, if you'd seen that error happen on the upload page. What would you have done at that point? Would you have, like saved the form? Quit the form called the Va hotline. Something else thrown your computer out the window like, what would you have done?

404
00:46:12.104 --> 00:46:14.650
P18: Okay, couple of things, you said.

405
00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:21.819
P18: I believe it [the form] saves what you left off at. I think it did that. I have had that problem

406
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.810
P18: but I wouldn't call them like, I know, that's an option. I like to make phone calls

407
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.979
P18: I could try to say again another time.

408
00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:39.570
P18: or I could message the VA. I said, Hey, this, I like to send a message there. The the thing I was filling out. It wasn't working.

409
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:53.839
P18: and I get a response back? There was a problem. Actually, I think I remember seeing this problem on the when I was requesting my DD214 there was a problem. And the the website was not working. But anyway, I was, I mean, sidetracked. But yeah.

410
00:46:54.244 --> 00:47:20.710
P18: I could log back in and continue with the though I don't know there's there should be a way to. I guess I would copy the Navigation bar and email myself. And then when I go back to the click, that link that email myself with that link. It should bring me back to the same page. That's the point I need to be able to bookmark where I left off at. And the only way I could think about doing that is to copy the Navigation bar

411
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:24.069
P18: and just email myself that link. And then

412
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:30.659
P18: maybe another day later, I'll click that link and hope it brings me back to where I left off at.

413
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:48.950
Renata: Okay, got it. So you kind of already alluded to this. But now that you know what the form is asking for, what additional information would you provide to veterans on that 1st page to let them know? Like, you're gonna you know what information is gonna be needed for the form?

414
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:51.630
P18: I'm sorry just to repeat that first part again.

415
00:47:52.010 --> 00:48:01.819
Renata: Yeah, no problem. So now that you've filled out the application, what additional information would you tell veterans that they're gonna need to have on hand on that 1st page?

416
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:09.000
P18: Have on hand birth certificates, health insurance paperwork handy

417
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:16.189
P18: Well, yeah, not. They don't require driver's license. But yeah, that's it

418
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:22.909
P18: birth certificates. It didn't ask for the birth certificate, either, but the health insurance documentation.

419
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:27.802
P18: But I don't know why would it? Because it didn't. It didn't ask you upload any

420
00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.020
P18: marriage or birth certificate information.

421
00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:35.069
Renata: Okay, and you were expecting it to ask that about folks?

422
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:45.230
P18: Oh, I think I would expect to upload, you know, marriage certificates or domestic partnership paperwork. They didn't ask for that.

423
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.100
Renata: Okay.

424
00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.409
P18: Not that I remember.

425
00:48:48.571 --> 00:48:53.239
Renata: And since it didn't ask for that stuff, do you still feel confident that, like

426
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:58.330
Renata: everything's gonna be okay when you submit the form, or or you know.

427
00:48:59.165 --> 00:49:06.680
P18: It's sometimes it just skips a step, and they

428
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:14.010
P18: it's they have something I feel like. They have a trust that the person implies is truthful.

429
00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:25.589
Renata: Okay, got it? Just a couple more questions for you. What are your thoughts about the amount of information in the form that you saw today: not enough, too much, just right?

430
00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:29.709
P18: In the form itself, or like the application process?

431
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:30.500
Renata: Yeah.

432
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:37.819
P18: Well, I'd like to get more information about the CHAMPVA

433
00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:45.299
P18: like what you described to me. I don't think it covers that until you click something. I wish it was just right there.

434
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.840
P18: On on the 1st page of the application process.

435
00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:54.430
Renata: Got it any questions for me before we wrap up?

436
00:49:55.340 --> 00:50:09.080
P18: No, and I just let my purging I not them, I finished. But like I said the one on the 1st page of the application process. I don't think it says the purpose of the CHAMPVA is to do this and do that. I don't think it says that.

437
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.180
Renata: No.

438
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.420
P18: Clear. It wasn't very clear right there.

439
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.870
Renata: Okay, got it

440
00:50:15.249 --> 00:50:22.250
Renata: So I just want to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of the session with our Va partners?

441
00:50:22.954 --> 00:50:32.640
Renata: And to remind you, we remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and we only share the videos with Va. Partners for the purposes of improving va.gov.

442
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:34.560
P18: Absolutely no problem.

443
00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:47.570
Renata: Okay. Well, with that, P18, we really appreciate you taking some time out of your day and your week to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is super helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans. So thank you.

444
00:50:47.570 --> 00:51:04.960
Renata: Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to any other veterans you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in future research studies. And with that, thank you again, have a great rest of your day and your week, and we really appreciate you taking the time to chat with us today.

445
00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.910
P18: Okay. Right now. Thank you. Have a good one.

446
00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:08.144
Renata: Alright, take care!
