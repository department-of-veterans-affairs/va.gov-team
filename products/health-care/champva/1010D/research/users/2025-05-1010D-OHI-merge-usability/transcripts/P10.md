1
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:10.050
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording, and I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.320
P10: Yes.

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:21.860
Renata: Alright. Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.580
P10: True.

5
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:33.969
Renata: Wonderful. So let's get cracking here. Got a few questions before we start playing around with our our prototype tool. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

6
00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:41.040
P10: Yes, we have, and I think I think my wife is

7
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.739
P10: eligible, and I think she's signed up. But we're not really sure how it works. So.

8
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.590
Renata: Okay, got it. Do you remember when you signed up by any chance?

9
00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.699
P10: I think I think within the last year, as I think is when they did it, my son and my wife

10
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.260
P10: worked on it, and I think my wife

11
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.399
P10: got some information. But I, to be perfectly honest, I'm unsure.

12
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:24.760
Renata: Okay, that's fair. And again, we're not testing knowledge or ability. So if you don't know, that's totally fine. But a couple of questions about that experience. Did anyone like a veteran service organization, a family member or friend, help your wife fill that application out.

13
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.980
P10: My son helped her fill it out.

14
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.630
Renata: Got it. Okay? So it sounds like both your son and and wife are enrolled in the program, or just just your wife.

15
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.880
P10: Just my wife.

16
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.265
Renata: Okay.

17
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:46.959
Renata: Do you know if your wife has ever submitted a form 10-7959c, otherwise known as the Cther Health Insurance Form?

18
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.480
P10: I don't. I don't know that, and she probably hasn't.

19
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.580
Renata: Okay?

20
00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:00.340
Renata: And when your wife filled the the application out, was it online on paper over the phone? By Fax.

21
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.959
P10: I believe it was online.

22
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.250
Renata: Okay, and do you know what her experience was like submitting it online on VA.gov.

23
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.600
P10: I don't, but it was. Probably it was probably decent.

24
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.750
Renata: Okay.

25
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.819
P10: Thing we've done with VA.gov has worked out.

26
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.629
Renata: Got it. Do you remember? If you had a mail or fax in any documents after she submitted the application.

27
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.410
P10: And

28
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.160
P10: I don't remember.

29
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.040
Renata: Okay, that's fair. So

30
00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:43.490
Renata: let's check in my notes my questions. Do you have a VA.gov account?

31
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.460
P10: My healthy vet?

32
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.850
Renata: Yeah.

33
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.119
P10: Yeah, I sure do.

34
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.240
Renata: Okay, what has been your experience logging into the site?

35
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.790
P10: It's been.

36
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.779
P10: It's been great. MyHealtheVet is a

37
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.379
P10: is a great site. I'm a little

38
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.660
P10: flummoxed on the on the new site. The were shift shifted over to id.gov, 

39
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.030
P10: And the design of the site is a little different. And

40
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.552
P10: I think the old, MyHealtheVet was a bit better. But

41
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:32.509
P10: overall, I really think my health event is a good, or whatever you call it, is a is a great site informative, the whole shooting match.

42
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.490
Renata: Got it. And how often are you logging into MyHealtheVet?

43
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.640
P10: Alright.

44
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.920
P10: I don't know. I would. I don't know if I could average it, but probably

45
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.159
P10: 3 or 4 times a week.

46
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.440
Renata: Okay? And when you're logging in 3 or 4 times a week, what sorts of tasks are you doing?

47
00:03:55.737 --> 00:04:09.209
P10: checking my secure messages, sending secure messages, ordering oh, prescription medication that sort of thing.

48
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.950
Renata: Okay, checking my appointments.

49
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:20.119
Renata: Alright. So mostly. Healthcare related tasks, medical providers, prescriptions, appointments, things of that nature? Okay.

50
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:34.769
Renata: Got it. Thank you for sharing so for the next portion of our session today, we're going to be looking at a that demo website that I referred to earlier. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen in zoom?

51
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.989
P10: Sure now I'd like to make this

52
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.049
P10: window bigger. Let me see. Here, there we go.

53
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:55.470
Renata: Okay, I'm gonna give you a moment to close out any other browsers or things that you have open. But when you're ready, let me know, and I will paste a link in the chat for you to open up.

54
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.070
P10: See, I don't. Let's see. What do I?

55
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.700
P10: I have a can I just minimize my Firefox? Or do I need to close it?

56
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:18.410
Renata: You can minimize it. I mean, it's gonna load in a firefox browser window, the link I'm gonna give you. But just in case there's anything you have open. You don't want us to see when you share your screen. This is a time to close it out.

57
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.780
P10: I'm an open book.

58
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:28.699
Renata: Alright. I am sharing that link in the chat. Go ahead and click on that, and then share your screen. And if you have any issues. I can help troubleshoot.

59
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.150
P10: Okay, it says, apply for CHAMPVA benefits.

60
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:59.440
Renata: You're on the right place now, you'll need to share your screen. So in order to do that, can you click back into the zoom application, and then at the bottom of the application there should be a whole bunch of icons.

61
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:06.099
Renata: and there's 1 in the middle. It's a big green box with an up arrow that says, Share, if you could go ahead and click on that.

62
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.129
P10: The Green Box.

63
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.680
Renata: Yeah, the bottom in the middle of your of the zoom application.

64
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:28.879
P10: Format emoji, file screenshot. Leave more chat, participant.

65
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.880
P10: Let me check more. See what that says.

66
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.359
Renata: Yeah, more. It might be in more on your computer.

67
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.520
P10: It's under, it's under more.

68
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:44.829
Renata: Alright if you click that it should give you some options of what to share, and just select that browser window where you have the

69
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.520
Renata: CHAMPVA Application open.

70
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.330
P10: Would it be desktop one?

71
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.830
Renata: If that's where you have it open, if it looks like it. Yeah, go ahead.

72
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.740
P10: Open system settings.

73
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.810
Renata: Oh, yeah, if it's your 1st time sharing screen, it might ask you to give permission to do that.

74
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.699
P10: It's not taking my

75
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.659
P10: my login.

76
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:17.030
Renata: Alright. Well, for the sake of time I can share my screen, and you can give feedback on what you see. There. Does that sound all right?

77
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.430
P10: Yeah, I don't know what's happening here, ma'am.

78
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:36.719
Renata: That is quite okay. It happens to the best of us, as Zoom doesn't cooperate for me all the time, either. So give me just a moment. Can you see me again? Are you back in the zoom application.

79
00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:37.769
P10: Yes.

80
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:43.520
Renata: Okay, I'm gonna share my screen, and then we'll make sure that you can see everything and we'll get rolling.

81
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.129
P10: Hang on just a moment. Here, let me let me try this one more time.

82
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.149
Renata: Okay. I'll stop sharing.

83
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:11.760
P10: The zoom. Us may not be able to record the contents until it has quit.

84
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.625
Renata: Oh, it's asking you to reboot zoom in order to share?

85
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.440
P10: Should I say, quit and reopen?

86
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.000
Renata: It's going to make you rejoin the zoom room. Do you feel confident you can do that if it quits?

87
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.909
P10: I think so. If not, you can call me back.

88
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.689
Renata: Okay. Sounds good.

89
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.350
Renata: Welcome back.

90
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.220
P10: Hmm, okay.

91
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.700
P10: Now, what do I do again? Here, now.

92
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:48.910
Renata: You'll go to that more icon in the zoom click, share and then share your screen.

93
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.010
Renata: Okay? And if you could.

94
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:18.100
Renata: let's see did you open up that link that I gave you in a another window?

95
00:11:21.486 --> 00:11:23.109
P10: I don't think so.

96
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.610
Renata: Okay, let me post it in the chat again.

97
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.060
P10: Can you see my screen right now?

98
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.886
Renata: I can see your screen. Yeah, we just need to get you to the right website page.

99
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.160
Renata: can you see the chat where I shared a link.

100
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.869
P10: See, zoom us is requesting to bypass the system.

101
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.990
P10: priVAte window picker and directly access, so I'll allow that.

102
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.210
Renata: Okay.

103
00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:01.121
Renata: Now, if you go down to the bottom of your screen, where you've got all of your applications, if you click back into zoom there.

104
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.070
Renata: yeah, go ahead and click on that for me.

105
00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:14.069
Renata: And check the the chat in zoom. I I shared a new link to the the prototype that we're gonna be looking at. If you could click that and open it up, that would be great.

106
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:20.550
P10: Okay, I'm clicking on the on zoom, and nothing's happening.

107
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.360
Renata: Okay.

108
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:28.479
P10: Is this? I can do the chat here.

109
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.410
Renata: Yeah, you might be able to find the chat at the top of your screen now, because you're screen sharing.

110
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:53.269
Renata: There we go. All right now we're cooking. So just a few things to be aware of before we start filling this out again. Like I said before, this is our testing site. So you don't need to worry about your information that you enter going anywhere and nothing you click is going to have any bearing on your VA. Benefits

111
00:12:53.380 --> 00:13:21.110
Renata: as we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers. And you may see some screens in this form that ask you to upload documents as we're not submitting the form. And this isn't attached to your benefits. Nothing that you upload on those screens is going to actually get sent to VA. But when we get there I'm happy to offer you a fake document to upload, or you can just upload a random picture from your desktop. However you feel, but when we get to that point I'll let you know.

112
00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:23.730
Renata: Any questions for me before we get started?

113
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.179
P10: Not yet, but I'm sure there will be. Well, actually.

114
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.310
P10: you can see this garbage in front of me? Can I close that out or?

115
00:13:34.106 --> 00:13:35.100
Renata: Which garbage?

116
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.000
P10: Can you see? Can you see my screen.

117
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.739
Renata: Yep. I can see your screen.

118
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:46.960
P10: It says you are screen sharing, stop, share, and it shows your. It shows your your link.

119
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.700
Renata: Okay.

120
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.220
P10: Can I close that?

121
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.350
Renata: Yeah, you can close it. Just don't hit, stop share, because that'll make your screen go away.

122
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.400
P10: Right.

123
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.770
P10: How's that?

124
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:19.350
Renata: Perfect. Alright. So without clicking on anything, you can scroll, though I'd like you to take a look at the information on this page, and just tell us your initial thoughts, any questions, anything that comes up for you.

125
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.060
P10: Well, it looks incrementally organized

126
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:31.510
P10: and gives me a direction of where to start.

127
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.770
P10: where it's going and what I need to do next.

128
00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:42.249
Renata: Alright. And how do you know you're on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

129
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:49.629
P10: Well, it, says I can check my eligibility, and if I can, if I am eligible, tells me, put together.

130
00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.329
P10: and then once I gather it up.

131
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.210
P10: I sign in with my looks like my

132
00:14:59.293 --> 00:15:03.129
P10: VA dot gov or id dot me, and then I can

133
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:10.579
P10: create an account. But since I already have an account, I can sign in and start my application.

134
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:26.219
Renata: Got it, and I'd like you to scroll up a little bit towards the top of the page above the big text where it says, apply for CHAMPVA benefits. There's 3 little links there, and one of them says, 1010d Extended. What does that mean to you? If anything.

135
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.380
P10: Doesn't mean a thing to me.

136
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:38.739
Renata: All right, that's fair. So if you were filling this out on VA.gov for your spouse today, what research would you do before applying and completing a form like this?

137
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.799
P10: Well, I go right here to find out if I'm eligible.

138
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:49.470
Renata: Okay. And we're not gonna click on that today. But if you were to click it, what would you imagine finding there?

139
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:56.510
P10: I would imagine questions on my military service.

140
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.479
P10: Oh, if my wife were filling this out.

141
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:07.029
P10: Is that what we're talking about right now? If my wife were doing this, or if I'm doing this?

142
00:16:07.636 --> 00:16:12.270
Renata: In this case, if you were well, I mean, I guess both. 

143
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.150
P10: Well, I would. I would suspect that it

144
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.600
P10: it's gonna query, my wife, on

145
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:26.010
P10: her eligibility based upon my military service, her age, our marital status.

146
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.719
P10: I don't know if income or anything like that would apply, but

147
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.850
P10: they'd want to know if if she's generally eligible.

148
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:56.840
Renata: Okay. And all those things that you just mentioned, your status as a veteran, disability rating, her information, financial information. Would you need to stop at this point to collect all of that? Or do you have that information on your computer like ready to go?

149
00:16:58.366 --> 00:17:01.380
P10: Don't definitely don't have it on the computer.

150
00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.390
P10: But as far as information on me

151
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.380
P10: and my military service, I remember most of it.

152
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:11.400
Renata: Okay.

153
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:27.369
Renata: Got it. So I got one more question for you before we start filling this out on a scale of 1 to 5 with one being poor and 5 being very well. How informed you feel about the application you're about to begin. Based on the information on this page?

154
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.990
P10: I'd give it a 2 or 3.

155
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.820
Renata: Okay. And why would you give it a 2 or a 3?

156
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:45.060
P10: I guess I'm not sure what to expect. I guess I'll go through. I'll go with 3

157
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.660
P10: what to expect. But

158
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.809
P10: I guess I'm after our conversation. I'm concerned

159
00:17:53.493 --> 00:17:59.359
P10: Whether or not, if I know that I have everything either memorized or available.

160
00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:09.859
Renata: Got it. So what would make this page go from a 3 to a 5 like very informed and you feel very confident about it?

161
00:18:11.567 --> 00:18:24.340
P10: If I know all of the exact dates of my enlistment and discharge, and I guess my

162
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:33.180
P10: my disability ratings, which, come to think of it, are online in MyHealtheVet.

163
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.510
Renata: Okay

164
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:45.466
Renata: got it, thank you for sharing those opinions. At this point, I'm gonna have you scroll down a little bit on the page,

165
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:59.109
Renata: and below where it says, "sign in" inside that huge blue box there's a smaller link that says, "Start your form without signing in." I'd like you to click that now.

166
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:28.569
Renata: Okay, so we're going to start the form as if you're applying for your spouse for CHAMPVA benefits. I'll let you know when to pause, and we're going to ask some questions. But to help orient you, we're going to do about 3 sections of the form. Just a few things as a reminder. This is our testing site. No information goes anywhere, and you can use fake information if you prefer. And as you go through the form. Please remember to think out loud. We want to hear any reactions you're having as you're experiencing them.

167
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.800
P10: Okay.

168
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.339
Renata: You can go ahead and get started.

169
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.020
P10: Fake name, and everything?

170
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.869
Renata: Whatever name you want.

171
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:54.520
P10: Okay.

172
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:11.930
P10: go to a country I've been to.

173
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.950
Renata: And nothing confusing about filling out anything so far?

174
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.500
P10: Nope.

175
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:07.930
Renata: All right.

176
00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.480
P10: I don't have my DD-214.

177
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:51.580
Renata: What was that?

178
00:21:51.980 --> 00:22:01.200
P10: It says we will not need your DS-214. I was just saying, I don't have it online.

179
00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.759
Renata: Are you glad that you don't need to provide it then, or...?

180
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.480
P10: Yeah, I'm pretty happy. I don't have to provide it.

181
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.220
Renata: Okay.

182
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:13.939
P10: I'm always, I'm admittedly a pretty disorganized person.

183
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:39.529
Renata: So our test system doesn't like it. If you do. 7, 8, 6, 7, 8, 9 here. So if you can just like switch 2 numbers. We'll sail through this just fine, but your otherwise your fake social will be great.

184
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.220
P10: I'm filling all this fake stuff, and I don't have a good memory.

185
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.860
Renata: That's all right, like I said, we're not gonna test you at any point here.

186
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:59.579
Renata: But if you were filling this out for you and your spouse, would you happen to know this information off the top of your head, or would you need her to be sitting here with you, or...?

187
00:24:00.475 --> 00:24:03.020
P10: Definitely no problem.

188
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:04.140
Renata: All right.

189
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:27.534
Renata: Yeah, that's just our test system. You gotta add a couple of different numbers in there.

190
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.080
Renata: nothing confusing or unusual so far?

191
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.230
P10: Looks good to me.

192
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.509
Renata: All right.

193
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:15.260
Renata: Okay, I'm going to have you pause here really quickly to answer some questions. So on a scale of 1 to 5, with one being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete your section and your spouse's section of the form?

194
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.340
P10: Very easy. 5.

195
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.450
Renata: Okay, anything in particular that made it very easy?

196
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.450
P10: Oh.

197
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.800
P10: I would guess the the logical flow of the information.

198
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:35.930
P10: It was in a logical sequence.

199
00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.600
P10: So no, nothing made it difficult at all.

200
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:58.370
Renata: Got it. Okay, you can go ahead and click no on that question on your screen to other applicants to add and click, continue. And then I'm going to have a few more questions for you. So, before clicking on anything, just take a look at this page and let me know if anything stands out to you?

201
00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:05.099
P10: Well, it's asking about Medicare, which I of course qualify for. My wife doesn't.

202
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:10.599
P10: But my wife doesn't. So I would just say no.

203
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:23.469
Renata: Okay, so this section is asking you for Medicare, thinking back to the information you saw on that 1st page that we looked at. Do you know why this form is asking you for this information?

204
00:27:24.846 --> 00:27:26.930
P10: For dual coverage, I guess.

205
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.290
Renata: Okay. And do you remember it mentioning Medicare at all?

206
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.170
P10: I don't remember. No.

207
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:44.559
Renata: Got it, and if you were filling the application for CHAMPVA benefits out on VA.gov today, would you need to stop and gather some Medicare information, or would you have that on hand already?

208
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:50.830
P10: Oh, I have my Medicare on hand.

209
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.475
Renata: Okay.

210
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.779
P10: It's well she doesn't qualify for Medicare, so

211
00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.650
P10: it wouldn't make any difference. And I do have a comment about this page.

212
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:00.300
P10: So.

213
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.480
Renata: Okay, what's that?

214
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:08.270
P10: Says, "if you have trouble using this online form, call us," Yeah.

215
00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:15.999
P10: So understand that, I love the VA, I absolutely 100% trust

216
00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.830
P10: and I love the VA. But one problem is the phone.

217
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.910
P10: I'm not positive that if I needed help.

218
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.970
P10: and if I call this number I wouldn't be on hold for 4 hours.

219
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:37.380
P10: and I don't mean that I'm not trying to make a joke, but you know I'm

220
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:43.680
P10: I'm just a few months from 79 years old, and I don't have a whole bunch of patience

221
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.460
P10: staying on hold.

222
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.989
P10: And, generally speaking, when I call a number at the VA.

223
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.869
P10: It's really tough to get a hold of somebody.

224
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:59.089
P10: You know, you're 45th in line or something, and it just doesn't work.

225
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.250
P10: So old guys like me just hang it up.

226
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:16.609
Renata: Got it. I'm sorry that you've had that experience. It sounds very frustrating, and we genuinely appreciate your feedback about that, and and we'll share it with the the team that works on that. So

227
00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.219
Renata: thank you.

228
00:29:20.104 --> 00:29:35.880
Renata: I wanna direct your attention to the top of the page next to the VA logo, it says, CHAMPVA Form 1010d Extended CHAMPVA Application (includes 10-7959c). Does that mean anything to you at all?

229
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.910
P10: Means nothing to me.

230
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:59.020
Renata: Okay, that's fair enough. So for this next section of the form. I'd like you to imagine that your spouse has Medicare as well as private health insurance. So I'd like you to go ahead and fill out this section with Medicare and private health insurance plans, and then I'll stop and ask you some questions before we wrap up.

231
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.440
P10: Good

232
00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.420
P10: oops.

233
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.290
P10: Yeah, I would need to go to her card

234
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:38.010
P10: to get this information, so I'll just shoot in the breeze here.

235
00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.729
Renata: And is it clear to you what this page is asking for?

236
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:24.220
P10: It's asking me to to upload my card.

237
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:34.329
Renata: Okay. And like, I said, I can provide you with a dummy document, or if you have any random photo on your desktop, you can upload it. We're not submitting this. So nobody's gonna see what we put there.

238
00:31:35.923 --> 00:31:36.416
P10: Boy.

239
00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:01.569
P10: Okay, I don't. I guess I'll just upload my ship.

240
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:05.509
Renata: Okay, if you go back to the web page.

241
00:32:05.992 --> 00:32:14.570
Renata: Yeah. Click there, click upload file for me, and it's gonna open up a a screen of options of things to upload.

242
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:19.070
P10: Okay, let's see photos.

243
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:31.520
P10: I guess I shouldn't try to be. How about a photo of a baby bald eagle? That's what I'll do.

244
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.390
Renata: And we would love that.

245
00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.520
P10: Did you ever follow the website? Friends of Big Bear Valley?

246
00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.269
Renata: No. Is that where you found this?

247
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:50.109
P10: Yeah. I followed them from egg to to fledging.

248
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.550
Renata: Oh, wow!

249
00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.210
Renata: It's saying you need a different file type.

250
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:57.440
P10: Okay.

251
00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.570
Renata: Interesting.

252
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.199
Renata: Maybe try a Pdf?

253
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.819
P10: I don't even know what that Pdf is.

254
00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.860
P10: See what it is before I upload it.

255
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:38.960
Renata: So you said you'd like to see what it is. Would you prefer if it showed you like a thumbnail preview of the document before you continued?

256
00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.700
P10: How do I do that here?

257
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:51.350
Renata: We don't have that in this current version of the the tool, unfortunately, so no previews.

258
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:56.589
P10: Go to delete file, and I'll figure something else out.

259
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:57.820
Renata: Okay.

260
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:05.069
P10: And you want me to hurry up. I'm sure I'll just.

261
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.459
P10: I'll just do this. See what it is.

262
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:11.350
P10: Continue.

263
00:34:12.495 --> 00:34:14.769
Renata: Yeah, you can click continue.

264
00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:22.380
Renata: And it's asking you to upload something else.

265
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.329
Renata: You can use the same document if you'd like.

266
00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.549
P10: You can tell me what it is.

267
00:34:54.679 --> 00:35:02.429
Renata: Alright. And like, I said before, for here we're gonna imagine that your your wife also has a a health insurance plan, so you can go ahead and click yes.

268
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.239
P10: And I'm assuming I would add all that?

269
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.310
P10: I don't even know if that's a real date.

270
00:35:42.193 --> 00:35:42.959
Renata: Which one?

271
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.470
P10: February 29th 2003.

272
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.859
Renata: Oh.

273
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:54.559
Renata: well, the system says no.

274
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.600
P10: It's an invalid date.

275
00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:06.170
P10: That's what I get for trying to be smart ass.

276
00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:13.650
Renata: If you were filling this out for real, would you want it to tell you if you'd maybe put a typo and put March 39th or something?

277
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:14.930
P10: Absolutely.

278
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:15.510
Renata: Okay.

279
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:24.190
P10: Yeah, yeah, I think I think any self correcting or

280
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:32.680
P10: any kind of software that helps somebody fill something out. If you make a mistake.

281
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:37.809
P10: and it gives you a a suggestion, I think is really helpful.

282
00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:42.959
P10: you know, again especially, and I don't mean to put myself in a box, but

283
00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.300
P10: you know, the older we get

284
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:51.469
P10: the less patience we have, and I am definitely not as tech savvy as you

285
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.819
P10: or any of the other folks online.

286
00:36:56.250 --> 00:37:01.549
P10: You know where you guys may get frustrated at somebody like me that's trying to click through screens.

287
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:13.980
P10: Software that helps us click through those screens is a big help, and I can tell you that I appreciate it. I think any other vet would.

288
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.289
Renata: Got it. Thank you for sharing.

289
00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.310
P10: I don't know what the...

290
00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:10.229
Renata: You can use the same Pdfs that you used before for this section again, we're not going to submit anything. So it's it's not going anywhere.

291
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.269
P10: Does it want you to do 2 files?

292
00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:34.019
Renata: Would you prefer if it just asked for one with front and back? Or do you prefer having separate uploads for the front and the back of the card.

293
00:38:35.595 --> 00:38:37.019
P10: Say that one more time.

294
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:48.199
Renata: Would you prefer it to ask just for one upload of your card cause it's asking for the insurance card scan, or would you prefer to have separate uploads for front versus back?

295
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:53.328
P10: No, I think this is, I think this is good.

296
00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:56.890
P10: Well,

297
00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:07.710
P10: okay, so it'll it'll take a photo.

298
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:17.130
P10: Now, this is making the assumption that that you're

299
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.380
P10: again. I hate to reference, old guys and ladies.

300
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.480
P10: but you're assuming that everybody is tech savvy?

301
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:31.929
P10: So I'm guessing a lot of people don't have a scanner.

302
00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:40.900
P10: Are we? Assuming that everybody has a as a smartphone.

303
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:50.149
Renata: I'm going to be a little annoying, and answer your question with a question is that what you would assume, based on what you've seen so far?

304
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.930
P10: Yes.

305
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:58.820
Renata: Okay. And what would make this a a better experience, you think, than assuming a scanner or a smartphone here?

306
00:40:05.286 --> 00:40:07.979
P10: Included there. If you do not have a

307
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:14.070
P10: or maybe just a a scan, a photo.

308
00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.720
P10: Yeah.

309
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.040
P10: Provide an address that it can be mailed in

310
00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:28.430
P10: to meet up somewhere and somewhere. You want to match the

311
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:36.010
P10: the mailed in document to the oh, to the digital application.

312
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:47.339
Renata: Okay. So if I'm hearing you correctly, if we provided a a mailing address like a Po box to to send in a a copy of your health insurance card. You'd wanna like indicate

313
00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:57.639
Renata: your name or your spouse's name, or or some id number, so that the VA. Could associate your application and and the mail? Okay, got it.

314
00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:02.879
P10: Some kind of an ID number. It wouldn't even have to have a name or anything just to

315
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.670
P10: just ID number. And

316
00:41:06.258 --> 00:41:08.950
P10: you know the the veteran could

317
00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:17.680
P10: you would get a photocopy of stationary store, or wherever her neighbors.

318
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.220
Renata: Right.

319
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:26.670
Renata: Alright. Well, thank you for that feedback. That's very helpful. If you go ahead and click the continue button.

320
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:42.760
Renata: So I'm going to stop you here, and I'm going to ask you that 1 to 5 scale again, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the Medicare and Health Insurance section of the form.

321
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:50.439
P10: Real easy, you know, assuming that I had all my information and her information, not a problem.

322
00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.139
Renata: Okay, so on that scale, would you give it a 5 for very easy?

323
00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:58.760
P10: Excuse me. A 5. Yes, it's pretty well organized.

324
00:41:59.080 --> 00:41:59.470
Renata: Okay

325
00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:05.859
Renata: And assuming that you didn't have all the documents sitting with you, would that rating number change at all?

326
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.109
P10: No, it would just.

327
00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.370
P10: It would just encourage me to

328
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:16.449
P10: put the brakes on and go get the information.

329
00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:26.990
Renata: Got it. Alright. I just want to do a quick time check. We're about 3 min to the end of our scheduled session. Do you have a few extra minutes to go over?

330
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:33.369
P10: Okay, I'm I'm almost 79 years old and retired. I have all you need.

331
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:46.749
Renata: Okay, we're almost done with this, but I don't anticipate us going too much longer than over the hour. Go ahead and click No, for that question about other health insurance to report and hit the continue button.

332
00:42:47.630 --> 00:43:00.769
Renata: So like, I said, we're not going to be submitting this application today. But I'd like you to go through and review your application for your spouse's CHAMPVA benefits at this point, and remember to think out loud, give any feedback as you go.

333
00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.030
P10: Okay.

334
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:15.879
P10: I'm glad to see there's an edit function on all the information here.

335
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:48.650
P10: and if I you know, if I forgot to add an applicant. I could do that.

336
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.249
Renata: So we

337
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:39.920
Renata: won't click submit at this point. But I do have a few questions for you. So if we were actually submitting this application today, what would you expect to happen after you click the submit form button? 

338
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:49.739
P10: I would say I would expect to get a confirmation email back.

339
00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:57.239
P10: And I would want a copy of everything that I submitted, sent back to me.

340
00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.135
Renata: Okay

341
00:44:59.213 --> 00:45:06.120
Renata: When you say a copy of it sent back like a Pdf of the application in that in that email or...?

342
00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:14.430
Renata: OKay, got it, and how soon would you expect to be notified about a decision on your application for CHAMPVA benefits?

343
00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.030
P10: So you're asking somebody that's

344
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:25.190
P10: done a lot of stuff with the VA and has been

345
00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.199
P10: super happy with some of the responses, and

346
00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:35.359
P10: disappointed with the speedy results of others. So I would expect within 2 weeks.

347
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:48.590
Renata: Within 2 weeks. Okay, and would you want to know about the status of your pending application between today, submitting the form and 2 weeks from now, or just wait until 2 weeks?

348
00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:53.439
P10: But I don't see any reason why the VA couldn't provide the same

349
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.560
P10: type of information that the IRS does,

350
00:45:56.950 --> 00:46:03.330
P10: You know? Where's my tax return? You know, in what stage is is it in? So

351
00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:12.020
P10: yeah. And you guys can speak to this better than I can. But since this is all

352
00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.489
P10: software driven, it should be fairly easy

353
00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:22.760
P10: to determine. You know, if somebody's looking at it, you know it.

354
00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:26.570
P10: they should be able to let me know that it's in review.

355
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:43.100
Renata: Okay, and let let's let's say that you know you submit the application it's under review, and maybe you forgot to upload that health insurance card. Would you expect to see some notice of "We're missing a health insurance card"?

356
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:43.840
P10: Yes.

357
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.599
Renata: "Here's what you need to do to provide it?"

358
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:50.050
P10: I'm sorry I didn't say that, but yes, I would expect

359
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:54.929
P10: to have a notification that my application is incomplete.

360
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:57.680
P10: We're waiting on this.

361
00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:06.700
Renata: And where would you expect to see that notification email text, a letter in your VA.gov profile?

362
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:13.829
P10: Great question. I would expect that you guys could say, "how would you like to

363
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:18.229
P10: us to respond text or email, or both?"

364
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:22.700
Renata: Okay. And those would be your preferences for notifications?

365
00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.409
P10: Text or email, and I would always check both.

366
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:26.420
Renata: Okay.

367
00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:33.130
Renata: Got it. I've got one more question for you before we wrap up. It's that 1 to 5 scale again. Oh, go ahead.

368
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.710
P10: Actually text email or snail mail. I guess.

369
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.760
Renata: Okay.

370
00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:38.520
P10: Yeah.

371
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:50.500
Renata: Got it so, the 1 to 5 question again, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it for you to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits on this page?

372
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:53.570
P10: 5.

373
00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:54.610
Renata: Okay.

374
00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:56.870
P10: Pretty darn easy. Yeah.

375
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:57.680
Renata: Okay.

376
00:47:58.366 --> 00:48:08.189
Renata: so we're done with the screen sharing portion of this, you can stop sharing your screen. There's probably a little checkbox at the top of the screen that says, stop sharing

377
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:17.300
Renata: alright. So just a few more questions as we wrap up overall. Was there anything you saw in the session today that worked well for you?

378
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:26.700
P10: The entire, the entire experience work really well.

379
00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:27.780
Renata: Okay.

380
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:33.479
P10: I mean, I think somebody's done their homework.

381
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.170
Renata: All right.

382
00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:41.149
Renata: Was there anything, unclear, or that didn't work well for you that you saw today?

383
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.680
P10: Not that I can think of.

384
00:48:48.770 --> 00:49:01.470
Renata: All right, and knowing what you know. Now, having completed the application, what research would you recommend that veterans do before applying for and completing the CHAMPVA application?

385
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:09.700
P10: Yeah, before you complete this app before you begin this application.

386
00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.240
P10: please have the following documents available.

387
00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:20.999
P10: or or accumulate the following following documents to help you speed through the application.

388
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.330
Renata: Okay.

389
00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.850
P10: So I don't let let anybody know upfront

390
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.919
P10: what all they're gonna need before they they're halfway through, and then have to go searching for it.

391
00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:42.450
Renata: Alright! And what are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in this form? Not enough, just right, too much?

392
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.020
P10: I think it's great.

393
00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:45.320
Renata: Okay.

394
00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.030
P10: Yeah.

395
00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:47.830
Renata: Alright!

396
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.310
P10: You've done your homework.

397
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:55.950
Renata: I'll let the team know. Do you have any questions for me before we close out?

398
00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:01.510
P10: Not a 1, but one of the things that I've always answered.

399
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:05.839
P10: Whenever somebody says, What would you change about our website?

400
00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.010
P10: I would like to see some color in it.

401
00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.700
Renata: Gotcha.

402
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:18.050
P10: Yeah, you know, rather than blue and white or whatever. And that's just

403
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:25.959
P10: that's just, I guess me. But I think colors make things easy.

404
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:27.470
Renata: Okay.

405
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:31.949
P10: You know it makes things friendly, or, or

406
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:40.959
P10: you know, more attractive, easier to fill out, easier to navigate. You know the whole VA site is great. It's well organized.

407
00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.490
P10: but I just wish it had more color in it.

408
00:50:44.900 --> 00:51:00.670
Renata: Got it, I'll make sure to pass that along to our folks. Thank you for sharing that I want to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of the session with our partners and to remind you, we'll remove any information that would be used to identify you?

409
00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.360
P10: Sure, no problem.

410
00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:07.300
Renata: Alright. Was there any part of this discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?

411
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:13.460
P10: Not that I can think of everybody's refreshing all. Of course.

412
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:18.370
P10: I'm sure they're professional, but I didn't get to talk to, but.

413
00:51:18.684 --> 00:51:35.680
Renata: Yeah. Well, with that we really appreciate you taking time out of your day and your week to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback was super helpful. And it's going to really help with our continuing work on the site and making sure it really works for veterans. So thank you so much.

414
00:51:36.113 --> 00:51:57.260
Renata: Perigean is going to be sending you a little. Thank you note email. And at the bottom of that there's going to be a blurb that you can pass on to other veterans, you know, so that they can also sign up for a chance to participate in future studies like this one. But with that thank you so much. Enjoy the rest of your day. Enjoy your Vacation. I'm extremely jealous.

415
00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:57.850
P10: Where are you?

416
00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:00.549
Renata: I hope you have a wonderful time! I'm in California.

417
00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:04.679
P10: Oh, well, if you've never been to Canada up to

418
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:10.299
P10: British Columbia or Vancouver Island, you owe yourself the favor of it.

419
00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.680
Renata: Noted. I will put it on the list.

420
00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.580
P10: Go up to Whistler, where the Olympics were held.

421
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:20.830
Renata: Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, that sounds fabulous.

422
00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:26.369
P10: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it, and you know, if there's anything else I can do or say.

423
00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:34.620
P10: please call. I'm happy to help, and I love the VA.

424
00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:40.180
Renata: Absolutely, we will be in touch. And again, thank you so much, and have a good one.

425
00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:41.040
P10: Alone.

426
00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.469
Renata: Alright, bye.
