1
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:09.880
Renata: All right. I have started the recording, and I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.460
P13: Yep.

3
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:19.869
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.810
P13: Yes.

5
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.879
Renata: All right. Thank you so much. So gonna get started with a few questions. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program?

6
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.940
P13: Yes.

7
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.449
Renata: All right. How long ago did you apply?

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.689
P13: I believe it was 2020.

9
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.750
Renata: Okay,

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.999
Renata: got it. Did anyone such as a Veterans Service Organization, a family member or friend help you fill out the application?

11
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.380
P13: So I'm eligible because my husband is a veteran disabled. So we both did it together.

12
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.570
Renata: Okay.

13
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.269
P13: To make sure to try to make sure it was done correctly, I think we had some questions, and we called the CHAMPVA toll free number to

14
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.070
P13: to ask them, as well.

15
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.080
Renata: Okay. And was it helpful to ask questions as part of filling it out?

16
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:27.919
P13: yeah, from what I recall. And I know after we sent it as well, we had questions because of the timing of it. That was that was going on with it. I feel like maybe the paperwork was lost, or something. We have to resend it, or something along those lines.

17
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.450
Renata: Okay, got it. And aside from you, is there anyone else in your household currently enrolled in the CHAMPVA programs?

18
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.090
P13: Nope.

19
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:50.470
Renata: All right. And have you submitted any updated health insurance information to CHAMPVA, using the Other Health Insurance certification form otherwise known as the 10-7959c?

20
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.320
P13: No.

21
00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:02.819
Renata: Alright and it sounds like given the timing of it you did you fill it out a paper form. Did you fax it, or mail it? What was that process like.

22
00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:17.429
P13: I feel like we mailed it as well as faxed it. I'm not sure which. If that was because something wasn't happening the 1st time we did it, so we tried a different method, but I feel like we did both of those. Possibly.

23
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:32.075
Renata: Okay. Did you ever call the CHAMPVA line to see what was going on with your application because of the amount of time it was taking? Ok. And was that when you got told that you were like missing items that you needed to provide or...?

24
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.219
P13: Well, I don't think we were missing items. I think we we submitted everything. It's just that

25
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.510
P13: maybe they lost it. I'm not, I don't really remember exactly on that. I just

26
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.880
P13: know that it was very clunky in the beginning, trying to get that all straightened out and

27
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.810
P13: approved so that we can move on with our lives.

28
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:09.040
Renata: Got it. Yeah. Was there anything confusing about the paper CHAMPVA application? As you you mentioned having to ask some questions about it?

29
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.190
P13: I don't recall specifically that part.

30
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:23.690
Renata: That's fair. And have you submitted any medical or health claims to the CHAMPVA program since you were enrolled?

31
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.430
P13: Um no.

32
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.939
P13: Yeah. So the medical providers I've seen have submitted claims to them. I've not personally submitted a claim

33
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:57.960
P13: in a traditional sense to get it paid to me. They had changed their policy on the vaccines, and you weren't supposed to get charged to copay on them, but they were still charging copays, so I had to write to them to get that corrected. It was like this big deal where I had to actually look on the US Government site to find the highest people in CHAMPVA to email them

34
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:08.640
P13: and to finally get somebody to respond. Because if you call the call center, it's kind of, they can be helpful. But for like difficult stuff, you just get robotic answers.

35
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:28.373
Renata: Got it. I'm sorry to hear about that, but I appreciate hearing about your experience. So just to make sure that I understand, my understanding is when you've had health and medical claims to submit since enrolling, your providers, or, like the doctor's office, has been facilitating filing those for you? You've not had to

36
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.660
Renata: you know, file one yourself? Okay.

37
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.589
P13: Correct. Yeah, thank goodness.

38
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.360
Renata: All right. Yeah. A couple more questions for you. Do you have a va.gov account?

39
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.180
P13: Yeah, I believe I do. I don't think I use it much, but yeah, I do have one. I don't use it much, though.

40
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.450
Renata: Alright what has been your experience with logging into the the va.gov site?

41
00:04:52.701 --> 00:05:20.419
P13: When I've done it. Well, it feels like something that's continually changing, that's perception. I don't know what the reality is, so use id dot me use this use that so I mean, generally I can get in I've had to help my dad, which is kind of separate from what we're doing today is 92, and he's since lost access to it. And you need to have a driver's license which he doesn't have anymore, and a valid passport to get access. So we just can't get him access now

42
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:28.870
P13: to it. So it's it just feels like something that changes frequently.

43
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:41.610
Renata: Alright again, I'm sorry to hear that, but I appreciate you sharing all the same. When you are logging into va.gov, what sorts of tasks are you doing when you when you land there?

44
00:05:44.219 --> 00:06:01.680
P13: One time I was doing I thought something with managing. I don't really have prescriptions very much, but there was a time where I was getting something, and I was getting it through VA's mail prescription program the CHAMPVA program. So there are ways to, I think.

45
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:20.049
P13: like request your next shipment, or whatever. So I was using it for that. But beyond that I don't really remember what I was using it for, specific for me, cause it was more when I've used it, which is just the website was more about policies and things along those lines.

46
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:34.009
Renata: Got it. Okay. Well, those are all my questions just to get started. So the next portion of the session today, we're gonna be looking at that demo tool I mentioned before. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen in zoom?

47
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:49.890
P13: Yeah, that's fine. I don't have a problem with that. I don't think this is what the sessions about. I'm just gonna put this out there. I'm sure you all know this. If they could ever get the explanation of benefits online, that would be amazing. Because they don't currently have that right now.

48
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.760
Renata: The the CHAMPVA ones that get sent in the mail?

49
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:59.569
P13: Yeah, you can't even look up anything. When you ask about like going online, there's bare bones of what you can do.

50
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:21.829
P13: So it's just something that is not even like 2001 technology as far as a a recipient of the care. It's probably like 1994 technology, because you can't...nothing's online for the most part, except the prescription thing that I mentioned to you. They did just put have a or I did discover they have an app

51
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.230
P13: where you can put in CPT codes to see if things are covered. So that's helpful.

52
00:07:27.708 --> 00:07:33.559
P13: It looks that looks like about 2009 technology. But so far it's working for what I need.

53
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:53.290
Renata: Got it. Okay, noted. Thank you for the the things that you'd like to see in the future. Those are really helpful for the team to know about. I'm gonna share a link to the demo tool we're gonna be looking at. But let me know if you need any assistance with getting the zoom screen. Share up and running.

54
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.660
P13: Okay, just a moment.

55
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.930
P13: Okay.

56
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:43.470
Renata: All right. So before we start filling out the form, just a few things to be aware of. So this is our testing site. Like, I said before, you don't have to worry about any of the information that you're going to be entering today, going anywhere, and nothing we click on is going to affect your benefits. We're not also not going to be submitting this this form today, as we go through the form, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, such as social security numbers. If you don't feel comfortable using real information.

57
00:08:43.470 --> 00:09:08.870
Renata: and there's a few places in the application where you may be asked to upload documents, as we're not submitting the form, and this isn't attached to your benefits. Nothing you upload in this is going to be sent to VA. But when we get to those screens that ask for the file to be uploaded you can upload a random thing on your desktop like a photo, or I can provide a sample document for you to use. I'll remind you, when we get to those screens that you have that option. But any questions for me before we get rolling?

58
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.219
P13: No sounds good.

59
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:19.299
Renata: All right. So without clicking, you can go ahead and scroll on this page, but without clicking it. I'd like you to take a look at the information on this page, and just tell us your initial thoughts.

60
00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:36.389
P13: So it's assignment issues. If you're using iphone voice over and voice control navigation veterans using voice over voice control, assistive assistive technology. Iphones are having trouble. So this is just a something that's going on, and they're letting me know about that

61
00:09:36.838 --> 00:09:50.199
P13: apply for CHAMPVA benefits. Yeah, I don't think I was able to apply online. So this must be something new, so that could potentially be a good thing application for CHAMPVA benefits. And then it's that's the name of the form

62
00:09:50.789 --> 00:09:59.410
P13: which is probably like the paper form. Follow the steps to apply for CHAMPVA benefits. I do like that. It's stepped out. So I know where the beginning and the end is.

63
00:10:00.042 --> 00:10:21.809
P13: Check your eligibility. Make sure you meet eligibility requirements before you apply. So find out if you're eligible by clicking there. So that's important, and then gather your information. Here's what you need to apply personal information about you and anyone else's you're applying for, and then personal information about your sponsor, the veteran or service number you're connected to.

64
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:38.770
P13: This includes dates of birth, social security, numbers, and contact information. You may also need to submit supporting documents like copies of your health insurance cards or proof of school enrollment. Find out which documents you'll need to apply for champion. So that's all. Helpful. Heads up overview

65
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:46.159
P13: and then start. Your application will take you through each step. The process it should take about 15 min. I like that. They have an estimation of time.

66
00:10:46.310 --> 00:11:00.219
P13: Sometimes you start things and you don't know how long it's gonna take. You get dinner coming up. You don't know if it's gonna save your progress. So that's good. Or after you apply, we'll contact you if we have questions or need more information.

67
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.365
P13: And

68
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:10.660
P13: it says, yeah, I'm just thinking about this now, hopefully, throughout this, hopefully, somewhere in the process.

69
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:20.776
P13: and maybe towards the end of the application, it estimates how long it takes for them to review the application. And

70
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.833
P13: yeah, as opposed to

71
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:33.330
P13: just not knowing that information. And I think it would also, I mean, I can assume this, but it would be nice if they

72
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:43.619
P13: said, if there is a benefit to applying this way, as opposed to via fax or paper mail in like this is this quicker? Perhaps this might

73
00:11:43.770 --> 00:12:00.170
P13: have your application review faster. If that's the case. That would be nice to know at some point here, like, I think it would be this page where I would be like, what's the besides it being online which I like, what's the? Are there any other advantages to me doing it this way? It would be nice to see here.

74
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:12.310
P13: and then sign in with their verified account. When you sign in with an id identity verified account, you can save your work in in progress. So that answers that as far as I can save the work

75
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:16.660
P13: now 60 days, when you start or make changes to submit your form.

76
00:12:18.087 --> 00:12:28.529
P13: And then don't have a verified account. Create a login.gov or id dot me account will help you verify your identity for your account now and then. Not sure if your account is verified, sign in here.

77
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.249
P13: If you still need to verify your identity, we'll help you do that now

78
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.760
P13: and then you can sign in after you start

79
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:42.530
P13: filling out your form, but you'll lose any information you already filled in. So the advantage to

80
00:12:43.675 --> 00:12:46.999
P13: signing in is I can save that information. So that's good to know.

81
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.100
P13: That's where I can sign in and create the account.

82
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.639
P13: Start your form without signing in. That's the option. They mentioned

83
00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:02.440
P13: the estimated 15 min, and then a control number expiration date.

84
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.709
P13: I'm not really sure what that's all about, the expiration date.

85
00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:10.894
P13: privacy act statement. And then, if I need help, there's a phone number.

86
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.270
P13: So

87
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:22.800
P13: I'm just kind of wondering in my mind is that seems different than the regular CHAMPVA number. So it makes me wonder where that would go to that phone number.

88
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.179
P13: But yeah, that's my kind of 1st impressions of things.

89
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:36.480
Renata: Got it a couple of questions for you before we proceed with filling out the application. How do you know if you're on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

90
00:13:40.281 --> 00:13:43.650
P13: Because it says, Apply for CHAMPVA benefits.

91
00:13:44.387 --> 00:13:50.270
P13: That's really the only reason like this here means nothing to me: "1010d Extended"

92
00:13:50.570 --> 00:14:16.369
P13: Lvc CHAMPVA like that garbly speak to me. So I actually wish it was in more in English here, because I do use these menu trees sometimes, so I don't like, I know we're doing a test right now, but I don't actually know how I landed here so hopefully in real life. I could easily get here, because using this here would not get me there easily.

93
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:30.710
Renata: Got it follow up question. So if the Lvc CHAMPVA and 1010 d Extended aren't meaningful sort of signposts for you, what? What would be more meaningful in terms of identifying where you are in va.gov?

94
00:14:31.985 --> 00:14:55.049
P13: Something about the VA Gov dot home. I don't even know what this CHAMPVA...Maybe this is for CHAMPVA. Specifically, I know Lvc. Means so if it just said CHAMPVA, I would be good. But, like I, I could understand that. And then, if there was the next thing said, apply for champion benefits instead of this 1010 whatever that would be English to me, and I would understand that.

95
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:55.960
Renata: Okay.

96
00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:11.440
P13: Because this is the type of thing that ends up making calls to the VA CHAMPVA line. What does this mean? Like, I don't understand. Yeah, that's the name of the form. But regular people don't speak that way, and I'm a regular person. So that's what I would say on that.

97
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:23.100
Renata: Okay, I appreciate that feedback. If you were on va.gov, filling this form out for yourself today, what research would you do before applying and completing the form?

98
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.210
P13: So.

99
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:36.330
P13: So in that, in your question, like, I've landed here. But what research would I do beyond what I just read here is that?

100
00:15:36.663 --> 00:15:42.000
Renata: Yeah, if any, I mean, if you feel like, this is sufficient, you know.

101
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.395
P13: Where.

102
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.169
Renata: Or would there be more.

103
00:15:44.835 --> 00:16:07.459
P13: I mean, this seems sufficient. But when I applied Chat Gpt didn't exist. Now it exists, and I use it a lot for a lot of different things. I probably would put some of this in there and say, You know, is there any other tips that you can give me that might help me with this application, and then see what it comes out with.

104
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:18.340
Renata: Okay, got it. So what I think you mentioned this when you were 1st looking at the form. But what information do you think you'll need to have to fill this application out for yourself?

105
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:28.779
P13: So I need my information like it says social security dates of birth, contact, information. And then I need the the sponsor.

106
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:37.609
P13: you know the veteran's service number I'm connected to. So I'm gonna need their information, probably their social security number.

107
00:16:38.217 --> 00:16:43.420
P13: I don't know if I need their separation date, or if they can, just look that up with the social security.

108
00:16:44.068 --> 00:16:51.939
P13: I mean, this isn't. This is an overview. But I do have this link that I could click to get more specifics if needed.

109
00:16:51.940 --> 00:17:01.020
Renata: Okay, and would you have all the information you just listed off on hand? Or would you need to pause right now if you're really filling this out to go collect all of that?

110
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:12.359
P13: yeah, I probably would start it. Cause I know, like social security number, date of birth.

111
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:26.000
P13: It doesn't look without clicking this link here. It doesn't look that difficult as far as the the information that they're telling me I need. So I probably would start it because

112
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:32.110
P13: I'm not seeing anything at this point that I'm gonna need to go get.

113
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.120
P13: because I haven't clicked this link here.

114
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.850
Renata: Okay.

115
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:48.219
P13: You know, if they had like 5 more things, and they were more complicated, or, you know, copy of your birth certificate, or whatever, then it'd be like, Okay, I probably wouldn't start. I would try to make sure I've got everything.

116
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.020
P13: Oh, man, before I start.

117
00:17:52.090 --> 00:18:04.149
Renata: Makes sense. One last question for you on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being poorly 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin, based on this page's content?

118
00:18:06.517 --> 00:18:11.380
P13: So we're not like doing this part up here, but more like below. Here

119
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.170
P13: we're we're considering all of it in that that ranking

120
00:18:15.962 --> 00:18:17.359
P13: I would give it a 3.

121
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.659
Renata: A 3. Okay. And what specifically makes it a 3 and not a 4 or 5?

122
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:33.609
P13: This menu could be better as I talked about earlier. I do think that this is pretty good here that I like the steps.

123
00:18:34.468 --> 00:18:59.919
P13: And yeah. So so it's probably mainly this part that's getting it lower. But to me that was an easy thing to to get right the 1st time, because the reason why I say that look what they did here, personal information about your sponsor. They could have left it at sponsor and me go, wait a minute. What is that? But they actually, said the veteran of Service Member, you're connected to very helpful. That's English.

124
00:19:00.565 --> 00:19:05.440
P13: So this is missing that. So that's why I'm giving it a 3.

125
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:17.680
Renata: Alright. Thank you. So at this point I'm gonna have you scroll down a little bit on the page, and in that big blue box underneath. Sign in. I'd like you to hit sign. Start your form without signing in.

126
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:18.580
P13: Okay.

127
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:29.699
Renata: So at this point I'm going to have you start filling out this form as if you were applying for yourself and one other family member like a dependent child.

128
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:50.210
Renata: I'll let you know when we're going to pause and answer some questions, but to help orient you, we're going to complete sections, one through 3 of the form and just some reminders. Again, this is our testing site. You don't have to use real information for anything, and as you go through the form, please remember to think out loud. We'd like to hear any reactions as you're experiencing them.

129
00:19:51.092 --> 00:20:06.199
P13: Okay. I notice up here. It says CHAMPVA. The application as well as the other stuff. That means something to the VA, so that's good. That up there it says, CHAMPVA. So I like that. It stepped out 1 through 6 clearly. I can see where I'm at.

130
00:20:06.537 --> 00:20:21.389
P13: Sign in your information. Your information may take some time to complete this form. Sign in to save your progress. I like that. They're letting me know that, so that I don't like regret it later. We can also pre fill some of the information for you to save your time.

131
00:20:22.127 --> 00:20:27.040
P13: Oh, if I sign in to do that. So which of these best describes you?

132
00:20:27.616 --> 00:20:35.309
P13: Let's see which that was. I'm a veteran, or I'm applying for myself, I'm a representative applying for benefits of me.

133
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.430
P13: So I guess.

134
00:20:37.975 --> 00:20:41.000
P13: On this one. Is that what we're doing in this scenario.

135
00:20:41.937 --> 00:20:47.499
Renata: Yes, we're gonna have you applying for yourself and one other family member like a dependent child.

136
00:20:48.610 --> 00:21:06.730
P13: Okay, so am I a veteran here, or am I not a veteran? Because I can't do the child here under this option? I'm a representative applying for benefits. I don't. I don't even that's not the case, and I'm not a veteran, so I don't see one that's for me and a dependent.

137
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:13.670
Renata: Got it so if we took the dependent out of the equation, if we just said you were applying for yourself, which one would you be inclined?

138
00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:14.130
P13: That's fine!

139
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.210
Renata: Okay.

140
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:15.600
P13: This one.

141
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.569
Renata: Let's let's click on that one for the sake of today.

142
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.250
P13: Okay.

143
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:26.100
Renata: And proceed from there. But if it asks you for other family members, you're going to apply for yourself and a dependent child.

144
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:27.580
P13: Okay.

145
00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:43.079
P13: so hopefully, when it's live, it can be more clear on that cause I wouldn't know what to do if I had a child, and which that would be a phone call to the CHAMPVA to try to get that answer, or ChatGpt.

146
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:43.780
Renata: Got it.

147
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.820
P13: Alright. So your name?

148
00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.450
P13: I'll just use the fake stuff.

149
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.279
P13: and then so we'll go ahead and do continue. That's pretty straightforward.

150
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.439
P13: Signer. One of the things that would be nice, though, is, if they had a sub

151
00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:21.299
P13: tracker to let me know where I'm at within this section, because this is gonna be one of those things where each section has multiple sections in it. So you don't ever know like where you're at to get to. In other words, like a true progress bar would be helpful.

152
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:27.820
P13: So your mailing address will send any important information about this application to your address.

153
00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:32.170
P13: Okay, so just say, United States,

154
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.530
P13: let's see.

155
00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.199
P13: Alright, that's straightforward.

156
00:22:48.351 --> 00:22:57.819
P13: If it's gonna like it. Okay. So your contact information, use your, we use information. If we have any questions. Okay, so

157
00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.509
P13: and then email address.

158
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:12.039
P13: that's easy. Sponsor information. I will ask you to enter information of the veteran or service number that the

159
00:23:12.564 --> 00:23:20.020
P13: applicant is connected to also called the sponsor. We'll use the sponsor's name, social security number.

160
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:31.870
P13: and status to confirm their eligibility for champion benefits. We will not need you to upload their DD-214. That's good to know all of good information.

161
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.967
P13: And it's good. They're, you know, explaining what the sponsor is.

162
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:47.069
P13: so sponsors, name and date of birth, and to the sponsors, name and date of birth. We'll use this information to confirm the their eligibility for CHAMPVA.

163
00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.400
P13: Okay, so we'll do

164
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.219
P13: there and then.

165
00:23:54.340 --> 00:24:01.950
P13: I'll just say, [DOB].

166
00:24:02.728 --> 00:24:04.840
P13: So we'll go continue.

167
00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.570
P13: Oh, so we did move to Section 2. Okay, that's good to know.

168
00:24:10.025 --> 00:24:22.320
P13: I think, because the other one was not a true progress bar. I kind of didn't rely on this as much, because I never knew when it was really gonna change. When I was at the end of a section. So sponsors identification.

169
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:26.159
Renata: So.

170
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:26.650
Renata: It gives you

171
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:38.259
Renata: trouble if you do duplicate numbers, so I recommend making it more of a random string of numbers, or doing like 9, 8 at the end of that just a quirk of our test system that we're using.

172
00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:42.600
P13: Yeah, let's see if this will work.

173
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:52.869
P13: I think that's okay. This is sponsor's [SSN]. Okay. And now we'll ask you questions about the death of the sponsor. Have they died so in this scenario they died?

174
00:24:54.316 --> 00:24:56.800
Renata: No! You can say that they're alive.

175
00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:11.699
P13: And then sponsors address selection will send any important information about this form to this address. Does the sponsor live at previous standard address? So we'll say, yes. So that's helpful. That that's easy to enter.

176
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:24.730
P13: Then their mailing address. We'll send any important information about this application to the sponsors address. Okay? So they did pre fill this. Thank goodness, okay, that's good addresses on. Okay, got all that. That's

177
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:31.169
P13: perfect sponsors, contact information. So we can just do.

178
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.659
P13: or I don't even know if I did that right.

179
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:36.720
P13: Yeah.

180
00:25:39.832 --> 00:25:55.120
P13: and then add applicants. Next, we'll ask to enter the information about each applicant. This includes social security mailing, address, contact, information relationship to the sponsor. You can add up to 25. Wow! So this would be where the

181
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.420
P13: was. It like a dependent child is added. Is that what we were doing?

182
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:04.925
Renata: Yeah. So this is where you're gonna enter the information for you and a dependent child.

183
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.610
P13: Oh, okay, yeah, I almost forgot I was applying

184
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.263
P13: For myself as well.

185
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:20.779
P13: okay, I think because you have to enter the sponsor. My mind was on the sponsor more than

186
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:25.988
P13: what we're here for, which is, you know, the benefits for the the people.

187
00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:45.730
P13: who will get the benefits? So what are we doing here? This applicant is missing information. Edit. Complete this applicant's information. Okay. So this might just be done on purpose, because this is a test site. But I don't recall a date of birth there. So I think that's what it wants.

188
00:26:46.422 --> 00:26:49.079
P13: Unless I skipped it. I don't.

189
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.850
P13: Oh, maybe I skipped it.

190
00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:51.970
Renata: I'm gonna be annoying.

191
00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.510
Renata: Do you think you skipped it, or is this new?

192
00:26:54.510 --> 00:27:04.779
P13: I don't think I skipped it. I don't think I skipped it. Yeah, or if I did it, what I mean this all says required. Oh, it says required. And then the date of birth here. Okay.

193
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.560
P13: yeah, maybe I did. But I don't think I did.

194
00:27:09.765 --> 00:27:12.210
P13: Social security number.

195
00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:22.949
P13: That's interesting. Now it's a small J. I'm pretty sure I did a big J, that in real life that would annoy me. I don't know if I can go back to the previous page. See, it's a big J there, interesting. Must be a quirky

196
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.160
P13: system.

197
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:25.590
P13: Okay

198
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:32.550
P13: Social security number. So okay, I understand what you said before.

199
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.689
P13: All right. So we'll send any important information about this application to this address.

200
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:48.989
P13: Okay, so this is the applicant myself. So go ahead and do save and continue.

201
00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.509
P13: And then the phone number is there, and then the email address.

202
00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:00.295
P13: So I'm just wondering here.

203
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:09.649
P13: I feel like I entered stuff at the beginning. That was my information, and now it's getting re-entered again.

204
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:30.450
P13: so I don't know if that's the correct recollection. But I understand. It's carrying over addresses, but I'm kind of wondering like, why did I have to put my stuff at the beginning? I get the sponsor, but now I'm reentering my stuff so I don't understand what that's about. If that's really what happened, there is starting to feel redundant.

205
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:40.219
Renata: Okay. And if you were doing this for real on va.gov, would that be a point of frustration? Would that necessitate a call, or would you just continue?

206
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:45.082
P13: I would just continue and just figure it was a quirk of the application.

207
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.965
Renata: Understood.

208
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:50.050
P13: [NAME]'s sex listed at birth.

209
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:57.639
P13: What's [NAME]'s Sex listed at birth? Enter the sex that appears on [NAME]'s birth certificate. Okay.

210
00:29:01.727 --> 00:29:04.409
P13: [NAME]'s relationship to the sponsor.

211
00:29:05.568 --> 00:29:14.539
P13: What's [NAME]'s relationship to the sponsor depending on your response? You may need to submit proof of marriage or dependent status with this application.

212
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:20.539
P13: So spouse or partner from a legal union, including a civil union or common law marriage?

213
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.299
P13: Interesting. I didn't know they did the civil union

214
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.880
P13: thing that they recognize that. Okay? So we'll do spouse

215
00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:50.199
P13: like, I would just move on. But honestly, like, I didn't think that they did civil union. So that's just interesting to me. Right now I would go to chatgpt in real life, and I would ask what this is all about because it's just different than my understanding, potentially a good thing. But I just it's unexpected.

216
00:29:51.033 --> 00:29:52.949
P13: So I would go forward.

217
00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:02.249
P13: Edit [NAME]'s date of marriage to the sponsor. If you don't know the exact date and to your best guess.

218
00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:08.579
P13: we won't need the marriage certificate unless we can't find a record of the marriage in our system. Okay.

219
00:30:10.057 --> 00:30:13.392
P13: date of marriage required. So we'll just say,

220
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.730
P13: Same year.

221
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.319
P13: Go forward.

222
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.360
P13: [NAME]'s information has been updated.

223
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.539
P13: The date of birth is then, which is, I think, different than what I entered.

224
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:36.430
Renata: Yeah, there's a there's a known bug, it goes, it goes minus. One day. We, our engineers are on that. Okay, alright.

225
00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:44.879
P13: So, yep, spouse, do you have another application applicant? So I do for the child, I believe. So we'll do "yes."

226
00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.230
P13: and we'll go ahead and do.

227
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:59.740
P13: and oh, none of that, and then we'll do the date of birth.

228
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:12.640
P13: Let's see, we'll just do there social security number.

229
00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:23.219
P13: And then does [DEPENDENT] have the same mailing address as another person? It will say yes.

230
00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.709
P13: and we'll go forward.

231
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.470
P13: Any information will go to that address.

232
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:35.700
P13: [DEPENDENT], mailing address that put that in there for me to verify which is good. We'll go forward.

233
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.820
P13: And then the [DEPENDENT] contact information.

234
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:45.400
P13: And then email address.

235
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.090
P13: what's the problem with the number? Probably didn't enough.

236
00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.419
P13: Alright! There we go, and then we'll go to whatever's next.

237
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:08.330
P13: So far straightforward. [DEPENDENT]'s sex listed at birth. 

238
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:10.240
P13: So we'll do female

239
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:27.710
P13: [DEPENDENT] relationship to the sponsor. What's [their] relationship to the sponsor depending on your response, you may need to submit proof of marriage or dependent status with your application. So, child, we will say.

240
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.920
P13: including adopted children or stepchildren.

241
00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:42.640
P13: [DEPENDENT], children's dependent status. Biological child?

242
00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:46.420
P13: Okay, got it. I understand the option. We'll do biological.

243
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:53.869
P13: And then review your applicants. So we've got Jim Smith at, you know. That's the information there.

244
00:32:54.484 --> 00:33:04.229
P13: I also notice it's putting this in small small cap situation here, which is kind of interesting. Maybe when it's live it won't do that.

245
00:33:05.102 --> 00:33:08.120
P13: And then [NAME] is there

246
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:13.270
P13: and do you have another child or another applicant. No, I don't.

247
00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.179
Renata: Alright. You can pause right here for a

248
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:15.510
P13: Moment.

249
00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:29.499
Renata: So just gonna give you that scale question again. So, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to complete sections, 1 through 3 of the form.

250
00:33:32.122 --> 00:33:36.780
P13: As far as ease. I would say it was a 5 I don't

251
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.260
P13: I don't recall if I said I would make a call to the

252
00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:52.800
P13: CHAMPVA number or not so. But I think it just felt a little redundant at the beginning, but that didn't necessarily make it hard. It just made it seem longer than it needed to be.

253
00:33:53.110 --> 00:34:05.919
Renata: Okay in an ideal world. Would you want to see a more like less redundancy in this experience? I think I asked you before, if that would be something that would frustrate you, and sort of make you stop, or whether you would keep going?

254
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:22.339
P13: Yeah, what I saw wouldn't make me stop. But it feels like the I feel it feels like I like here on [NAME]. It feels like I entered [NAME] at the beginning, and then, when it got to entering the covered information, I entered [it] again, so that felt

255
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:39.900
P13: like. I don't understand what that's all about. Why not just have me start with the sponsor, then have me do Jim Smith and Daisy Jones, or whatever what's going on with that? So if that's if I'm accurately remembering that that seems cause I don't know what that was used for at the beginning. What did I do that for.

256
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:41.000
Renata: Okay.

257
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.269
P13: That's what I would wonder.

258
00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:51.349
Renata: And to your recollection. Do you know why it asked you that information? Your information before it asked for you, the sponsors, information or not, something that you recall.

259
00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:59.780
P13: I don't recall that. I mean it seems like they would have told me. But

260
00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:24.629
P13: but I mean to me, it makes sense to. It's kind of counterintuitive. But to put the sponsor first, because you can't get this benefit unless you have someone that qualifies for the sponsor, as they call it. So if I saw that that was the 1st step, because I'm familiar, like with

261
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:48.090
P13: how this works in the sense of you have to have done so, you know. So instead of the 100% or all that, so I would, it would make sense to get that out of the way to just 1st slip and figure out. Does this veteran have the 100% to qualify anyone who's an applicant for benefits for CHAMPVA like that's why it would make sense if that was at the beginning.

262
00:35:48.480 --> 00:36:04.799
P13: They could always say something, you know, in English and say, Okay, so we're gonna start where you enter the sponsors information, so we can verify that they are eligible for CHAMPVA for their dependents like, if there was just a short paragraph, I'd go, okay, that makes sense to me, and that would set my expectations.

263
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:20.379
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you for sharing so I'm gonna have you click that continue button. Now we're gonna go on to the next screen and just before we click on anything. Just take a look at this page. Let me know if you have any questions about it. Anything that stands out.

264
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:31.200
P13: So do you have any Medicare to report for one or more applicants? If any applicants have medicare, you're required to report that you process your application for CHAMPVA.

265
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:46.279
P13: So I understand, as someone who has CHAMPVA and has had to know the ins and out, so that I understand what this is saying. So in this scenario, you know, I don't know how much the person would really know. But

266
00:36:46.834 --> 00:36:54.195
P13: and then this is more like. I don't know that I knew this level of it back in 2020 when I applied.

267
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:58.250
P13: But I know what this is about, and why they're asking it.

268
00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:07.640
Renata: Okay. And thinking back to when you initially applied. Do you remember having answering any questions about Medicare or health insurance providers?

269
00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:24.789
P13: I don't, but it wouldn't surprise me. Because I know that you know Medicare is becomes the primary when you reach, when you get on Medicare. I believe so. And I know that they asked about other health insurance information for sure that that was asked about because

270
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.199
P13: of how CHAMPVA works.

271
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:36.239
Renata: Okay. And thinking back to the information you saw on that 1st page we looked at today, do you recall if it mentioned Medicare or health insurance at all?

272
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.396
P13: I don't recall seeing that I think I would have remembered that

273
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:47.289
P13: somewhere. I thought something about other health insurance was mentioned, but not Medicare, which I know is a kind of a form of health insurance.

274
00:37:48.060 --> 00:38:04.330
Renata: All right, and I've asked you this before, but unfortunately repeating questions. Now, if you were filling this out today, would you have the information about Medicare or other health insurance on hand? Or would you need to pause and stop and collect that information before proceeding?

275
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.284
P13: If it was Medicare

276
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:21.650
P13: I've never been on it, but I feel like I would have that information if it was other health insurance which can vary from insurance provider to insurance provider. I feel like I would need to pause and well.

277
00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:29.089
P13: I might pause, but I don't know exactly what they need me to upload, if anything. So I might just proceed and just

278
00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:37.520
P13: hope that, and then just see what they need, and then go from there, and then maybe I need to pause to go gather the information. I just don't know what I need yet.

279
00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:51.000
Renata: Okay in an ideal world. Would you want it to give you a heads up of what you'd need for the Medicare and other health insurance section, or or would you sort of roll the dice and move forward and see what's gonna be asked?

280
00:38:51.280 --> 00:39:12.489
P13: In this scenario, where I'm not signed in with an account which I would definitely do an account, because I want everything saved. But I get that people won't. Some won't do that. So in that scenario I would want it here because I don't. I don't have to go through this again go through all the time that's being put in this in real life. So I wanna know

281
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.520
P13: as much as I can one

282
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:20.239
P13: now to to get that information. To do this as efficiently as possible.

283
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.360
Renata: Okay.

284
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:22.979
P13: And I just

285
00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.269
Renata: Oh, go ahead. Please.

286
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.890
P13: Just really quickly just thought of something whenever this is live is

287
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:42.270
P13: I assume this is gonna time out at some point in real life. So it would be really bad for someone to lose all their information, but not be told when it's gonna time out. So if that is true. Hopefully, they

288
00:39:43.070 --> 00:40:07.590
P13: can tell people upfront when it will time out or put a warning sign that comes up. Because that could create some real frustrations. If you're not told, if if you get called away from something going on at home which happens, and then you get back to some side conversation, and 45 min later you come back here and it's it times you out. It'd be like very frustrating.

289
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:15.000
Renata: Yeah, yeah, I completely understand that. Thank you for sharing for today, I'm gonna have you click. No on the Medicare question. And

290
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.700
Renata: then continue so from this point on.

291
00:40:20.475 --> 00:40:23.779
Renata: You can click no on this page as well. Sorry about that.

292
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:43.359
Renata: Okay, so for today's session, I'd like you to imagine that you and your dependent child have private health insurance. So I'd like you to go ahead and fill this section out with a health insurance plan for you and your dependent child, and then when we get to the end of that, I'm going to stop you and ask you some more questions.

293
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:49.079
P13: Okay, so do you have any other health insurance to report for one or more applicants?

294
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:54.180
P13: It's required to report it to process your application for CHAMPVA. So I'll say yes.

295
00:40:54.610 --> 00:41:02.270
P13: And then private or employer, sponsored insurance plan. Select the type of insurance plan or program the applicants are enrolled in.

296
00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:09.620
P13: You may find this information on the front of your insurance card. So there's HMO, PPO, medicaid, prescription drug program.

297
00:41:11.145 --> 00:41:18.780
P13: Other like specialty limited coverage and medigap, so does it matter which one I select here?

298
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.207
Renata: It does not matter at all. We're not testing you on that.

299
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.780
Renata: Yep, so I'll just do HMO.

300
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:29.680
P13: And click continue, and then name of their insurance provider.

301
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:39.819
P13: So we'll just put Aetna. You may find this start date on the declarations page of your insurance policy, for example, January 19th 2000.

302
00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:44.330
P13: So we'll just say, January one of this year.

303
00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:54.120
P13: Insurance termination date. Please enter...We'll just put December 31

304
00:41:55.250 --> 00:42:00.510
P13: end of the year. Only enter this date if the policy is inactive.

305
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:09.709
P13: Oh, for oh, okay. So I guess I shouldn't do anything here, because hypothetically, I don't think it would be inactive, so I think

306
00:42:10.539 --> 00:42:27.580
P13: I don't know. Maybe this would be for like...Because I know when you apply for CHAMPVA, sometimes it can go backwards because of when the veteran was approved for the 100%, so maybe you could still have that policy for a few months, but it's then gone inactive or something, I'm not sure but

307
00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:36.520
P13: So anyway, that's that's what you would enter there. So I'll go ahead and click continue.

308
00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:44.250
P13: Type of insurance for Aetna. Is this insurance through the applicants employer? Does that matter what I enter?

309
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.470
Renata: It doesn't matter. No.

310
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.060
P13: Okay, so we'll do no.

311
00:42:47.770 --> 00:43:02.670
P13: And then additional insurance additional. I'm sorry. Health insurance, additional comments, any additional comments about the applicants. Health insurance. Yeah, this is nice that they have this here whatever could come up to help them

312
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:12.929
P13: like idiosyncrasies about this situation. So I think that that's good. I'll just put none but I think it's good that that's there.

313
00:43:14.076 --> 00:43:22.000
P13: and then we'll go to continue. Which applicant or applicants has the plan. I think it was both of us. So we'll just do there.

314
00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.080
P13: upload Aetna health insurance card.

315
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:27.299
Renata: You'll need to like, I said.

316
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:27.650
P13: Okay.

317
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:36.902
Renata: Or like, I said earlier, I can provide you with a dummy document at this point for the uploads, or you can select just like a random picture on your desktop, or something to upload. We're not submitting anything.

318
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:42.380
P13: Right. You just give me a dummy one. If you have that. I don't know where my random stuff is.

319
00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.049
Renata: Yes, I can. I have it exactly for this purpose.

320
00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.560
Renata: So those will appear in the chat

321
00:43:56.156 --> 00:44:01.973
Renata: and to download those you're gonna yeah, there you go, so you'll have to save that to your desktop or something.

322
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.680
P13: Oh, okay, it's the same.

323
00:44:17.723 --> 00:44:22.430
P13: Okay, let's go to just the desktop downloads.

324
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:33.249
P13: Okay. So let's go back to go out here. And then the front of the insurance card in the back of it. Okay, so we'll go to this.

325
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.370
P13: and then we'll just

326
00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:42.969
P13: do the same thing for the back. Oh, do! Does that have to be different? Or can I just do this.

327
00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:43.980
Renata: It doesn't matter.

328
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:44.970
P13: That's completely fine.

329
00:44:45.696 --> 00:44:53.449
Renata: Anything confusing, though, on this page, unclear, was this what you expected when you were starting this section, that you'd need to upload this?

330
00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:23.950
P13: It doesn't surprise me. I don't know that the previous section said that this was coming up, but it they need. Some knows the comment section. So it doesn't surprise me. I like that. They tell me the format, the megabytes, or less. That's helpful. Because that could be frustrating sometimes when you're not told that, and you keep going back and forth trying to upload something. If you only have a paper copy, scan or take a photo and upload the image. Yeah, that's all good information. So I think it's it's good.

331
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:24.740
Renata: Okay.

332
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:26.540
P13: Do I continue?

333
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:27.720
Renata: Yeah.

334
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:37.310
P13: Report other health insurance. So if there was anything else, I would report that here. But I think we're gonna say, no on that. Is that right?

335
00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:49.999
Renata: Yeah, and we'll pause here for a moment. So I'm going to ask that 1 to 5 scale question again, 1 being very hard 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the Medicare and health insurance portion of this form?

336
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:54.469
P13: I thought it was a 5. Nothing really stood out as difficult.

337
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.670
Renata: Okay, got it. Any other feedback about this section before we proceed?

338
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:03.760
P13: No seem pretty straightforward from what I recall.

339
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:07.620
Renata: Got it. Okay, you can hit that continue button.

340
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:22.749
Renata: So like I said, we're not going to be submitting this application today. So this is going to be the last page that we look at without clicking. Submit, though I'd like you to review your application for champions for yourself and your dependent child.

341
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:36.749
P13: Okay. So I would just expand these, probably one at a time. I know you can do all of them, but I just try to take it in. So sign their information. Your name, mailing, address.

342
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:44.380
P13: contact, information, sponsor information which is the

343
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:52.270
P13: veteran and their address applicant information which is now, [SPOUSE and DEPENDENT], that that's where it seemed

344
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:57.770
P13: duplicative. So I don't know what the difference is between a signer and an applicant.

345
00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:06.369
P13: so that's that. This is great to be able to review all this. Make sure I didn't miss anything or

346
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.249
P13: review your plans. Do you have any other

347
00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:13.450
P13: plans? Do you have any plans to add?

348
00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.860
P13: Review your plans. Okay, no, there's no medicare.

349
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:31.370
P13: Well, I think this is referring. It says Medicare up here, but just says, Do you have any plans to add? So I guess that's what that's referring to. Or...

350
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:38.310
P13: yeah, I think this is a little confusing, and it might be like a prototype thing. But I don't know where the Aetna thing is.

351
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:44.260
P13: So this is yeah, I don't understand this. So Medicare...

352
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:51.380
P13: And then review your plans. You're saying it like there's different types of Medicare plans? I don't think that's really applicable.

353
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.490
P13: So do you have a notice of disallowance, denial

354
00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:17.360
P13: or other proof of eligibility for Medicare part A? I don't remember doing that. So I think there's just some prototype stuff here that's not matching up with my experience. And there should....So health insurance information. Okay, that's here. God, I didn't expand that. So that's there. But I still think that this Medicare is sounding a little bit different than what I experienced.

355
00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:29.380
Renata: So if this wasn't a prototype, if this was the live va.gov experience, what what would you expect to see here? That would be clearer than what you're seeing right now?

356
00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:43.320
P13: I just thought I said, no to "do you have Medicare" or something like that. And so I thought this was just gonna be no to that. But this is talking about. "Review your plans." Plural. Do you have any plans to add like

357
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:57.280
P13: Medicare? Would that be like the Medicare advantage? I'm not sure what they referred, what they were talking about with that. And then this part here I don't understand. I don't. I don't recall seeing this, so it's it's like getting into stuff that I didn't. I don't recall dealing with.

358
00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.997
Renata: Okay, that's fair.

359
00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:01.360
P13: This is okay here, though.

360
00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.459
P13: So other, yeah.

361
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:19.199
Renata: Okay, so would you expect to see something similar to that for the the Medicare? But it just sort of says like review or report report Medicare, and it just says No, or something like what it seems like. The health insurance is clear, but the Medicare is not, is what I'm hearing.

362
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:46.990
P13: Yeah. So the health insurance actually have health insurance to report. So I don't know what this would look like if I didn't have health insurance. What if it would be confusing like Medicare or not? But in this box it's very clear. But this, you know, they could put this in a box, too, following a similar format. So my eyes are already trained to look for certain things. So that would potentially make it less confusing. Besides, not putting in stuff that I don't recall

363
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.850
P13: seeing before.

364
00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:59.870
Renata: Okay. So I have a few questions for you about this page. Let's say you accidentally input some information wrong like your dependent child's name. How would you fix that.

365
00:50:00.381 --> 00:50:20.340
P13: I would just go to edit, and then expect to be taken to that page to edit her name, and then hopefully get me right back here. Sometimes with these experiences in general, you go edit, and then you they don't bring you back, and you're like, you gotta figure out how to get back to where you left off.

366
00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:31.239
Renata: Okay, noted. Thank you. So like, I said, we're not gonna submit the form today. But if you scroll down to the bottom and click, submit application. What would you expect to happen next?

367
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:33.270
P13: So.

368
00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:45.140
P13: So let's see, I confirm the identity, and this form is accurate. It's been represented. I've read and accept the those things. My full name. I certify the information. So I was correct and true.

369
00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:50.339
P13: I think it would just go for review, and I'm hoping that

370
00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:54.820
P13: because I don't see it here hopefully, after I hit submit, it will say

371
00:50:54.930 --> 00:51:02.970
P13: "your application has been submitted." It will send me an email confirmation and then an estimation of how long the review may take.

372
00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:12.709
Renata: Okay, got it. I do just wanna note we're almost at the top of the hour. Would you have a couple of minutes to stay over, or do you have a hard stop? 

373
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:13.150
P13: That's fine!

374
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:33.260
Renata: Great. So you mentioned in your ideal world, when you submit the form you're going to get that email that tells you how long it's going to take them to make a decision on your application. In your expectations, how soon do you expect to be notified about a decision being made on your CHAMPVA application?

375
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:47.119
P13: In my expectations. I mean to me it should be within a month, but the reality of it it can take, I don't know if it's 6-8 months, or how long it it can take. But it can take a while.

376
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:51.580
Renata: Okay, alright so. But in an ideal world it would be in within a month?

377
00:51:53.060 --> 00:52:06.209
Renata: Okay, and would you want to see any statuses on your application before being notified about a final decision, or just waiting until that 30 day mark to get the the notice?

378
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:19.449
P13: Oh, it would be great if there was a status you know, since hypothetically I could create an account, even though I didn't for this scenario, but if I created an account, and it could say statuses when I log in

379
00:52:19.982 --> 00:52:22.290
P13: that would be great, for sure.

380
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:35.569
Renata: And for those statuses and notices of a decision being made on your application. Do you expect to get those in your profile text message email, a letter mailed to you. What's what's your expectation here?

381
00:52:36.064 --> 00:52:39.299
P13: It could be it could be when I log in

382
00:52:39.747 --> 00:53:07.779
P13: it could also be email. Maybe I could select how I'm updated. Maybe I could tell them that information. I did. I did just recall that back in 2020 when I applied they, there would be a voice message when you called their number and it would say, we are opening mail, dated March 31, 2019 like, that's how you could get your update. So. This, if there was a way to get something better here, that'd be great.

383
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:23.964
Renata: Okay, got it. So just making sure that I understand: the call center would give you a a date that they were reviewing from in terms of applications, and you could sort of compare that against your submission date and know, like, okay, they're they're not to my submission date yet.

384
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:36.910
P13: Yeah. And there's actually an auto. A lot of times, those auto messages are annoying that companies do. But this was actually fine. It would cause. Then I didn't have to speak with someone, and I just knew, "Well, they're only up to March 31st"

385
00:53:37.524 --> 00:53:40.979
P13: You know, so they probably have an open mind or not.

386
00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:53.210
Renata: Okay, got it. So one last question for you here, it's that 1 to 5 scale again, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it for you to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits?

387
00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:06.100
P13: I mean overall. It was easy. I'm gonna give it a 3, just because I think this Medicare is a little bit confusing. But the rest of it is pretty clear.

388
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:07.030
Renata: Okay.

389
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:18.039
P13: And also I don't like that it doesn't have an estimation of time here, and I don't know if, when I submit it in real life if it would do that, because that's really key, and I don't know if this

390
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:36.920
P13: and help with that. But it falls into a black hole, is what it feels like. So if back to where we're talking about, if you could just log in and see a status, I'm not looking for an etched in Stone Date, but just knowing that somebody's dealing with it is a good thing.

391
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:55.140
Renata: Got it. Thank you for sharing that. So we're actually at the end of this portion of with the screen sharing so you can end, screen share, and also, you know, close out of this tab in your browser just a a few questions for you before we wrap up. Overall, was there anything that you saw in the session that worked really well for you?

392
00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:01.509
P13: Yeah, I think just having an application online. And for the most part.

393
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:12.500
P13: you know, with the exceptions of what I already explained, it's understandable. So, yeah, that was a good thing. I mean, if this was available when I was doing it, I would just do it online.

394
00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:14.572
Renata: Okay, got it

395
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:16.550
P13: And it's faster.

396
00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:22.850
Renata: Yeah, yeah. Was there anything, unclear, or that didn't work well for you that you saw in today's session?

397
00:55:25.368 --> 00:55:41.930
P13: Just some of the things I already talked about with the you know them talking about it being a champion application, and the and the menu the medicare thing we just talked about. Just just I would call it fine tuning rather than the whole thing needing an overhaul.

398
00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:58.020
Renata: Okay, that's fair. And now that you've been through the the online form, is there any additional information or research that you would recommend that a veteran or a spouse of a veteran do before completing the application for CHAMPVA benefits?

399
00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:19.270
P13: I would say, just be sure to click, even though we didn't do it, be sure to click on the other types of id you may need, or I forget what that section was called, but it was clickable. I would just say to them, you know, just make sure you click on that. So you have everything I know I'll say like I know it tells you some. But just click on that, just to be sure you have everything ready for when you're filling it out.

400
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:27.330
Renata: Got it. And what are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in this form? Not enough, just right, too much?

401
00:56:29.178 --> 00:56:38.400
P13: I think they could give just a little bit more like estimated. What happens with the application after you hit? Submit how long it might be estimated to take

402
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.679
P13: because it feels like

403
00:56:40.720 --> 00:57:08.959
P13: this was made by people that develop these things for online. And then they're like, Oh, those people will process it. That's their thing. Who knows what happens when it goes there? And really, for a user that's just as important, like what happens after? Because, yes, this is great that we have this nice form to do, but it's not great if it just falls in the same black hole that it did 5 years ago, or similar to that. So that's what I would say. The tweaking on some of the things I talked about

404
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:10.040
P13: messaging.

405
00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:10.550
Renata: Okay.

406
00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:18.300
Renata: got it. Thank you. And how would you compare the form you just completed to your experience with filling out that paper form in 2020?

407
00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:41.315
P13: You know, that doesn't really stick out as a horrible thing. I don't recall how many pages it was. But this has to be better, because it's online. And it wasn't too bad. So and now makes me wonder what was that form like? I imagine people could still fill the form out, though I don't know if it's changed. But I think that this is better.

408
00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:46.120
P13: even though I don't have that strong recollection of what the form was.

409
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:50.099
Renata: Got it any questions for me at this point?

410
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:56.960
P13: No, I'm just glad to be able to help out anything to make CHAMPVA better for people.

411
00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:10.840
Renata: Yeah, thank you. I wanna circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners, and as a reminder we remove all inner information that could be used to identify you before sharing. We only share it internally at the Va.

412
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:12.260
P13: Yeah, that's fine.

413
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:36.950
Renata: Okay, well, listen. We really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today, taking time out of your week. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the site and making sure it really works for veterans and their family members. And then, lastly, Perigan is going to be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, you can pass along to other veterans or spouses of veterans, you may know, to provide them the chance to participate in future research. Sessions like this.

414
00:58:37.276 --> 00:58:41.590
Renata: But I thank you so much. Have a great rest of your day. Have a great rest of your week. We really.

415
00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:41.960
P13: Appreciate it.

416
00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:42.770
Renata: This.

417
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:44.649
P13: Thanks you too. Bye.

418
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:45.660
Renata: Bye.
