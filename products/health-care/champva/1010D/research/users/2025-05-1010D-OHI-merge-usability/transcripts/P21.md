1
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:09.700
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:26.300
P21: I am. Let me know also that underneath my name, my face you're gonna see it say, the [group] because I'm the president of the [Association], just to let you know.

3
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.130
Renata: Okay.

4
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.009
P21: Why is showing that? Because my zoom account is made up.

5
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:52.779
Renata: Okay, got it perfect. Second question for you, are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our session today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any...? Okay, got it. With that, I just have some warm up questions for you before we look at that demo tool I mentioned. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

6
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.339
P21: I'm sorry. The what program?

7
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.870
Renata: The CHAMPVA program.

8
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.039
P21: The Champ?

9
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.990
Renata: CHAMPVA: the civilian health and medical program at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

10
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.319
P21: Is that where they send you out to a civilian

11
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.460
P21: specialist, or whatever from the VA?

12
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:23.079
Renata: No, this is specifically for medical and health care, for qualifying spouses and children of of veterans.

13
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.229
P21: I know I was with champers. That's not the same as champion, though.

14
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.875
Renata: Oh, no! They are

15
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.300
P21: Yeah, cause I have outside position, too. It.

16
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.250
Renata: Oh, okay.

17
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.450
Renata: So you you do community care.

18
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.962
Renata: Okay, got it

19
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.869
P21: And that's how's that different from

20
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:56.189
P21: like the VA they sent me to a different civilian dentist. That's a different program? 

21
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:06.390
Renata: Correct, it is a different program. Yeah, we're gonna be specifically talking about this benefit, which is for spouses and dependents of of qualifying veterans. But you know.

22
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.469
P21: It's in it, too.

23
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:19.059
Renata: Yeah, okay, so do you recall if, when you filled this out, if anybody helped, you apply for the benefit, like a VSO or a family member or friend?

24
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.600
P21: My wife probably did.

25
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.879
Renata: Okay, and aside from your wife, is anyone else enrolled in the program?

26
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.670
P21: Just my wife. It's just me and my wife. My kids are all grown and married now.

27
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.545
Renata: Okay

28
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:46.789
Renata: And have you ever had to file a form that's called the Other Health Insurance certification form, otherwise known as VA Form 10-7959?

29
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.350
P21: Can you hold a second? I got to ask my wife.

30
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.450
Renata: Okay.

31
00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:58.609
P21: [redacted] I have some memory loss. So let me just hold on.

32
00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.870
Renata: Yeah, not a problem.

33
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.429
P21: I'll be right back.

34
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.010
Renata: Okay.

35
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.929
P21: She's at the end of the house.

36
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.870
Renata: Not a problem.

37
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.660
P21: And she she's gonna be able to answer that. Help me to answer that one.

38
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.549
Renata: Okay. Do you want me to repeat the question?

39
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.109
P21: Soon as she gets in. She's.

40
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.010
Renata: Okay.

41
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.609
P21: I'm in here, [wife]

42
00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:42.319
P21: here's the question.

43
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.154
P21: Okay, this is my wife, Leela.

44
00:04:45.580 --> 00:05:03.719
Renata: Hi, there! Just a quick question for you. Have you ever filled out either the CHAMPVA (the civilian health and Medical program at VA) Application, or a form called the Other Health Insurance certification, or VA Form 10-7959?

45
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.389
P21 Spouse: It doesn't sound familiar, but he is contracted out for his dental.

46
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.800
Renata: Okay.

47
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:20.660
P21: They tell me, like Champs. No, we don't have champions. We've never filled out anything that doesn't sound familiar to me. But you go to Dr. [Name]

48
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.170
Renata: That's the outside doctor you're referring to earlier, right?

49
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.630
P21 Spouse: Not military, I know, but you fall under under

50
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:43.080
P21: under my yeah, but I can't go to the VA suite, not the Va. We're talking about civilian doctors like I could go to Dr. [Name]. I have, we have 

51
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.910
P21: Tricare for life.

52
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.909
Renata: Okay, got it. Yeah.

53
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.469
P21 spouse: But because he's retired. So we do have tricare for life.

54
00:05:50.790 --> 00:06:03.440
Renata: Okay, got it. Okay. So we're not gonna be asking about tricare. But I'll ask you some questions about something else and and we'll just keep going with this but good to know that that's your secondary, and thank you.

55
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.920
P21 spouse: Okay, that's it?

56
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.450
Renata: Yeah, that's it.

57
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.730
P21 spouse: Okay. Thank you.

58
00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:14.399
Renata: All right. A few more questions for warming up. Do you have a va.gov account?

59
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400
P21: I do

60
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.880
Renata: All right, and what has been your experience with logging into the site?

61
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.190
P21: No problem at all. Logging it in, I hit

62
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:48.539
P21: the app that I have on on my ipad, and it takes you to it you have to sign in. That's the only thing each time whereby the old way you could just go to hit a button and sign in. But here they got to wait on a confirmation email, that or text that not email text that they send you with a number that you have to put in.

63
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.099
P21: That is nerve wracking, but it's not hard. It's just

64
00:06:53.390 --> 00:07:06.620
P21: you have to go like I do this on my ipad, and then, when it that sends the code, it sends it to my phone, and I have to go to my phone and see the number, then enter it to log in.

65
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:14.019
Renata: Got it. Thank you for sharing your experience. What tasks are you doing when you log into va.gov?

66
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:20.739
P21: What task? Well, we...my wife uses it to

67
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:27.330
P21: order my medicine. Or if we have questions for the doctor, we could email it through.

68
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.450
P21: It's not called MyHealtheVet, it's called

69
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.879
P21: i-Gov, or something like that.

70
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.510
Renata: Okay.

71
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:50.557
P21: We send texts to the doctor. We check appointments. We check results from different tests, you know. Like, when you do your blood test things of that nature. We also receive texts from the doctor that we also

72
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:59.510
P21: What else? Oh, it works also when you have a claim, and you could check through

73
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.240
P21: through that also on different claims and things.

74
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:10.049
Renata: Got it. How often on average, are you logging into va.gov?

75
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.619
P21: I'm gonna say, maybe 3 times a week, 4 times a week.

76
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.850
Renata: Okay. Just a few more questions for you. What assistive technology are you using?

77
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.429
P21: What assistant technology, you said?

78
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.360
Renata: Yeah.

79
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:36.340
P21: You mean, like the CCTV, the magnifier, things of that nature, or what?

80
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.199
Renata: Yeah, yeah, but specifically on your ipad. What do you use?

81
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.360
P21: Well, I used the magnifier. I

82
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.719
P21: I use the browser is that we're referring to things like that.

83
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:58.030
Renata: Yeah, are you magnifying like, when you're in the browser and stuff? Okay.

84
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.000
P21: That's the only way I could see, ma'am.

85
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:15.779
P21: [Redacted]. I'm considered legally blind. I have a little vision. That's why I'm so close to the screen also, so I could try to see as far as here, what's going on.

86
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:22.509
Renata: Okay. And aside from Magnifier, do you use anything else to help you when you're in a browser?

87
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:33.320
P21: Sometimes, not very often, I have to use voice over.

88
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.910
Renata: Okay.

89
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:43.610
P21: We also use the magnifier, the browser.

90
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:55.030
P21: I don't know what else that could use it for. I mean pictures and make videos on it.

91
00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:04.850
Renata: Okay, and how would you rate your level of experience with using a screen magnifier: beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert?

92
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:17.489
P21: I use it every time I'm on here. To that I can magnify like I can't magnify this portion. But when I'm anytime I receive text message. I got my.

93
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.470
P21: my, my thing pretty big. I'll show you here on my phone.

94
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.109
P21: I got the writing real big. Let me go into something that you can see.

95
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.770
P21: Can you see that? How big my writing is?

96
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:35.800
Renata: Yeah.

97
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.150
P21: Like I'm at 18 or 20

98
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:47.559
P21: 24, [font size] in order to see it.

99
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.370
Renata: Yeah.

100
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.250
P21: And let's see.

101
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.600
Renata: So you consider yourself, maybe an expert, then, with the magnification?

102
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.530
P21: I must say I'm pretty good at it.

103
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.015
Renata: Okay.

104
00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.660
P21: Always room for improvement.

105
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.500
Renata: Okay, how long have you been using a screen magnifier?

106
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.723
P21: Long time.

107
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:21.410
P21: On the gear. Since I've had my iphones, my ipad, and the computer, I've been using it.

108
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:28.719
P21: Oh, my goodness way, 2025, over 10 years or no.

109
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.220
Renata: Okay. Wow.

110
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:38.659
P21: Over 20 years, almost, if it's been around that long, because I'm thinking back when I

111
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.179
P21: had my when I went blind.

112
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:48.600
P21: and they had to do the operations to try to free up some space for me to see.

113
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.040
P21: I've been using it ever since then.

114
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:58.959
Renata: Oh, wow! Okay, have you ever shared your screen in zoom while using the magnifier before?

115
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.269
P21: I don't know if I've used zoom

116
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:18.140
P21: zoom and magnifier you when you say zoom, you refer to zoom like we're on now, zoom like you just making your letters big and small?

117
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.560
Renata: Zoom like we're in now and sharing screen in it.

118
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.610
P21: I don't think you could use it on here, I if I can. I don't know about it.

119
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:35.579
Renata: Okay, well, Jamie's our expert. So don't worry about that. Is there anything else that we can do to support you during this session?

120
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.000
P21: hmm.

121
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:53.790
P21: cool.

122
00:12:54.950 --> 00:13:03.369
P21: There's so many things that that I'd be thinking of. But I can't think of them right now, except, you know, dealing with the

123
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:11.519
P21: technology that's available. You could always try to go online. Like, if you want to learn something, you could.

124
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.080
P21: you could go online in the website or in Youtube, and and find it out that way.

125
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.190
Renata: Okay.

126
00:13:19.739 --> 00:13:29.209
Renata: Well, let us know if there's anything we can do to support during this session. But we're gonna move to the portion of the the session today, where we look at that coded prototype I told you about.

127
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.610
P21: Okay. Yes, ma'am.

128
00:13:31.152 --> 00:13:43.400
Renata: So I'm gonna have you silence any notifications on your device. Close out anything. And then I'm gonna share a link for you in the chat, so let me know when you're ready for that link.

129
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.619
P21: You say, close my notifications?

130
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.780
Renata: Yeah, silence any notifications that way, when we're screen sharing, they don't pop up.

131
00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:00.410
P21: Okay, do I have to go into my settings to do that?

132
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:06.550
Renata: Typically on an ipad, you can swipe down from the top, and then you can put it. There's like a

133
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.980
Renata: there's a settings mode.

134
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.050
Renata: Put it on like, do not disturb or focus.

135
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.450
P21: Do not disturb.

136
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.540
P21: Okay.

137
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.629
Renata: All right.

138
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.559
P21: Let me bring you back.

139
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.540
Renata: Okay.

140
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.270
P21: Okay I put do not disturb. That was the I never thought about that.

141
00:14:26.814 --> 00:14:43.079
Renata: I'll remind you at the end that you put it on so you can turn it back off and get your notifications. But at this time I'm gonna put that link to the demo tool in chat, and if you could open that link and then share your screen and let me know if you need any help. With that we can provide.

142
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.270
P21: Put it in, chat.

143
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.340
Renata: Yes.

144
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.180
P21: Okay

145
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:51.270
P21: And that's it, with a staging VA government?

146
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.240
Renata: Yes.

147
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:53.830
P21: Okay

148
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.959
P21: And it said, "Apply for CHAMPVA"

149
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:07.970
P21: No, Champ, it's camp. I don't know benefits. Okay, I'm here and I see you live.

150
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.649
P21: Face here, not your little face, but your face.

151
00:15:11.735 --> 00:15:14.900
Renata: So are you able to share your screen?

152
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:20.259
P21: Yeah. How do I do that?

153
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.399
Renata: So if you go, I see Jamie, you unmuted. You go ahead

154
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:31.030
Jamie: Oh, no, no! It sounds like you had it. But what you need to do is go back to Zoom

155
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.970
Jamie: so you can see all of us.

156
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.210
P21: Oh! And hit...

157
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.049
Jamie: And hit the green share button.

158
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:47.630
P21: Let me find the green share button as the stop video participant, raise your hand, chat

159
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.259
P21: and let me close this.

160
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.380
P21: I don't let me hit that menu, maybe. Oh, there it says, share

161
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:03.270
P21: hit the hit, the one with the arrow that says, Share.

162
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.150
Jamie: That's right.

163
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.929
P21: Okay, then I get what where you just say, screen.

164
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:09.540
Jamie: Yup.

165
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:19.339
Jamie: correct. Then there's 1 more thing. There's gonna be something that says start broadcast, which is kind of weird. But but.

166
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:30.259
P21: Okay, what came up. It says, everything on your screen, including notifications, will be record it enable.

167
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:36.920
P21: Okay, then, underneath this a screen broadcast, then it has zoom. Zoom is checked.

168
00:16:39.657 --> 00:16:43.080
Jamie: So it's like a menu with different options.

169
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:52.939
P21: It don't have menu. Just say it has a block with a button at the top, and it says, screen, browse, broadcast, zoom, or start broadcast.

170
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.190
Jamie: Oh, click, start broadcast.

171
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.230
P21: Okay, 3, 2, 1, okay.

172
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:07.860
Jamie: So now we can see your screen. So now what you're gonna do is go back.

173
00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:11.489
P21: It. I still got the little thing turning because I.

174
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:19.380
Jamie: Oh, yeah, you're you're good. That's trying to tell you like, "Hey, this is active right now."

175
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.019
P21: So in order to get rid of that, do I just press anywhere on the screen?

176
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:33.449
Jamie: Yeah, you're just gonna swipe up from the bottom of the screen. Yeah, you're good. So now you can go back to your browser, since you already opened.

177
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.499
P21: Okay. I'm there.

178
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.550
Jamie: Yeah, we can see it.

179
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.740
P21: Okay.

180
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.850
Renata: Perfect.

181
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:38.429
Jamie: Thank you so much.

182
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:53.089
Renata: We're rocking and rolling. So just a few things before we start playing around with this form to be aware of. Like, I said before, this is our testing site so nothing. What we click on today is not gonna have any bearing on your benefits

183
00:17:53.160 --> 00:18:03.099
Renata: as we go through the form feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers, if you don't feel comfortable using real information.

184
00:18:03.467 --> 00:18:29.079
Renata: There's a couple of screens that you may see in this form that ask you to upload a document. We're not actually going to be submitting the form today. But when we get to those pages. I can offer you a dummy Pdf, it just has fake information in it. I'll let you know when we get to those pages and just remind you that I can offer that that document to you when the time comes. Any questions for me, though, before we get started.

185
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:41.889
Renata: All right, so you can scroll up and down this page. But I'd like you not to click on anything yet. But just take a look at what the information on this page says, and let me know your initial thoughts.

186
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.379
P21: What have happened? 3. Again.

187
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.600
P21: you see.

188
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.810
P21: Been approved.

189
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.770
P21: Okay.

190
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.379
P21: This is what you need to apply.

191
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.980
P21: [unclear].

192
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.240
P21: Option.

193
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.889
P21: Okay? Sure. Sure.

194
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:38.730
P21: Okay, it's like they just telling you how to sign up and things that are gonna be required.

195
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:40.200
Renata: Okay.

196
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:48.400
Renata: got it. So a couple of questions for you. Do you know, if you are on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

197
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:54.140
P21: It says, Apply for

198
00:19:54.370 --> 00:20:10.239
P21: CHAMPVA benefits, and then they say, Follow, just going on down to say it follow the steps to apply. So I'm on the correct place page to apply for the CHAMPVA benefits, and then

199
00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.870
P21: course, it had different steps underneath it.

200
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.020
P21: So I'm on the right page, I reckon.

201
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:26.189
Renata: Got it and above where it says, "Apply for CHAMPVA benefits" there's 3 small links. They say, "va.gov home," Lvc champva,"

202
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.510
P21: Right.

203
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:33.999
Renata: And the 3rd one says, "1010 d Extended." What does 1010 d Extended mean to you? If anything.

204
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:42.120
P21: It's 10 days worth of work, or oh, 10 days.

205
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:50.219
P21: like when you're looking at my appointments, I could select 10 days at a time to watch, or 20 days at a time.

206
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:59.480
P21: That is set up to go for 10 days. It's extended to show 10 days or 10. Yeah. 10 days at a time.

207
00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.079
Renata: Okay, so it's showing 10 day increments. Okay.

208
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.620
P21: Yeah, 10 day increments.

209
00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:15.139
Renata: All right. A few more questions about the information on this page. Do you know how to check your eligibility for CHAMPVA benefits for you and your spouse?

210
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:24.889
P21: Instruction one tells you to check your eligibility. I guess I'll have to

211
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.169
P21: hit where it says, "find out if

212
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:33.290
P21: you're eligible for CHAMPVA benefits," I would have to hit that.

213
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:45.619
Renata: Okay, we're not going to click on it today. I know it's tempting. But I'm just curious about that. So next question for you, what information do you think you'll need to fill out this application for you and your spouse?

214
00:21:47.883 --> 00:21:53.119
P21: It's under Step 2, where it says, "gather your information."

215
00:21:53.590 --> 00:22:02.680
P21: And it tells you that they're gonna need personal information about you and anyone else you're applying for

216
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:11.010
P21: personal information about your spouse, the veterans or service members

217
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:22.779
P21: You're connected to this data will include birthday, social security, numbers and contact information

218
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.960
P21: and everything down in Section 2 of the different steps to.

219
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.359
Renata: Got it.

220
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.290
P21: To see if we are eligible for it.

221
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:45.040
Renata: Okay. And if if you were on va.gov, filling this out for real today, would you have all of that information on hand, or would you need to pause and go collect it before starting the form?

222
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.479
P21: The way I would do it if I need to fill this out.

223
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.759
Renata: Yeah, yeah.

224
00:22:51.430 --> 00:23:10.450
P21: I would read the whole thing 1st to see, to give me an oversight of what I'm gonna be looking to do, and I can always come back to each page as I go. Like number one, I'll hit "Find out if you're eligible," read all that, and I can go back to

225
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.849
P21: find number 2, read all it, and then go back down where it said.

226
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.840
P21: find out which documents I'll need to apply

227
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:26.290
P21: to be to for the CHAMPVA Benefits.

228
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:45.120
P21: And then, of course, I just come back to 3, or it may have different steps after each one, but they say in step 3 when you take it, take you through each step of the process. It should take about 15 min. Okay, and then it.

229
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.659
P21: Everything's right there.

230
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.086
Renata: Okay, all right.

231
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.619
Renata: so, Jamie, do you have a question?

232
00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:09.859
Jamie: Yeah, I was just wondering, like, I can see the text being magnified, and I was wondering how you're doing it. Are you just like pinching and zooming with your fingers in and out?

233
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.850
P21: Oh, yeah, I'm zooming in and out.

234
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:14.630
Jamie: Perfect.

235
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.560
P21: And sliding.

236
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.669
Jamie: I'll write that down. Just so I know what's going on. Thanks so much.

237
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.520
P21: Okay

238
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:29.533
Renata: All right, I have one more question for you before we start the application: on a scale of 1 to 5 with one being

239
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:40.769
Renata: Poor and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin? Based on the information on this page.

240
00:24:41.060 --> 00:25:04.850
P21: Just judging from this 1st page finding out if I'm eligible, finding out if my wife eligible. Everything seems like it's going to be included in each step. Once I go through each step, then it just looking at this, I will say it's good information. Now the steps in between there may signify something different.

241
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.990
Renata: Okay

242
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:07.530
Renata: So yeah.

243
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:13.819
Renata: So on that 1 to 5 scale, what would you put it? As like a 5, being very well informed, or 4?

244
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.359
P21: Yeah, I'll say I'm pretty well informed about this page.

245
00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:24.900
Renata: Okay. But it's what might be involved in each one of those steps that you're not quite sure on?

246
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:25.820
P21: But I'll do it.

247
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:35.930
Renata: Okay, so I'm gonna have you scroll down the page a little ways. There is a big blue box that mentions signing in. We're not gonna

248
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:36.520
Renata: sign into.

249
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:47.759
Renata: Yeah, if you keep going down further towards the bottom of the big blue box, there's a link that says, "start your form without signing in." We're gonna click on that. Yeah, right there.

250
00:25:48.290 --> 00:26:12.960
Renata: go ahead. Okay. So at this point, I'm going to have you start this form as if you were applying for your spouse and one other family member, and maybe you have a dependent child. We can make one up to it today. I'll let you pause. Wow! I can't talk today. I'll let you know when we're going to pause and ask some questions. But to help orient you, you're going to complete the 1st 3 sections of the form.

251
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:26.910
Renata: and then a couple of reminders for you. This is our testing site, and you can feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions as you go through the form, please remember to think out loud. We want to hear any reactions as you're experiencing them.

252
00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:31.650
P21: Understood, and you want me to do the 1st 3 out of the whole 6?

253
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:37.289
Renata: Out of the whole 6, yeah, but I'll remind you as we go whether we're pausing or not.

254
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:49.879
P21: Understood. Okay, your information, once my information..."it may take some time to complete this form, sign in to save

255
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.180
P21: your progress.

256
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:58.250
P21: We can also pre-fill some of the information

257
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:06.530
P21: for you." Okay, now, this is only a test page. So I'm gonna sign in to start my application.

258
00:27:07.272 --> 00:27:11.457
Renata: We're not gonna click the sign in today. We're actually gonna do it unauthenticated.

259
00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.339
P21: Let me go back!

260
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:18.469
Renata: Totally okay. But if you were doing this for real on va.gov, would you sign in at this point?

261
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:33.289
P21: I probably would. But let's say normally what I didn't do that time. What I said before to go through the whole page 1st

262
00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:42.369
P21: to see to give me an insight of what I'm gonna be doing. And right now you I was going on what you told me to fill out the 1st 3

263
00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:47.969
P21: sections of the thing. That's the only reason why I went to sign in.

264
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.339
Renata: Oh, got it! Okay.

265
00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:54.450
P21: No reason why I did that, because I was under pressure. You want me to go into it.

266
00:27:54.919 --> 00:28:02.969
Renata: Yeah, we're gonna fill out the application as if we don't have a va.gov account today. So sorry for for being misleading, there.

267
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:07.509
P21: Oh, no, okay. So here will I sign in here.

268
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.520
Renata: No, we'll we'll proceed without clicking that.

269
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:15.439
P21: Right. I'm trying to answer your question. You were saying, will I sign in earlier.

270
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.780
Renata: Oh, normally, yeah.

271
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:22.819
P21: Okay. Normally, I would read everything. I'm gonna take it that we haven't talked about. Fill out the 1st 3.

272
00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:23.970
Renata: Okay.

273
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.560
P21: It stays here.

274
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.120
P21: Which of these best describe you?

275
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:35.339
P21: I'm applying for benefits for myself.

276
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:41.650
P21: I'm a veteran applying for benefits for my spouse, our dependent.

277
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.120
P21: Okay, I'm

278
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:54.067
P21: a representative notebook like Nope. And then they said, Continue need help. I don't need to help right now. So really I would.

279
00:28:54.770 --> 00:29:01.889
P21: I don't need my information. I will go down to where number 2 here says

280
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:11.339
P21: I'm a veteran applying for benefits for my spouse Independent. I would hit that first, and then I'll hit continue.

281
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.170
Renata: Okay. Sounds good.

282
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.180
P21: Did you want me to do that, or.

283
00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.430
Renata: Yes, please.

284
00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.620
P21: Then I'll hit. Continue.

285
00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.100
Renata: Yes, please.

286
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:34.350
P21: Okay, and my name, information need help? No.

287
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.000
P21: you want me to fill everything in?

288
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:38.120
Renata: Yes, please.

289
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.530
Renata: Yes, it does not have to be your real information.

290
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.010
P21: It worked

291
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.669
P21: I got the auto-fill [prefill] on.

292
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:49.090
P21: I just put something else.

293
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.319
P21: I don't have the suffix thing.

294
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.750
P21: Let me hit continue.

295
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:13.770
Renata: Okay.

296
00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:25.349
P21: A mailing address within important escalation. Not just application to your address.

297
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.059
P21: Okay, I live on the US. Military base. Nope.

298
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:39.949
P21: that's not the Us. Learn more next, street street.

299
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.449
P21: Okay, go ahead to fill this out.

300
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.939
P21: I will pretend I'm still living on a military base.

301
00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:49.580
P21: If that's okay.

302
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.780
Renata: That is quite all right.

303
00:30:53.650 --> 00:31:00.770
P21: Okay, learn more about military base, etc. No let me take that off.

304
00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:04.440
P21: I'll put

305
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.580
P21: okay. I filled all that out.

306
00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.809
Renata: Alright, no questions or issues with that?

307
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.120
P21: Everybody fine with that?

308
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.190
Renata: Yup, if you're fine with it, then I'm fine with it.

309
00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:18.740
P21: Okay.

310
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:23.390
P21: continue.

311
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.560
Renata: Yes.

312
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.960
P21: Initial information.

313
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.920
P21: We use this information to contact you.

314
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:35.100
P21: Careful.

315
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.279
P21: We have half more questions

316
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.169
P21: since y'all have all the information already.

317
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:51.440
P21: Oh, oh.

318
00:32:53.191 --> 00:32:58.080
Renata: This is a quirk, sometimes with Autofill. It might make you fill it in the the long way.

319
00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.699
P21: Wait. Wait!

320
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.800
P21: How's that? Should break love?

321
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.699
P21: Okay?

322
00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.159
P21: Oh, oh, if you get my phone number again.

323
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.869
P21: I guess I got to go more realistic phone number.

324
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:08.329
Renata: It might not like that. You left a space between the area code and the the rest of the number.

325
00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.979
P21: Just take all of that.

326
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:17.200
Renata: Yeah. Sorry the the the demo site can be a little picky with format sometimes.

327
00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:26.429
P21: Okay, we're gonna have back. Continue. Okay, spouse information.

328
00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:28.940
P21: Okay.

329
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:36.550
P21: Now, we'll ask you to enter information about the veteran, the spouse.

330
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:44.699
P21: Remember that the application is correct for [unclear] spouse. Okay.

331
00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:54.880
P21: with, you. Let's see, spouse name. So secure number and status confirm the eligibility.

332
00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:02.800
P21: Have benefits. We will not me. You to upload the data.

333
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:05.480
P21: DD-214.

334
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:11.030
P21: Okay, continue, you wanted me to continue on correct?

335
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.110
Renata: Yes, please. Yeah, I'll let you know when we're hitting pause.

336
00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:15.040
P21: Okay.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:19.800
P21: Sponsor's, name and date of birth, sponsor's name

338
00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.610
P21: and date of birth. Right here.

339
00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:41.780
P21: Information to confirm eligibility for CHAMPVA we open up some detail based you provided early...

340
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.699
P21: If you need to make change, you can do so.

341
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:51.680
P21: But sponsor's name is...[starts filling it out]

342
00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:01.780
Renata: Just to make sure that I'm checking my own understanding.

343
00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.992
Renata: Who do you think this section is asking you to fill out for?

344
00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:14.099
P21: It's asking about information from my spouse who I want to see if she's eligible.

345
00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:21.700
Renata: Okay, so based on what you saw at the top of this screen and on the previous screen, that's your understanding of what we're we're asking for here?

346
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:29.659
P21: Right because I hit "I want to enroll my spouse and dependent," and here I'm just putting

347
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:34.879
P21: When I filled all that out, going to the next page where it wants that spouse information.

348
00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:35.970
Renata: Okay.

349
00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:38.580
P21: That's the only one I'm continuing on.

350
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.280
Renata: Okay, perfect. Thank you. I just wanted to check my understanding.

351
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.140
P21: Okay.

352
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:04.999
P21: okay. Loving me. Wife, I mean, yeah, lovingly. Dope. That's fine.

353
00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:12.970
P21: I'm having fun here!

354
00:37:13.893 --> 00:37:14.940
Renata: We're glad!

355
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.250
P21: The one who's subname.

356
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:40.950
P21: Oh, suffix that suffix that date of birth...okay...

357
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:43.910
P21: [date]

358
00:37:47.621 --> 00:37:54.820
P21: I'm put that same date. I hope it don't mess up nothing?

359
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:56.720
P21: Yeah.

360
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.870
P21: continue

361
00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:12.980
P21: Your identification information.

362
00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.699
P21: I'm not gonna put my number. I'm just put numbers.

363
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.349
Renata: Okay, just so, you know.

364
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:26.160
Renata: our test system's a little cranky. If you put 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. So if you make it a little bit different than that.

365
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:26.740
P21: Okay.

366
00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:27.610
Renata: Perfect.

367
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:33.960
P21: Okay, they had to put there should automatically do it.

368
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.650
Renata: No dashes needed.

369
00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:47.359
P21: There's too many numbers. 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, yeah, too many numbers.

370
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:57.920
P21: No, I think that's enough numbers.

371
00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.380
Renata: All right, perfect.

372
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.790
P21: Continue?

373
00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:01.780
Renata: Yes.

374
00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:03.970
P21: Okay.

375
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:09.840
P21: The mailing address with information put in.

376
00:39:14.087 --> 00:39:16.450
P21: I thought I went through that already?

377
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:25.760
Renata: Okay. So seeing this screen, is

378
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.230
Renata: it? It seems like you've already seen this screen before?

379
00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:41.909
P21: Yeah, I'm just looking at it, says, "step 2," my address, [address].

380
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.380
P21: Yeah. I've been through all that. I'm hit it, anyway, because it's all filled up.

381
00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.730
Renata: Okay.

382
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:55.190
P21: Okay, why do you guys brought up your contact information?

383
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.680
P21: Why is it going back?

384
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:11.159
P21: Let me hit continue again. See if it's gonna rotate again.

385
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.190
P21: Okay, little like something different here.

386
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:30.570
P21: and application next will act you to enter the information about each application, each applicant, this inclusive care number

387
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:36.640
P21: you can.

388
00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:38.949
P21: And it took my phone.

389
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:43.639
P21: I would. Just, I want to add my other dependent.

390
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:44.500
P21: Because that's what.

391
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:44.870
P21: Okay

392
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:45.929
P21: Okay

393
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.250
Renata: Yes, please.

394
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:48.799
P21: Don't need information, [Son] don't have a social security number.

395
00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:53.769
Renata: Your dependent doesn't have a social social security number?

396
00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.380
P21: It's only one years old.

397
00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:03.769
Renata: Okay. So if you're filling this out for real, and you had a 1 year old, would you have to stop the form here, or what would happen?

398
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.279
P21: When you're saying, what would I do?

399
00:42:12.425 --> 00:42:15.120
P21: That's when I have to get help.

400
00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:18.650
Renata: Okay. Would you call the VA? or

401
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:20.260
P21: I would call.

402
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:27.930
P21: [Reading page] "If you have trouble using this online form, call this number

403
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:32.800
P21: if you need help gathering your information

404
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:40.040
P21: filling out this form." I could contact the local VA or service organization

405
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:45.839
P21: right there, or probably be easier to call that 1-800 number.

406
00:42:46.270 --> 00:43:00.281
Renata: Okay, for the sake of time today, during the session, we'll just invent a social for our one year old dependent like, I said again. It can't be 1 through 9, and we can't do like a lot of repeated digits.

407
00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:01.740
P21: You want me to start

408
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:02.470
P21: with a social.

409
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.660
P21: I could fake another.

410
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.300
Renata: Yeah, absolutely.

411
00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:07.540
Renata: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

412
00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:25.299
P21: No junior edit address.

413
00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.620
P21: You Continue

414
00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:12.180
P21: just verifying your address.

415
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:14.960
P21: Continue

416
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:03.710
P21: too many numbers soon.

417
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:05.519
P21: I'm not sure.

418
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:10.780
P21: So

419
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:20.650
P21: continue. Okay, what's [Dependent]

420
00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:23.490
P21: Put Junior.

421
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:35.200
P21: Continue what is [dependent's]...what's his relationship to the spouse, dependent?

422
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:44.060
P21: Oh, you're the sponse. "You may need to submit proof of marriage."

423
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.320
P21: Oops.

424
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:57.690
P21: Oh!

425
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:11.010
P21: What can we do during this dependant status depending your response?

426
00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:13.689
P21: You may need to submit.

427
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:15.030
P21: Poof of

428
00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.150
P21: His dependency status.

429
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:35.800
P21: Okay? Well, they ask a lot of questions, don't they?

430
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:38.090
P21: Okay

431
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:44.480
Renata: All right. I'm gonna stop you here and ask some questions unless you'd like to review the dependent first?

432
00:46:45.342 --> 00:46:56.139
P21: I couldn't verify the social security number, because I don't remember what I put it. I could only go on what they say here and say, no, I don't.

433
00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:02.969
P21: I don't have to fill out nothing else. I don't have to hit that. No, at the bottom. Okay.

434
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.880
P21: so I'm here now.

435
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:14.510
Renata: Okay, so was anything that you saw in this 1st 3 sections of the form confusing, or unexpected?

436
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:16.929
P21: When I was going through it, and it showed

437
00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:18.959
P21: when it seemed like you were

438
00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:38.499
P21: asking the same information on the address and and things of that nature like when you did your spouse. And they went back actually for the address, the street, and all that twice, and they did it again the same thing when you put your of the dependent. I didn't understand why

439
00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:44.470
P21: they did it all that did did it like that. Because

440
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:52.190
P21: if you're living in the same house they should you put live together, whatever something simpler.

441
00:47:52.670 --> 00:48:01.149
Renata: Okay. So I think what I'm hearing you say is in an ideal world, you wouldn't be seeing that screen multiple times. You just say, like "same address as veteran"

442
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.830
Renata: right?

443
00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.560
Renata: And it would just keep going.

444
00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.420
P21: Right.

445
00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.840
Renata: Got it

446
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:07.000
P21: All right.

447
00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:08.820
Renata: So

448
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:17.660
Renata: on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this 1st

449
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:19.310
Renata: portion of the form?

450
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:29.500
P21: Because of what I just stayed as far as showing repetition, the thing coming up again that would delete it from a 5. So I'll have to put a 4.

451
00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.009
P21: on that portion.

452
00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:38.840
Renata: Okay, but to bring it from a 4 to that 5, we just need to skip past those screens?

453
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:39.500
P21: Leave it.

454
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.280
Renata: It very easy.

455
00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:45.479
P21: That duplicate screen was asking the same information several times.

456
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:58.600
Renata: Got it. Okay? So you can scroll down on this page a little bit, and where it asks you if you have more applicants. You can select no, and then click the continue button. And we're gonna look at the next page.

457
00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:08.550
Renata: So before you answer this question, I'd just like you to take a look at this page, and in your own words, let me know what it is asking for.

458
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:09.500
P21: Okay.

459
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:18.700
P21: Medicare information. I'm just thinking out loud. I'm not.

460
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.327
Renata: Of course. Yeah.

461
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:26.290
P21: Do you have any Medicare to report

462
00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.900
P21: patient?

463
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:47.450
P21: If any applicants here corner to report here to process in an application for CHAMPVA

464
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:56.470
P21: it's asking me not if I have Medicare. But do my dependents have medicare either one of them.

465
00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.549
P21: That's what I'm getting out of this page thus far.

466
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:13.909
Renata: Okay, got it. And thinking back to that 1st page that we looked at, do you remember if it mentioned Medicare being something that you would need to provide.

467
00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:16.909
P21: I don't remember seeing Medicare on there.

468
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:28.510
Renata: Okay, that's totally fair. Like, I said, we're not testing knowledge or abilities, just curious. And why do you think the application for CHAMPVA benefits would be asking you about Medicare at all?

469
00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:36.880
P21: I think that like my situation, now.

470
00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:40.860
P21: with my age now being around 70 years old. Now,

471
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.240
P21: you didn't hear how old, but

472
00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:52.939
P21: I have Medicare, Medicaid. Some one of those, my wife knows which one. I would imagine that if we have to go to

473
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:57.129
P21: a hospital that's not the VA Hospital

474
00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:04.910
P21: whereby Medicare can kick in and pay some portion of that that bill.

475
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:07.980
P21: Okay

476
00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:27.300
Renata: Okay. Alright got it. I'm gonna have you scroll up to the top of the page a ways. Next to the VA logo, it says, "1010 d Extended CHAMPVA Application," and then in parentheses, it says, "includes 10-7959c."

477
00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:33.109
Renata: What does 10-7959c mean to you, if anything?

478
00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:36.490
P21: The Application

479
00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:37.870
P21: has two

480
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:43.240
P21: Find the Va forms.

481
00:51:44.984 --> 00:51:46.015
P21: that's it.

482
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:50.009
P21: That's a form. I know that.

483
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:56.735
P21: 10 dash 7, 9, 5, 9. See? That's a form I know

484
00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:05.029
P21: is that the CHAMPVA application form, I reckon that's the CHAMPVA application form and the VA

485
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:10.250
P21: Form 1010.

486
00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.020
P21: The extended.

487
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:23.660
P21: I guess that's the 2 different forms. But I'm dealing with a Va form.

488
00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:38.729
P21: Well, both of them would be a forms. Okay, they [are] different type forms. If I want to find more on that, I would go to

489
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:41.360
P21: look up VA Forms

490
00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:45.710
P21: I'll put this whole thing, CHAMPVA Application

491
00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:59.380
P21: to the website to include and then put that 10-7959c and look at it. You could go on on this application to

492
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:02.349
P21: Id. Gov, or whatever one I'm on.

493
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.060
P21: You could, you could find out what form it is.

494
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.720
Renata: Got it. Okay.

495
00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:12.860
P21: You can always call that number down below and and look at. Okay.

496
00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:17.209
P21: it's easier just to put it in and look at it on online.

497
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.619
Renata: Got it. Okay.

498
00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.759
P21: If you don't understand what it is.

499
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:37.719
Renata: Yeah, one more question about this page for you. So if you were on va.gov filling this out for a spouse, your spouse and a dependent for real today. Would you have your Medicare information on hand, or would you need to stop and go collect information.

500
00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:44.200
P21: I have to stop and get the information can have it only.

501
00:53:44.530 --> 00:54:05.170
Renata: Okay, so I'm gonna have you start this section of the form as though your dependent as if he has a Medicare plan. So you're gonna click "yes," on this. And then you can fill out some some fake information for this section. And again, remember to please think out loud as you're going through.

502
00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:06.090
P21: Will do.

503
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:07.179
Renata: All right.

504
00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:10.799
P21: And it's gonna be for Junior?

505
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:18.530
P21: Which application would you like to add? Medicare insurance?

506
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.000
P21: Hmm.

507
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:28.959
P21: or notification overturn to add Medicare?

508
00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.269
P21: Don't do me.

509
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:44.759
P21: I thought on the other page it says, Does anybody have it?

510
00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:46.330
P21: Medicare?

511
00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:56.050
P21: Okay? And the way I'm reading it, this is that which applicant dependent would I like to

512
00:54:56.950 --> 00:55:02.010
P21: add Medicare to. When I already told them he got Medicare. I don't understand that question, that much.

513
00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:06.280
Renata: Okay, 

514
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:15.800
Renata: So just to check my understanding. You assumed you clicked "Yes," on "Does anybody have Medicare," whereas,

515
00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:20.709
Renata: what would you assume or expect to see on this page, now, instead of what we're seeing here?

516
00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:26.379
P21: I would expect them to ask for the information about his Medicare.

517
00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:41.100
P21: If he has Medicare, he should have paperwork, saying with his Medicare numbers, or whatever they have. I don't know. My wife keeps all that, and they'll be asking for that information so that they can apply it as part of the package.

518
00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:51.999
P21: so that in case that happened where they have to go to emergency room or somewhere, and Medicare takes part of that payment or whatever.

519
00:55:52.430 --> 00:56:02.770
P21: and I wouldn't expect them to say who would I like to have medicare insurance for.

520
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.600
Renata: Okay.

521
00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:09.650
P21: But I don't understand why they would ask that question when they almost asked their

522
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:17.000
P21: virtually... actually in the beginning, "who had, does anybody have Medicare?" And I say, "yes," and then, 

523
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.540
P21: say, "who has it?" and their information.

524
00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:20.760
Renata: Okay

525
00:56:21.148 --> 00:56:35.659
Renata: So coming back to the form that we're looking at here. Not an ideal world, not where we're redesigning the form. If you clicked, continue, what do you expect to see on the next page? Now that it's asking on this page, you know. Who do you want to add the Medicare for?

526
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:40.546
P21: If I go on, it's doing right now

527
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:52.310
P21: It would have me fill out an application for Medicare for that person when they already have it. That's what I would expect for them looking at this question here.

528
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.270
P21: But

529
00:56:53.460 --> 00:57:06.880
P21: here again, the question is making me think that he doesn't have it, that they want me to add him to Medicare. That's the way I'm understanding this question.

530
00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:12.460
Renata: Got it, like this would almost be an application that would go to the center for Medicare?

531
00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:13.000
Renata: In addition

532
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:21.199
Renata: to what you're filling out. [P21 nods] Okay. Got it. Alright. For the purposes of today. I'm gonna have you click that continue button. But thank you for that feedback.

533
00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:37.200
P21: Okay, John DOE, General Medicare plan type, which that's a following Medicare.

534
00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:39.730
P21: Does this beneficiary?

535
00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:42.880
P21: Now see what they doing? That

536
00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:52.070
P21: they asked for who had, I mean, does anybody have..I said yes. Then they asked who and the question was,

537
00:57:52.420 --> 00:58:03.560
P21: I can't remember this question, but it was making me think that he didn't. Now they're saying, Okay, he got Medicare already. What plan does he have? I didn't expect.

538
00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:13.160
P21: Well, yes, I did expect it. But the question was misleading the other question, How would right.

539
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:14.990
Renata: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

540
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:18.260
P21: Question before this, the way I read it was saying.

541
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.469
P21: Who do you want insurance on?

542
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:21.950
P21: John DOE?

543
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.350
P21: And I put yes, John DOE.

544
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:25.530
Renata: Okay.

545
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:27.180
P21: Okay.

546
00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:34.669
P21: Now, just to let you know

547
00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:43.890
P21: my wife handles all this. I'm not familiar with the different plans they have. So this is all fake. Don't just pick anything.

548
00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:50.500
Renata: That is perfectly fine, like, I said, not testing knowledge or abilities. 

549
00:58:50.500 --> 00:59:01.150
P21: How would you pick it..."Which of the following Medicare plans does this beneficiary have?"

550
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:08.330
P21: original Medicare part A and B hospital and

551
00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:14.530
P21: medical coverage. Okay, Medicare point C, advantage plan.

552
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:22.869
P21: This option includes being previously enrolled information.

553
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.239
P21: I've just picked the 1st one.

554
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:36.490
Renata: Perfect.

555
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:39.479
P21: Okay, you want me to hit

556
00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:40.450
P21: Continue?

557
00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:42.129
Renata: Yes, please continue.

558
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:49.289
P21: Medicare part a effective date.

559
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:37.670
P21: [Part] B [effective date]

560
01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.020
P21: Okay.

561
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:13.520
P21: Just a question. 

562
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.260
Renata: Alright!

563
01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:17.969
P21: I don't know the difference between A or B or whatever my wife knows all that

564
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.520
P21: I was gonna ask you, what's the difference between A and B. But I ain't gonna worry about that

565
01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:34.979
P21: right now. I'll get that from my wife. Okay, let me go back through here and make sure that date.

566
01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.619
P21: Medicare Part B, whatever they are.

567
01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:45.240
P21: I'm gonna hit continue...upload 

568
01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:46.270
P21: All right.

569
01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:59.960
P21: You need to submit a copy Medicare health card [unclear]

570
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.260
P21: But it.

571
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:10.886
P21: Okay, okay, referred to as red, white [and blue card]

572
01:02:14.506 --> 01:02:20.600
P21: [Unclear (reading page text)]

573
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:25.669
P21: And you have Medicare part B

574
01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:33.689
P21: listed as Medicare, and the date your coverage begins. Okay.

575
01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.730
P21: okay, I don't have a card to put on there?

576
01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:51.970
Renata: So like, I said at the outset of the session. I can provide you with a dummy card at this point if you would like so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add an attachment to the zoom chat.

577
01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.599
P21: So I get to go to my zoom account?

578
01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:55.840
Renata: Yes.

579
01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:04.130
P21: Go to chat box, and which one is it?

580
01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:21.519
Renata: It'll be that second message there, the one at the bottom. You'll see if you're able to magnify it more. There's 3 icons below the file, I added, there's a chat, there's an emoji, and then there's 3 dots, and if you click the 3 dots there should be an option to download that file.

581
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:23.370
P21: Okay, let me go back.

582
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.870
P21: Okay.

583
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:34.360
P21: Where am I at? On here?

584
01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:40.880
P21: You're sharing same one.

585
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:43.319
P21: I don't know where I'm at now.

586
01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:46.000
P21: You could see my screen. What do I?

587
01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:54.420
Renata: I can see that you're still in zoom. I can't. What are what are you seeing? Okay, now I can see all of your apps.

588
01:03:54.420 --> 01:04:01.119
P21: Okay. Now I hit that again. Down at the bottom, you say. Hit the 3 dots. Oh, it disappeared. There they are!

589
01:04:01.635 --> 01:04:03.760
Renata: It? Yeah. If you go into the chat.

590
01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:05.600
P21: Over, hit,

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.620
P21: Okay, I hit the chat.

593
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.870
P21: Okay.

594
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:13.690
Renata: Do you see that attachment that I sent?

595
01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.929
P21: I see something that says...

596
01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:21.580
P21: Renata?

597
01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:23.370
Renata: Yeah. That's me.

P21: Okay? And then it says, I am 3 dots PDF.

599
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.189
P21: Is that it

600
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:35.950
Renata: Okay, yes, that's the file. If you can click the download button, there.

601
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:39.319
P21: I hit the download, and there's my card.

602
01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.270
Renata: Okay.

603
01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:41.040
P21: So, okay.

604
01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.490
P21: Happen.

605
01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:45.110
Renata: You might

606
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:51.439
Renata: need. We'll have. Okay. Can you get back to the browser that you were in where we were filling out the form?

607
01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.570
P21: Yeah.

608
01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:57.530
Renata: Let's see if we can get this to work. Sometimes it's a little cranky.

609
01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:01.230
P21: Do I hit this little thing, or how does it go on?

610
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:03.809
Renata: If you scroll down the page.

611
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:09.150
P21: It has fun. But how to upload the file?

612
01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:12.090
Renata: Yeah.

613
01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:15.370
P21: Okay, make sure that the file size.

614
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:31.660
P21: How do I do that upload from the original Medicare card? Nope, do I hit that

615
01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:38.720
P21: use if you only have a paper copy.

616
01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:43.099
P21: Nope, I don't know how to put it on here.

617
01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:48.300
Renata: All right. I can help walk you through. So if you, if you scroll back down a little bit on the page.

618
01:05:49.106 --> 01:05:55.959
Renata: There should be a white little button that's got  a blue outline, and it says, "Upload file" in it.

619
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:58.030
P21: Yeah, okay, I see it right here.

620
01:05:58.030 --> 01:05:59.939
Renata: Yeah, if you click on that.

621
01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.730
Renata: Okay, select.

622
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:07.750
P21: Yeah. So photo library, take a photo or choose the file.

623
01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:10.729
Renata: Yeah, if you could click, choose the file for me.

624
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:13.038
P21: Okay, I hit choose file.

625
01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:20.139
P21: And I did never follow it in it never saved it to a file.

626
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:24.349
Renata: Okay, it should have downloaded to here, so we should see it.

627
01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:27.389
P21: Oh, it's under doubt it should be on the download. Let me see.

628
01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:33.599
P21: Zoom account payment. Nope, share recent. I'm gonna hit recents.

629
01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.780
Renata: Yeah, let's see if it's under recent.

630
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.510
P21: Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope.

631
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:42.420
Jamie: I think he might have

632
01:06:43.236 --> 01:06:46.919
Jamie: opened the file, but not downloaded it.

633
01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.270
P21: Right.

634
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:48.860
Renata: That's where I'm.

635
01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:49.630
P21: Into 2.

636
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.580
Renata: To go back to zoom and save it.

637
01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.470
P21: Where it's my zoom, my zoom disappeared.

638
01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.300
P21: Where are you going?

639
01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:01.540
P21: You see it here?

640
01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:03.450
Jamie: I it.

641
01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:09.559
Jamie: It's interesting. I don't see it here. What you what you can do is oh, is it here?

642
01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.140
P21: Okay. I'm I'm.

643
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.179
Jamie: Oh, okay. Now you're back.

644
01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.845
Renata: We got it

645
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.080
P21: Now to download.

646
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:22.039
Renata: At the top, where it says

647
01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.920
P21: Big because I got my page

648
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:31.699
P21: enlarged so everything would be big. That's why it's showing this so big here.

649
01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:36.760
P21: And if I hit that arrow. Where do I go to? Download it?

650
01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:40.920
P21: Where would? Oh, one of one

651
01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:46.070
P21: insurance, maybe the top button. Nope, the arrow!

652
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:48.050
P21: Anybody want to.

653
01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:53.739
Jamie: Press that little arrow on the top left. What happens? Okay.

654
01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.429
P21: It went here.

655
01:07:55.430 --> 01:08:00.040
Jamie: Alright. So now if you click on

656
01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:07.849
Jamie: But the the little 3 dot menu under Renata's name, where you were before.

657
01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.880
Jamie: Huh! Why is it doing that?

658
01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:14.150
P21: Where they got 3 dots on here.

659
01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.900
Jamie: Yeah.

660
01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.420
P21: It says copy.

661
01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:28.219
Renata: There's also 3 dots above the title of the Pdf. If you see in the center of the screen, it says, insurance underscore front dot. Pdf, there's 3 dots above that.

662
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:29.409
Renata: Yeah, back on this, too.

663
01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:32.640
Renata: Oh, that's the zoom controls.

664
01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:33.529
Renata: Okay

665
01:08:34.459 --> 01:08:42.339
P21: It normally had where you could hit, I mean, and make it save it.

666
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:43.430
Renata: Hmm.

667
01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:47.549
P21: I maybe the copy copy to where, though?

668
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:55.259
P21: I thought it had, where you could put it in your photos, or whatever.

669
01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:56.409
Renata: So

670
01:08:56.410 --> 01:09:12.010
Renata: at this point we could either use a random file that you have, or we're fairly close to the end of the form, so we could just wrap up and not upload anything, and I'll ask the remainder of our questions. What would you feel comfortable with? Because I don't want you to upload anything here, if you're not comfortable.

671
01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:15.369
P21: Where am I? Oh, okay, let's just

672
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.599
P21: forget. I got to put something in there right accord or something.

673
01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:34.960
Renata: Yeah. But honestly, if you don't wanna upload any random files that you have on your ipad, we could just stop proceeding in the form. You've seen the bulk of it, and we can wrap up and finish the session, and you'll we'll it still be complete. So.

674
01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:40.330
P21: Okay, well, let's do it like that. Let's not put anything.

675
01:09:41.056 --> 01:09:45.579
Renata: At this point you can stop sharing your screen. And I'm just gonna ask you some questions.

676
01:09:46.383 --> 01:09:52.340
P21: Okay. Should I leave this here on here, this va file, or.

677
01:09:53.161 --> 01:09:58.050
Renata: You can X out of it. But let's stop sharing first, but then you can close it.

678
01:09:58.620 --> 01:09:59.170
Renata: So

679
01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:02.049
P21: let me find here.

680
01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:03.570
Renata: Stop share button. Yeah.

681
01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:06.400
P21: Okay, so stop share.

682
01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:12.360
Renata: Okay. So yes, I can see you. Can you see me?

683
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:16.400
P21: Screen broadcast, live broadcast to zoom. Okay.

684
01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.260
P21: -oh, did I hit the wrong button?

685
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.210
Renata: I can see you can. Can you see me? Okay

686
01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:22.750
P21: Good to see you!

687
01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:30.392
Renata: Alright. So I'm gonna ask you that 1 to 5 scale again on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being

688
01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:37.200
Renata: very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to do that Medicare section of the form?

689
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:49.770
P21: Except for that one part whereby it it to me it was the wrong question, as far as it

690
01:10:50.070 --> 01:11:00.120
P21: previously actually do. You have anybody who's on Medicare, and you hit "Yes," and then it went to, who do you want to put Medicare insurance for

691
01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:09.299
P21: or on, or whatever word it used, and that was confusing, because I had just said, Yes, I do have somebody. Then it's saying who you want to put on Medicare

692
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:17.760
P21: Insurance. That was a little confusing to me at first, st till I hit the next page, and then it

693
01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.479
P21: I

694
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:43.239
P21: selected John DOE, and it had inquired information concerning that portion all that wasn't hard except for that one line that I mentioned. And if I had an actual card I could scan it and put it on here. So overall it wasn't that hard on a scale of one to 5.

695
01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:45.419
P21: I give it 3 and a half.

696
01:11:45.610 --> 01:12:05.929
Renata: 3 and a half. If I had to be really strict, and it had to be a whole number. Would you put it a 3 or a 4. Okay, got it, a 4. Thank you. So let's imagine that we finished the form. We didn't have any issues with Zoom and and the file not working out. If you clicked, submit application, what would you expect to happen next?

697
01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:14.160
P21: If I had, first, it would give me a summary of all that I did to

698
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:16.900
P21: look over it, and then it

699
01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:19.860
P21: it had submit again, because when.

700
01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:20.380
Renata: Okay.

701
01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:28.640
P21: Before you, you submit, and it should let you see everything that so you could verify everything again, and then you could hit

702
01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:44.510
P21: actual submitting it to them. Once you hit that submit button. Hopefully, you'll get a text message or something saying that this information has been sent to whomever it was supposed to go to just a confirmation

703
01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.159
P21: that it was. Excuse me that it was submitted.

704
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:54.459
P21: It said also that I'll be getting stuff in the mail, so I'll be on watch for that also.

705
01:12:55.100 --> 01:13:09.200
Renata: Okay. So I'm hearing a couple of things. You'd want to review the application before you hit that submit button. Once you submit it, I heard you say, I want to get a text message that says, Hey, we got it, you submitted it

706
01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:15.330
Renata: and that it would also tell you, "expect something in the mail, also confirming that you've submitted."

707
01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:15.770
P21: Right.

708
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:17.990
Renata: Okay, okay, got it. I just

709
01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:28.480
Renata: wanted to check my understanding. Okay, how soon after submitting the application, would you expect the VA to notify you about a decision being made on it?

710
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:32.559
P21: 30 days.

711
01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:39.870
Renata: 30 days. Okay. And now, is that an ideal world is that, or would you want to see it sooner in an ideal world?

712
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:45.529
P21: I would love it sooner. But to be realistic with

713
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:51.939
P21: with the Government, VA, whatever, it'd probably take 45 [days or] longer.

714
01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.639
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you.

715
01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:58.250
P21: And the only reason I'm saying that well, really longer than that.

716
01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:04.050
P21: because I had put the application in for something through the Government.

717
01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:08.460
P21: I put it in in December, and I just found out about it.

718
01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:11.000
P21: June.

719
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:13.889
Renata: Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry to hear that.

720
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:18.390
P21: That's how long that took.

721
01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:23.100
P21: They approved it, but it took a long time.

722
01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:31.259
Renata: Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that, but thank you for sharing. I'm sure that that was a a frustrating experience. It's a very long time to wait.

723
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:40.610
Renata: That sort of leads into my next question, which is, if it was taking that longer timeframe, would you want to receive updates about the status of your application?

724
01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:42.500
Renata: [P21 nods] Okay

725
01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:50.299
P21: And that's where that 1-800 number came in, because, like, you have to go on on my help to, not my help to, but I keep on calling on

726
01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:52.570
P21: on the VA benefits thing

727
01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:52.920
Renata: Okay.

728
01:14:52.920 --> 01:15:02.959
P21: And it did tell you applications, forms, and everything that you submitted, and you can go on there. And if you don't see the answer. They have a number you could call, and you

729
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.239
P21: they knew my voice.

730
01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:07.410
Renata: Okay.

731
01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:12.009
Renata: So you're calling pretty regularly, is what you're saying. [P21 nods affirmatively]

732
01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:26.180
Renata: Okay, and with that waiting period you gave me, you said you know it could take upwards of 40-45 days, if not longer. When would you start calling the VA? Would it be the day after you submitted the form? Would it be.

733
01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:40.459
P21: No, I wouldn't call in. I will wait. I'll give time for the mail [confirmation of submission] to get to me. I'll give that at least 10 working days at least 10 working days for me to get something in the mail

734
01:15:40.990 --> 01:16:02.009
P21: after 10 days. I probably start making phone calls because hopefully, they had when I submitted it, they sent a text or something. Your application has been received, or whatever submitted to us, government government affairs, or whoever, and

735
01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:08.960
P21: with all that information 10 days past. I haven't heard in that, I start making phone calls to

736
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:21.580
P21: see whatever, especially if my son or my dependent, someone gets sick, or whatever, and have to go to the hospital. I don't want no problems coming from

737
01:16:22.241 --> 01:16:37.149
P21: the billing cycle, either from Medicare, saying you're not in Medicare, or you're not under this. It doesn't qualify for this or whatever. And the government saying we can't do nothing because Medicare

738
01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.482
P21: hasn't taken care of the part.

739
01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:40.605
P21: Yeah.

740
01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:41.790
Renata: Got it

741
01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:54.429
Renata: If you have the ability to go on the VA website to check the status of your application, would you prefer that to calling the 800 number? Just curious, if there was an option...

742
01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.169
P21: Oh, yeah, there's a option on it when you go to [the VA website]

743
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:11.100
P21: it lists when you submitted it, what you submitted, and then tell you it'll give you that. It's still working, whatever.

744
01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:19.250
P21: I got one still in there right now, but that's gonna take a while. They say that's waiting for the judge, and all that good stuff.

745
01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.319
Renata: Okay, that's a disability benefit claim?

746
01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:22.760
P21: Believe me.

747
01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.190
Renata: You have okay, got it. Got it. 

748
01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.125
P21: And

749
01:17:27.570 --> 01:17:30.910
P21: I'd rather to see it there, and not have to make the call.

750
01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.740
Renata: Okay. So if it was one over the other

751
01:17:35.010 --> 01:17:40.969
Renata: calling or checking online, you'd rather check online. But if that's not an option, then you're gonna pick up the phone.

752
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:49.710
P21: Pick it up in a heartbeat because I wanna try to prevent problems before they happen.

753
01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:51.650
Renata: Yeah.

754
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.900
P21: Dealing with payment, because everybody wants their money.

755
01:17:54.330 --> 01:18:03.059
Renata: Yeah, just a few more questions for you overall. Was there anything that you saw in the session today that worked well for you?

756
01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.610
P21: In this session?

757
01:18:10.101 --> 01:18:35.759
P21: the young lady who was helping me to to go back, and was offering information on things we should do to like, she said. I didn't download that that file, whatever. Then we couldn't find out how to do it. But that's a good suggestion. She made suggestion on something else earlier, which I found out to be helpful also. Having these different minds in here and support on this call

758
01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:42.059
P21: on this zoom call I. I enjoyed it. It was very helpful to me.

759
01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:52.500
Renata: Okay, thank you. Jamie, shout out. Was there anything that you saw during the session today that was unclear or that did not work well for you?

760
01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:59.220
P21: Other than those things already mentioned?

761
01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:00.929
Renata: Other than those, yeah.

762
01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:16.152
P21: I can't think of anything right now. That was there was unpleasing

763
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:19.010
P21: or frustrating

764
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:22.849
Renata: Okay, got it.

765
01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:28.339
Renata: thinking back to that 1st page that we looked at. Now that you've been through the form.

766
01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:28.789
Renata: Is there any,

767
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:38.700
Renata: Any other information that you would put on there to tell veterans or their spouses or dependents like, "Hey," you know, "do this research, or you're gonna need this before you start today."

768
01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.140
P21: Being that gone through phone, I would say.

769
01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:54.439
P21: have all the paperwork that you think may be necessary. Like your Medicare information, the card and all that. Have all that information.

770
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:58.440
P21: Hand it right there for you, so you don't have to

771
01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:10.629
P21: put it on hold, go and find that information. Come back and do it. Have all the information there that you think, because you don't know when you're filling up what may be needed. Just have it all available

772
01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:20.640
P21: because you're trying to get them into the system for coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, Government

773
01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:31.530
P21: assistance, or whatever. And here again, the Social Security number, where you're living everything you may know and have

774
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.160
P21: available. But having the other information like, I said, the

775
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:40.530
P21: Medicare/Medicaid stuff for whatever court you get

776
01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:46.250
P21: have it available. I mean hopefully, that's covering your question.

777
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:55.609
Renata: Yeah, yes, it does. What are your thoughts about the amount of information that's provided in the form? Not enough, too much, just right?

778
01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:16.750
P21: Well, I feel, because if you have a child or a spouse that's already handicapped in some way, they could put that on there too, because you you want them to know all already that this person

779
01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.100
P21: hands.

780
01:21:20.312 --> 01:21:24.240
P21: But that's not well.

781
01:21:26.150 --> 01:21:35.950
P21: or had something already wrong with them, that they have to live with that can come up to make them aware of it

782
01:21:36.670 --> 01:21:41.690
P21: may help, too. I don't know if they help or make the price go up, or whatever.

783
01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:45.879
Renata: Okay, like, disclosing a pre-existing condition, maybe?

784
01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:46.385
P21: Right

785
01:21:46.890 --> 01:21:47.610
Renata: Okay.

786
01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:48.969
P21: Oh, yes, got it!

787
01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:53.790
Renata: Got it any questions for me before we close out the session today?

788
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:56.199
P21: No, I really enjoyed it, though.

789
01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:57.280
Renata: Okay.

790
01:21:58.230 --> 01:21:58.869
P21: I enjoyed it

791
01:21:58.870 --> 01:22:07.579
Renata: I'm glad I'm glad! I wanna circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA Partners?

792
01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.550
P21: No, no problem at all.

793
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:14.930
Renata: Okay? And is there any part of our discussion today you would not want shared in a video clip.

794
01:22:21.173 --> 01:22:27.739
P21: No, I ain't nothing to hide. I don't think I.

795
01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:54.250
Renata: Okay. Alright, if anything comes up and you, you're not comfortable anymore. Just let Paragean the folks who emailed you to schedule this know, and they'll let me know. So that's totally fine. But at that, with that I just want to say we really appreciate you taking the time out of your day and out of your week to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is super helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans. So thank you.

796
01:22:54.700 --> 01:23:04.219
Renata: Lastly, Paragene will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb in it. You can pass that along to other veterans, you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

797
01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:18.530
P21: I have. I've done that like, I said. I'm with the Blind Veterans Association and I I shared the information with a lot of them because they they may fall into some of the different categories that they'd be looking to interview people with.

798
01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:29.680
Renata: Well, thank you truly, from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you for doing that. We really appreciate it. And we really appreciate your feedback today. But with that, thank you so much again, and have a really great rest of your day and week.

799
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:32.869
P21: Okay, thank you, ma'am. Thank you all.

800
01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:33.600
Renata: Yeah.

801
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:38.309
P21: Okay, is it.

802
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:39.260
Renata: That is it.
