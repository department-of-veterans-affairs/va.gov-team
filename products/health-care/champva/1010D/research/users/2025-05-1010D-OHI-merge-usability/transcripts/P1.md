00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.260 
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording I'd like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.080 
P1: Yes.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:19.089 
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.770 
P1: Yes.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:30.079
Renata: All right. So with that over, I'm going to start with a few warm up questions. So have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:31.459
P1: No, I have not.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.640
Renata: Okay. Do you intend to apply for CHAMPVA benefits for your spouse or dependents in the future?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:01:04.330
P1: You know I was told quite a while ago that it didn't pertain to us because the family fell under tricare, but so I haven't really looked into it enough to know whether it's something that I'd be considering. I know some friends of mine that are in similar situations, but now they live overseas have used it. But again, I'm not sure how that works.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.220
Renata: Okay, fair enough. Do you currently have a va.gov account?

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.230
P1: Yes.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.030
Renata: What has been your experience with logging into the site?

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:46.810
P1: I think it's gotten better I think. At 1st it was challenging. And I know they were migrating it to everything under va.gov because they had different. So that was...that used to be cumbersome where it's now at least everything's in one area. I think the only thing. I've noticed that the app doesn't isn't as robust as the website. So there's areas on the Va app that you can't get to unless you log out to a computer.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.979
Renata: Got it anything in particular that has been cumbersome for you that's not available in the app?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:04.150
P1: I think the bigger. The biggest thing that I've noticed recently is the education side, even though there's a tab for it for other benefits it. Some of those things are not there.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.329
Renata: Got it. Okay. And how often and for what tasks are you logging into? va.gov? Or using the app?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:43.870
P1: Well, it's either education or communicating with a doctor's office like this morning. Later or later on. Today, I'll I'll be asking about getting labs before my next appointment. So that's nice. It's nice to be able to communicate with my doctor. If something comes up to ask is, should I get a visit. Can I do? Tele visit? So there's times things come up, and I'm not sure what the best route is, or if it's something that I can just take care of myself or talk to a nurse about. That's been really helpful.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:03:15.500
Renata: Got it. Thank you for sharing so we're gonna shift to the next stage of the session where we're gonna be looking at that demo tool. I'm gonna drop a link in the chat, and I'd like you to open it in your browser and share screen and zoom I can help walk you through that if you need any assistance. But just wanna give you a moment to close out any other tabs, notifications, things like Facebook or email. So it doesn't appear in the in the screen share. And let me know when you're ready for that link.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.830
P1: No, I'm ready.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.090
Renata: All right. There you go!

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:42.510
P1: There it is. When I...I usually use teams. But see, where's the share thing? I think it's down the there it is.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.290
Renata: Yeah, they're all a little different. It's the the green button with an up arrow at the bottom.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.259
P1: Alright should be sharing it right now. Can you see it.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:48.460
Renata: There it is, perfect. Okay! So before you start filling out this form, just a few things to be aware of. As I mentioned before. This is a testing sort of demo tool. You don't have to worry about any information that you put into this form going anywhere, and nothing that you click on, will have any bearing on your information or benefits. As we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, such as social security numbers. If you don't feel comfortable using real information. You may be asked to upload some documents as part of this form, as we're not submitting the form, and it isn't attached to your documents. Nothing you upload here is going to get sent to Va. When we get to screens that ask for a file to be uploaded. I can provide something to you, or you could use like a random photo that's on your desktop. When we get to those screens. I'll ask you what you'd like to do, and and we'll sort of cross that when we get to it. But do you have any questions for me?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.220
P1: No, not the moment.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:05:00.220
Renata: Alright without clicking on anything. I'd like you to just take a look at the information on this page and let me know what your initial thoughts, questions, concerns are.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:06:05.179
P1: I like it. It's 1 of the reasons I think it. Va.gov has improved quite a bit. It's it's nice to see the steps. What to expect at the steps. What to have ready at the beginning, when all this 1st started, I felt there were times I'd had to log off and and find out. Hey, what do I need for this, or pick up the phone and call where here it looks like there's links, and it's telling you ahead of time what to have ahead in hand before you start filling out the application, which is nice. Gives you an idea how long it'll take. So, depending on how much time you have so. And and it still has the 800 number in case you need help.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:15.619
Renata: Yeah. A couple of questions for you. So do you know, if you're on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.539
P1: Yes, right at the very top it says where you're at.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:37.730
Renata: Got it. And if you were on va.gov. Filling this out for yourself and your family today, what research would you do before applying for a form like or completing a form like this.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:43.009
P1: Oh, I I right away just click that 1st link. Find out if I'm eligible.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.240
Renata: Okay. Anything else that you would do after that?


00:06:48.370 --> 00:07:32.080
P1: Well, I know with other forms that I've submitted even if I click on that. And I'm not sure how this one is, because I've never clicked on it. But there's times where. Okay, that's I think I qualify. But I'm not quite sure.And honestly, I don't want to submit an application if I don't know for sure. So that's when at that point I'll just pick up the phone and say, Hey, am I reading this correctly? Am I reading something different? Can you help me out and see whether I do? Am I eligible. And there's times that even VA Reps have said, you know what I think you are. Go ahead and apply, and other times where they said, now you're definitely eligible. Go ahead and apply so.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:48.960
Renata: Okay. So just double checking my knowledge based on what you said, you would click that. Find out if you're eligible button. And then, if you still didn't feel comfortable or confident in your eligibility, you'd call the 800 number and ask about the benefit and your eligibility. Is that correct?

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.640
P1: Yes.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:57.619
Renata: Okay, thank you. What information do you think you need to fill out this application for your spouse and dependent children?

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:37.639
P1: Again. I don't know a lot about CHAMPVA but I would imagine it would ask you what...where you're located, because I'm sure. Some of this, probably  my guess is that it depends on on geographic area, like some areas, maybe underserved communities where there's not as many health providers available, maybe in rural rural areas of the country or near engine reservations. Maybe you don't have the same capabilities. Other than that. I'm not really not sure, because I don't know enough about chat va.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:54.579
Renata: Okay, I wanna draw your attention to that link under the step 2 on the screen that says, Find out about documentations. You don't need to click it. But what information do you think they might be asking for in terms of like documents to provide for Champ.

00:08:56.423 --> 00:09:09.940
P1: I would imagine family information so dependent information, current insurance and can't really.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.420
Renata: Okay.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.619
P1: Think of anything else.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:25.570
Renata: Totally fine. Would you happen to have that information on hand if you were on va.gov. Applying for this today in real life? Or would you need to pause here and go collect that information about your family and health insurance?

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:43.570
P1: Honestly, I have most of it. Because again, I've gone to the website and applied for other things that I have a folder specifically with with information where I can easily fill out most of the time easily fill out family information fairly quickly.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.750
Renata: Okay.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:50.899
P1: But it's nice to have ahead of time, so I know what to have open and ready to do it that way I don't get logged out.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:10:03.319
Renata: Got it so on a scale of one to 5, with one being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin, based on this page's content?

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:25.810
P1: I think I think well informed. Because, even though I don't know enough about chat va, I know how I am before I would even apply to it. I'd probably do some digging to find out. Hey, what is it? What will it provide me and my family? And obviously, like you said like I said at the beginning, the 1st thing I do is find out if I'm eligible.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:38.119
Renata: Okay? If I had to force you to give it a number on that number scale, would you give it a a 4 being like easy or a 5 being very easy to understand and well informed.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.839
P1: No, I I honestly 5.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:11:34.029
Renata: Okay, alright great. So you can scroll down to the bottom of the page now, and there is a link that says, Start the form without signing in. I'd like you to click on that. All right. So for this next task, I'd like you to start the form as if you're applying for yourself and one other family member or sorry, your spouse and one other family member, and that could be like a dependent child that you have. I'll let you know when to pause when I'm going to ask you some questions. But to help Orient you, we're going to be doing the 1st 3 sections of the form. As a reminder. This is our testing site. So you don't have to worry about the information going anywhere, you can use dummy information. And as you go through the form, please remember to think out loud as you're filling things out. We want to hear your reactions as you're experiencing them.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:12:47.189
P1: Okay. So obviously, this is just name as you saw, is already auto filled for name. Let's continue after that address. I think that's the only thing. I guess it is the whole thing. Okay, post office. I guess on this one I'd be confused on. Why, I would have to put a military post office, so I wouldn't know why I would have to do that, especially being retired. So I I guess in this regard, unless that's the population they're looking for, and I see.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:54.519
Renata: If you if you scroll up to the top of the the screen, there's a checkbox there that says "I live on a military base."

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.189
P1: Oh, and I clicked it. That was my fault.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.809
Renata: That's totally fine. You can go ahead and unclick that.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:14:09.970
P1: That's why no, that makes sense. Thank you. City, the State. Make sure I didn't mess anything up. Clic, continue...the sponsor's information. Date of birth...Click continue.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:31.650
Renata: You might need to make it one non chronological number. You get an error message if you do 1, 2, 3, 4, just to make it extra challenging.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:15:07.029
P1: Got it. Let's see, the sponsor information.  Make sure I didn't do anything. So gotta put in, I guess, for the other dependent?

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:15.980
Renata: Yeah, as a reminder, we'll have you do this for a spouse and a dependent child.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:22.539
P1: So would this be, I guess, on this one I'm confused. Is that still me right here?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:31.039
Renata: I'm gonna be annoying and answer your question with another question. Do you think that it's you, or is it somebody else?

00:15:31.980 --> 00:16:00.899
P1: Yeah, I think it's for me, cause it says applicant. But I guess it's confusing, because I already put my information a couple of times so. And I was doing it for myself and one other person. So I guess that part was confusing at the beginning. Then, so okay, so makes sense for me to put it twice, but if if I'm applying, I'm the applicant, I would be putting in my information.


00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:17.450
Renata: Okay. So you think that this is still referring to you, and not a a spouse or a dependent child? Okay. What would you do at this point if you were feeling unsure and wanted to like double double check before you continued.

00:16:17.731 --> 00:16:39.079
P1: I end up picking the phone up honestly at this point, just to just to make sure. Because I know how some of these forms, and I've messed up on some of them because I didn't understand them, and I just went through, and I had to redo the form or restart the application all over, because it it was an application was denied because I did not fill in what they actually wanted.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:49.940
Renata: Okay. For the purposes of today. I'd like you to click that cancel, adding this applicant, button down before continue.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.960
P1: Okay.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:52.910
Renata: Canncel it, yes. I Want to just pause here. Does any of the information on this page help you to better understand whether we're asking you to add more information about yourself, or about a spouse and child.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:47.079
P1: Yeah, I guess it is asking for others. But I think that word applicant needs to change, because that's the confusing part for me when I hear applicant. And I guess I guess reading this last part right here, where it says you can add up to 25 applicants. So I guess it's treating everyone as an applicant.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.089
Renata: Everyone meaning like you and your whole family, or?

00:17:53.090 --> 00:18:05.320
P1: That's what that's what it seems like to me when you say when it says you can add up to 25 applicants. So it's at. It's treating everyone as an applicant.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:18.059
Renata: Got it. In your mind what would be a more appropriate word than applicant to make this section clearer to you who you're filling this section out for?

00:18:18.060 --> 00:19:23.360
P1: I think I think it started out fine for me when it said sponsor. That's easy cause, even if it was a spouse filling this out, for whatever reason the sponsor would be, whoever the active duty or the retired person was, either way. Yeah, I think, applicant, I yeah. I don't know what other term, but because most of the other forms don't have it, you know, when you fill out for education, forms, or even for dependency for for Va disability. The wording's different. I don't remember exactly how it's worded. I think it's either dependents or family members. When you see applicant, I right away. Think of myself, and and maybe that's me. I should have read it more.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:32.200
Renata: It's not on you. This is the again. This isn't a test. We're just curious, like what what comes to mind when when we say.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:37.060
P1: Yeah, when I hear applicant, I think of of the sponsor.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:51.419
Renata: Okay. So just to make sure that I'm getting this correctly. When we're when when we're done with the session in your mind, an applicant and a sponsor. The same thing. But a family member or a dependent is a different concept.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.250
P1: Yes.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:20:03.720
Renata: Okay, perfect. So for today's session, I'd like you to hit continue and add 2 applicants. And they're going to be your spouse and a dependent child. So not you. In this case.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:21:31.710
P1: Sure I got that. I'll just click in the addresses. Let's see. That's correct. Continue. That's right. No 1 1 bit points, please. Okay, it's asking me relationship, continue. Need to put that on there because I remember it. No problem.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.502
Renata: Happy anniversary, by the way.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:40.810
P1: Yeah, thank you. Let's see. And we said, add one more?

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.649
Renata: Yes, please add one more.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:22:19.950
P1: Date of birth. Click continue. Getting pretty good at adding those fake socials.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:24.890
Renata: Yeah, you are. You are an expert at this point. Thank you.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:23:39.490
P1: Let's see. Make sure I get the address. Yep. Oops! Did I add? No, that's good charm. Biological child. She's going to college. Okay. So it's saying, because she's in school that they'll need her information expected graduation, all the normal stuff for someone that's over the age of 18 and going to college. And now it's going to ask me to upload a file.

00:23:40.437 --> 00:23:47.150
Renata: And I'll stop you here. Do you want me to provide you with a sample? It's just a dummy file to upload here.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:55.039
P1: Well, sure, why not make it easier? Instead of trying to figure out what I have on my computer.

00:23:58.048 --> 00:24:12.249
Renata: You're probably gonna see this one a few times, but I'm going to drop it in the chat. There's gonna be 3 little dots below the image. If you mouse over it, it says more, and if you click that you can save the file.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.600
P1: Oh, okay.

208
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:31.610
Renata: And out of curiosity, based on what you saw at the beginning of the form. Would you have a school letter like this ready to go. Would you know, to have that prepared for today's form if you were filling it out.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:25:16.140
P1: Typically I wouldn't have thought of it. That's where the eligibility and what documents to have in place I would have. I would have read that. And hopefully, that's in there. I should most I would say most of the time. Yes, only because. I've been doing this for all 3 kids, almost one in a row, because they're about 4 or 5 years apart. So that's about the only reason I would have known to have it on file, like I have her stuff on file now on my desk, on my desktop, because I know that it's our. Those are things I routinely have to use, instead of having to bugger or call her, especially since she's going to school out of state.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.200
Renata: Okay. Got it.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:26:17.229
P1: And go back...trying to go back to the I forget how. Oh, there it is! My screen! Oops! Hmm! There we go! I didn't look at the file. Does it matter which one I put in there? School enrollment, certification, form or enrollment letter?

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:33.499
Renata: For today. No, but you said, you've done this a lot for your 3 dependents in real life. Which one do you typically have a copy of that you're uploading, typically the enrollment letter from school?

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:46.490
P1: What they provide like. She's she's going to [UNIVERSITY]. I know the paperwork they've submitted to me is different than my boys that went to [COLLEGE]. So really, whatever it is that they provide me.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:27:02.760
Renata: Got it. Okay? So you can go ahead and stop on this page. I have a couple of questions for you before we continue so on a scale of one to 5, with one being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this section of the form.

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:09.980
P1: I would have to give it a 3 only because of the applicant that wording.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:21.219
Renata: Okay, got it. I'm going to have you click that continue button after you hit. No on other applicants to add.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:21.940
P1: Okay.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:37.670
Renata: Okay. So before we keep going with the form in this section, I just want you to take a look at the page. Let me know what you're looking at. If you have any questions about it before we proceed.

00:27:40.282 --> 00:27:50.699
P1: Do you have any medicare to report for one or more applicants? Personally, I don't. But I'm not sure if you want me to go through other steps for this purpose.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:28:05.350
Renata: We'll get there in a moment. So it sounds like, you know, that this section is asking you for Medicare information. Thinking back to the information you saw on the 1st page of this form. Do you remember, if Medicare was mentioned?

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.190
P1: No.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:11.000
Renata: Okay. And why do you think this form would be asking for Medicare information?

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.220
P1: Oh, I would imagine it's just like other health insurance. They want to know what else you have.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:32.120
Renata: Okay. So if you were filling this out on va.gov today, would you need to stop and collect more documents for other health insurance, or would you be able? Would you already have that on hand?

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:48.559
P1: No, everything I have. Because it's tricare. Everything's online fairly easy to get to. And I also have it saved on my phone because I've had to use it for whether it be me or my children having to go to the doctor or other appointments.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:56.149
Renata: Okay, you are far more prepared than I am with having that on your phone. 

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.299
P1: Many times.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:19.859
Renata: Yeah, I'm sure. So for the purposes of today, I'd like you to imagine that your spouse and your dependent child both have Medicare as well as private health insurance. So go ahead and fill out Medicare and private health insurance information for both of them. And again, I can provide some dummy uploads. When we get to those pages.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:39.250
P1: Thank you. So Medicare wouldn't. I don't think my daughter, unless she was disabled, would qualify, so would it make sense to even select her.

00:29:41.474 --> 00:29:48.915
Renata: I mean for for today we're going to imagine that everybody in your your household who you're applying for has it.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:49.950
P1: Okay.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.069
Renata: Whether or not they actually do in real life.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:30:04.079
P1: Okay on Medicare Plan. Is there's  particular one you want me to pick on here?

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.689
Renata: No preference, whatever speaks to you.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:27.299
P1: Alright. Yeah, if we had Medicare, I know how I am, I'd have it somewhere in a folder to be able to get this information. But for now I can just put whatever date is that correct?

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:29.460
Renata: That's correct. Any day.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:53.889
P1: Let's see. Okay, so this is where I'll need to upload.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:31:04.999
Renata: Yeah. So you'll need that file. I already sent you, and I'm gonna send you another one in the chat, which is just a back of a dummy insurance card. You're gonna use those for these file uploads.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.949
P1: Okay. See the 2 that you sent me.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:22.120
Renata: Yeah, and I'll provide it. I just uploaded a Pdf of it. I'm also uploading a Png file of it in case the the Pdf. For some reason, doesn't work. But the 2 that I just added are identical.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:49.169
P1: Okay, I see. Try these. So one's the front and one's the back right.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:51.790
Renata: That is correct.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:13.330
P1: Back now. And let's see...Medicare part d.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:32.400
Renata: For the sake of time you can. You can mark no for this one.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:43.829
P1: Okay. Do you have another plan, the report for one or more applicant, so I will hit. Yes, for [DEPENDENT].

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:44.850
Renata: Yes, please.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:33:21.170
P1: 1st month. Do you want me to use the same ones or...?

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:25.270
Renata: Yes, please. I mean you can use anything but.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:25.690
P1: Yeah.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.539
Renata: For the sake of convenience. If you've still got them, use them.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:58.770
P1: Yeah, I won't delete them until we're done. No, true, continue. Do you have another plan to report for one or more applicants? Is there any other forms you want me put in? Or are the other.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:16.549
Renata: No other medicare at this point. So, as I mentioned before, I'd like you to also add a health insurance plan for both your spouse and and dependent, and you can use the same cards that I provided you already.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:35:23.799
P1: Oh, okay, gonna ask that. I'm just picking that. And for now. The...hmm. Remember, date the policy is inactive. For example...Oh, I see. Should I leave that blank?

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:32.729
Renata: Gonna be annoying again and ask a question to your question. Do you feel like you should leave a blank or put something in here?

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:54.240
P1: I guess when I read insurance termination date, which you know, I know we pay for insurance every year. I thought of it as being the date. You'd have to renew it. So the date it ends, and you'd have to start from scratch again. So that's why I put something in there.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.990
Renata: Got it. And why do you think they'd be asking for this information?

00:36:00.788 --> 00:36:11.670
P1: To what to know whether you have insurance, or if it's lapsed, or when. Yeah, I thought of as when it's gonna be expiring, at least the current plan.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:15.570
Renata: Okay. So for a future date that hasn't happened yet.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:20.700
P1: Yeah. And that's why I put October of this year.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:29.229
Renata: Okay. So to continue with the form, do you want to continue to fill this out? Or would you mark this blank? How would you handle this.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.149
P1: I would have marked this blank after talking about it.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:37.980
Renata: Okay. But initially, what would you have done if we hadn't paused here to talk?

00:36:37.980 --> 00:00:36:56.970
P1: Initially, I would have put the end of the fiscal year. I I think it's calendar year we pay. I don't. It just comes right out of my retirement check, so I don't even pay attention. But yeah, I would have [icked either end of the fiscal year or end of the calendar year.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:15.729
Renata: Got it for today. You can go ahead and select the month. Dropdown. and at the top it should have that select above January and I'll just have you leave that blank unless it's going to be difficult.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:25.119
P1: It's going to be difficult. Sometimes with the back button you can go back and come back to it.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:30.489
Renata: Let's see if clicking continue lets you continue without actually.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:32.970
P1: Oh, it did!

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:38.179
Renata: Like, I said, this isn't the real. It's a demo. So sometimes we run into these things.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:44.750
P1: Yeah, I've gone through that before, and I've had to hit click the back and it resets everything. You just have to retype information.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:46.360
Renata: Yeah.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:38:10.399
P1: Is this insurance through the applicants? Employer? Well, like is it? Yes and no as a retiree, I don't work for them anymore but it was through them. So I'm not. Yeah. I wouldn't know how to answer.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:15.830
Renata: Out of curiosity. Have you been asked this on other like healthcare enrollment forms?

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:16.490
P1: No.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.799
Renata: Okay

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.179
P1: With Tricare, they never ask anything else.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:29.419
Renata: Got it, and just like gut reaction, gut response. What would you...What would you put here? I know you said you don't know. But if you had to just pick one.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.290
P1: I would put. Yes.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.229
Renata: Okay, let's click. Yes, then, and see what happens.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:52.529
P1: Okay, and additional comments. Oh, I can make comments, but I'm not sure. I don't think I would add any comments...again without this conversation. I don't think I'd any any comments about it.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.099
Renata: Okay, that's fair. You can click, continue. If there's nothing that you would want to add there.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:29.399
P1: I would select both of them. Here it is the front of Mac. Okay, so report other health insurance.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:36.929
Renata: Gonna stop you at this point. Once you've reviewed everything on the screen.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:42.660
P1: Okay.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:55.840
Renata: All right. So on a scale of one to 5, with one being hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this, the Medicare and other Health insurance section of the form?

00:39:57.003 --> 00:40:00.760
P1: I thought it was easier I'd give it a 4 only.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.460
Renata: Okay.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:08.210
P1: Those couple of questions I had. But again, that's what I'd use the 800 numbers for.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:16.220
Renata: Okay. So if if you'd been filling this out in real life, you would have probably called the 800 number to get those questions answered?

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:41.729
P1: Yeah, like the the term when, especially with that termination. Just the way I read it, the way I filled out other forms in the past, I would have been a little confused on that one, so I would have had to just pick up the phone and call. Because the 1st thing I would have done is probably hit the back button because I've done that before, and it just erases a lot of information you put in. You just have to go back in and put it in.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:57.690
Renata: Got it. Okay. Let me double check to see if I had any other questions for you. Okay, so you can click no for other health insurance to add and click, continue.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.690
P1: Okay.

00:40:59.382 --> 00:41:13.349
Renata: So we're not going to submit the form today. This is going to be the last page that we look at. So without clicking submit. I'd like you to review your application for chant Va. Benefits for your spouse and dependent child.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:42:30.870
P1: See, and this is where I think another part that was confusing me on the applicant. Other forms I've submitted, whether it be for education, or any any other Va benefits. It'll ask me instead of applicant, it would say it would say applicant, if not the sponsor, or something to that effect. So it lets me know. Leave it blank because you already filled out information and all it may have is a box saying, You're you're also the sponsor and and the applicant. So I guess when I see more than one applicant on a form, especially if one person's filling it out, I guess, for me that was that's a confusing part. Looking back at other forms that I've submitted.

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:34.320
Renata: Got it that's really useful to know. Thank you for sharing.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:43:06.830
P1: You're welcome. So. Okay. And this is normal statement of truth. Put your name in. Certify that what you put in there was correct, and to the best of my knowledge. So I just all I'd be doing is put my name checking the box after reviewing the form and then submit it.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:19.369
Renata: Okay. So if you accidentally input some of the information on this application wrong, say, your spouse's name, how would you fix that? At this point.

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:24.949
P1: Well, at this point I I think I go back. There should be an area edit there it is.

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:34.700
Renata: Okay, yeah, you don't have to click it today. And without clicking anything. If you actually submitted this form, what would you expect to happen next?

00:43:36.760 --> 00:45:49.279
P1: 2 things, and it's hit and miss, what I've noticed. I should. I should see something. Hey? Success application was submitted, and an email doesn't always happen that way. But it's nice to have an email confirmation too many times with the Va. In fact, I went through it recently over the last 2 months I had applied twice for some education benefits for my daughter, and each time they told me, Hey, we don't have your application. We don't know where it's at. You gotta go investigate it. We get gotta give you another number. And then I call back 2, 3 weeks later. Oh, yeah, we've got both of them. Why'd you submit 2 of them? So the emails are nice because you can give them confirmation numbers where you can say, Hey, here's a confirmation number I received the 1st time. Here's the confirmation the second time that I did, in fact, submit the application. So so I know that can be cumbersome sometimes, or you know you sit there and wait a month or 2 months, or 3 months, and all of a sudden. You realize there's no tracking on it, and no one has visibility of it, so that that I would expect that I would receive a confirmation email telling me, oh. What the same thing that the online form, because the online form will give you a confirmation number as well, saying, Thank you for submitting your application. The email just has some a record. And I usually, as you can tell, I track a lot of things. So I keep the email. I do a screenshot of that confirmation page and I save those in a file until it's closed. But I think I do that because it's happened so many times where they've told me, especially in the past, when I used to have to submit things manually, just take them to the local VA Office and even then I used to always ask, Hey, could I get a copy stating, you know, something stating that I submitted this today and they always give it to me, but only if I asked if I didn't ask, they wouldn't even offer.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:46:17.229
Renata: Got it. I'm I'm sorry to hear about those experiences where you had to submit multiple times. Just wanted to recap. You'd expect to receive an email after submitting that would have a confirmation or like application id something similar to what you see on that submission page in an ideal world, you'd get both of those things. And how soon do you expect to be notified about action taken on your application?

00:46:17.990 --> 00:48:01.300
P1: I know, for all of them are different like the one I recently had that issue, with the only reason I found out so fast that there was no visibility of it, or it was lost, or whatever not. Sure exactly what happened, because they told me that typically they make the decision within 30 days. So it gave me something to look at in that particular situation. They asked me, Hey, how could we have done better? I said, well, there's no tracker on it. So you have to just keep checking where other things you apply for. There's a tracker saying where it's at which, hey, we received it. We're look, we're verifying information. And so typically 4 or 5 steps where that particular one for the education one, there's no tracker at all. You just have to log in to see, is it? There, you know, is even tracking. So the last com I had with them last week they said, Oh, it's taken us a lot longer than 30 days. Okay, at least I know there's visibility of it. And they said, Please feel free to call us, because we know there's no tracking which is which. At least they're they're they're welcoming to that. So with the CHAMPVA, it'd be great. If there was a tracker that way, you can just check yourself, or maybe at the beginning of the form, or even at the end of the form, hey? It typically takes us 6 months, 8 months, 9 months, because there's things that take,  unfortunately, years for them to to do. I would imagine that for something like CHAMPVA it shouldn't take that long, but I'm not sure how inundated they are, or what the process is.

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:04.650
Renata: Got it.

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:05.100
P1: Yeah.

00:48:05.343 --> 00:48:06.300
Renata: I think you mentioned a couple of times now like a tracker, someplace where you could check the status of an application. Where on va.gov. Would you envision? Finding that for CHAMPVA. 

00:48:19.700 --> 00:49:45.800
P1: I would imagine it's in the health side, like for disability, benefits and other claims. There's claims trackers in the education side. There are trackers for some things, but apparently it wasn't tracking what I was applying for, and so for the health side, I would imagine there there'd be somewhere in there to check hey? Status of CHAMPVA application some kind of button where you can go, because I know these people are busy so to be calling them. At the same time,  I realize if I don't call them. I don't know, or I don't know if something is missing, because sometimes you don't hear for months that, hey? We didn't decide because we're missing this document we've known for 3 months, and I'm being a little bit sarcastic. That's not exactly how they say it, but like, Yeah, you didn't submit this. How was I supposed to know to submit this? So the trackers are nice, because at least tells you. Hey? We're missing a document, even though it wasn't asked for in an application. They're missing it so you can at least contact them. Say, what document am I missing? So I can get that information to you? So so the yeah, the trackers are nice. Instead of having to pick up the phone and call an office that it's probably getting bombarded with with calls, left and right. And people are busy.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:50:01.779
Renata: Got it. I have one more question for you before we can stop screen sharing, so that one to 5 scale again, one being very hard 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits on this page.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:05.029
P1: Oh, reviewing was easy, I would say 5.

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:13.760
Renata: Got it. So we're done with. The demo portion of this you can stop screen sharing, and we'll just wrap up with a couple of other questions.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:14.580
P1: Okay.

00:50:17.529 --> 00:50:22.739
Renata: So overall. Was there anything that you saw in the session today that worked really well for you?

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:36.829
P1: Yeah, I like the steps, how it's laid out. So it's nice to see the steps that I'm gonna be taking. Like I mentioned the beginning. It's nice to see approximately how long it's gonna take you to fill it out.

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:43.759
Renata: Yeah, was there anything or unclear, or that didn't work well for you that you wanna mention?

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:59.450
P1: No, just just really that terminology. The the applicant part, I guess, because it's not the typical language that the Va. Uses for healthcare. So.

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:00.150
Renata: Okay.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:17.309
P1: So when you see, when you see that I was like Oh, wait a second. I refilled this out, my filling out again. What do I do, and you also don't want to fill it out wrong. because once you submit the application, that's a reason for them, then to not approve it.

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:18.800
Renata: Right.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:52:03.950
P1: And and sometimes you won't find out for months or longer that something wasn't approved because you fill in a section wrong, and what I've done in the past and I didn't see on this one. I just thought of it. Sorry. But I'll look at the forms online, because sometimes the forms have instructions, and they're a little bit more thorough. So I've looked at forms like even for the education. When I submitted recently, I'll look at the online form, the Pdf, and the backside typically has instructions, and they're a little bit more detailed. It's it's really small print. It's a lot of information. But it could save you heartache if you really read it and review review it well.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:12.089
Renata: Got it. So you're look, you're downloading that Pdf version of the form in order to fill out the the online education benefit.

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:52.770
P1: Yeah, cause sometimes that can save me a phone call some places when you call them like Education, if I call for the Gi bill usually within 3 min, I'm talking to them. But if I can avoid even that phone call, look at the piece of paper and say, Okay, I see, they're going a little more detail on this sheet of paper where online it doesn't have. And to me, I guess that's confusing. Because why would not they not have the exact same information that's on the form. But but yeah, that's been helpful as well sometimes, just to download the the paper version just so you can see it, even though you're not going to submit it manually.


00:52:53.790 --> 00:53:03.510
Renata: Yeah. Got it. What are your thoughts about the amount of information and clarity provided in this form? Was it enough? Not enough? Too much?

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:32.329
P1: No, I don't...I don't think I think it was enough. I I think it's just maybe some of the wording, but the amount of information. I think it's fine and obviously there's a link that tells you eligibility things, you know. So I didn't get to look at that part but but that should give enough information to at least know whether you're eligible, and to get started.

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:48.370
Renata: Okay. So I know that you mentioned we didn't get to click on those links. But knowing what you know now, having gone through the application. Is there any additional research that you would have done, or that you'd recommend to users filling out this form in order to like, be prepared for everything?


00:53:49.370 --> 00:55:00.980
P1: Yeah, for sure. Again, like like you mentioned, I have all that stuff on file, all like the Tricare Information School information letters. I would hope that eligibility's part ask you all that. So you can have that information because a lot of people just don't have that available, and they're scrambling, trying to get all that information, or they're calling the school or calling their kids that are in school. Hey? I need this form. Can you send me a picture of it, or a Pdf. File of it once you talk to your school. Some people don't keep it, I know, because I have friends that have been in the same boat. They're like, how do you get that? I go. I have it on my computer. I've done it so many times that I know that if I don't have it, it's just gonna cause heartache and slow things down. Although some of that stuff can probably just generic stuff, maybe could just be on the front on the chat. Va. You don't want to make it look too messy. I like that. It was clean where it outlines the steps. So as long as that eligibility link has all that in there, it's just less frustrating.

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:07.409
Renata: Got it. Any questions for me before we wrap up?

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:17.979
P1: No, I don't. I don't think so. I'm glad I participated. Learned a lot in case case I have to go through this process at least a little bit more educated on it.

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:27.040
Renata: Yeah. I just want to circle back before we we close out and reconfirm. Are you comfortable? If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va. Partners.

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:27.840
P1: Yes.

Renata: Alright and as a reminder. Again, we remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and we only share videos internally at the Va. For the purposes of improving. va.gov. well, with that I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. This feedback is super helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans. Lastly. Perigian is going to be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass on to any of your other veteran friends or acquaintances that you may know, provide them the chance to participate in future research studies like this one. And thank you so much again, enjoy your day. Have a wonderful week. Yeah.
