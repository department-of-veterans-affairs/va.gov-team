1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
P8: This is just soda water with fruit in it. Okay.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:14.399
Renata: Alright. I've started the recording. And I'd like to confirm, are you okay if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

3
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.410
P8: Yes.

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:25.359
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

5
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.260
P8: Yes.

6
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:38.950
Renata: All right. So with that all out of the way we're gonna kick off the fun stuff. So I have a few questions for you before we start playing around with our demo tool. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program?

7
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.409
P8: My husband is in it so, yes.

8
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.770
Renata: Oh, wonderful!

9
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.363
P8: Yeah. So I'm really interested to see if this goes electronic.

10
00:00:47.177 --> 00:00:57.180
Renata: That's great to hear. Did anyone such as a Veterans Service Organization, family member or friend, help you fill out the application when you applied for CHAMPVA?

11
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.940
P8: No.

12
00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.510
Renata: Okay.

13
00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.039
Renata: and aside from your husband, is anyone else in your household currently enrolled in the CHAMPVA program?

14
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.770
P8: No.

15
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.930
Renata: Okay.

16
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.786
Renata: Do you know, if you or your husband have submitted any

17
00:01:15.672 --> 00:01:21.100
Renata: other health insurance using the 10-7959 form?

18
00:01:22.113 --> 00:01:30.590
P8: Well, when he applied, it's still the same insurance. There hasn't been any changes, and I think he's been in it 2 years now.

19
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.680
Renata: Okay.

20
00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:36.630
Renata: so you just did the 10-7959 when you did the 1010d, and submitted

21
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.129
Renata: the other health insurance form?

23
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.349
P8: Yeah, I'm sorry. We did that. Yeah, we did that.

24
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.470
Renata: Okay.

25
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.339
Renata: and you mentioned that, you're excited to see the digital version. How did you submit the application originally 2 years ago?

26
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.188
P8: Paper, a lot a lot of paper.

27
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.480
P8: So it went back 2 years on, like doctor's bills and things like that.

28
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.160
P8: And so it was a good stack in the envelope.

29
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.250
Renata: Oh, okay, I imagine.

30
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.419
P8: On the receiving end, everything went through.

31
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:26.909
Renata: So you submitted everything from the date of of the disability determination? Okay, wow, can you tell me a little bit more about the experience of submitting the CHAMPVA application by mail?

32
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.109
P8: It was slow, and it seemed like some

33
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.299
P8: like...he got his Optum pharmacy card

34
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.411
P8: before we were aware that he was approved for CHAMPVA

35
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.430
P8: so some things didn't go in order

36
00:02:46.259 --> 00:03:03.349
P8: and then there just was so much because there was so much paperwork to provide for proof of stuff, and we're not medical people. So we didn't understand a lot of the terminology and things that were needed. So we mailed it all in.

37
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.430
P8: And then it came back

38
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.099
P8: and said, Oh, we need this, this and this, not what you sent us. So then we had to do it again

39
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.489
P8: so, and it was all through mail. So it was a few months.

40
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.810
Renata: I'm sorry to hear that, that sounds difficult, but

41
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.290
Renata: thank you so much

42
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:37.930
Renata: for sharing your experience. You mentioned, you know, you're you're not medical folks. Did you ever call into the the 800 number to get any help with understanding anything or just figuring it out?

43
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:49.499
P8: When we received the pharmacy card, we called and said, Well, cause we didn't know if that was his Health ID card or what. And they explained it was just the pharmacy card.

44
00:03:50.088 --> 00:03:51.719
P8: The actual like

45
00:03:52.070 --> 00:04:00.980
P8: health card comes in later. So we just had to wait for that, but they were a few weeks apart

46
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:09.040
P8: in receiving them. So we got pharmacy before we knew he was qualified for the program.

47
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:17.749
Renata: Got it. Have you or your husband submitted any medical or health claims to CHAMPVA?

48
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.469
P8: Not since the initial application.

49
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.300
Renata: No? Okay. Got it. Do you have a va.gov account?

50
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.380
P8: Yes.

51
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.480
Renata: And what has been your experience with logging into the site?

52
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:37.149
P8: Logging in is fine. It's just some of the

53
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.410
P8: I feel like sometimes when you're on one screen, and

54
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.697
P8: I don't know like, say I go to pharmacy, and I look at my medications. But then I remember I have to

55
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.850
P8: do a travel claim for an out-of-area visit at the doctor.

56
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.389
P8: I find it in a different...I find the travel claim in a different area.

57
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.810
P8: But where? Like, if you would just log on and go to travel claim.

58
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.190
P8: It's like different.

59
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:10.730
P8: So.

60
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:11.200
Renata: I see.

61
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.559
P8: It doesn't. They don't always look the same each screen.

62
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.169
P8: and I haven't done it again. But I call, I had to call

63
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.760
P8: the there's like a tech support number.

64
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.439
P8: and I had to call them because I wasn't able to see any of my doctor's notes.

65
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:41.219
P8: and it wasn't there. So you can see your doctor's visit, and it says something like doctor's notes. But that's not where you find doctor's notes.

66
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.509
P8: They took me somewhere completely different, and I was like. Oh, look! There they all are.

67
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.259
P8: but I haven't tried to get back into it since they told me how to do it, so I don't know if I could find it again.

68
00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:07.159
Renata: Got it. Well, thank you for sharing. It sounds like you're often visiting va.gov for medical appointments and and paperwork prescriptions. That sort of thing. How often are you visiting va.gov?

69
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.700
P8: Oh, I'd say once or twice a month.

70
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.850
Renata: Okay.

71
00:06:12.797 --> 00:06:28.769
Renata: I just wanted to circle back to the the CHAMPVA claims really quickly before we move on, you mentioned that your husband hasn't filed anything, any claims with them since the initial enrollment 2 years ago. Out of curiosity, has he just not had any

72
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.610
Renata: medical visits that would necessitate a claim?

73
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:39.189
P8: Oh, well, no, yeah, he's gone to medical appointments, but he shows he shows his blue cross

74
00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:49.800
P8: his first, his primary insurance, but he also has his CHAMPVA card, and he shows them that so they do, 1st billing and second billing.

75
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.460
Renata: Oh, got it!

76
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.390
P8: So that works out.

77
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.949
Renata: They do the whole thing.

78
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.929
P8: Yes, they're doing it, and it's working out fine. And the same thing for pharmacy.

79
00:06:59.637 --> 00:07:20.299
P8: We just had to switch pharmacies because rite aid went out of business, but they moved us over to CVS. So we had to explain to them again that yeah, you need both insurances on his prescription, and once we remind them, then it works out fine, and we don't pay anything.

80
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:36.700
Renata: Oh, wow! Got it. Okay, thank you for clarifying that. So at this point, we're gonna move to the portion where we get to play around with the the digital tool today. I'm gonna drop a link in the chat. Are you comfortable sharing your screen in zoom?

81
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.780
P8: Yes.

82
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.960
Renata: All right.

83
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.310
P8: Let's close that other stuff, so I don't get any pop-ups with you.

84
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.559
Renata: Oh, yeah.

85
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.015
Renata: Okay.

86
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.110
P8: All right. Can you see my screen?

87
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.839
Renata: I can't see your screen yet.

88
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.670
P8: Oh, I clicked your link. Is there something else I need to do?

89
00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:22.149
Renata: Yeah, if you go back into zoom at the bottom of the zoom application, there should be a row of icons, and in the middle of them there should be a green button with an up arrow that says, Share.

90
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.749
P8: I don't think I'm seeing my whole zoom.

91
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.609
P8: Oh, there we go! There's you!

92
00:08:31.536 --> 00:08:33.320
P8: Sure! There we go!

93
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.889
P8: Did that work.

94
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:39.139
Renata: It's.

95
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.569
P8: It's still spinning. It's still spinning.

96
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.790
Renata: It sometimes takes a minute.

97
00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.939
P8: Okay, there we go and share.

98
00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:49.149
P8: You are sharing.

99
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.750
Renata: Okay, yeah. If you can click on that tab that says 1010d Extended...

100
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.359
P8: I think I only have my zoom tab on here.

101
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.879
Renata: I don't see.

102
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.040
Renata: I see the other tab.

103
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.509
P8: The where it says this meeting is being recorded is covering.

104
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.680
Renata: Oh, if you hit okay, it'll it'll minimize.

105
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.530
P8: Come on, there we go.

106
00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.690
P8: Okay.

107
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.570
Renata: Alright perfect.

108
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:39.190
Renata: So few things to know before we start playing around with this. Like, I said before, this is our testing site. So you don't have to worry about any information going anywhere. We're not submitting anything today.

109
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.560
P8: Right.

110
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:51.910
Renata: And nothing you click in the form will have any benefits or bearing on your benefits as we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, such as social security numbers. If you don't want to use real information.

111
00:09:52.455 --> 00:10:16.749
Renata: there may be some spots in the form that ask you to upload documents since we're not submitting the form. And this isn't attached to VA systems in any way. Nothing we upload here is gonna be sent to Va, when we get to those screens that ask for a file to upload, you can upload a random picture that you might have on your desktop, or I can provide you with a sample document to upload. I'll remind you, when we get to those screens.

112
00:10:17.327 --> 00:10:19.350
Renata: Do you have any questions for me?

113
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.400
P8: No.

114
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:28.729
Renata: Alright. So, without clicking on anything, please take a look at all of the information on the page, and let us know your thoughts.

115
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.350
P8: Yeah.

116
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.860
P8: Well, I don't have an iphone, so I don't know what voice over voice control is.

117
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.490
Renata: Oh, you can

118
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:40.960
Renata: just click

119
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.239
Renata: Out of that. I'm sorry. I don't know why that popup is there.

120
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.710
P8: That's okay. That's okay. There we go.

121
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:51.680
P8: Okay.

122
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.550
P8: Looks fine. So far.

123
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.400
Renata: Alright. Do you want to scroll down and look at anything else on this page?

124
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.260
P8: Sure

125
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.550
P8: gather information supporting documents.

126
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.390
P8: Start the application.

127
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.260
P8: Then, after you apply.

128
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.709
P8: So up here. Oh, that's just find out if you're eligible. Okay.

129
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.770
P8: So if you click on, find out if you're eligible.

130
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:51.069
P8: and I guess it's going to ask you questions to find out if you are if you are. Does it take you back to this step by step through the screens?

131
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:59.629
Renata: I'm gonna be a little annoying and answer your question with another question. Is that what you would want to happen if you clicked that?

132
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.725
P8: Yes, okay.

133
00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:10.580
P8: So you'd like a little like eligibility, determination. And it tells you, yes, no. And you end up back here to start.

134
00:12:11.516 --> 00:12:17.579
P8: Yeah, cause it says, find out if you're eligible. So if you're not eligible, why would you

135
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.740
P8: start an application? I guess I'm not sure

136
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.660
P8: if those 2 are related, or.

137
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:34.139
Renata: Got it. You mean the second link there the find out which documents you'll need?

138
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:39.160
P8: No. Number 3 says, start your application. We'll take you step by step of the process.

139
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.600
Renata: Okay.

140
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:48.610
P8: But maybe find out if you're eligible should not be a link. It's it's highlighted and underlined like it's a link.

141
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.099
Renata: Okay. Yeah. Like, I said, some things on this site aren't gonna be clickable.

142
00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.290
Renata: We won't be able to click that link today. But.

143
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:55.610
P8: Okay.

144
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.039
Renata: That would be a page that you could go.

145
00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:03.030
P8: Oh, okay, okay. So then I would hope that that page

146
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.879
P8: tells you. Yes, go ahead with the application process or no, don't.

147
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.170
Renata: Okay.

148
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:19.530
P8: Then you collect your documents, and then you start the application, and then we'll contact you.

149
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:35.470
Renata: So, aside from aside from wanting that link to sort of give you like a clear thumbs up or thumbs down about starting the application. Any other initial thoughts or impressions about this page?

150
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.810
P8: No.

151
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:49.730
Renata: Okay, I have a few questions for you before we start filling out this form. Do you know, if you're on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

152
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:50.960
P8: Yes.

153
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.690
Renata: And how?

154
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.419
P8: It says it really big. It says it really big, right there.

155
00:13:57.922 --> 00:13:59.550
Renata: What would be.

156
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:05.090
P8: It's nice, too, though, that if I mean, if I didn't mean to click on this

157
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:14.160
P8: I wouldn't know what this page is, because maybe I don't know what CHAMPVA is. It should be spelled out, because that's an acronym.

158
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.590
Renata: Okay.

159
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:21.190
P8: It should be spelled out, because then oh, wait! That's not what I wanted to click on, and I could back out.

160
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.880
Renata: Got it.

161
00:14:24.476 --> 00:14:26.860
Renata: So just above the big

162
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:35.020
Renata: text that says, Apply for CHAMPVA benefits in bold. It says, 1010d Extended. Does that mean anything to you?

163
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.700
P8: No.

164
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.410
Renata: Okay.

165
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:37.230
P8: Yeah.

166
00:14:38.506 --> 00:14:40.421
Renata: That's completely fine.

167
00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:51.400
Renata: So when filling this out, would you expect to see the 10-7959, the other health insurance form as part of this?

168
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.480
P8: Yes.

169
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:53.610
Renata: Okay.

170
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.809
P8: Yeah, because you have to provide that. So it should be included.

171
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.220
Renata: Okay.

172
00:14:59.026 --> 00:15:12.369
Renata: and I know you've already filled out this form before, so you're probably pro at it. But if you were on va.gov, filling this out with your spouse today, what research would you do before applying for and completing a form like this?

173
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.499
P8: I would look to see what it is.

174
00:15:17.098 --> 00:15:19.429
P8: What kind of benefits they provide?

175
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:30.349
P8: Things like: What kind of doctor can I see? Or what doctor can I see? Maybe eligible doctors

176
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:40.600
P8: within that program? If and maybe if I have a copay allowances, things like that.

177
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.730
Renata: Okay.

178
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.573
P8: Because I mean, if that's gonna cost too much money, why have it?

179
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:59.210
Renata: Right when you were applying for CHAMPVA before. Is that the sort of research that you did, or how did you know that you were eligible for this benefit with your spouse?

180
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:06.410
P8: I did not find out for a while. I was in one of the

181
00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:12.550
P8: DAV offices just finding out, you know.

182
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:19.499
P8: Hey, I'm a hundred percent. All of what does that include? Can you guys tell me, help me out? And they mentioned this program.

183
00:16:20.326 --> 00:16:24.619
P8: and I think they even gave us a flyer for it. Just

184
00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:30.119
P8: to say, you know where to go download documents and things like that.

185
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.385
Renata: Okay.

186
00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:38.499
Renata: so on this page, do you know how to check your eligibility for CHAMPVA benefits for your spouse?

187
00:16:40.826 --> 00:16:42.329
P8: For my spouse? No.

188
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.130
Renata: Okay.

189
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.439
P8: I know how to see mine. I don't know how to see his.

190
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:48.840
Renata: Okay.

191
00:16:49.856 --> 00:16:56.979
Renata: and I know you've already filled the form out. But what information do you think you'll need on hand to fill this application out?

192
00:16:58.138 --> 00:17:01.071
P8: Well, since I was the veteran.

193
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:09.199
P8: all of my information, my service dates my social branch of service.

194
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.930
P8: which I mean. I know that, but

195
00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:15.270
P8: I would think that's questions that they would ask

196
00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:16.559
Renata: Okay

197
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:23.040
P8: And like, maybe his information, age and marriage, date.

198
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.000
Renata: Okay

199
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:35.979
Renata: And would you have all of that information on hand? Or if you were filling this out online, would you need to pause and collect all of that information before applying?

200
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.043
P8: Oh, pausing is great!

201
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.550
Renata: Okay.

202
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:54.829
P8: Because, you know, we may not think. You know, some people don't have their social memorized, and we may not think that you need his social, since it's under me. So we might have to pause to go get that information.

203
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.200
Renata: Okay.

204
00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:11.759
Renata: One last question for this page on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed. Do you feel about the CHAMPVA application you're about to begin, based on the content, on the page?

205
00:18:12.428 --> 00:18:14.259
P8: Is that? Okay? If I scroll again? Sorry.

206
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.410
Renata: Absolutely go ahead!

207
00:18:18.094 --> 00:18:21.180
P8: Besides what we've already talked about.

208
00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.450
P8: 15 min.

209
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.310
P8: What's the expiration date?

210
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:34.720
P8: I just noticed that there's an expiration date view privacy.

211
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:39.889
P8: Well, it has a phone number to contact. If you need help, we're here 24/7

212
00:18:40.283 --> 00:18:45.110
P8: or you can go to a VSO, and you can even find a VSO on that link?

213
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:55.280
P8: Really, if it just near the heading, if it said what CHAMPVA is, and even spelled out.

214
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.339
P8: I you wanted a rating.

215
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.449
Renata: Yeah, 1 to 5.

216
00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.400
P8: One, I'd give it like a 4 and a half.

217
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:10.475
Renata: Okay. If I had to be really strict, and you had to give it a whole number, would it be more of a 4 or 5?

218
00:19:11.906 --> 00:19:15.080
P8: I'd say 4, because there's room for improvement.

219
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:29.359
Renata: Okay, noted. So at this point you can scroll down to the bottom of the page. And in that big blue box there's a small link under the button that says, Start your form without signing in. I'd like you to click that, please.

220
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:31.970
P8: All right.

221
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:56.319
Renata: Okay. So at this point I'd like you to start the form as if you were applying for benefits for your spouse and one other family member like a dependent child. I'll let you know when to pause, and we'll talk in a little bit more. But to help orient you, we're going to go through the 1st 3 sections of the form and a couple of our reminders again, it's the testing site. So no, this isn't being submitted.

222
00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:05.799
Renata: and you can use fake information for sensitive questions. And as you go through the form, please remember to think out loud. We want to hear your reactions and thoughts as you're experiencing them.

223
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.990
P8: I'm not sure what it means by signer information.

224
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.340
P8: Do I sign because I'm the sponsor? Or is this the person signing up?

225
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:31.659
P8: because down below it says, like, "I am the veteran applying for benefits," or "I'm the representative," or "I'm applying for myself."

226
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.730
P8: What does Signer mean?

227
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:43.860
Renata: I'm gonna be annoying again and ask you answer with a question which is, what what do you think? Based on the information that you're seeing.

228
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.210
P8: I think it should say applicant information.

229
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.200
P8: The person who's applying.

230
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:53.370
Renata: Got it.

231
00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:03.659
P8: It may take some time. Which of these describes you. You see, I'm a veteran applying for benefits for my spouse or dependents.

232
00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.040
P8: I think it should be applicant information.

233
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.450
Renata: Okay.

234
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.979
P8: Okay, do I go ahead and click one.

235
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.949
Renata: Yeah, go ahead and click which one just best describes you, and we can get moving.

236
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.140
P8: All right, and continue.

237
00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.160
Renata: Yes, please.

238
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.360
P8: Okay

239
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.699
P8: And then my name

240
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:41.139
P8: middle not required last name. We're gonna fake info and suffix.

241
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:43.630
P8: I have none.

242
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.160
P8: Continue.

243
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.290
P8: Hmm!

244
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.540
P8: No country.

245
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.962
P8: Well, I like that. You put United States at the top.

246
00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:06.710
P8: [street address]

247
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:20.130
P8: [city, state, zip].

248
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.170
P8: Continue, though

249
00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.690
P8: phone number required.

250
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.870
P8: Do I have to put dashes in?

251
00:22:48.986 --> 00:22:49.620
Renata: No dashes.

252
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.190
P8: It doesn't say it doesn't say so. I'm

253
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.450
P8: okay.

254
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.390
P8: Sponsor information.

255
00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.800
P8: Can I? Back up.

256
00:23:19.242 --> 00:23:25.810
Renata: Yeah, if you go up to the if you scroll up a little bit, you see, it says back to previous page above the bar.

257
00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.969
P8: Because I'm not sure I filled that out right, because the 1st

258
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:36.690
P8: page said, "I am a veteran applying for my spouse or children"

259
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.920
P8: and I put in my name.

260
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:44.990
P8: but now it wants a sponsor name, and I am the sponsor.

261
00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:47.700
P8: So.

262
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.330
Renata: So do you want to go back and double check that you put the information in? Or do you want to

263
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:52.980
Renata: go forward? 

264
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.740
P8: I'm going to go back.

265
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.649
P8: Yeah, see?

266
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.930
P8: Maybe that should have said sponsor information.

267
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.700
P8: I'm not sure, because your mailing address I mean

268
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.450
P8: signer information.

269
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.980
P8: I would fill this out differently, depending on how that is worded.

270
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.230
Renata: Okay.

271
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:28.149
P8: So I think, before we had said applicant information.

272
00:24:28.597 --> 00:24:37.409
P8: If it said that, then yes, I would put my husband's name but I put my name

273
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:41.359
P8: because I'm the sponsor, and I'm used to doing that first

274
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:42.910
Renata: Okay.

275
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.060
P8: So I'm not sure how I should continue.

276
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:47.710
Renata: For this...

277
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.610
P8: I feel like I messed up my application already.

278
00:24:50.610 --> 00:25:00.050
Renata: You didn't mess it up. Trust me, there's no messing it up in this session. Let's try pressing "Continue" and going forward back to where you were.

279
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:00.780
P8: Okay.

280
00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:20.539
Renata: So I just wanna double check. As you understand it, you are the sponsor. And so what you already filled out should have been your information. So, seeing this screen here is causing confusion?

281
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:25.509
P8: Yes, and I think that's because those first 3 question [responses] were.

282
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:30.650
P8: I clicked "I am the veteran applying for my spouse and children."

283
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.729
P8: So I put my information.

284
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:39.829
Renata: Alright for the sake of time, let's hit the continue button.

285
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:40.510
P8: Okay.

286
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.939
P8: okay, so it has my information in there already.

287
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.059
Renata: Is this what you expected when you hit continue?

288
00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:04.999
P8: well knowing that now it's asking for sponsors, name, and date of birth, and it automatically filled it in.

289
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.889
P8: And it's not the applicant information.

290
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:14.770
P8: It's the sponsor information. I guess this is okay.

291
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.630
P8: I just don't know why it needs to be on 2 screens.

292
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.030
Renata: Got it.

293
00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:27.779
P8: But I can go ahead and continue. It's got my sponsor's name. That's me.

294
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:42.109
P8: Okay. Date of birth. We'll go with [DOB] continue.

295
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.520
P8: And then it needs a social.

296
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.349
Renata: Unfortunately, it doesn't let you do 1, 2, 3, 4, so like, if you can transpose 2 numbers...

297
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.910
P8: They're on to us. They know they know. Sorry as long as I don't have to remember it.

298
00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:04.772
Renata: Oh, no, 

299
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.719
Renata: Like, I said. We're not testing you.

300
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:15.510
P8: Okay, mailing address is a... it is not.

301
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:21.610
P8: Yes, it's it's got all my information again that I already typed in.

302
00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.699
P8: And my phone number.

303
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.099
P8: And now I can add applicants.

304
00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.190
P8: I'm sorry I just kept going. Continue, is that okay?

305
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.770
Renata: Totally okay.

306
00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:39.240
Renata: Okay.

307
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:44.779
Renata: And just as a reminder, I'd like you to fill this out as if you're applying for your spouse and a dependent child.

308
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:50.880
P8: Okay, enter information about each applicant. Okay, now it's the applicant information.

309
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:59.800
P8: I can add up to 25. So 1st name, [NAME].

310
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:12.120
P8: we'll make him fancy he's a [Suffix].

311
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.029
P8: Oh, that's cool.

312
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.150
P8: that's nice. It let you put the same address. You don't have to type it in again.

313
00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.779
P8: His mailing address. So I guess I'm just verifying the mailing address.

314
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.290
P8: And yes, it's correct.

315
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:12.310
P8: And his contact information, oh, phone number

316
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.480
P8: and the email address

317
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.510
P8: continue.

318
00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:33.270
P8: His sex listed at birth.

319
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:42.209
P8: Male. Relationship to sponsor, spouse, or partner,

320
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.440
P8: Civil union or child.

321
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:49.470
P8: Continue.

322
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.370
P8: Oh, see? Date of marriage. Date of marriage.

323
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.150
P8: Huh!

324
00:29:59.895 --> 00:30:03.469
P8: We'll go with [DATE]

325
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.259
P8: Does it validate the dates when you do it?

326
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:15.789
P8: Like, what if I accidentally put a year before I was born on the marriage?

327
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.550
P8: Or if I put like September 35th?

328
00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.360
Renata: You want to try it and see what happens?

329
00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.919
P8: Maybe it'll say that's not a valid date. I'll just try this one.

330
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:37.420
P8: I'll just try to, and I'll say a good year.

331
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.349
P8: Oh, look, it does. Okay.

332
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.530
P8: Valid date.

333
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.479
P8: Okay, it does check you.

334
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.350
P8: And that's correct. Do you have another applicant?

335
00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:00.960
P8: Yes, 24 applicants. My goodness, that's a big family.

336
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:10.810
P8: The next person we'll call them [DEPENDENT].

337
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:18.480
P8: And well, we don't name people anything anymore. So they're just not anything.

338
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.750
P8: I've noticed. People don't follow family names a whole lot anymore.

339
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.950
P8: [DOB]

340
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.070
P8: identification

341
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.770
P8: continue changes.

342
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:50.640
P8: Address.

343
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.360
P8: Same, continue.

344
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.820
P8: That's all. Correct.

345
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:07.719
P8: Continue contact information.

346
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:27.550
P8: Yes, [PHONE NUMBER]. We'll give them a fun email, continue

347
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:35.569
P8: sex lady at birth. We'll make it a girl. I don't have any girls, so we'll give me a fake girl.

348
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.105
P8: Continue.

349
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.980
P8: What's the relationship?

350
00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.690
P8: Child, continue.

351
00:32:47.430 --> 00:33:03.630
P8: Oh, so 3 different questions. What is this dependent status, biological step, or adopted biological? Review yur applicants.

352
00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:15.440
Renata: Alright, we're gonna pause on this screen. As you were going through that anything unusual or unexpected that you saw? Or was it all pretty pretty much as expected?

353
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:19.230
P8: It was as expected.

354
00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.430
Renata: Okay.

355
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:33.579
Renata: got it. I'm gonna ask a scale question again on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the sponsor and applicant sections of.

356
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.179
P8: Oh, that was very easy.

357
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:42.090
P8: I'd say that's a 5 that was very easy for me, especially when we tried a fake date, and it worked.

358
00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:45.950
P8: That makes it awesome, and goof proof.

359
00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.400
Renata: Okay.

360
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:54.159
Renata: got it. So you can go ahead and answer no to other applicants to add and click the continue button.

361
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:58.440
P8: No, continue.

362
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.869
P8: Do you have any medicare?

363
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:11.810
Renata: Yeah. So before we start filling this out, just take a look at this page. Let me know if you have any questions about it, and I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions before we proceed.

364
00:34:16.297 --> 00:34:17.429
P8: I do not.

365
00:34:18.099 --> 00:34:19.499
P8: Okay, no questions.

366
00:34:20.077 --> 00:34:26.430
Renata: Do you understand? Or in your own words, could you tell me what this section is asking you for?

367
00:34:27.371 --> 00:34:31.900
P8: That's extra assistance. I think. Medicare..Medicaid comes from the State

368
00:34:32.865 --> 00:34:39.680
P8: and when you're older I think it's when you're 62, you qualify for these.

369
00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:40.730
Renata: Okay.

370
00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:45.989
P8: And even once you start using strictly CHAMPVA. Or if you're using strictly CHAMPVA

371
00:34:46.557 --> 00:34:51.079
P8: you have to use one of those if you're old enough to qualify.

372
00:34:51.620 --> 00:35:01.109
Renata: Okay, thinking back to the information you saw on the 1st page today. Do you remember if Medicare was mentioned at all?

373
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.450
P8: It was not.

374
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:12.560
Renata: Okay. And then from what you remember, do you know why the form is asking you for Medicare information? You kind of already answered, but any any other thoughts?

375
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:18.320
P8: Yeah, I just think they need to make sure that you're not getting other assistance.

376
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:19.210
Renata: Okay.

377
00:35:20.398 --> 00:35:28.710
Renata: and if you were filling out the CHAMPVA benefits application on va.gov today, would you need to stop and collect more documents for additional insurance at this point?

378
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:50.530
P8: Yes, because it's a weird number for Medicare and Medicaid. So I would have to go look that up, find it, or something like that, and especially if it's new to me. I'd might have to log into something to get that number. So yeah, I would need to save and continue later.

379
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.419
Renata: Okay, got it. 

380
00:35:53.420 --> 00:36:04.170
P8: But I think when we started also, it said "Log in to save your progress." But I did not log in, so that maybe that's why, I'm not seeing that option right now.

381
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:18.170
Renata: Yeah, yeah, we're not using the the logged in option for this. It's just a little easier in our test site. But if you were doing this for real on va.gov, you'd be logged in, and you'd save in progress is what I'm hearing? Okay.

382
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.520
P8: Yes.

383
00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:36.949
Renata: Thank you. So for the purposes of today's session, I'd like you to imagine that your spouse and dependent child have both Medicare as well as private health insurance. So go ahead and fill out this section with Medicare and private health insurance information for both your spouse and dependent child.

384
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:41.040
P8: Okay. So we'll say yes and continue.

385
00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.180
P8: which applicant needs Medicare. And you said, Put it for both of them?

386
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:50.729
Renata: Yeah, you're gonna be listing Medicare and and health insurance for both.

387
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:52.759
P8: Okay. Oh, it doesn't let me

388
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:56.550
P8: one at a time, I guess. Which applicant

389
00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:01.349
P8: I clicked on [SPOUSE] and [DEPENDENT], and it switched so I can only do one at a time.

390
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.230
P8: So then I'll click continue.

391
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:11.990
P8: Which of the following plans does this beneficiary

392
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:19.110
P8: have? It has his [SPOUSE] name on there, I remember which one I clicked on, because if I had 24 [dependents] I'd forget which dependent I was on

393
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.720
P8: original medicare parts A and B hospital and medical previously enrolled.

394
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:35.250
P8: I'm just going to choose A and continue effective date.

395
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.729
P8: Oh, boy, yeah, see, I'd really need that card information.

396
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.799
P8: We'll just pick a date right.

397
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.050
Renata: Yeah. Any random date

398
00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.740
P8: Effective date.

399
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:53.449
P8: Okay to the 2 different ones.

400
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:59.110
P8: And we'll just say the same date.

401
00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:07.539
P8: Continue upload Medicare card.

402
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.790
P8: So you need to submit a copy. Okay.

403
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:24.929
Renata: Yeah. At this point I can provide you with a dummy document to upload, or if you just have a random picture on your desktop. You can pick that again. We're not submitting this. So this doesn't go anywhere. It's not

404
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:26.930
Renata: any any database.

405
00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:38.319
P8: so it says you have to send it. Oh, there it is! You need a Jpg, Png or Pdf file.

406
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.900
P8: Make sure it's 20MB or less.

407
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.729
P8: If you have a paper copy, upload.

408
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.710
P8: scan or take a photo and upload the image.

409
00:38:51.615 --> 00:38:53.520
P8: Okay, upload file.

410
00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.570
P8: Oh, wow! I really did just go to my stuff.

411
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:06.970
P8: how about some sheet pan pizza? It says it's a Pdf.

412
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:23.750
P8: okay. I didn't see anything saying successfully loaded. But it's

413
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:28.180
P8: it's there. So I guess it worked.

414
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.840
Renata: Okay.

415
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.450
P8: Maybe just a little pop-up upload successful.

416
00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:40.790
Renata: In an ideal world, you'd like to see some sort of confirmation?

417
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.680
P8: Yes, okay, yes.

418
00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:50.459
P8: because the way I mean the way it looks right now, it's like that's the file name I picked. But I don't know if it's really there or not.

419
00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.090
Renata: Okay.

420
00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:57.560
P8: Upload back of original Medicare card required.

421
00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:03.970
P8: Upload desktop.

422
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:13.779
P8: Oh, let's go with the 2025 Veterans Guide. That's the back of the card.

423
00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:25.380
P8: Yeah. See? It didn't give me any kind of indication that it uploaded. Okay, got it.

424
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.640
P8: So.

425
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:36.300
Renata: I'm curious. If it showed you a little thumbnail of the file you uploaded. Would that be better?

426
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.439
P8: That would be good.

427
00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.470
Renata: Okay.

428
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.850
P8: Yes.

429
00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:39.180
Renata: Got it.

430
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.180
P8: That that would be understandable.

431
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.320
Renata: Okay.

432
00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.959
P8: And then continue.

433
00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.620
Renata: Yeah.

434
00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:50.150
P8: [SPOUSE] Medicare part d.

435
00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:57.339
P8: Do you have medicare part d coverage? I thought I just said A and B for him.

436
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.529
P8: I don't remember it asking about D in the beginning.

437
00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.369
P8: Do you want me to say yes on this one, and do a file?

438
00:41:10.875 --> 00:41:13.569
Renata: You can click no, for the sake of time.

439
00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:14.240
P8: Okay

440
00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.460
P8: And then continue.

441
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.350
P8: [SPOUSE]

442
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:28.720
P8: provisionally occur parts A and B hospital and medical.

443
00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:34.858
P8: Okay, I feel like something's lacking here.

444
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.410
Renata: What's lacking?

445
00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:47.260
P8: The report for one or more applicants. Well, I mean, it just says, review your plan.

446
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.820
P8: Maybe it should say files attached.

447
00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.130
P8: or something, because this just looks like

448
00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.909
P8: I mean it. It's it says Medicare parts A and B.

449
00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.410
P8: Review your plan.

450
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.610
P8: I can edit or delete

451
00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:17.909
P8: I mean, I don't know it. Just

452
00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.710
P8: if I had less skills with the computer.

453
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.080
P8: It.

454
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.420
P8: It's simple.

455
00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:32.620
P8: And I mean, it gets to the point.

456
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.060
P8: But Medicare plans.

457
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.840
P8: Maybe a review plans applied for, or something even

458
00:42:43.007 --> 00:42:49.119
P8: and I've applied for original parts A and B, or suspended parts A and B.

459
00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:50.430
Renata: Okay.

460
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:51.600
P8: Would work for me.

461
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:57.679
Renata: And any other additional information. I think you mentioned wanting to see like files or something there?

462
00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:03.510
P8: Yeah, but all it had me. It had me do the the front and the back.

463
00:43:04.205 --> 00:43:04.450
Renata: That.

464
00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:07.849
P8: Was the files that I submitted was the front and the back of the card.

465
00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:13.439
P8: So you yeah, just

466
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:23.620
P8: files submitted, or something like that, acknowledging that they received what I submitted, even.

467
00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:24.850
Renata: Okay.

468
00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:28.340
P8: Or a a thumbnail like you said before, would be good, too.

469
00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:35.220
P8: Got it? Do you have anyone else? Yes, I do. So I'll do [DEPENDENT] now.

470
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:37.130
Renata: Yep.

471
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:51.270
P8: Okay, and they are the only one that I want to left to add for and continue.

472
00:43:52.650 --> 00:44:00.259
P8: And she's pretty healthy, doesn't need any pills. So we'll just give her hospital.

473
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:06.490
P8: Continue just to try a different button. Really.

474
00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:28.120
P8: Yeah, front of card back of card upload front.

475
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.270
P8: Since they're a minor. It looks pretty much like Dad's.

476
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.029
P8: so we'll just use the same 2 files.

477
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.120
P8: Oh, open!

478
00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:49.410
P8: And then the back.

479
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.930
P8: I think that was that button.

480
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:09.879
P8: I think before to the little loading bar went so fast I didn't even notice some of it loaded

481
00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:11.880
Renata: Oh, okay.

482
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:20.729
P8: Yeah, I mean, don't slow down your system. But continue.

483
00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.000
P8: Hmm!

484
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:33.559
P8: So I have uploaded those plans files uploaded, I guess. Do you have another plan

485
00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.680
P8: to report for one or more applicants.

486
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.769
P8: My answer would be, No, but this is a trial system.

487
00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:53.769
P8: What if I said, oh, wait, [SPOUSE] does have pharmacy, and I needed to go back.

488
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.420
P8: I could just choose edit right.

489
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:59.659
P8: And then go back and add more for her?

490
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:05.059
Renata: Is that what you would? Wanna you'd expect to happen if if you realized a mistake here? Okay.

491
00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.030
P8: Yeah, should I go ahead and try it?

492
00:46:07.807 --> 00:46:11.429
Renata: We're not gonna try it today. But okay, that's fine to know that. Yeah.

493
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:16.010
Renata: you can click no there and and continue.

494
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.900
P8: Okay.

495
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:24.669
Renata: So like I mentioned before, I'd like you to add a health insurance plan for both of your applicants.

496
00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:25.820
P8: Okay

497
00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.720
P8: Yes.

498
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.150
P8: Continue.

499
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.589
P8: yeah. State Medicaid or a state program. I already did that.

500
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:49.770
P8: I'm just gonna do a HMO name of insurance, right?

501
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:55.780
P8: Insurance start date.

502
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:04.449
P8: It started in October of 1990.

503
00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:07.090
P8: Termination date.

504
00:47:11.016 --> 00:47:15.910
P8: It's usually on December, I think, is when sign up periods go again.

505
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.990
P8: We'll just do a current year

506
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:37.029
P8: "only enter this date if the policy is inactive, provide a valid current or past date."

507
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:42.279
P8: Oh, cause it's not December of this year yet. Okay.

508
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:58.450
P8: well, I mean, I don't. I don't like that, though I know I already hit enter. But if my plan expires in December of this year.

509
00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.129
P8: Why can't I put December of this year?

510
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:04.060
P8: Okay

511
00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:12.970
P8: for me to put a current or past date? Otherwise, if I put a current date, then I'm saying I don't have this insurance anymore. It expired.

512
00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:22.569
Renata: Got it. So if if this was up on va.gov, you want that to be able to accept a future date?

513
00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:29.189
P8: Yes, because I'm saying I'm claiming them as an insurance. I'm reporting them as my

514
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:35.080
P8: other health insurance policy. So it needs to be a future date to be a valid policy.

515
00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.809
Renata: Okay, thank you for that feedback.

516
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:42.880
P8: Is this through the applicant's employer?

517
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.910
P8: Yes.

518
00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:47.110
P8: Continue

519
00:48:52.320 --> 00:49:00.980
P8: additional comments I, don't know what I would even put in there.

520
00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:04.127
Renata: That's totally fine.

521
00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.870
P8: I'll just say continue. It doesn't say.

522
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:07.429
Renata: Okay.

523
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:08.180
P8: If it's required.

524
00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:16.629
P8: Which applicant has the health plan? They both do.

525
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:18.030
P8: Oh, good!

526
00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:24.230
P8: I like that. It let me put both of them upload

527
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:29.870
P8: the group health health insurance card upload file.

528
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:35.240
P8: Hmm.

529
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.100
P8: and I'll just use using the same ones. Okay.

530
00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.600
Renata: Totally fine. Yeah.

531
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.310
P8: Okay.

532
00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.799
P8: okay, and upload the back

533
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:03.650
P8: and continue.

534
00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:11.580
Renata: All right, we're gonna I'm surprised it didn't ask me for a policy number.

535
00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:16.089
Renata: Oh, interesting! So you would expect to see that for the health insurance

536
00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:16.770
P8: Yes.

537
00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:17.440
Renata: Plans?

538
00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:30.019
P8: Yeah, usually it wants, like your group number, or your policy number even, or even, who is the primary holder of that? Because it. Let me click both of them at the same time.

539
00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.080
P8: Okay, yeah.

540
00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.079
P8: Do you have other to report?

541
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:37.190
P8: Oh, yeah.

542
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:38.630
Renata: We'll pause there

543
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:58.970
Renata: right here for a second. I did want to ask you about the expectations around like adding policy holder, group number. Since you're uploading a copy of the card, are you confident that that information is enough, since it's that information is usually on the card? Or would you want the reassurance of also filling it in on the form?

544
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:08.739
P8: No, that's fine. If if they're going to take it from it. Usually, that's just the pictures required, for, you know, extra proof.

545
00:51:09.133 --> 00:51:13.230
P8: And if they're going to take the information they need from the card, that's fine.

546
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:25.999
Renata: Okay, I'm going to ask that 1 to 5 scale question again. So, one being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to complete the Medicare and Health Insurance section of the form.

547
00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:31.599
P8: I'm gonna say that one's more like a 4 because I did have questions.

548
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:32.789
Renata: Okay, that's totally.

549
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:33.540
P8: Easy.

550
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.750
Renata: Or is it easy, but not very easy?

551
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:37.530
P8: Yes.

552
00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:42.650
Renata: And what in your mind would make it like a very easy?

553
00:51:44.412 --> 00:51:47.069
P8: So like saying, it's been uploaded

554
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.840
P8: confirming the upload of the documents.

555
00:51:50.692 --> 00:51:56.100
P8: That that would make it completely easy, and

556
00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:01.470
P8: examples of, I guess that remarks box

557
00:52:02.032 --> 00:52:06.259
P8: examples of what kind of information I could put there.

558
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:06.990
P8: Maybe.

559
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.620
Renata: Okay.

560
00:52:07.986 --> 00:52:12.180
P8: Because that would just help trigger people's minds.

561
00:52:13.219 --> 00:52:17.529
P8: That, you know. Oh, hey! I should include this information or something.

562
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.149
P8: I don't know.

563
00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:21.219
Renata: Got it. Thank you.

564
00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:29.410
P8: And yeah. And then again, the who is the primary policy holder on this group, health

565
00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:32.240
P8: in that review box?

566
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:37.809
P8: Yeah, I don't know, or even a choice, when you're clicking the names

567
00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:45.920
P8: cause you can put like their names and then put primary holder.

568
00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.680
P8: and then they can click which name has the primary holder.

569
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:52.080
Renata: Oh, I see. Okay.

570
00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.070
P8: Yeah, like, more columns to it. Kind of thing.

571
00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:59.649
P8: Then it's on one screen, and you don't have to go through too much.

572
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.220
Renata: Okay.

573
00:53:03.478 --> 00:53:12.039
Renata: I know we're almost at time we got a little bit more to go through, is it? Okay? If we we go a couple of minutes over just wanna double check. Okay.

574
00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.700
P8: Yeah. Just let me know when you're done.

575
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:17.230
Renata: Perfect. Go ahead and click the continue button for me.

576
00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:18.000
P8: Okay.

577
00:53:18.765 --> 00:53:30.140
Renata: So this is the last screen that we're going to look at. We're not actually submitting the form, but without submitting. I'd like you to review your application for CHAMPVA. Benefits for your spouse, independent.

578
00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:31.910
P8: Okay. So if I click.

579
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:33.230
Renata: Let me know your thoughts.

580
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:36.580
P8: Let's see my name, my mailing address.

581
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.949
P8: and I can change it if I need to.

582
00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:42.259
P8: We've got my phone number, my email.

583
00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:57.270
P8: Let's see, Signer information again. That's just doing something weird in my brain, because we also have sponsor

584
00:53:58.452 --> 00:54:00.459
P8: which is again me.

585
00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.319
P8: And then

586
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:08.769
P8: The applicant which would be the husband and child.

587
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:13.669
P8: So I don't know the point of the signer information.

588
00:54:14.474 --> 00:54:17.195
P8: Unless that's something that's like

589
00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:26.420
P8: They might have a guardian or something like that. So someone other than the sponsor or applicant dependent, maybe.

590
00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:26.760
Renata: Got it.

591
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.390
P8: Mm.

592
00:54:29.826 --> 00:54:32.410
P8: So then, medicare information

593
00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.139
P8: and the health insurance

594
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:45.029
P8: Federal law penalties, statement of truth.

595
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:51.229
P8: And I can review the privacy policy, and then my full name.

596
00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:58.010
P8: I certify. It is correct.

597
00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.600
P8: You want me to go ahead and click, submit?

598
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.040
Renata: Oh, we're not going to click, submit

599
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.181
P8: Okay, okay, that's it then.

600
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:14.560
P8: alright, so a few more questions for you say, you accidentally input some information wrong, like a family member's name. How would you fix that?

601
00:55:16.173 --> 00:55:23.179
P8: Well, it's letting me review it right here, so I would go to their name, and then just click edit.

602
00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:29.340
P8: although that's the plan information. But here, where it has their names and edit.

603
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:38.899
Renata: Alright. You don't need to click on it at this point, just asking about that. If you did submit the form today, what would you expect to happen next?

604
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:40.750
P8: Mm.

605
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:47.050
P8: Well, there's 3 emails on there. So there should be an acknowledgement message.

606
00:55:47.852 --> 00:55:50.570
P8: That benefits have been applied for.

607
00:55:53.240 --> 00:56:02.780
P8: I know it's hard to put a timeframe on when you should hear back on something. But maybe the information again, because now I'm going to close this.

608
00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:07.610
P8: so I'm not going to have this part down here anymore.

609
00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:13.750
P8: So maybe a confirmation email would include this information

610
00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:17.039
P8: on who to contact if we have more questions

611
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.359
P8: and maybe an application number on that. Also.

612
00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:31.170
Renata: Okay. If you were applying for the CHAMPVA benefits, would you want to have be able to download or save a copy of the application for your records, or just the email?

613
00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:31.610
P8: Yes.

614
00:56:31.947 --> 00:56:41.409
Renata: And you mentioned, there's 3 emails on this application. Are you expecting that submission confirmation email to go to one of those email addresses, or all 3 of them?

615
00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.330
P8: I would think the sponsor

616
00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:49.280
P8: it should go to the sponsor, so they know someone's applying for benefits under them.

617
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:51.910
Renata: Got it. Okay.

618
00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:53.939
P8: Might not like [DEPENDENT] anymore.

619
00:56:55.404 --> 00:56:56.774
Renata: You know,

620
00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:06.699
Renata: and how soon would you be expect to be notified of action or decisions taken on your application for CHAMPVA benefits?

621
00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:11.220
P8: I would think at least 30 days seems reasonable.

622
00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:17.809
Renata: Okay, and would you expect to receive any notifications of like

623
00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:23.229
Renata: progress being made on your application before that 30 day mark, when you when you hear a decision?

624
00:57:25.802 --> 00:57:30.457
P8: You know. Yeah, that would be nice. At the 30 day mark, maybe.

625
00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:35.140
P8: hey we're still working on your application.

626
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:39.599
P8: and that kind of thing, so you know you didn't fall off the grid for them.

627
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:55.620
Renata: Got it. I've got one more question for you before we can close out this portion of the session. That's that 1 to 5 scale again. So, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy is it for you to review your application for champion benefits.

628
00:57:57.235 --> 00:58:02.739
P8: This review screen, or you mean like logging in again and reviewing it.

629
00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:05.060
Renata: Just the screen that we're reviewing.

630
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.279
P8: Very easy.

631
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:07.070
Renata: Okay.

632
00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:08.119
P8: Very easy. Oh, one.

633
00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:20.010
Renata: Okay, got it. So we are not gonna submit. Like I said, we're done with the screen sharing portion. You can click, stop screen sharing, and then we'll wrap up with it. Just a couple of more questions.

634
00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:32.519
P8: I can't get back on your screen.

635
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.589
P8: There we go.

636
00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:40.899
Renata: Perfect, no.

637
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.520
P8: It says I'm still sharing.

638
00:58:43.322 --> 00:58:47.050
Renata: There should be like a checkbox that says, Stop share.

639
00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:48.400
P8: Oh!

640
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:48.920
Renata: Up at the top.

641
00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:49.490
P8: Okay.

642
00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:52.380
Renata: There we go!

643
00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.505
P8: Okay. I think it's gone now.

644
00:58:54.860 --> 00:59:04.499
Renata: Alright. I have just a few more questions as we wrap up so overall. Was there anything you saw in the session today that worked well for you?

645
00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:12.869
P8: This whole like initial process that that is great, compared to the paper.

646
00:59:13.524 --> 00:59:17.480
P8: Sticking it in the mail and hoping it gets on the right desk.

647
00:59:18.805 --> 00:59:22.780
P8: You know, you don't even know if it was received.

648
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:29.390
P8: So just having the confirmation email and everything right away, I thought, that's very helpful.

649
00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:40.690
Renata: Got it. I did also. Wanna add, that's another one of my questions for you. How would you compare the form that you just completed to your experience, filling it out and submitting by mail?

650
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:54.090
P8: Very easy, very easy. Yes, I know this is a work in progress and everything. But I did not see like I said, we got to submit

651
00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:57.190
P8: back 2 years

652
00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:08.209
P8: During the application process for my husband. I didn't see anywhere to submit any kind of doctor claims or anything like that.

653
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:10.380
Renata: Okay.

654
01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.380
P8: So maybe there's gonna be a link later or something to

655
01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:23.638
P8: provide that and then go to that form and submit the stack of paperwork.

656
01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:34.249
Renata: It. Would that be like an ideal world for you that you submit this? And then you get some notification like, Hey, we're ready for your your stack of 2 years of paperwork?

657
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:38.440
P8: Yeah. Do you have any currentc laims to provide? Yes.

658
01:00:39.056 --> 01:00:41.290
P8: And you know, if

659
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:51.079
P8: he wasn't in the system as much as he is, and everything gets taken care of right away. I know a lot of people have to put in a claim later.

660
01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:57.990
P8: So being able to do that, too. I don't know if you have to do the whole application

661
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.869
P8: process to submit that to get paid back reimbursed

662
01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:06.100
P8: or not, and I don't know where that is in your study.

663
01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.760
P8: but something to think about, too.

664
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.820
Renata: Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you.

665
01:01:12.595 --> 01:01:18.709
Renata: Is there anything that you saw in this session today that was unclear or did not work well for you?

666
01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:24.584
P8: That signer thing at the beginning. The signer information.

667
01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:31.739
P8: I don't know who that was supposed to be, because it also asked for sponsor and applicant.

668
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.080
P8: So that was a little confusing.

669
01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:37.390
P8: but other than that it was great.

670
01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:51.349
Renata: Okay? So now that you've finished filling this out online, what research would you recommend a veteran or or family member take before, like preparing to apply for and complete a form like this.

671
01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:54.903
P8: I think there's a CHAMPVA

672
01:01:55.530 --> 01:02:01.689
P8: like I had that veterans guide I used as an attachment. I think there's a CHAMPVA users guide.

673
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:08.110
P8: so that would be helpful. Even on that initial screen where it says, "See if you qualify"

674
01:02:08.705 --> 01:02:14.700
P8: having a link for it somewhere, there would be good, too, so that they could do all their research right there.

675
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:15.850
Renata: Okay.

676
01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:23.989
Renata: got it. And what were your thoughts about the amount of information provided in this form? Not enough, just right, too much?

677
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:25.609
P8: Just right.

678
01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:26.850
Renata: Okay.

679
01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:27.510
P8: Just right.

680
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.600
Renata: Any questions for me?

681
01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:31.750
P8: No.

682
01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:32.500
Renata: Okay.

683
01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:38.179
P8: I'm looking forward to this. I know everyone, really. It's frustrating to submit all those documents by mail.

684
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:40.689
P8: So this will be really great.

685
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:48.900
Renata: Yeah. Well, I wanna circle back and confirm if you're comfortable. If we share a video clip of our session with our our VA partners?

686
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:49.970
P8: Yes.

687
01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:54.640
Renata: And is there any section of the discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?

688
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:56.830
P8: No all good.

689
01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:08.100
Renata: Okay, well, P8, I really appreciate you taking the time out of the your day? Oh, wait! I think I might have a question from one of my coworkers.

690
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.610
Renata: Andrea, do you wanna.

691
01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:16.320
Andrea: Okay.

692
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.629
Renata: Ask your question yourself.

693
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:28.629
Andrea: Yeah, absolutely. I was just curious. So during this during this session, you also filled out the information for the OHI

694
01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:29.600
P8: Yes.

695
01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.179
Andrea: During that, was that clear to you like you knew as you were filling it out like, oh, yes, I'm filling out both forms at the same time?

696
01:03:36.308 --> 01:03:57.290
P8: Yes, I knew that I was in including that information, too. It was just the my question, I think. Was it because it didn't ask me for the policy number, but the card is attached, so they'll be able to read that and get the number and any other information they need for it. So she did. Renada went back and explained that to me very well.

697
01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.810
Andrea: Perfect. Okay, that's my only question.

698
01:04:00.693 --> 01:04:01.480
P8: Thank you.

699
01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:16.900
Renata: Thank you, Andrea. I P8 genuinely appreciate you taking time out of your day today and out of your week to talk with us and share your thoughts. Your feedback is super important as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans. So thank you.

700
01:04:17.178 --> 01:04:33.039
Renata: Perigian is going to be sending you a little. Thank you. Note, and it's gonna have a blurb in it. You can pass along to other veterans, you may know, and they can sign up and provide the chance to participate in future research studies like this one. But with that, thank you so much. Enjoy your.

701
01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:33.490
P8: Yeah.

702
01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:35.770
Renata: Good luck with cleaning out your garage this week.

703
01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:37.210
P8: Right.

704
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:44.699
P8: And you know, if you guys do have additional like, Andrea came back with another question, if I need to clarify something, just let me know.

705
01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.609
Renata: Okay, really appreciate it, P8. Thank you so much.

706
01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:49.570
P8: Sure. Thank you. Have a good day.

707
01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:50.080
Renata: Okay.

708
01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:50.800
P8: Bye-bye.
