2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.580
Renata: Alright. So I've started the recording I just like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.290
P4: Yes.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:20.139
Renata: And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.870
P4: Yes.

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:30.639
Renata: Alright. So with that all out of the way, I have a few warm up questions for you to get started. So have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before.

7
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.520
P4: No.

8
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.969
Renata: All right. Any reason why not?

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.683
P4: I didn't know about it.

10
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.050
Renata: Oh, okay, is this the 1st you're hearing about it?

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.290
P4: Yes.

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.730
Renata: Okay, would you like a little bit of context around the program before we get going any further?

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.919
P4: Now, I kinda after I saw the what you guys

14
00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:01.709
P4: what it was about, I went online and started looking it up because, I actually, I'm gonna apply for it eventually, because my son's gonna need it.

15
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.379
Renata: Oh, okay, so did you go on va.gov to learn about it when you started looking for it?

16
00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:10.889
P4: After I saw your guys's thing.

17
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.150
P4: Yes, I did.

18
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.149
Renata: Okay, did you look anywhere other than va.gov to find any information about it?

19
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.030
P4: No.

20
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.347
Renata: Okay, all right. So you said that you'd you'd like to apply for the CHAMPVA program in the future?

21
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.829
Renata: let me just scrolling through my list of questions. Do you have a va.gov account?

22
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.580
P4: Yes.

23
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.929
Renata: And what is your experience with logging into the site?

24
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.119
P4: It's fine. It's easy to do.

25
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.740
Renata: Okay. And how often are you logging into va.gov?

26
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.229
P4: Maybe every 4 months. 6. Well, let's just be on every 6 months unless there's something

27
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.910
P4: I'm gonna be doing on it. And I need to check it, then it'll be more often.

28
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.219
Renata: Got it. And what sorts of things are you typically logging in every 6 months to do?

29
00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:11.780
P4: It would be like for a a doctor's appointment, just seeing if it's on there and then.

30
00:02:12.474 --> 00:02:16.835
P4: Well, when they make me change my password.

31
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.940
Renata: Oh, yeah, yeah, I get that.

32
00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:39.224
Renata: Okay, those were all my warm up questions for you. So we're gonna switch to a task where I'm gonna have you looking at our demo tool. Before we do that, though, are you comfortable with sharing your screen in zoom? Okay? So I'm gonna drop a link into the chat.

33
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.210
Renata: If you want to like.

34
00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:50.070
Renata: Pause any notifications or anything since we'll be having you share your screen, go ahead and do that now and then. Once you've got

35
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.670
P4: yeah, sorry.

36
00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:01.429
Renata: Everything ready. Okay, you're a pro at this love that alright. So I've got the link in the chat, and just share your screen when you're ready.

37
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.480
P4: Okay.

38
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.980
P4: where is it at?

39
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.940
P4: Right there

40
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.220
P4: did it work, did it? Oh, shoot! Did it work or no?

41
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.009
Renata: I can't see anything quite yet. No.

42
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.800
P4: Bluetooth.

43
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.340
P4: Oh, shoot!

44
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.238
P4: It gave me some error message.

45
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.270
P4: is, it is share right? Share, screen.

46
00:03:50.450 --> 00:04:01.769
Renata: Yeah, there should be into the mobile app. There should be a little icon. It's green with an up arrow, and that's the share option, and then it should prompt you and ask what you want to share.

47
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.159
P4: It doesn't wanna.

48
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.220
P4: No, I don't want to do it. Let me.

49
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.730
P4: green

50
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.939
P4: you said a little green arrow.

51
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.249
Renata: Yeah, it's a little green icon with an up arrow in the middle of it, and it it says, share underneath.

52
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.499
P4: Yeah, I see the share.

53
00:04:31.924 --> 00:04:41.340
Renata: And when you click it it should pop up, and it should ask you what you want to share. And if you're on a phone, you should select share, screen.

54
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.520
P4: Everything on your screen, including notifications.

55
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.320
P4: And is it start broadcast or screen broadcast.

56
00:04:48.843 --> 00:04:52.390
Renata: I think it should be dart

57
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.612
Renata: broadcast. Let's try that 1st

58
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.569
P4: Says, not available when airplay restrictions or screen mirroring is active.

59
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:10.379
Renata: Hmm, okay. Can you try the other one? If that doesn't work, I will share my screen and we'll go through it that way.

60
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.380
P4: You may have to share yours.

61
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.140
P4: I don't know why mine's doing that. That's weird.

62
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.210
P4: Yeah.

63
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.140
P4: Smell.

64
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.679
Renata: It's not working. Okay.

65
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.749
Renata: Alright. So let me.

66
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.610
Renata: I have a million tabs open. So hold on. Just one moment.

67
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.119
P4: That's fine. I'm gonna go over here and see. Maybe if this will.

68
00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:44.900
Renata: Actually, do you want to see if turning on airplay changes it at all, or turning off airplay?

69
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.069
P4: Yeah, let me do that.

70
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.600
Renata: Let's try that, and then try sharing screen again.

71
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.910
P4: Oh, good Lord! I have a bunch of crap on there!

72
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.990
P4: Oh, where'd she go? There she is!

73
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.160
P4: Let me try this. I did something else.

74
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.769
P4: Oh, let me turn off

75
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.220
P4: airplane settings

76
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.330
P4: where? Oh, there it is!

77
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.250
Renata: Think you froze on our end, you still there.

78
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.140
P4: It didn't work. I tried.

79
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:46.560
Renata: Okay. Alright. That's no problem we'll switch. I'll be sharing my screen. We'll give that a shot.

80
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.570
P4: Okay.

81
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.609
Renata: I'm just closing a bunch of tabs.

82
00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.870
P4: I'll keep trying while you do the tabs. Maybe I'll just do it. You never know

83
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.060
P4: share camera. Now, I want to share the screen.

84
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.049
Renata: Can you see my screen.

85
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.369
P4: Yeah, hold on.

86
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.969
P4: Yes, I can pinch up for bigger view. Wow.

87
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.799
P4: okay, I can see your screen.

88
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.359
Renata: Okay, perfect. I am just

89
00:08:22.591 --> 00:08:25.300
Renata: moving my other tabs around.

90
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:25.919
Renata: There we go.

91
00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:27.939
Renata: You can see it better?

92
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.425
P4: Yeah.

93
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:36.100
Renata: Okay, alright perfect. So just a few things to know before we jump into this

94
00:08:36.489 --> 00:08:59.919
Renata: like, I said before, this is our demo tool on a testing site. This is not live on va.gov at the moment. So you don't have to worry about any information that we enter here, going anywhere and nothing we click on in this form is, gonna have any bearing on your benefits. As we go through this form today, we're we can use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers. If you're not comfortable.

95
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:23.339
Renata: you may be asked to upload some documents as part of this flow as we're not submitting this form in real life, and it's not attached to your benefits. Nothing you upload here is going to be sent to Va. And I'll be since I'm going to be in the driver's seat with the form. I'm going to be uploading some sample documents when we get to that stage. But do you have any questions for me? But before we dive in.

96
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.220
P4: No.

97
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.970
Renata: Okay.

98
00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:37.109
Renata: So without clicking anything, I'd like you to take a look at this page and tell us your initial thoughts, and I can scroll up and down, just you can just tell me when you're ready to move, and I'll move things.

99
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.189
P4: Yeah, you can scroll down.

100
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.010
Renata: Okay.

101
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.719
P4: You keep on going.

102
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.830
P4: Keep on going.

103
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:55.994
P4: Okay.

104
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.409
P4: You go back up.

105
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.660
Renata: Alright. Any initial thoughts, questions, impressions?

106
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.020
P4: So is this is this on the VA website, or it's not on the VA?

107
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:21.699
Renata: This is not that little badge you see up in the corner that bright green thing is letting you know that this is not the the real website. This is a a demo tool that we use for tests like this.

108
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:28.035
P4: Well, it seems fairly easy. It says, only takes 15 min to apply.

109
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:33.429
Renata: Okay, anything else standing out to you, just looking at it for the 1st time?

110
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:41.220
P4: To see if you're eligible, and to start that with, no, it's it's pretty straightforward.

111
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:49.909
Renata: Okay, so a couple questions for you before we start filling out this application. How do you know if you're on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

112
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.460
P4: Hmm!

113
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.300
P4: Great question.

114
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.069
P4: How do I know what clearly says that? But how to get there?

115
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.319
P4: I think I go to

116
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.918
P4: myVA, and then from there I'll

117
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.340
Renata: Start here.

118
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:24.150
P4: Yeah, myVa, and then from there. Oh, I didn't even know it, said, myVa, yeah, myVa, and then from there I think I can select, like what is available, like the benefits.

119
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.280
Renata: Okay.

120
00:11:26.386 --> 00:11:32.929
Renata: What does 1010 d. Extended mean to you? This this link right here.

121
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.410
P4: Absolutely nothing. I have no clue.

122
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:50.299
Renata: That is fair. Thank you. If you were on va.gov. Filling out this form for yourself and a spouse or dependent child, what research would you do before applying and completing the CHAMPVA application?

123
00:11:51.298 --> 00:11:57.200
P4: Making sure my child is qualified to

124
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.970
P4: get the CHAMPVA benefits before I even start.

125
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:07.839
Renata: Okay and anything in particular that you would be looking for for checking that eligibility?

126
00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:14.269
P4: Well, I know they have to. Well, because he's over the age of 21. He has to be in school

127
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.220
P4: and ask.

128
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:15.680
Renata: Okay.

129
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.839
P4: The right school.

130
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.850
Renata: Okay,

131
00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.560
Renata: So do you know how to check your eligibility from this page, for CHAMPVA benefits?

132
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.730
P4: Oh no!

133
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.160
Renata: Okay.

134
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:37.000
Renata: And what information do you think you will need to fill out this application for yourself and a spouse or dependent child?

135
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:46.900
P4: Pretty much all pretty much all of my information, as far as my name, where I live, my social security number

136
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:53.980
P4: the same with them, and if they're dependent upon of mine.

137
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.440
Renata: Okay.

138
00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:04.940
P4: Of course, the school stuff showing that he's actually in a qualified school through the VA accepts.

139
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:11.960
Renata: Okay, anything else that you think you're gonna need before you fill out this application?

140
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.200
P4: No, I think that's it. I think I just need to make sure I have that letter from the school.

141
00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:31.610
Renata: Okay, and talking about all of that stuff, your information, your son's information, the school stuff. Would you have all of that on hand if we were filling this out, live on via.gov, or would you need to pause at this point and go collect it?

142
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:43.500
P4: I would have to pause and go collect it. I mean, I can. I can pretty much start filling it out. I have a good idea as far as the school.

143
00:13:43.909 --> 00:13:48.830
P4: And of course the social. I don't have memorized anymore. Kind of sort of I do. But.

144
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.880
Renata: Okay.

145
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.690
P4: But that paperwork to put his social in.

146
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.685
Renata: Okay.

147
00:13:56.474 --> 00:14:02.320
Renata: and how long do you imagine it would take you to sort of collect all of this material in order to get started?

148
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.280
P4: About 10 min, because I know where to look.

149
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:16.569
P4: I would say about 15. Because if I'm gonna do this, I know that I have to go get my stuff ahead of time, and then I would put it in, so I would say, about

150
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.540
P4: 15 min.

151
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.730
Renata: Okay.

152
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:39.240
Renata: got it. So one more question before we jump into actually filling this application out on a scale of one to 5 with one being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the CHAMPVA application, based on the information on this page?

153
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:50.709
P4: Oh, unless there's somewhere else that explains what

154
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.020
P4: CHAMPVA is.

155
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.969
P4: Oh, it says right there, find out if you're eligible for CHAMPVA benefits. Okay,

156
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.660
P4: I would say I would give it like a an 8.

157
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.139
P4: So what was the question? Again.

158
00:15:18.463 --> 00:15:28.500
Renata: That's fine on a scale of 1 to 5, with one being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the champion. You're about to begin based on the

159
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:28.920
P4: Sorry.

160
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.320
Renata: Information on this page.

161
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.100
P4: A 5.

162
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:32.399
Renata: A 5. Okay

163
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:37.570
Renata: And anything specifically, that makes it a 5 here that you wanna?

164
00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:44.639
P4: Where it says, gather your information. Here's what you'll need to need to apply.

165
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.690
Renata: Okay.

166
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.229
P4: You know, like the supporting documents?

167
00:15:48.928 --> 00:15:51.631
P4: Proof of school. Yeah. Proof of school enrollment?

168
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.440
P4: Yeah.

169
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.539
P4: So I think that's why? Because they actually tell you what you're gonna need.

170
00:15:59.114 --> 00:16:06.229
P4: So you're not clueless as to as you're as you're starting to put in the information you already know, you're supposed to have this too

171
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.669
P4: put in to apply for the Va. Or the CHAMPVA

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.230
Renata: Okay.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.650
P4: Benefit. There you go!

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:19.280
P4: Okay.

176
00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:36.449
Renata: So with me doing everything that you tell me to do. From this point on, we're gonna start filling out this form as though you're applying for a spouse and one other family member like a child who's your dependent.

177
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:46.110
Renata: I'll let you know when to pause when we're going to ask some questions, but to help Orient you, we're going to be filling out the 1st 3 sections of the form before we pause.

178
00:16:46.478 --> 00:17:14.700
Renata: So just a reminder. This is our testing site. None of the information we're putting in goes anywhere we can use fake information for your spouse and dependent child. I'm going to have you like, dictate what you'd like me to put into the various fields of the form, but also think out loud. So if you have any questions or reactions as we're looking at stuff on each page, just let me know. And I can. Also, you know, we can stop at any time.

179
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.030
P4: Okay.

180
00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:18.740

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.159
P4: Yay, and then you try.

319
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.040
Renata: Would you like me to open the the dropdown select press? Select.

320
00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.370
P4: It would be the top one selected location.

321
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.890
P4: and then, unless you have another file which we don't.

322
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:15.980
Renata: Okay.

323
00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:16.275
P4: Yeah.

324
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:27.029
P4: and then go down and then select. Continue.

325
00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.880
P4: No, I don't have anybody else to add.

326
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:39.366
Renata: Okay, I'm gonna stop right here and ask you a couple of questions about what we've just gone through in the form

327
00:28:40.279 --> 00:28:51.049
Renata: so on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this section of the application?

328
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.070
P4: 5.

329
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.869
Renata: And why would you give it a 5?

330
00:28:54.870 --> 00:29:00.419
P4: That was easy, because it was plug and play as long as you can read and

331
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:07.779
P4: take your time. It. It allows you to do what you need to do? Very. It's wow. That's simple.

332
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.290
Renata: OK.

333
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:14.820
Renata: So, no surprises, nothing, nothing jumped out to you as being difficult or confusing?

334
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.550
P4: No.

335
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:16.810
Renata: Okay.

336
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.750
Renata: And then, so I'm gonna click the continue button.

337
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:30.580
Renata: We're gonna pause here, just take a look at this page and what it's asking you for. And then I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions before we keep going.

338
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.310
P4: Do you have any Medicare?

340
00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:47.879
P4: Well, it's asking if if any of us, if

341
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.670
P4: either one of them have medicare which they don't.

342
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.440
P4: because isn't medicare for people who are older?

343
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:05.080
Renata: I'm gonna do that annoying thing again, where I answer your question with a question, is that your understanding of how Medicare works and eligibility? Okay.

344
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:14.292
P4: That's how I understand it. Okay, if that said, do you have other health insurance? And then I would have been like, Oh, yeah,

345
00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.790
P4: he gets health insurance through his work.

346
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.490
P4: My, you know the spouse.

347
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:21.495
Renata: Okay.

348
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:27.390
P4: But it's saying, if you have Medicare, you don't have Medicare, so that.

349
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:28.200
Renata: Understood.

350
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.300
P4: That would be a no.

351
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:48.169
Renata: Okay. So as you understand it, this section of the form is asking you about Medicare specifically and and nothing else? Okay, thinking back to the information that you saw on that 1st page before we started filling out this application. Do you know why the form is asking you about Medicare?

352
00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:54.100
P4: Yes, because if you say if your spouse is older

353
00:30:56.110 --> 00:31:00.899
P4: I know when you get medicare, but if you're like way older.

354
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.550
P4: you may have medicare, so they probably want to.

355
00:31:05.486 --> 00:31:10.630
P4: Make sure, I guess, for billing purposes.

356
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:22.610
P4: The big to get paid. I don't know. That's the only thing I could think of like

357
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.750
P4: supplemental insurance. Maybe.

358
00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:38.639
Renata: Got it. If you were filling this form out today, would you have to pause at this point and collect any more documents about Medicare or anything? It sounds like. The answer is, No, but...?

359
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.550
P4: No for me.

360
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:41.340
P4: Okay.

361
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:55.299
P4: and maybe somebody who's older and has Medicare and has a Medicare card. They would say yes, and then maybe have to upload the card or something. So then the VA knows that they have that, and they'll get CHAMPVA.

362
00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:01.389
P4: if they're able to, and then it'll help offset the medical bill.

363
00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:02.305
Renata: Okay.

364
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:24.620
Renata: thank you for sharing. So for this next section of the form, I am going to ask you to imagine that your spouse and dependent child. Both have medicare as well as private health insurance. So we're going to fill this section out adding plans for Medicare and health insurance for both of them any questions for me before I hit that. Yes, button, and we we get rolling.

365
00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.669
P4: No, it's still.

366
00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:26.700
Renata: All right.

367
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.820
P4: [NAME], can I put the top one.

368
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:35.740
Renata: Okay.

369
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:36.950
P4: Yeah.

370
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.220
P4: Well, I guess we'll do parts A and B.

371
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.980
Renata: Okay, there's no right or wrong answers here. If if you don't know it, we're, you know, we could just use fake information for this.

372
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:56.610
P4: Continue, we're gonna put fake information. I have no clue.

373
00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.539
P4: We'll put [DATE]

374
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.207
P4: What? What date can we start it?

375
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.770
P4: Let's see if that works.

376
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.880
Renata: Okay.

377
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:20.250
P4: Probably kick us out same thing there [DATE].

378
00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.150
Renata: Okay.

379
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:24.690
P4: Hi, let's write about the card.

380
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:31.229
Renata: Anything here that's confusing or.

381
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.570
P4: Yeah.

382
00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:32.210
Renata: Out to you.

383
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:38.499
P4: Now that's good for somebody who does have Medicare. At least they'll know that they need to upload the front and the back.

384
00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:45.090
Renata: Got it. Okay. So I'm gonna use those sample.

385
00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:48.470
Renata: Examples that I have to upload here.

386
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.840
P4: Okay.

387
00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:52.890
Renata: And click continue.

388
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:59.659
P4: Continue. Oh, wait! You didn't do the back. Oh, wait! Did you get both of them? Oh, yeah, the front and back? Okay, continue.

389
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.200
Renata: Okay.

390
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:13.459
P4: Sure he does. We'll put yes, and continue. Oh, man!

391
00:34:14.315 --> 00:34:20.090
P4: Name of insurance carrier, I don't know is Kaiser. One of them. We'll put Kaiser.

392
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:20.650
Renata: Sure.

393
00:34:21.833 --> 00:34:22.780
P4: Same date.

394
00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:27.460
P4: Yes. Keep on going.

395
00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:28.620
Renata: Okay.

396
00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:33.428
P4: And then upload the file.

397
00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:35.380
Renata: All right.

398
00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.750
P4: And then hit continue.

399
00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.260
P4: Oh, wait, wait, oops! My bad!

400
00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:51.790
P4: Do you have another plan to report from one or more applicants? You said yes, right?

401
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.250
Renata: All right.

402
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.820
P4: And that would be for [NAME].

403
00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.260
P4: Oh, but he does. No.

404
00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:08.140
P4: I thought we were. Gonna do private for him. So we'll do click to cancel that.

405
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.729
P4: Yes, okay, no.

406
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.530
P4: Okay.

407
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.440
P4: And do you have a notice of disallowance, denial, or other proof?

408
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.019
P4: No or yeah. No.

409
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.990
P4: Continue.

410
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.879
Renata: Any questions or anything unusual about this page?

411
00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:52.160
P4: No.

412
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:53.330
Renata: Okay.

413
00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:55.560
P4: Continue okay.

414
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.780
P4: And then it would be, yes.

415
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.250
Renata: Okay.

416
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.600
P4: Oh.

417
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.721
P4: I guess it would be a

418
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.400
P4: An HMO

419
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:24.750
Renata: Okay.

420
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:33.950
P4: Oh, jeez I guess. Put [Insurance carrier].

421
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.720
Renata: All right.

422
00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.570
P4: And then [Date]

423
00:36:41.740 --> 00:37:00.660
P4: I guess. [Termination date].

424
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:08.929
Renata: Okay? And what does the insurance termination date mean to you? What is this asking for?

425
00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.714
P4: Oh, when it ends pretty much when it

426
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:18.242
P4: what's usually September, isn't it? I was thinking a whole year, though.

427
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.969
P4: When you can reapply for your insurance. It's usually.

428
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:32.710
P4: you know, the cancellation time when they re renew your insurance policy.

429
00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:40.630
Renata: Okay, got it. So this could be like a future date is what you're saying, or would this only be for, like

430
00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.690
Renata: a past plan?

431
00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.830
P4: Now this oh, shoot! I put the wrong year.

432
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:56.510
P4: I was thinking from it would have been 2,025.

433
00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:00.569
Renata: Oh, for this, for the start date, or for the termination date?

434
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.450
P4: The termination date.

435
00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:05.470
Renata: Okay.

436
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:15.410
P4: Wait insurance to only enter this date if the policy is inactive. Oh, so you don't have to put a date there.

437
00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:21.679
Renata: Okay, what would you like to do? What would you like me to do here, delete it? Okay.

438
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.210
Renata: it's gonna show a bug. This is a bug. We're just gonna.

439
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.359
P4: Okay.

440
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.912
Renata: It's not asking that.

441
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:40.580
P4: And then can is insurance through the applicant's employer? Yes.

442
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.490
Renata: Okay.

443
00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.770
P4: Well, wait a minute. He's in school, so no.

444
00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.739
P4: no additional comments.

445
00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.430
Renata: Okay.

446
00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.859
Renata: If you want me to put that in there, just skip?

447
00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.510
P4: Yeah. Yeah.

448
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.730
P4: [NAME].

449
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.210
P4: continue.

450
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:10.900
Renata: [Name] as well or just [Name]?.

451
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:11.980
P4: Both of them.

452
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:12.870
Renata: Okay.

453
00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:19.330
P4: And continue, and then we would have to upload the card.

454
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:24.899
Renata: Okay. And I think you mentioned at the beginning that you'd need to go grab that if this was a.

455
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.020
P4: Right.

456
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.550
Renata: If you're doing this in real life. At this point.

457
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.150
P4: Oh!

458
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:36.349
Renata: Would you just be pulling that out of like a a wallet or somewhere like? Is that? Is that something you'd just be able to grab pretty easily.

459
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.640
P4: I'll be pulling it out of a wallet and just taking a photo of it.

460
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:40.530
Renata: Okay.

461
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:43.369
P4: And then uploading it from my phone to

462
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:47.649
P4: The application.

463
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:48.970
Renata: Got it.

464
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.030
P4: Hit continue. If it says, Yeah.

465
00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:59.249
P4: do you have any other health insurance to report?

466
00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:04.480
P4: No, unless you tell me I need to. So.

467
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:10.299
Renata: But nothing, nothing here that's standing out, or anything that you wanna double check.

468
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.050
P4: No.

469
00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.050
Renata: Alright.

470
00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:13.470
Renata: Okay.

471
00:40:13.757 --> 00:40:27.549
Renata: So a couple more questions for you. I'm going to just pause on the screen for a moment. That 1 to 5 scale question again. So one is very hard, and 5 is very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this section of the form?

472
00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:30.340
P4: 5. It was easy.

473
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.249
Renata: Okay, and any reason in particular why you gave it a a very easy?

474
00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.570
P4: Self-explanatory.

475
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.000
Renata: Okay.

476
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.420
P4: Good examples of what you needed to upload, and how it's supposed to look.

477
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.526
Renata: Got it.

478
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:52.820
Renata: All right. I am going to click. No, on other health insurance to report.

479
00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:53.275
P4: Okay.

480
00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.430
Renata: We're going to go to the next page.

481
00:40:56.292 --> 00:41:05.929
Renata: So on this page, we're not going to be clicking. Submit on this CHAMPVA application. But I'd like you to review the application that you just filled out.

482
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:06.650
P4: Okay.

483
00:41:06.872 --> 00:41:12.649
Renata: Again, remembering to think out loud. And you can go ahead and tell me what you'd like me to do as we're interacting on this page.

484
00:41:13.652 --> 00:41:15.630
P4: Go ahead and hit the expand all.

485
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.500
Renata: Okay.

486
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:21.860
P4: Because this way I can just look at it and then scroll down.

487
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.100
P4: Oh, go back up, go back up real quick.

488
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.619
P4: and keep on going up.

489
00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:32.799
P4: Okay, go down.

490
00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.429
P4: Keep on going down

491
00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.089
P4: all right. Hmm.

492
00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.270
P4: and keep on going down

493
00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.330
P4: and keep on going

494
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.760
P4: and keep on going.

495
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.030
P4: Okay, that's fine.

496
00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:15.669
Renata: Alright! Any impression. 1st impressions. Just taking a look at this?

497
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.159
P4: I've it's easy to read

498
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:23.660
Renata: Okay.

499
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.230
P4: It's it's doable.

500
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:39.940
Renata: Alright. So let's say you accidentally input some information wrong like that. I don't know. You, your spouse's name was spelled incorrectly. There's a typo how would you go about fixing that?

501
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.959
P4: I would scroll down and then go to edit.

502
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:46.320
Renata: Scroll down and go to Edit, where.

503
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:50.649
P4: Oh, well, either, go back up.

504
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.990
P4: Where's their name?

505
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:55.939
P4: Keep on going.

506
00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.879
P4: Oh, I guess it's down below.

507
00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:07.329
P4: Okay, so right here, review your applicants and then hit edit.

508
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.450
Renata: You'd hit edit right here. Yeah.

509
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:29.180
Renata: we're not gonna click on that at this point. But just wanted to know. You know, if if that was something that you could see there. So if, without submitting the form today, if you clicked, submit, if you, if you signed it and clicked. Submit there at the bottom of the the page. What would you expect to happen next?

510
00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:34.979
P4: You probably send me like 5,000 emails that they that they received it.

511
00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:48.168
P4: And then I believe, I well, I believe I should receive an email from them, saying they received the form, and how long it's gonna take for it to be

512
00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:51.760
P4: processed.

513
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:54.230
Renata: Okay.

514
00:43:54.768 --> 00:44:01.249
Renata: and that leads into my next question, how soon would you expect to be notified about a decision on your application?

515
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.520
P4: Probably like 3 weeks.

516
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:11.443
Renata: 3 weeks. Okay, is that is that your expectation about it? Or is that like ideal world?

517
00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:18.009
P4: Oh, I was just thinking like ideal!

518
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:19.850
Renata: Okay.

519
00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:26.765
P4: They'll get it to me faster. But you know I'm not the only person there's a lot of people on this earth.

520
00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:38.550
Renata: Yeah, so I anything else that you want to give feedback on before I stop sharing, because we're we're done with this portion of the of the session?

521
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:41.749
P4: No, it seems simple, easy.

522
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:45.060
Renata: I'm going to stop sharing.

523
00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:59.099
Renata: Thank you for letting me take a spin through the the the form. It's been a while since I've done that just moving my screens around again.

524
00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:00.095
P4: Okay.

525
00:45:07.412 --> 00:45:19.590
Renata: So just a few more questions before we close out. So overall. Was there anything that you saw in this session with the champion application that worked well for you?

526
00:45:22.228 --> 00:45:25.881
P4: It was self explanatory, self explanatory.

527
00:45:29.098 --> 00:45:43.249
P4: easy to navigate through. The only thing was the whole. You were asking me what those numbers. CD, one, I guess that's the form number. But maybe if it just said CHAMPVA form

528
00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:50.070
P4: I'd be like, Oh, okay. But I mean, you figure it out once you're inside of it. But

529
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:54.998
P4: if you don't know what the form number is, it's like, it'll mean nothing to you.

530
00:45:55.530 --> 00:46:14.070
Renata: Got it. Just realizing I was gonna ask you another one of those annoying number questions. But that last screen that we saw before I stopped sharing that one to 5 scale with one being really hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits?

531
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:15.379
P4: 5. It was easy.

532
00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:18.550
Renata: Okay, and anything in particular that made it a 5?

533
00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:25.859
P4: It was straightforward, and you're able to do the little edit buttons if you made a mistake.

534
00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:31.550
P4: So you just hit the edit and then fix it, save it, and then move on.

535
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:39.899
Renata: Got it. Thank you. So was there anything, unclear, or that didn't work well for you with the application that we filled out.

536
00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.110
P4: No.

537
00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:51.429
P4: now, the only part would be Medicare. As long as somebody knows that Medicare isn't the same as health, regular health insurance.

538
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.569
P4: That would be the only thing.

539
00:46:55.090 --> 00:47:08.939
Renata: Got it. So now that you've seen the whole champion, and knowing what you know now, is there any additional research that you would do before applying and completing a form like this or that. You tell other veterans to do, to prep?

540
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:12.670
P4: Oh, just to have make sure you have

541
00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:19.019
P4: like the school paperwork or your health insurance cards. So this way.

542
00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:25.709
P4: If you already have them either scanned in or take a photo of them. They're already in the system

543
00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.680
P4: on. You know your your laptop

544
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:36.060
P4: or your phone. And then this way. When you get to it the the part to upload it. You can just upload it without having to stop.

545
00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:39.810
Renata: Got it. Thank you.

546
00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:47.359
Renata: What are your thoughts about the amount of information and like explanations provided in this application?

547
00:47:52.077 --> 00:47:54.759
P4: It's straightforward. Easy to read

548
00:47:55.788 --> 00:47:59.471
P4: it gave me the information I needed in order to

549
00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.610
P4: apply for the CHAMPVA for my son. So

550
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.460
P4: which is a good thing, cause I didn't know about it. I'm glad you guys emailed me.

551
00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:20.460
Renata: Yeah, before we wrap up any questions for me? As as we close out the session.

552
00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:21.450
P4: No, none.

553
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:39.629
Renata: Okay, I just want to circle back again and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of our sessions and to remind you again, we remove all information to identify you before sharing, and we only share those videos internally with Va. To for the purpose of improving va.gov, and digital experiences.

554
00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:41.079
P4: Yeah, that's fine.

555
00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:45.739
Renata: Alright. And is there any part of our discussion that you would not want shared in a video clip?

556
00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.750
P4: No, it's fine. I'm good.

557
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.620
Renata: Type alright.

558
00:48:49.980 --> 00:49:01.309
Renata: Well, thank you so much. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is super duper, helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans.

559
00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:20.169
Renata: Lastly, Parigean is going to be sending you a Thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass on to other veterans, you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future studies like the one you participated in today. But with that, thank you so much again, have a great day. Have a great week, yeah, and take care.

560
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:21.350
P4: All right. Take care!

561
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.790
Renata: Okay? Bye.

562
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:23.500
P4: Bye-bye.
