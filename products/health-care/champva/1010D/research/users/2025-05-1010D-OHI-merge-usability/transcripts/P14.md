1
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:09.250
Renata: Okay, I've started the recording, and I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.110
P14: Yes, that's fine. I just okay.

3
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:22.549
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.340
P14: Yes.

5
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.600
Renata: All right. So we're going to start with a few questions before we look at anything. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program before?

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.850
P14: I haven't. I'm a dependent of a veteran. So my father had in the past.

7
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:51.120
Renata: Okay. And do you know, if you'll apply, you have any intentions of applying for CHAMPVA benefits in the future?

8
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.410
P14: I didn't know if I was entitled to anything. I thought that was more a spousal thing

9
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:14.739
P14: on there. I learned more from doing the Zoom Meetings with you guys than I do on my own. I know for a while, which I think is incorrect, they kept sending me, I forget what association it was for to get help with like either buying a home or whatever. But.

10
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.110
Renata: Hmm.

11
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.620
P14: I did a lot of research on that, as far as I know. That's for the veteran themselves and or their spouse.

12
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.850
P14: If they got it, that

13
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:37.380
P14: way that has nothing to do with the children. So a lot of times when I get things like this, I don't pay attention to them, you know, because they don't really apply to me. I thought they were more for the primary person.

14
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:52.159
Renata: Okay, got it. Just curious, so you mentioned that sometimes you get sent letters about about VA benefits. Do you go on the Internet or va.gov, or anything to look up more information to see if you qualify, or just sort of...

15
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.253
P14: You know, I did in the past. But I

16
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.340
P14: 9 months ago I [Redacted, life story]
17
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:20.310
P14: I've had no life. [Redacted, personal information]. So I'm so busy with that because I think I'm just going to

18
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:34.929
P14: go ahead because I've got the talent for it. [Redacted, personal information]. So I'm down in front of the computer from the moment I get up until I'm too tired, so I.

19
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.360
Renata: Gosh!

20
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:46.449
P14: I don't have a lot of time to look up spare things, but just as I've done in the past, when I've done these Zoom Meetings with you. It kind of spurs me to look and see what I might be entitled to.

21
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.469
Renata: Okay, fair enough. Thank you for sharing. And best of luck with [redacted].

22
00:02:52.398 --> 00:02:57.080
Renata: Do you have a va.gov account by chance?

23
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.810
P14: My father has one. I don't have one.

24
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:09.510
Renata: Okay. And are you visiting va.gov at all, either for your own benefits or to help him with his benefits?

25
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.140
P14: Oh to help him with his benefits. I

26
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:23.139
P14: like, I said. Maybe I don't know if you've done these other meetings, and you hear the same thing, but I didn't think I was really entitled to anything. I thought that was more

27
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.029
P14: him. And or if

28
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:35.369
P14: my mom and dad were still married it would be, you know, my mother. At that point I didn't think it applied. That it came down to the children I know

29
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:44.150
P14: is that there's a special auto insurance that you can get that USAA. But my understanding is

30
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.920
P14: the veteran has to pass that down to you, the benefits or something like that.

31
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.530
Renata: Interesting. Okay.

32
00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:09.199
P14: Yeah, I don't know if it's through the VA. But I think you're entitled to that. But the person has to pass them down to you, which I don't understand, either. I last year, when I was looking to change car insurance, I had checked that out a little bit, so

33
00:04:09.698 --> 00:04:16.330
P14: I learn more doing these with you. You know, more aware of maybe things that are available.

34
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.232
Renata: Got it. Yeah, I haven't heard of that auto insurance, but that's interesting to hear about. So thank you for sharing

35
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.870
P14: No.

36
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:32.779
Renata: All right. And what sorts of tasks are you helping your dad with when you're helping him out with his benefits management? Just out of curiosity?.

37
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:48.299
P14: Looking to see what he's entitled to, that he's getting everything that he needs. You know, and that everything is going to him at that point of just trying to make sure that he gets everything that he's entitled to.

38
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.572
Renata: Okay, all right.

39
00:04:50.476 --> 00:05:00.519
Renata: So we're going to switch gears now and start looking at that demo tool I told you about. Are you comfortable sharing your screen in zoom?

40
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.890
P14: Yes, yes.

41
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.220
Renata: Oh!

42
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.180
P14: You want me to share my screen now?

43
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:17.839
Renata: I'm gonna drop a link in the chat for you to open up. Go ahead and close any other tabs you have, open any notifications. Silence them, and then, when you're ready, please open the link and share your screen.

44
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.930
P14: Okay, that I did not want that to do that. I think I need to share

45
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.309
P14: Maybe I need a I think

46
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.120
P14: I can't remember. It's been a while since I've done this. I think

47
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.570
P14: I need to share my screen 1st and then pull it up. Let's try that.

48
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.329
P14: If it doesn't work. I'll try it the other way.

49
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.859
Renata: Okay. And I can help troubleshoot. If you have any issues.

50
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.400
P14: Okay.

51
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.309
P14: I did it the wrong way. Let's see. Come on.

52
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.400
P14: Oh, no, it's gonna fight me now.

53
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.900
P14: Hmm, okay. Let me stop sharing. Let me do it the other way.

54
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.030
P14: and chatting as a guest. Okay, let me pull that up.

55
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.569
P14: Let me go back and share my screen and see if it works this way.

56
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.960
Renata: Okay.

57
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.759
P14: Okay, can you see what I'm looking at now?

58
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.730
Renata: I can perfect.

59
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:24.980
P14: Okay, perfect.

60
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:52.150
Renata: All right. So just a few things to go over before you start filling out the form. So like, I said before, this is our testing site. You don't have to worry about any information that you enter in here, going anywhere, and we're also not going to submit this form and nothing you click on will have any bearing on your benefits as you go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers. If you don't feel like using real information.

61
00:06:52.330 --> 00:07:18.680
Renata: depending on how you answer questions, you may be asked to upload some documents. As we're not submitting this form, and it's not attached to your benefits. Nothing you upload here is going to get submitted to the Va. But when we get to those screens that ask for a file to upload. You can either upload like a random photo from your desktop, or I can provide you with a sample document to use. You don't have to decide yet, and when we get to those screens I'll remind you when it comes up. But any questions for me.

62
00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:25.020
P14: When it comes to like social security numbers on that. Do you want me to make something up or...?

63
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:41.949
Renata: Totally up to you. You can use a you can make something up on the spot. A lot of folks do that. We just can't use consecutive numbers. If you do. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. You've gotta. You gotta switch a couple of the numbers because our systems a little bit. The demo tools a little bit finicky. But yeah, that's about it. It's up to you.

64
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.790
P14: After.

65
00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:52.529
Renata: So without clicking on anything yet you can scroll up and down, but no clicking. I'd like you to just take a look at the information on this page, and tell us your initial thoughts and impressions.

66
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.760
P14: I think it's set up pretty.

67
00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.059
P14: you know, to be pretty easy for anyone to use. I know

68
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:25.229
P14: it's strange, because I'll end up going to Meijer. I don't know if you have Meijer food stores in your area, and there's a couple of people that work there part time that are my age, and they're like, "How are you doing [profession]? I don't like computers. I don't know anything about them." So I there's people, even my age that are afraid of things. But I think even those people going on here.

69
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:50.890
P14: This is pretty straightforward, you know, and it's kind of hard to believe in this day and age that people are still afraid of technology, because I think technology and knowledge is power. And it's making your life easier rather than having to go into the VA and apply for this in person and wait in line, and maybe have to get an appointment. You can do this all online.

70
00:08:52.130 --> 00:09:05.160
Renata: Got it. Few more questions for you. So if you scroll up a tiny bit above the heading where it says, Apply for CHAMPVA. There's a bold little link that says 1010d Extended. What

71
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.880
P14: Tab.

72
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.739
Renata: What does that mean to you? If anything.

73
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:19.379
P14: Oh, you know what I actually overlooked it, which is terrible. I'm usually not like that. I would click on it. I'm not sure if I don't know what something is.

74
00:09:20.067 --> 00:09:23.479
P14: I would click on it is. Do you want me to click on it now?

75
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:42.029
Renata: We're not going to click on it. Just curious if that label meant anything to you at this point, but it's no worries. So if you are on va.gov, filling this out for yourself today, what research would you do before completing this form and applying for CHAMPVA benefits?

76
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:50.849
P14: I would double check and make sure. I knew exactly what CHAMPVA benefits were, and if they applied to me before

77
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.520
P14: I wasted

78
00:09:52.680 --> 00:10:12.060
P14: my time, the VA's time, the Government's time to do that, just to make sure that I was...I knew exactly what I was paying for. If I was eligible, which I see they have down here, but I would probably do a little bit of homework and investigative work

79
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.429
P14: on my own before I went on the site to

80
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.680
P14: see if I was eligible, or apply, if that makes sense at all, to you.

81
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:32.120
Renata: Yeah, that makes sense. Would you do that research into eligibility on va.gov, with that link that you see there on the screen, or would you, I don't know. Do a Google search go somewhere else?

82
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.209
P14: Possibly just to I don't know. To me, the more

83
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:52.880
P14: knowledge I have about something that I'm applying for, [Redacted]

84
00:10:52.960 --> 00:11:13.380 
P14: [Redacted]

85
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:25.150
P14: [Redacted]. So the same thing with this, I want to make sure I know exactly

86
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:34.889
P14: who they're for, whether they're just for the veteran themselves, whether they're for dependents or family members or spouses, what they entail.

87
00:11:35.070 --> 00:12:03.929
P14: what paperwork they may need. So in advance I could get all the paperwork that I needed, or documents or information, and then that way, when I went to apply. It would be like 1, 2, 3, you know. I like to have everything in front of me rather than go through the form and get part way through and see. Okay, they need my father's birthday. They need his dates of service, which.

88
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:14.760
P14: with the social security number, they should be able to find it. But it's just easier if I know insurance cards, you know. If there's any kind of.

89
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:24.490
P14: let's say educational, which he doesn't need right now, anyway. But let's say he was younger any kind of educational documents, or.

90
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:45.949
P14: let's say, dependents were able to apply for educational benefits, then I would assume that they would want the school that the dependent was looking at the the study they would maybe want. What do they call it, a curriculum? So things like that. If it entails something like that.

91
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:51.489
P14: it would be. I would have all that right in front of me, so that I could just

92
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:57.309
P14: it would be smooth sailing to go through the application. Does that answer your question properly?

93
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:11.500
Renata: It does. Yeah. So you listed a few things that you that might be necessary to fill this out, and that you want to gather that ahead of time. What information do you think you're going to need to fill this application out for yourself today?

94
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:29.730
P14: Oh, I would think that it would be relevant to probably have the veterans birthday their social security number and that, and probably contact information, but they should have all of that. I would think that he'd be linked

95
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:38.090
P14: by the birthday and the social security number, but maybe not. Everything about dependence

96
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:57.500
P14: or spouse is is linked at that point. So if let's say, I was applying for another family member, and you know, because I'm a guardian, then I would have all their information all the way through, and if it was for me, then I would

97
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:24.929
P14: want to have all the documents that the Va. Required to make the application, so that if I was eligible I could get approved the 1st time around rather than it getting kicked back to me which I would think it would do here, or it would tell me. Maybe you could put this on hold. But you need to upload this document that way, I would have an idea of exactly what I needed, and have it

98
00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:33.428
P14: either loaded on my computer ready downloaded, ready to upload, or I would have it where I could

99
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:42.449
P14: do a screenshot or take a picture with my phone and then send it to my email and download it to my laptop.

100
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:57.869
Renata: Got it. Just one more question for you before we move on on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin? Based on this page's content.

101
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.600
P14: And whether I think it's going to be successful or...?

102
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:09.969
Renata: Yeah, just how informed or ready you feel, based on what you've what you see on this page.

103
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.700
P14: I'd say a 4 or 5, the the higher the better correct.

104
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.369
Renata: Yeah, a 5 would be very, very well informed.

105
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:44.539
P14: I think they give you everything that you need. They're telling you here, and personal information, and they're telling you exactly what they need, but they're saying that you may need supporting documents. I think I would do my homework, and then I would click on here and find out exactly what documents they wanted before I started the application. So that, like I said, I,

106
00:15:44.670 --> 00:16:07.020
P14: I could get through this I don't know if it has the option where if you're missing something where they you can pause it and go back to it, or whether you have to start all over some some sites and a government site would be a good example. They're gonna possibly make you start all over. So it's just easier to have something

107
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:17.060
P14: right there when you need it, and right in front of you, in my opinion, that's just me. But I try to be really organized, or I am organized, and I try to stay that way.

108
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:40.679
Renata: Yeah, so just so you're aware, with this form and with some others on va.gov, if you have an account, and you sign in. You can save in progress. For the purposes of today, though we're not gonna be signing in with a va.gov account. So you're not gonna see any language that says save in progress. But I just want you to be aware that that is an option. If you were signed in but at this point

109
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.300
P14: Oh, thank you.

110
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:57.530
Renata: Yeah, at this point I'd like you to scroll down a little bit. There's a big blue box towards the bottom of the page, and below, where it says, sign in or create an account. There's a smaller link that says, Start your form without signing in. If you'd click on that for me, please.

111
00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:14.779
Renata: Okay, so I would like you to start this form as though you're applying for yourself and one other family member, such as your father's spouse or another dependent child of of the veteran.

112
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:40.369
Renata: I'll let you know when we're going to pause in the form to ask some questions, but to help orient you, we're going to go through the 1st 3 sections of the form. And just as a reminder, this is our testing site. You don't have to worry about information going anywhere. You can use fake information for any sensitive questions or things you don't want to share, and as you go through the form, I would like you to please think out loud. We want to hear any reactions as you are experiencing them.

113
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:47.109
P14: Okay, okay, let's see, send in to save your progress. We can also pre-fill.

114
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.829
P14: Okay and you said, I'm not going to sign in. I'm just doing it as a guest, correct?

115
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.690
Renata: Right yeah, just for today.

116
00:17:53.690 --> 00:18:03.209
P14: Okay. And you said applying for myself, or you said dependent? So I would assume, this 1st one is what I would pick, since I'm not the veteran. Oh, wait a minute.

117
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:03.750
Renata: And.

118
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.310
P14: Or

119
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:12.859
P14: I could actually well, you said to do myself, so I'll leave it that way. Then I was looking at Number 3 because of

120
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:19.220
P14: what you attached afterwards. But I'm assuming the 1st one is what you would like me to choose.

121
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:29.310
Renata: I'm going to be very annoying, and answer your question with another question, which is based on what I asked you to to do today for the session. Which one do you feel confident to select?

122
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.799
P14: I think the 1st one at that point.

123
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.119
Renata: Okay, well, let's go. Click, continue and go ahead with that.

124
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:45.439
P14: Okay. So now I can put my name in, or should I make a name up? Does it.

125
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.860
Renata: Either one is fine. We're not gonna submit this. So it it's not gonna go anywhere either way.

126
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.369
P14: I'll cheat some of this will pre-fill. So

127
00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.950
P14: I don't think I need anything there. Okay.

128
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.990
P14: United States oops.

129
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:10.910
P14: That was nice.

130
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:24.889
P14: and I always stick my apartment number on the 1st line, because if I put it on the second, I've noticed that they leave it off, and then it's a big apartment complex, and I don't always get my mail. Then.

131
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.450
Renata: Got it.

132
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.890
P14: Hmm! That one.

133
00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:42.970
P14: Okay. Now, do you want me to put in his name, or just make something up at that point or?

134
00:19:43.533 --> 00:19:55.539
Renata: Again. You can use real information, or you can use fake information. It's up to you and what you feel comfortable with. But do you know what this section is asking for? Which person?

135
00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.025
P14: Oh, I can't even spell my maiden name. Okay

136
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.040
P14: Been a while.

137
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:09.870
P14: There we go.

138
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:20.410
P14: Oh, I may have the day wrong.

139
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:29.080
Renata: It's okay. Like I said, we're not testing your knowledge or abilities, and we won't be submitting this.

140
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.209
P14: Do they? Maybe they don't need dashes. I guess I'll find out.

141
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.370
P14: I don't know the address off the top of my head.

142
00:20:54.470 --> 00:21:04.000
P14: I'll just change my address a little bit. It'll just make it easier. There we go alright.

143
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.330
P14: and I'll stick mine in.

144
00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:22.189
Renata: If you were doing this in real life, would you use your phone number for your father's information there? Or would you have put your father's phone number in contact.

145
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:32.589
P14: I would have put his his number, but I just figured it was easier at that point. Normally, if I was filling out a legal form. I would put his phone number.

146
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:45.653
Renata: Okay, yeah, that's fair. I'm just curious. So like I said, you'll be filling this form out for yourself and one other dependent that could be a spouse for your father or another like, you know, a dependent sibling

147
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.589
P14: Incomplete review edit and complete.

148
00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:02.580
P14: Oh, I must have missed something save and continue.

149
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.410
P14: Oh, I didn't put all this in pre-filled.

150
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.339
P14: I don't. Oh, you know where I stopped

151
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.210
P14: when it when it said Junior or senior, I stopped. I didn't.

152
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.740
P14: That's my own oversight. I apologize.

153
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.060
Renata: Oh, no need to apologize.

154
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.336
P14: Oh, my God! I almost made myself a hundred years older.

155
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.240
P14: There's days I feel like that. But

156
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.229
P14: just make something up.

157
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.170
P14: Phone, United States.

158
00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:01.700
P14: Hmm, contact. If there's more. Okay, that's fine.

159
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.000
P14: And you said, there's 1 more applicant that I need to add?

160
00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:27.310
Renata: Yeah, it could be fictional either a spouse of your father's, or another child of your father's.

161
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:37.029
P14: Okay. My brother passed away last year, so I can put him down, for now that's the only other person I can think of.

162
00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:44.360
Renata: I'm sorry to hear that. You can use a fictional person if you want to. It doesn't need to be any real person's information.

163
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.109
P14: Let's see.

164
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.009
P14: Yeah. He passed away very early.

165
00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:05.980
P14: Yeah, he was just trying to...

166
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:16.720
P14: Oh, I can't remember exactly the year I want to say that's correct.

167
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.239
Renata: Our system might not like those fives. I'm so sorry.

168
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.248
P14: Oh, that's okay. Because so.

169
00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:36.120
P14: Dashes allowed. Now I didn't put dashes on the other. Is there a reason?

170
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:41.930
Renata: You can use them, or you don't have to use them there. It allows you to submit it in either way.

171
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.790
P14: Yeah, no.

172
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.489
P14: it was actually, unfortunately, he was living at a hotel when he passed away, and I do not know

173
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.050
P14: the name of the hotel. It's kind of a sad story, but we'll just

174
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:14.419
P14: make it that he lives somewhere near me at that point.

175
00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:15.690
Renata: Okay.

176
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.440
P14: Oh.

177
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:30.040
P14: I think that's the number. We'll just put that one in at that point. And we'll do...

178
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.069
P14: Let's see.

179
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:41.960
P14: oops.

180
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.670
P14: God love touch screens when they work properly.

181
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.090
Renata: Yeah.

182
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.479
P14: We'll just say that.

183
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.150
Renata: All right. I'm gonna stop you right here and ask you a few questions.

184
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:05.830
P14: Okay.

185
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:15.010
Renata: So anything confusing or unexpected that came up when you were filling out this section sections 1 through 3?

186
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:30.430
P14: It seemed pretty straightforward to me. Until I tried to put all fives in which I didn't even think was gonna be an issue, but it seemed very straightforward like. It shouldn't be any kind of a problem as long as you had

187
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:35.679
P14: all the information right in front of you before you started, I think, would make it easier.

188
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.850
Renata: Okay.

189
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:47.139
Renata: I'm going to ask you a scale question again, 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this section of the form?

190
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.170
P14: Oh, I think it's to me it's a 5. It was pretty straightforward.

191
00:26:53.490 --> 00:27:05.549
P14: If I did my homework and had everything right in front of me, I could fly right through it at that point. It's it's set up very well. Whoever whoever was the designer of the website did a good job. And

192
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:33.800
P14: was it 2 years ago I set up a online teaching website. I didn't end up publishing it. But I've created one 3 times for my portfolio. For this I've got to create another. So I kind of have an idea of all the work that goes into set up a website and how involved it is. So I say kudos to the person that designed it. So I can see both sides of that. And I think it's set up very well.

193
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:43.769
Renata: Got it. Thank you for that feedback. So at this point, I'm gonna have you select No for the question. Do you have another applicant to add, and you can hit, continue.

194
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.780
P14: Okay.

195
00:27:45.175 --> 00:27:52.230
Renata: So before we keep going, I'd just like you to take a look at this page. Let me know if you have any questions or anything stands out to you.

196
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.810
P14: Do you have any Medicare to report. 

197
00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.889
P14: I wouldn't be sure

198
00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.850
P14: on what Medicare I had to report. Maybe that's something I'd have to do homework on.

199
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:10.990
Renata: Okay.

200
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:22.229
P14: You are required to report it to process your application. Oh, so if if the applicants have a Medicare theyre required to report it. Okay, then that's that's not a problem. At that point, I would think

201
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:29.030
P14: with their correct social security number and date of birth, that the Government would know

202
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.660
P14: that anyway, even they would know that I'm on Medicare.

203
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:43.719
Renata: Okay, just to make sure that I understand. If you've provided the right, like social and date of birth for folks, you're assuming that the CHAMPVA program could confirm your Medicare benefits like with

204
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:45.630
Renata: CMS?

205
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.605
P14: Yes, and then I think,

206
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:59.860
P14: if any of the Medicare or any of the benefits have medicare, you're required to report it to process the application. So I would think that if you

207
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:11.039
P14: think you're going to get around it and say, Oh, they'll never know it. It's the government. I'm sure they they have a way to trace it back at that point. And

208
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:15.935
P14: I'm thinking to, how do I explain it?

209
00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:27.920
P14: for people that are still working that that have medicare, but they might still be working part-time and still collecting or still using health benefits

210
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:36.400
P14: with things like that. My understanding is a lot of times, Medicare wants that 1st health care company to be billed 1st

211
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:51.429
P14: and then Medicare. So I think if you try to get around it and they find out that you have something that you're concealing that could maybe get, you know, deny you benefits for this program.

212
00:29:51.560 --> 00:30:00.369
P14: You know, if you're knowingly, if it's overlooked, that's different. But if you they're asking you if the person has medicare, and you say no.

213
00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:05.030
P14: they have a way to check, anyway. You know, so

214
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:10.560
P14: it's it's better to do your homework and have everything you need right up front. But

215
00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:14.580
P14: at at this stage of the game they they all had Medicare.

216
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.460
Renata: Okay.

217
00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:32.718
Renata: I'm gonna have you scroll up a little bit on this screen. So next to the VA logo, it says, 1010d Extended CHAMPVA application, and then in parentheses includes 10-7959c. Does that mean anything to you

218
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.230
Renata: at all?

219
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.960
P14: No, because I didn't do any homework on the form. I didn't know

220
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:45.099
P14: before I did this session. If you wanted me to do.

221
00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.610
P14: I'll work on that form. But.

222
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:55.039
Renata: There was no homework needed. I'm just curious if it means anything to you. And your answer is completely satisfactory. So that is fine.

223
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.850
P14: I'm sorry. I'm usually very, very well versed on things like this.

224
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:09.979
Renata: No apologies necessary. A couple more questions for you. Thinking back to that 1st page you saw at the beginning of this. Do you remember, if it mentioned Medicare at all?

225
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:22.770
P14: I cannot recall. I know it asked for social security. I have birthdays, but I don't remember seeing Medicare.

226
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:35.490
Renata: Okay, that's totally fine. So if you were filling this out on va.gov for real today, would you need to stop at this point and collect more documents related to Medicare or health insurance?

227
00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:46.210
P14: I would assume. Well, I may click. I would have it in advance. But let's say that I didn't see that in the beginning, and they asked for this.

228
00:31:46.884 --> 00:31:49.060
P14: I may go back

229
00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:54.989
P14: and make sure that I had the the Medicare numbers, because I know they've changed, and they're not

230
00:31:55.110 --> 00:32:21.190
P14: part of your social security number anymore just to prevent fraud. So I wouldn't have them off the top of my head with their social security number, because I think mine used to have. I don't know if it was an A after it I can't remember, but now it's got letters and numbers and I know that's for more security. So my

231
00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:26.390
P14: anticipation of this is that they may ask me for those numbers if I had them.

232
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:35.720
P14: But I still think that even if I didn't, you're saying I could save the form, so I probably go ahead now and see what they wanted.

233
00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:36.670
Renata: Okay.

234
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:59.510
P14: And I still say there's a way they can trace it back, because there have been times where, if I've gone to a new doctor. [Redacted]

235
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:25.909
P14: [Redacted]
236
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.030
Renata: Got it. Well, I hope you're feeling better now, and you've recovered.

237
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:50.749
P14: Oh, I am, knock on wood! [Redacted]

238
00:33:51.020 --> 00:34:16.036
P14: [Redacted]

239
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:22.499
P14: but it's just the way I've always been on my life. So I just try to be proactive where I can.

240
00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:35.729
Renata: Yeah. So for the purposes of today's study, I'm gonna have you go ahead and fill out this section as though you and your brother both have medicare as well as private health insurance.

241
00:34:36.226 --> 00:34:44.549
Renata: No need to, you know. You could make up plans, and whatever and I'll stop you when we're gonna ask some more questions.

242
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:45.420
P14: Okay.

243
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.789
P14: okay, you said Medicare and private health insurance, but I only see Medicare. So is it going to

244
00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:02.710
P14: ask me after? Well, I would assume. Maybe it's going to ask if there's additional.

245
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:03.780
P14: In short.

246
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:11.290
P14: I'm gonna do that annoying thing again. Where I answer your question with a question, is that your assumption just based on what you're seeing right now or...?

247
00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:12.519
P14: yeah. Well

248
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:23.970
P14: you know, you just told me that we have medicare and private insurance. So it's saying, Medicare plan types. I'm hoping I don't have advantage.

249
00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:34.400
P14: We both had thi. He had that and I'm gonna see. Oh, Lord, okay, dates.

250
00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.699
P14: I can't remember the exact date, but I think

251
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:47.419
P14: no, it was before that, because I was on disability before that.

252
00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.320
P14: Date, no coverage.

253
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:56.600
P14: So this is kind of a a good guesstimate.

254
00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.010
P14: It may have even been

255
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.229
P14: okay. So we'd have to upload it.

256
00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:21.449
Renata: Yeah. And at this point I can provide you with a dummy card to upload, or you can just upload a random picture on your desktop. What would you prefer to do?

257
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.520
P14: Oh, I guess a dummy one, because I'd have to go

258
00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:31.870
P14: get my wallet. I know kind of where it is, but I always

259
00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:37.980
P14: I try to take it out of there, too, because I always worry like if your wallet is stolen, that people

260
00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:43.019
P14: go with that. But then, if I'm at the doctor, and you know some doctor's offices

261
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.570
P14: every year. They want a copy of that. So it's.

262
00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:47.070
Renata: Yeah.

263
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.070
P14: Easier.

264
00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:49.690
Renata: That's great!

265
00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:53.870
P14: Thing that you're gonna send me, or can.

266
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:54.280
Renata: Yeah.

267
00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.240
P14: Mode.

268
00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.949
P14: I don't. I may.

269
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:57.450
Renata: So.

270
00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:01.600
P14: Screenshot I can just upload. But it it isn't of a Medicare card. Is that okay?

271
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:12.479
Renata: That is totally fine. It's not gonna it's not gonna bump you out if it's random. But if you want that dummy card, I put it in the zoom chat, and I can walk you through how to download that and access it.

272
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:18.970
P14: Okay, let me see what I have here. Or I could just pull

273
00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.940
P14: my chart. Okay, I don't want to give them

274
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:29.299
P14: the MRI of my pelvis. I'm sure they don't want that.

275
00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.730
P14: If this was my other computer, I have tons of images and things.

276
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:34.679
P14: I could just.

277
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.250
Renata: Okay.

278
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.289
P14: I'll just put this a

279
00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.730
P14: oh, okay, sorry.

280
00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.569
P14: Alright. We'll just do the same thing.

281
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.949
P14: I can't remember the date. But again, I'm just making it up correct?

282
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.440
Renata: Yeah, does not need.

283
00:38:08.905 --> 00:38:13.769
P14: In front of me. I have no clue.

284
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.859
P14: We'll just say that.

285
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:27.391
P14: Okay, I'll just take the same thing. This is when my, this computer I'm on couldn't handle the storyline

286
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:39.330
P14: file, because it's 2 GB of RAM. And you need another 2 GB. So they were insistent that my computer could hold it, and I knew they were wrong, and they were

287
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.639
P14: because I only had 5 GB of RAM.

288
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.230
Renata: Hmm.

289
00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:57.960
P14: Required to port it. Oh, this one, since you said there was private. Well, maybe I'll let me see if it goes to.

290
00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.900
P14: Maybe it'll do the Medicare first, st

291
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.610
P14: we'll just add, like he had the other

292
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:13.170
P14: oops.

293
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.530
P14: That's a new day like that.

294
00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:51.469
P14: I would spell that out normally, but I just.

295
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.479
Renata: Got it.

296
00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:06.438
P14: Oh, tell me you're gonna make me upload or

297
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:15.750
P14: but like, I said, if you have everything that you need, then this would be no big issue, because I'd have it all ready to go.

298
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:17.610
Renata: Admittedly.

299
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:27.779
P14: Then I would say no, because Medicare advantage would include it. So.

300
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:28.880
Renata: Okay.

301
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.520
P14: Okay. And you said, important

302
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:43.400
P14: okay, this is maybe I misunderstood the question.

303
00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.760
P14: Let me look. Review your plans.

304
00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:52.899
P14: Okay, no, I didn't read that correctly report other health insurance. Okay.

305
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.400
P14: let's say that.

306
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.129
P14: Just say, both of us.

307
00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:44.989
P14: Okay, I knew they were. Gonna ask for that which was okay.

308
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.317
Renata: You're you're a pro at the cards at this point.

309
00:41:54.790 --> 00:42:08.380
Renata: Okay. So I'm going to stop you here. I have a few questions for you, so that 1 to 5 scale again with one being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the Medicare and Health Insurance section of the form?

310
00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:23.629
P14: It was a 5. It it was pretty straightforward. There was that one area where I didn't read it correctly, but then I went back to double check, because something told me that maybe I read it wrong, and it was asking if it

311
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:29.519
P14: if there was more Medicare to report, and I thought I was going on to the other insurance, but I think

312
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:42.570
P14: if you saw me I went back, and then I answered, No, because I realized they were asking if I wanted to add more medicare coverage for the 2 people in there. And then I said no, and it came up with

313
00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:50.229
P14: the additional insurance which you told me would be for working for an employer. And then I added that.

314
00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:56.750
Renata: Okay, got it, and nothing confusing or unexpected aside from that, but that popped up during this section?

315
00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:13.050
P14: No, no, it's it's very straightforward, like, I said, whoever and I can look at it, you know, because in the last 2 years doing what I do create, having created websites which I thought I would never do, and then creating

316
00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:26.610
P14: e-learning modules which they look real easy to you. But let me tell you, there's like so many steps involved in things called triggers and and things. I say kudos to the person that developed it, because I know

317
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:30.629
P14: just how complicated it can be to make a simple form like this.

318
00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.810
Renata: Got it. So I'm gonna have you click that continue button now.

319
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:36.610
P14: Okay.

320
00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:48.199
Renata: So like, I said, we're not going to be submitting the form today. This is going to be the last page that we're going to look at, but I'd like you to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits for yourself and your family member.

321
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.979
P14: Okay. So Review

322
00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:04.400
P14: and I would make sure like this was all correct.

323
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:05.680
P14: Okay.

324
00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.300
Renata: Okay.

325
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.510
P14: Your mailing address. Signer information.

326
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.899
P14: Okay, that would whoop.

327
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.510
P14: Sorry about that. Oh, stop it.

328
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:28.220
P14: Okay. I guess this thing wants to fight me here.

329
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:53.780
P14: oops sorry. Sometimes the touch screen has a mind of its own.

330
00:44:54.180 --> 00:45:04.219
Renata: That's okay. Do you use keyboard shortcuts with your touch screen? I'm just curious. Or do you use the the keys or the mouse at all on your computer.

331
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:08.980
P14: You know the this laptop, this older one.

332
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:18.160
P14: I love it because the keys are like more broken in and everything. But it's got that older trackpad which actually, I'm gonna miss.

333
00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:28.550
P14: and the bottom where it had the right and left. Click, it's like frozen. So what I did is I got a wireless mouse, but it's attached to the rental.

334
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:29.729
Renata: Oh.

335
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:55.050
P14: For some reason, when every time windows 11 updates, the trackpad doesn't work, it's and I guess that's something that's a little glitch that they have with windows. 11. So I normally had a wireless mouse that I could use for here. So the only thing I can use are my fingers, or just the trackpad right here. If I go to like writer left. Click, it's kind of stuck.

336
00:45:55.530 --> 00:46:00.071
Renata: Got it. So you're just using that that touch screen plus typing.

337
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:16.809
P14: Yeah, I in fact, for this program. Someone I'm seeing and I don't know if he's ever gonna follow through. But he had promised me a laptop last September, and they said, Oh, I'm still getting it. And he said, Well, you don't need a touch screen, but actually, for what I do.

338
00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:45.199
P14: and I do, because I have my hands all over, because I have to go from different areas and what they call timeline states and kind of narrow things down. It makes such a difference. Once I think you get used to a touch screen, it's hard not to have one like I'll go to my rental office to print out forms, and I put my finger on the screen. I'm like, what's go. Oh, it's not a touch screen. So you get kind of spoiled.

339
00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:55.149
Renata: Yeah. Let's say that you accidentally input something wrong like your brother's middle name. How would you fix that on this screen?

340
00:46:55.150 --> 00:47:00.860
P14: Oh, I would go over to the left hand side to edit, and I would go ahead and

341
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:03.539
P14: do continue and make a change.

342
00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:04.225
Renata: Okay.

343
00:47:05.106 --> 00:47:15.190
Renata: got it. So like, I said, we're not going to be submitting the form today, but without clicking on anything. If you were to submit the form, what would you expect to happen next?

344
00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:20.430
P14: Oh, I would go through everything. It looks like I

345
00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:25.720
P14: right here, I would have to submit the form. I'd have to do a statement of truth.

346
00:47:26.576 --> 00:47:38.879
P14: And I know I don't know how many people do this, but I can. I can tell you. I know my lesson. A lot of people blow over their privacy policy.

347
00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:47.340
P14: I always check and read that before I would type in my full name. Because when I was setting up the online teaching website.

348
00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:56.329
P14: People were like, "Why are you paying for a jumpstart course to do that?" And the woman said, There's little things that when you're setting up.

349
00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:14.140
P14: you know, online teaching course. Or even if you're starting a business, you're on the Internet, right? So you're going to reach everybody around the world, possibly, and if you're in the United Kingdom, if you reach someone in the United Kingdom

350
00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:39.429
P14: and you violate their privacy policies. And that was 2, 2 and a half years ago. It's like a $26,000 fine per occurrence that people never think about. So when I heard things like that, I always look at the privacy policy always. It's just it's there to protect you. And maybe there's some things that you're not going to agree with.

351
00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:48.009
P14: and if you just blow through it and say, Oh, yeah, okay, it's a privacy policy, what? And maybe they're going to be sharing your

352
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:54.280
P14: your information, which actually would probably be illegal without your authorization. But if you

353
00:48:54.520 --> 00:49:06.489
P14: type your name here, you just gave permission because it's in the privacy policy. So I think a lot of people just aren't well versed on things like that. And they kind of

354
00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:22.200
P14: they see. Oh, yeah, everything's the same. But there could be just slight wording there that could get you in trouble, you know, and maybe release information that you don't want released at that point, so I always read it so I would.

355
00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:26.820
P14: I would verify everything. I would edit anything that was wrong.

356
00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:37.439
P14: Go through like the health insurance information, look at the privacy policy. Then I would type my name certify. It was okay, and then I would submit the form

357
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:50.980
P14: I would assume if it lets me submit the form, and there's no errors there that it's going to give me, like a confirmation number to hold on to for my records and a lot of times.

358
00:49:51.200 --> 00:50:14.959
P14: especially with the Government that will. They'll either an email will go to you with verification that they received it, or if it doesn't, I make a copy of that page, either screenshot it, or, you know, make a full copy and then put it in my Google docs, so that I have verification that I did that and have a date and time stamp on it.

359
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:15.800
Renata: Got it.

360
00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.800
P14: Does that answer your question properly?

361
00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:26.280
Renata: Yeah. I'm curious, would you prefer to have the option to download a copy, or just the screenshot, which would be more ideal for you?

362
00:50:27.097 --> 00:50:30.590
P14: It would be nice to download a copy. The thing is

363
00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:43.970
P14: I can see everything here that's up here. So what I would do. Because, let's say, this is the 1st time I've done this, I may just screenshot this whole screen

364
00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:56.249
P14: and save it, so that I have proof of what I filled out exactly what I filled up, because all the boxes are here, and then I would look at that privacy policy.

365
00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:07.510
P14: Oh, go ahead and put my full name in, certify, maybe make a screenshot of that also, and then submit the form and take a screenshot

366
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:12.009
P14: of the confirmation number, so that I had something to go by.

367
00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.563
P14: Just so I get everything

368
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:22.189
P14: so that if they come back to me and say we don't have anyone by the name of Michael Francis Shaughnessy.

369
00:51:23.006 --> 00:51:25.910
P14: You know, on file.

370
00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:46.649
P14: you know, is the birthday correct? Then maybe I'm off by a day or 2 that I didn't realize. Maybe you know how sometimes when you write real quickly, you can't read your own writing like it turns into like a doctor's writing. Maybe when I was putting it in transcribing it. Maybe I didn't pay attention to what I put

371
00:51:47.152 --> 00:51:56.779
P14: you know, and mistakes can happen. So I would go back. Look at my records, and then correct whatever it was, and resubmit it. Does that answer your question?

372
00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:05.440
Renata: Yeah, quick time check. We're almost at the end of our hour. Do you have a hard stop, or could you stay a couple more minutes past?

373
00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.039
P14: That's fine. I have no problems with that at all. I'm happy to help.

374
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:17.740
Renata: All right. So, after submitting this, how soon would you be expect to be notified about a decision on your application for CHAMPVA benefits?

375
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:24.180
P14: Oh, I you know that's a good question. It's the it's the government. 

376
00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:33.309
P14: I would think, if everything's correct it, you know I always try to give now, today, because I,

377
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:58.370
P14: with that situation, with that instructional design, I had contacted some education law attorneys and people were like you weren't on the attorneys backs, like, you know, 1st thing this morning. I said no, because I contacted them on Thursday, and my attorney told me a lot of attorneys. Offices took off Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and the 1st day back from a holiday.

378
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:15.220
P14: I try not to bother anybody because they get bombarded, you know, and so to me, Tuesday or Wednesday. So let's say that was the case now. I would give it 24 to 48 h to get a response, and then I may.

379
00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:22.799
P14: If there was, I would assume they're going to give me a confirmation number where I can go online also and check the status.

380
00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:24.540
Renata: Okay.

381
00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:31.339
Renata: got it. So you'd like to have a way to check the status of your application while you're waiting to hear on the decision?

382
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:35.650
P14: Right. And then, like I said, I'm not one of those, you know. 

383
00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:58.900
P14: Maybe it's more an emergency situation where it needs to be done. But usually things like this, they're they're fixable to me, whatever is wrong, and I'm allowing time, for you know I'm asking for benefits, and you know I'm grateful for the benefits are going to provide.

384
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:05.030
P14: I'm trying not to overstep my bounds. If that makes sense. I know

385
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:30.579
P14: I have plenty of people. I know they're not. I would say they're acquaintances or not friends, and they're one of them used to be a neighbor. I call her Nasty Nancy, because after the pandemic she was a nurse. I don't even know who she is, and I know they went through a lot with Covid, but she was rough around the edges to start with. But you know, people like that would be nasty and hounding people, and I find

386
00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:33.218
P14: just to sit back.

387
00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:54.109
P14: This is not a life or death situation just to sit back and let the government do its job. Maybe since it's automated, it might be an automatic response once. They, if I have the dates correct, it may come back quicker than I think it would, but I still

388
00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:58.509
P14: give the benefit of at least one to 2 working days before.

389
00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:05.249
P14: I would wonder if something was going on at that point. I don't know if that answers your question.

390
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:19.040
Renata: Yeah, that works. So I have one more question about this page. It's that scale question again, 1 to 5 with 1 being very hard. 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy is it to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits?

391
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:29.570
P14: Oh, 5. I mean it like I said. You know, whoever set this up if they're listening, they're probably like, Thank you. Thank you. Set up very well.

392
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:35.550
P14: I. The only thing where I think I had an issue where I to go back is because

393
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:40.413
P14: I didn't read everything properly, and I caught myself at that point.

394
00:55:41.020 --> 00:56:00.500
P14: I'm used to filling out these forms. I'm used to setting up forms like this, and when it took me to ask me to put in another Medicare. I knew I read something wrong, and then I went back. I could see where that could trip somebody up at that point, but not enough that I couldn't figure that out. So a 5.

395
00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:12.679
Renata: Okay, so we're done with. This portion of the session. So you can close this this tab, and you can stop sharing. And I just have a few things for you. To wrap up.

396
00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:13.470
P14: Okay.

397
00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:15.680
P14: Let me see.

398
00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:21.349
Renata: All right. So overall. Was there anything you saw in the session that worked well for you?

399
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.548
P14: Oh, this was very easy.

400
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:25.630
Renata: Okay.

401
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:52.500
P14: I don't know how many of others of these did if people tell you something different. But you know, maybe it's just the fact that I'm used to filling out forms. And now I'm used to creating forms like this. So I have a different appreciation looking at this than maybe the normal person. But, like I said, it's very well set up. I think even a couple people I know at the Meijer Food store that are like

402
00:56:52.840 --> 00:57:17.449
P14: know how you do that. I'm afraid of computers, even when I'm at self check. And there's a problem I call a supervisor. I'm like, really like, it's simple. You just overwrite it, I mean, but some people are afraid of technology. I kind of embrace it. And I want to keep. I'm a lifelong learner, and the way the economy is, I'm just going to stay working. And I think

403
00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:30.189
P14: that's actually very relevant. And I'm lucky my dad's side of the family, his great aunts they lived. One lived to 89, one lived right past her 99th birthday, and they were sharp as a tack.

404
00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:59.209
P14: and they were always reading, always learning, and I think it makes a difference when you're you keep your mind occupied. If that makes sense. The person I'm seeing now is 5 years older, and he's retired, and he's like, you know, I don't know if this is going to work with us because you're learning, and I'm just retired, and I read and I forget things. And I'm like, Well, that's because you're sitting in your house looking for things to do all day, saying how busy you are.

405
00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:02.219
P14: But you're really not. You're not challenging yourself.

406
00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:26.970
P14: you know. And I think I said, I'm surprised because I think in a relationship. If somebody's learning and they have things to talk about. I think you would be proud of that, and you would want to be with someone rather than me to say, oh, I sat around my house all day trying to look for things to do like. I'm just as bad as you, so I don't know every you know different strokes for different folks, but

407
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:39.350
P14: I just I always. I plan to work part time from home for as long as I can, and stay as active as I can, you know, mentally and physically, and I think

408
00:58:39.540 --> 00:59:04.759
P14: you know, maybe your mindset approaching life and approaching when you apply for these things, and understanding that there may be little quirks. It's the government, and being patient, I think, goes a long way. And there. So maybe I'm a different participant than you normally get, but I can see both sides of the story. So I look at things a little bit differently.

409
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:09.790
Renata: Got it. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?

410
00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:26.100
P14: Oh, no, I think this has been really thorough. You've been great to deal with. I hope I didn't talk your ear off for things that weren't relevant if I did. I apologize. But you know, like, I said, I think the website is set up fantastically.

411
00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:35.580
P14: some people that are a little bit computer illiterate may have a little bit of issues, but I mean, if you can read, it's very.

412
00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:47.790
P14: very well set up. I mean the the best advice I could give someone that I knew is to quote unquote. Have all your ducks in a row like. Have all your paperwork

413
00:59:47.910 --> 01:00:00.949
P14: right in front of you with the birthday, because then you can fly right through it. You've got your Medicare number, their dates of birth, you know. You think you remember, but maybe you're off by a day, and then that's going to

414
01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.359
P14: kick it back. And I don't know if you

415
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:21.619
P14: you know, some websites like the Government one are so attuned to things that if you put in a wrong date it's sometimes it'll know, you know. But if that's the real one, I don't know if it would stop you to give you an example. 

435
01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:51.369
Renata: Yeah, totally I wanna circle back now and just reconfirm if you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip from this session with our VA partners? And to remind you, we remove all information that could be used to identify you. 

436
01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:54.979
P14: Yeah, that's fine. Whoever set it up will probably be like, thank you. Thank you.

437
01:04:55.572 --> 01:05:00.610
P14: Is there any part of our discussion today you do not want shared in a video clip?

438
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:08.519
P14: No, I think everything's fine. I I don't think there's anything really any discriminating information at all.

439
01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:21.530
Renata: Okay. So I just wanted to say, we really appreciate you taking time out of your day and your week to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is really really helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for folks like you.

440
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:43.519
Renata: So, thank you. Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb in it that you can pass along to veterans or other family members of veterans, you may know, to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies. But with that, thank you so much. Again, have a really great rest of your day and week. And yeah, we really appreciate it. So thank you.

441
01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:57.060
P14: And cross your fingers hopefully. I can do this extension. 

446
01:06:55.170 --> 01:07:03.920
Renata: All the fingers are crossed. That. This gets resolved quickly. But yeah, just please take care and thank you again so much. The whole team really appreciates it.

447
01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.279
P14: Okay. And if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me, I'm happy to help.

448
01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:09.530
Renata: Got it. Thanks so much.
