1
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:09.990
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording I would just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.860
P12: Yes.

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:20.799
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.580
P12: Yes.

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.490
Renata: Okay, thank you.

6
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.100
Renata: So you mentioned this at the at the outset. But have you ever applied for the the CHAMPVA program?

7
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:33.609
P12: I haven't. But my wife and kids have, yes.

8
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:43.929
Renata: Okay, and did anyone such as a veteran service officer, another family member or friend, help your wife and kids fill out the CHAMPVA application?

9
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.150
P12: No, I'm pretty certain my wife did it all on her own.

10
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.120
Renata: Okay, got it

11
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.289
Renata: So you mentioned your wife and kids; how many dependents are enrolled in CHAMPVA?

12
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.030
P12: 3, with my wife and 2 kids.

13
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.480
Renata: Okay, got it

14
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.840
P12: They're they're actually aging out another year and 2 years.

15
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.689
Renata: Oh, got it. So they're they're college age?

16
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.770
P12: They're 22 and 21 right now, so they'll be. I think they age out at 23.

17
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.929
Renata: Got it. Okay.

18
00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:19.540
Renata: Actually, hold on a second. I just saw that a

19
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.470
Renata: colleague of would you mind if a colleague of mine joined to just observe? They're they're interested in hearing your thoughts today.

20
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.790
P12: Of course.

21
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.099
Renata: Okay, I'm gonna let them in and have them introduce themselves really quickly.

27
00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:19.620
Renata: All right. Thank you, you can go back off camera to save bandwidth. Sorry about that, doing things a little bit out of order today. So back to my questions about CHAMPVA. So do you recall when your wife and children enrolled in CHAMPVA if they submitted a form called the other health insurance certification, otherwise known as Form 10-7959c?

28
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:31.199
P12: I can find out. Really quick, [Spouse], did you sort of fill out a other health form certification when you signed up for CHAMPVA? Yes, it's an OHI, she said.

29
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:44.259
Renata: Okay, wonderful. Thank you. And when y'all filled out the application for CHAMPVA did you do it online, by paper, over the phone, mail? Fax?

30
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.399
P12: I believe it was faxed in.

31
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.929
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. And anything confusing about that experience or frustrating about submitting the form?

32
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:06.050
P12: Was it confusing? A little bit complex, just to make sure you got all the stuff right if memory serves. But I faxed it in for you, I remember. Yeah, it's just that.

33
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.030
P12: It was hard to confirm whether or not it was received, because there's such a backload in the faxes

34
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.040
P12: with that.

35
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.960
Renata: Got it.

36
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.330
P12: You know what I mean. I had our confirmation, but I couldn't

37
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.020
P12: I couldn't get confirmation from the VA that they received it.

38
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:31.559
Renata: Got it. I appreciate that feedback, and I'm sorry that there was some confusion and and lack of clarity around that but.

39
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.029
P12: There's no need to apologize, no need to apologize. Yeah. It was 2017.

40
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:48.489
Renata: Okay. Have you all ever submitted any medical or pharmacy claims to the CHAMPVA program? Or have your doctors managed to handle all of that?

41
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.569
P12: So I have a couple that I have to turn in. And I

42
00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:04.200
P12: I gotta do the form, and I have to do it. So I'm gonna be doing that like, I'm in the process of doing my 1st time with the pharmacy one

43
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.210
Renata: Okay, got it

44
00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:12.700
Renata: Thank you. A couple more questions for you, P12. Do you have a va.gov account?

45
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.740
P12: Yes.

46
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.799
Renata: Okay, and what has your experience with been with logging into the site?

47
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:28.940
P12: No problems at all. I've been. I've been on login dot gov. I've been on the the MyHealtheVet, and va.gov since they started. Really.

48
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.359
Renata: Okay, and how often are you visiting va.gov?

49
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:44.908
P12: I have the app. I go to the app at least once or twice a week, because I have. I take, like, 28 different medications. I'm pretty bad shape.

50
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.770
P12: so I'm on at least twice a week looking at my appointments and looking at my medicines.

51
00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:18.110
P12: But and I do go on to va.gov, I'd probably say at least once a week on on, you know, on the website to cause you can't get the health records and some stuff you can't get on the app like you can't get the tracking on like right now I'm out of a Med. And I couldn't get the tracking. So I had to go on the Va dot Gov, and that's not on there anymore, either. But so some stuff you can't do on the app, so I use both.

52
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:47.070
Renata: Okay, got it. So a little bit of each and there's some stuff that you're doing specifically in the app and some stuff that you can't do in the app that you're doing on the website. Sounds like, okay, got it? So those are all my questions to kick us off. The next portion of this session. We're gonna be looking at that demo tool that I mentioned earlier. I just wanted to double check before we get started. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen in zoom? In the next portion.

53
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.970
P12: Sure.

54
00:05:47.970 --> 00:06:00.649
Renata: Okay. So if you could go ahead and silence any notifications, close anything else out that you've got other than zoom and let me know when you're ready. I'm gonna drop a link in the chat in the zoom, chat.

55
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.209
P12: Okay, I have nothing else running in the background. So we're okay.

56
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.730
Renata: Okay.

57
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.439
P12: And and you wanted me to shut something else off? I'm sorry.

58
00:06:08.814 --> 00:06:14.429
Renata: Silence notifications. Just so they're not popping up when we're when you're sharing screen.

59
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:22.189
P12: Okay, give me one second. Let me go into focus, and I'm gonna put it on sleep, because then nobody will get through.

60
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.580
Renata: All right.

61
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.460
P12: Okay. I'm back.

62
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.500
Renata: Okay, so I shared that link in the Zoom chat, and I can help 

63
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.789
Renata: with any troubleshooting. But once you've got that open in the browser, if you could share your screen.

64
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.889
P12: Yep, just a sec open in the browser.

65
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.559
P12: And how do I share my screen?

66
00:06:48.387 --> 00:06:57.560
P12: You'll have to go back to the zoom app, and in there there should be either icons at the bottom of the screen, or a 3 dot.

67
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:05.239
Renata: 3 dots that says more, and you need to click into that. And then one of the options is an icon with an up arrow that says share

68
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.759
Renata: or broadcast screen, it might say broadcast.

69
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:21.470
P12: There, okay, screen, start, broadcast.

70
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.060
P12: Okay.

71
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:32.060
Renata: Perfect. And now, if you can go back to the browser where you open that link I gave you.

72
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.249
P12: That was on. Oh, it was on this.

73
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.449
P12: Actually, I can get it right here.

74
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.290
P12: You're still there, right.

75
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.800
Renata: Yep, I'm still here.

76
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.269
P12: Okay. And I go back to this.

77
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.070
P12: There it is.

78
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:55.399
Renata: I can also reshare it in the chat, if that'll help it. Pop up for you.

79
00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.120
P12: Oh, no, I just did. I didn't go to the chat because I'm a moron. Okay, I'm going to it right now. You got it.

80
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.119
Renata: Not a moron, the mobile zoom is tough. I can see it now. Perfect!

81
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.490
Renata: Okay.

82
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:27.139
Renata: So a few things before we get started. So like, I said before, this is a demo tool and a testing site. So anything we fill out here, we're not submitting anything, and it's not attached to Va system. So nothing we do is going to affect your benefits as we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers. If you don't feel comfortable using your real information.

83
00:08:27.582 --> 00:08:55.949
Renata: You may be asked to upload documents on some screens, as we're not submitting the form. And this isn't attached to Va systems. Nothing we upload here is going to be, you know. It's it's we don't have to upload real information when we get to those screens that ask for a file to upload, I can provide you with a sample document, or you could just upload something randomly that you have on your phone. You don't have to decide right now. I'll bring this up again when we get to those screens, if if they pop up but any questions for me.

84
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:56.990
P12: No!

85
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:06.069
Renata: Okay, so you can scroll up and down this page, but without clicking on anything. I'd just like you to take a look at the information, and let us know your initial thoughts.

86
00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:09.940
P12: I'm very familiar with the va.gov pages.

87
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.090
P12: So.

88
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.030
P12: It looks. I mean, it looks totally fine. "Check your eligibility."

89
00:09:16.881 --> 00:09:20.810
P12: "Find out what you need." So you tell me what you need before we start

90
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:27.389
P12: and then start it. And then you let us know what's happening, and you just gotta sign in with a verified account. And then

91
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:34.660
P12: you know what it doesn't say down there sign in with verified account, does it? Tell you got to do the oh, yeah, it does. login.gov or id me.

92
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.109
P12: Okay, yeah, it all is pretty straightforward.

93
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.450
Renata: Okay

94
00:09:40.197 --> 00:09:46.530
Renata: So a few questions for you here. Do you know if you're on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits?

95
00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:50.620
P12: I don't think...

96
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:59.489
P12: I have to start in first, st but I have to sign in first, and then I -- oh, yeah, I am on the right page. I can start it without signing in.

97
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:09.350
Renata: Okay. So you know that you're on the right page to apply because you, because of the start or create an account or start your form without signing in?

98
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:10.650
P12: Correct.

99
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:18.149
Renata: Okay. And if you wouldn't mind scrolling up a little ways towards the top of the screen.

100
00:10:19.084 --> 00:10:28.689
Renata: so above or below, where it says, apply for benefits. It says, VA form 1010d. What does that mean to you? If anything.

101
00:10:29.413 --> 00:10:33.169
P12: It's a military form that this application I'll fill out will be.

102
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:33.875
Renata: Okay?

103
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:45.669
Renata: And if you were on va.gov today filling this form out for your spouse and dependent children, what sort of research would you do before starting this application?

104
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.390
P12: Well, I 

105
00:10:49.540 --> 00:11:04.519
P12: the generic answer would be, find out if you're eligible, but which I know they are. So I wouldn't do that, but nor most people would. And then I'd find out which documents I need before I applied, because I hate to, you know. Stop doing it [the form] and go back.

106
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.410
P12: And that's it.

107
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:05.840
Renata: Okay.

108
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:35.789
P12: And then you already have an account. Bt I would create an account if I didn't. That is, I'll say a little bit of a hassle, because sometimes it don't read your license right and you can't do it, and you gotta wait a day or 2 to recertify. So that's a little bit of a hassle, and I don't know. Do you still have to verify your account in person before it becomes live? At one time, years ago I had to go down and prove my identity at the at the actual VA building in [city].

109
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:47.544
Renata: You know that's a really good question. I'm not sure if you still have to do that. I don't think so, with like id me. I think you can do it by uploading an identification like an id form of Id. But

110
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:54.560
P12: Yeah, that's what I did with login.gov it. It took a few tries because it wouldn't go through, but I finally got it to go through.

111
00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:01.790
Renata: Got it so. I think you mentioned th at you would probably sign in if you were filling this out for real on on va.gov?

112
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.899
P12: I would sign in as soon as I got to the page. Yes.

113
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:12.190
Renata: Okay, got it. And what information do you think you're going to need to fill this application out for your spouse and children?

114
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:18.220
P12: I would imagine DD214, maybe birth certificates, social security cards and

115
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.719
P12: I don't know. I think that's probably about it.

116
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.400
P12: I mean.

117
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.610
Renata: Okay, and birth certificates for the whole family? Or just for

118
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.950
P12: Oh, for the whole fam!

119
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:29.700
Renata: Okay, got it

120
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.280
P12: I don't think you did mine.

121
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.400
Renata: Okay.

122
00:12:32.865 --> 00:12:40.010
Renata: and do you have all that information on hand? Or would you need to pause and go collect all of it if you were applying?

123
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:45.430
P12: I got it upstairs in a fire safe, so I just go get it from before I started.

124
00:12:45.430 --> 00:13:00.399
Renata: Okay, got it. One last question for you on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being poorly 5 being very well. How informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin, based on the information you've seen on this page?

125
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:16.999
P12: Well, it doesn't really tell you many details about it. Just tells you per personal information about you and personal basement about your sponsor so it really doesn't say much. Oh, I guess it probably says everything they're gonna do. I didn't do it so I can't tell you

126
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.569
P12: Oh, it says the stuff. I'll need proof of school enrollment and

127
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.879
P12: copies of health insurance. Yeah, I guess it says everything I need.

128
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:34.360
Renata: Okay, so on that 1 to 5 scale with 1 being poorly and 5. Very well, how informed do you feel based on the information you've seen on this page?

129
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.220
P12: 5 if I take the time to actually read it. Yes.

130
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.769
Renata: Okay, if you were just skimming it, that 1st impression, would you still give it a 5? Or would it be a lower number?

131
00:13:44.026 --> 00:13:51.220
P12: Skimming it. I'd have probably said, if well, no, if I was doing it for the 1st time, I'd have read it all, so it'd stay a 5.

132
00:13:51.430 --> 00:14:02.060
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. So I'm gonna have you scroll down now. And in that big blue box underneath, where it says, sign in to create an account. We're gonna click that link that says, start your form without signing in.

133
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:29.900
Renata: Okay, perfect. So from this point forward, we're going to be filling out the application. I'm going to have you imagine that you are applying on behalf of your spouse and one other family member like one of your children. I'll pause to let you know what I'm going to ask some questions, and we'll talk about it. But just to orient you, we're going to complete the 1st 3 sections of the form just as a reminder. This is our testing site. So you don't have to worry about the information going anywhere

134
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:42.279
Renata: or affecting your VA benefits, and feel free to use fake information for those sensitive questions. And as you go through the form, please remember to think out loud. We want to hear any reactions you have as you're experiencing them.

135
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.580
P12: Okay. Oh, my, hit continue? I'm sorry.

136
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.110
Renata: Oh, no, go ahead, we can start filling it out.

137
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.310
P12: Okay

138
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.360
P12: Oh, it doesn't take auto fills.

139
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:12.909
Renata: Oh, yeah, I think this is a quirk of the test system that we're on right now.

140
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:17.559
Renata: It it sometimes is a little bit finicky with Autofill. I'm sorry about that.

141
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.190
P12: It's okay. I've noticed it on other pages before, too. So

142
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.150
P12: oh, that stinks

143
00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:57.940
P12: bummer

144
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.290
P12: oops.

145
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.379
P12: Okay, that was the 3rd screen.

146
00:16:45.002 --> 00:16:46.910
Renata: You can go ahead and keep going.

147
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:47.840
P12: Keep going? Okay.

148
00:16:54.710 --> 00:17:03.240
Renata: And aside from the the pre-fill not working out so great on those other screens, nothing unusual or unexpected popping up so far?

149
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.329
P12: No, everything's exactly as I'd expect to enter.

150
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.560
Renata: Okay.

151
00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:04.300
Renata: it might give you trouble, because that's consecutive. But if you flip the last 2 numbers, it's it's just a quirk of the test system.

152
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.527
Renata: Yeah, sorry about that.

153
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:18.300
Renata: So nothing unusual, frustrating, confusing what you're seeing?

154
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.530
P12: Pretty easy, really.

155
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:30.300
Renata: Okay. And when you see this part for the applicant's contact information in real life, would you put your your spouse's contact info, or would you put yours?

156
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.520
P12: I'd put hers in.

157
00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.430
Renata: Okay.

158
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:36.729
P12: That's actually what I'm doing, right? Is that correct?

159
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.542
Renata: Oh, I'm just curious. There's no right or wrong answer.

160
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.710
P12: Yeah, because I'm filling it out for her. So you want her email address, I assume.

161
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.600
P12: And then.

162
00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:47.950
P12: Email.

163
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.339
P12: Better remember this. Huh.

164
00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.772
Renata: Like, I said, we're not testing knowledge or abilities. So

165
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.640
P12: Oh, that's wrong.

166
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.910
P12: See I got in trouble.

167
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.940
P12: Oh, I got her birth wrong, but that don't matter, I put in [date] instead of [date].

168
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.210
P12: Let's try it.

169
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:34.690
P12: Okay, there's an error right there, I put in. I did have the right date, and it says [date].

170
00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.760
P12: It comes up.

171
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.200
Renata: I see.

172
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.830
P12: [Date]

173
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:48.300
Renata: Yeah, I think I think this might be a known issue here. But good eagle eye on catching that!

174
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.990
P12: Yeah, right? Oh, no. It's the next page.

175
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.220
P12: yeah, [date] it changed her birthday.

176
00:19:55.872 --> 00:20:01.059
Renata: But pretty easy for you to just go in and and click edit when you noticed an issue right?

177
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.420
P12: Yeah, it was no problem at all.

178
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.852
Renata: Okay, and like, I said, we're gonna add one other dependent like a child.

179
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.860
P12: [Daughter]. What's your number?

180
00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.859
P12: Yep, [phone number]

181
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.060
P12: Okay, thank you.

182
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.580
P12: I remember a long email address, but not her number.

183
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.370
P12: Yeah. So

184
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.340
P12: [Birthdate]

185
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:50.070
Renata: Alright! Just taking a look at this page. What is it asking you to provide in your own words?

186
00:21:50.070 --> 00:22:12.899
P12: I know exactly what they're asking for. They're asking for her enrollment for acceptance letter. That shows this. See, this is actually a very difficult thing because my daughter's college was able to provide that gave her graduation date. But my son's college in [state] only gives it for the semesters he's enrolled in at the time.

187
00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:24.260
P12: So it was a -- I had to go to the publisher's clearing house and beg, plead, wheedle, and get him to change it to his actual graduation date, so I could get his military ID.

188
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:31.630
Renata: Got it. So this was a point of frustration with the initial enrollment in CHAMPVA? Or have you had to do this multiple times?

189
00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:36.778
P12: We've had to do this multiple times. Every year. We have to do it.

190
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:41.029
P12: but and it's always a challenge with my son's college.

191
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:42.920
Renata: Got it.

192
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:50.630
P12: I, you know, and I'm wrong, ma'am. I don't think we have to do it every year. I had to do it for CHAMPVA and I had to do it, for when I got their ID, so.

193
00:22:50.910 --> 00:23:03.290
Renata: Okay, got it. So if you were filling this out on va.gov, today, would you have to stop and go call the the school, or your son or daughter to collect this letter? Or would this be something that you just have on hand?

194
00:23:03.558 --> 00:23:15.640
P12: It said at the beginning I would need proof of school enrollment, so I would probably try and get it in hand. In fact, before I went on, before I did any of the other stuff, I made them get me their letters, so.

195
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:26.600
Renata: Okay. So there's a quirk with our system that it won't take a photo. But if you have like a Pdf or a file to upload. And like, I said, I can also provide one to you if you would like.

196
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.700
P12: I got some.

197
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.969
P12: I got my DD214, but I probably shouldn't put that in there.

198
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:35.940
P12: No.

199
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.320
P12: Oh, that's pretty big file, does it matter how big the file is?

200
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.694
Renata: I think there's a file. There's a file limit, but it's it's fairly large.

201
00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:02.239
P12: Here. Actually, I got my covid, my covid vax.

202
00:24:03.056 --> 00:24:03.573
Renata: Okay.

203
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.409
P12: I'll call it the Enrollment letter.

204
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:24.629
Renata: Okay, you can go ahead and click continue. So I'm gonna stop you here and ask a couple of questions. 1st off, anything unexpected, unusual challenging about the section that you just filled out?

205
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:25.809
P12: Not at all.

206
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:36.709
Renata: Okay, and on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this initial section of the form?

207
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:43.460
P12: For me very easy. But again, people will have trouble with that school registration.

208
00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:44.710
Renata: Okay.

209
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:54.450
P12: You might want to forewarn them that they they need to go to probably publishers clearinghouse to get the the true date, because some colleges only give what you're enrolled in at the time.

210
00:24:54.790 --> 00:25:02.170
Renata: Yeah, I'm curious about that. You mentioned publishers, Clearinghouse. So do they do independent like enrollment verification?

211
00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.461
P12: Yeah. It says that on most most of the college sites you can.

212
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:12.559
P12: you go there, or you can go to the publisher. I think it's publishers clearinghouse. I'm almost positive it is.

213
00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.340
P12: And you can you pay a fee and then you can download their

214
00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.569
P12: they're I guess they're in. I forget, [depednent]?

215
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:27.890
P12: What was that letter you got from the publishers clearinghouse, to prove your enrollment? Or did yours work from the school?

216
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:40.289
P12: Remember when we had to verify your enrollment with CHAMPVA and to get your ID and we had to struggle to get them the finish date. Did you get it from publishers clearinghouse, or did you get it from the school?

217
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:41.970
P12: Okay

218
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.570
P12: What was your question, ma'am?

219
00:25:44.266 --> 00:25:51.459
Renata: So were you able to? Are you able to request that like independently? Or do you do that through the school?

220
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.419
P12: So a lot of the times.

221
00:25:54.920 --> 00:26:17.450
P12: The school will do it. But nowadays, especially when I needed it, I had to go, so I had to log into my student portal, and when you have CHAMPVA there's a different slot in your student portal for it, where you can go to the Clearing House tab on there, and you can request it. So I requested myself, but the school did give like access to it to the students who did have military.

222
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:18.120
Renata: Got it.

223
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:26.879
P12: And that was her school. [College] doesn't have that or make it that easy. And we really it took me a year and a half to get my son squared away.

224
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.130
Renata: Got it.

225
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:41.679
P12: Also kind of like, because I'm going to be taking these courses through what's called [name], and it's kind of like an online like college class for medical billing and coding certifications. They won't work with military at all.

226
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:48.789
P12: so even if you get benefits from military, they will not allow you to use them. So basically, you know, if you don't have

227
00:26:48.920 --> 00:27:05.620
P12: you know any other payment wise you're you have to pay out of pocket. If you want to be able to access those things. So it's very limited what you're allowed to use military id on now for for schooling. She's talking about the other way getting the CHAMPVA insurance, getting the letter from the school. She's not talking about the other way.

228
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.340
P12: Okay. Sorry about that. That was little Tmi.

229
00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:24.739
Renata: No, that's it's all helpful. I really appreciate all the feedback. So thank you. So in in your mind what would be an effective way to warn folks like, hey, this school letter is gonna stop you if you don't have it before you start?

230
00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:48.570
P12: In the very beginning. When you say what you need say, you're going to need a challenge. A difficult document to obtain with the proper dates is your enrollment letter. I think that's what it was, and maybe you could give a link to the publishers clearinghouse, and tell them what form or what they have to do to get it, because it took us like literally for my son, it took a year and a half.

231
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:57.869
Renata: Got it. Okay, I appreciate that feedback. So we're gonna keep going with the forms. You can click no on other applicants to add, and then click, continue

232
00:27:58.936 --> 00:28:04.150
Renata: so before we keep going, I'd like you to just take a look at this page and let me know what you see.

233
00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.369
P12: Are any of us on Medicare.

234
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:15.100
Renata: Okay, and why do you think the form is asking you for this information?

235
00:28:15.639 --> 00:28:22.969
P12: Because I imagine I would imagine they're similar insurances. They're both government sponsored so they may interact with one another.

236
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:23.830
P12: Got it.

237
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:31.040
Renata: And thinking back to that 1st page that we looked at. Do you remember it mentioning Medicare or Health Insurance at all?

238
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.649
P12: You seem to recall it, saying, health insurance, yes.

239
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:47.219
Renata: Okay, got it. And if you were filling this CHAMPVA benefits application out on va.gov today, would you need to stop and collect health insurance or health insurance provider documents at this point?

240
00:28:47.721 --> 00:28:56.160
P12: I don't know anything about Medicare so I don't know. I can't answer that. But yeah, I have. I would have my health card with me. Yes.

241
00:28:56.430 --> 00:29:15.689
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. So for the purposes of today's study, I'd like you to go ahead and fill out as though both your spouse and your child have Medicare as well as private health insurance. And again, we can use populate, fake information for this section.

242
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:24.019
P12: My wife's not on there. It just says, Oh, maybe she'll be up the next time.

243
00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.130
Renata: Oh, that's interesting!

244
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.410
P12: If I wanna let me let me go back. I can't go back, can I?

245
00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:31.480
Renata: It's.

246
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.979
P12: Previous page right there. It doesn't have my wife on there.

247
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.729
Renata: Yeah, that that's interesting.

248
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.740
P12: I don't know which one to pick our original.

249
00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.583
Renata: We're not testing you. So at this point, you know, you can put whatever you want in.

250
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.210
P12: Yeah.

251
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:17.920
Renata: Alright. And again, as I mentioned before, I can provide you with dummy like front and back of card for this, if you would like.

252
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.029
P12: I can just upload my my Covid card again.

253
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:22.790
Renata: Okay.

254
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.289
P12: I don't care if you guys know I was vaccinated.

255
00:30:26.943 --> 00:30:27.750
Renata: Got it.

256
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:33.870
P12: Actually, you guys vaccinated me. So the Va did.

257
00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.200
Renata: Oh, great!

258
00:30:37.108 --> 00:30:40.640
P12: Somebody's at the door, you guys not right now.

259
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.890
Renata: And for the sake of time you can hit no on the part. D.

260
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.920
P12: Oh, there she is!

261
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:50.679
Renata: Oh, that's.

262
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.339
P12: That's funny. I entered for [Dependent], and it went to [Spouse].

263
00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.460
Renata: Yeah, I'm seeing that, too.

264
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:04.090
Renata: yeah. So when you were on that page that asked you to select an applicant, it said your daughter right?

265
00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:11.089
P12: It only had my daughter, and now I filled out, and it came up [Spouse], my wife.

266
00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:21.550
Renata: Yeah, if you were filling this out on va.gov. What? Without clicking anything? What would you do at this point if you you came across this.

267
00:31:21.869 --> 00:31:30.170
P12: I would edit it and change it back to my wife stuff, and then I'd go and say yes to the next thing and have another

268
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:38.919
P12: one or more applicants, and hopefully my wife would pop up on that one, and I assume, when I populate my wife's stuff, my daughter's stuff will go in.

269
00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:44.350
Renata: Okay, yeah, let's let's let's say yes and hit continue and see what happens.

270
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.729
P12: No eligible applicants.

271
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.410
Renata: Interesting. Okay.

272
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.420
P12: No, sir.

273
00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:59.489
Renata: Yeah, that's fascinating. You can go ahead and click back. I'm sorry about this bug that we found.

274
00:31:59.490 --> 00:31:59.850
P12: Okay.

275
00:32:00.482 --> 00:32:08.389
Renata: You're helping us find this stuff before it goes. Live you can go ahead and click no. Then on other to report.

276
00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.330
P12: Okay.

277
00:32:10.377 --> 00:32:17.449
P12: and then for this one, like I said earlier, you're going to provide a health insurance plan for both your wife and child.

278
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.820
P12: Let's see if that one works.

279
00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:34.570
P12: So this is kind of stripping for you.

280
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:46.030
P12: Okay, yeah, I got it all so. But they don't.

281
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:47.600
P12: Yeah.

282
00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.420
P12: Yup, there it is again.

283
00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:01.320
Renata: Alright, yeah. So it's only showing your daughter and not your wife here.

284
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:06.489
P12: Here. Yup, but I'll bet you it pops up for on [Spouse]'s stuff.

285
00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.060
Renata: Yeah.

286
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.670
P12: This is actually pretty easy to operate, ma'am.

287
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.900
Renata: Really.

288
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.439
P12: Yeah, I'm not having. I mean, it's really fast.

289
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.199
P12: Yeah, [Spouse]. Okay, no, that put both of them in there.

290
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.869
Renata: Wow, that's interesting. Okay.

291
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:28.329
P12: That on the other one.

292
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:53.640
Renata: Yeah, that that is odd. I well, I you know, I'm gonna show this to my engineers, and I'm sure they're going to. They're gonna love seeing this bug. So I appreciate you uncovering this for us. Before we keep going with the form. I'm gonna ask that one to 5 scale again one, being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the Medicare and health insurance sections of the form.

293
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.520
P12: Oh, super easy. 5.

294
00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:01.450
Renata: Okay, got it? Yes, aside those bugs aside though it was, it was.

295
00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:04.670
P12: Yeah. Well, I assume your release version isn't gonna have the bugs.

296
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.090
Renata: One would hope not. Yeah, yeah.

297
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:33.319
Renata: But now we've seen it so we can show it to our engineers. So that'll be very helpful. Yeah, you can go ahead and click no, on other health insurance to report and hit, continue button. So this is actually the last screen that we're going to see. Like I said at the beginning, we're not submitting the form today, so I'd just like you to review your application for chant Va benefits for your wife and daughter. Let me know if anything unusual stands out to you, and then we'll talk at the end.

298
00:34:42.777 --> 00:34:48.170
P12: I wonder? Is the signer different from the sponsor? Is that why, my name's on there twice?

299
00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:56.299
Renata: I'm gonna be a little bit annoying and answer your question with another question which is based on what you're seeing. Do you think that they are the same or different.

300
00:34:56.841 --> 00:35:07.839
P12: It could be it could be if I was. If I was filling this out for a vet that couldn't fill it out for himself, I would be the signer, and I would put his name in there, so that makes sense.

301
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.990
Renata: Okay, got it

302
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.109
P12: It's got the. Oh, no. I put a different number in there.

303
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.819
P12: Yeah, that doesn't have [Dependent] on there.

304
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.989
P12: So it never. It didn't update her there, but it does have them both on this one.

305
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:43.859
P12: So that same error continued pretty straightforward.

306
00:35:44.200 --> 00:36:01.479
Renata: Got it alright. So we're gonna stop here and I have a few questions for you. So let's say, you caught that birthday error with your wife. When we got to this review page how would you go about fixing that without clicking on anything?

307
00:36:01.905 --> 00:36:14.569
P12: If I couldn't fix it then I'd probably have to call, because I've already tried to fix it, and it keeps going back, so there's nothing I could. I I would actually I would have to. I I assume you can save where you're at.

308
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:24.160
Renata: We're doing the unauthenticated version of this we didn't sign in. But typically if you had signed into your va.gov account you would be able to save the form, yes

309
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:24.700
P12: Yeah, I.

310
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.110
Renata: Right.

311
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:29.679
P12: I would save, and then I'd call right there that [800 number].

312
00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.719
Renata: Okay, and let them know that you're running into an issue?

313
00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.519
P12: Yeah, that that's plugging in the wrong birthday.

314
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.169
Renata: Okay. So like, I said, we're not.

315
00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:41.270
P12: I got my it changed my daughter's birthday, too.

316
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:42.970
Renata: Oh, my goodness!

317
00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.070
P12: They both went down by a day.

318
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:46.564
Renata: Wow!

319
00:36:47.366 --> 00:37:02.479
Renata: That that's a good catch. Thank you. So like, I said earlier, we're not actually gonna submit this form at all. But let's say that you were submitting the form for real today. What would you expect to happen after you click that submit form button at the bottom?

320
00:37:02.805 --> 00:37:12.879
P12: It's gonna give me a page that says this is your confirmation number for your submittal. Please print it out for your records and you're done. We'll get back to you.

321
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:20.579
Renata: Okay. And typically, when you submit forms online on va.gov, do you print out a copy of the submission or download the form?

322
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.930
P12: I, I save digital save a digital copy. Yes.

323
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.640
Renata: Okay, like a a Pdf?

324
00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.640
P12: I instead of printing? I, yeah, I pdf it.

325
00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:36.020
Renata: Okay, got it. And how soon do you expect? Be notified about a decision on your application after you submit it?

326
00:37:37.737 --> 00:38:07.109
P12: I'll be frank. I didn't have a lot of speedy service with my VA problems, even when I was dying from [condition]. So my my opinion would be negative. But I in defense of the system for CHAMPVA, I think you guys took care of my wife and kids pretty fast. I was in bedridden at that point in time. So it was really bad for me. I lost 65 pounds. I literally almost died. So.

327
00:38:07.826 --> 00:38:35.479
P12: I don't remember like 7 months. So this all happened in that timeframe. So I don't think [spouse] had much problem getting in. We have a problem every year, because when they're off for this, the kids are off for the summer, we have to re-enroll and and get the new letters, the verification letters from the school. So that's always a hassle, because the schools are always notoriously slow. But the original sign up, I think, was pretty easy for her.

328
00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:40.652
Renata: Okay. I'm really sorry to hear that, and I hope I hope you're feeling a lot better now.

329
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.799
P12: No, ma'am I'm still alive. I'm good.

330
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:55.299
Renata: Okay, in an ideal world, I know that I know that working with VA can be challenging sometimes, but in an ideal world. How soon would you ideally like to be notified about a decision on your application?

331
00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:00.600
P12: Oh, I wouldn't expect anything 30, 60, 90 days, I mean, there's a lot of people.

332
00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:05.899
Renata: Okay, got it. I think.

333
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:18.009
Renata: Oh, I have one more question for you. Sorry. Just checking my notes on a scale that 1 to 5 scale again, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy is it for you to review your application for Champ Va. Benefits.

334
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:22.579
P12: Oh, 5 easy! I blasted through the whole thing in a minute.

335
00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.740
Renata: Okay.

336
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:35.979
Renata: got it. So like, I said, we're not going to be able to submit the application in this test form, so you can stop screen sharing and and close out of your browser, and then we'll just finish up.

337
00:39:36.826 --> 00:39:39.710
P12: Okay, let me stop share.

338
00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.340
Renata: Okay, then.

339
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:48.400
Renata: So just a few more questions for you overall. Was there anything that you saw in this session that worked well for you?

340
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:55.290
P12: Actually, yeah. Everything on the on the on the site worked worked perfectly.

341
00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:01.810
Renata: Okay. And anything that you saw in your session today that was unclear or that didn't work well for you.

342
00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.020
P12: I

343
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:13.610
P12: I can. We go back to the other question? The only thing it didn't work was it changed the dates? But we expect some errors, because it's a demo version, so that really doesn't count. And no, there was nothing that happened that I didn't expect.

344
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:28.689
Renata: Okay. And just to reiterate, I think you said this on the review page. If you had gotten there for real on on va.gov and seen that change in birthday that would have been a hard stop for you. Save the form. Call that 800 number and say, Hey, this isn't working for me?

345
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.719
P12: Yeah. Otherwise it'd be just 90 days. I'd get a letter and say, you did the paperwork wrong.

346
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:39.070
P12: and I'd have to start all over. So yeah, I wouldn't waste my time even trying to submit wrong.

347
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:52.920
Renata: Okay. And my next question for you. Now that you've been through this application, what additional research or information would you provide? Would you suggest we provide for veterans and their families on that 1st page?

348
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.990
Renata: to make sure that they're, like prepared?

349
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:59.500
P12: Maybe you could provide a link that shows what the benefits are.

350
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:06.989
Renata: Because you say how to apply. You say what they need to apply, but they don't know what they're applying for.

351
00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:18.730
P12: Because that brochure does anybody really read that that thick pamphlet? I'm sure my wife did. I was. I wasn't looking at anything, and I have no memory of that time, anyways.

352
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:39.059
P12: but I'm sure she did. But do most people read that that fit blue 60 page pamphlet? Do they really know what they're getting. Would would that be beneficial? Putting a link on there, saying, This is what you're eligible for. So it goes both ways. So they know what they're eligible for and what they're not eligible for, so they don't go in with false expectations.

353
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:49.919
Renata: Got it. Thank you for that feedback. Next question for you. What are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in the form? Not enough, too much, just right?

354
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.950
P12: Oh, just right. It was easy.

355
00:41:52.190 --> 00:42:03.249
Renata: Okay, and this might be a better question for your wife. But how would you compare this to like filling out and faxing in the the CHAMPVA application, as y'all did previously?

356
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:21.430
P12: Oh, yeah, a hundred percent better before she. You know, we we had to fax. We had to fill it out. I had. We had to get it into a I took. I think I took it up to a kinko's, or she did. I don't remember to get it faxed, and it was just a hassle, and you know, snail mail snail mail so doing it online so much better.

357
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:25.979
Renata: Got it. Okay, thank you. Any questions for me before we wrap up?

358
00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:28.510
P12: No, you've been wonderful. Thank you.

359
00:42:28.915 --> 00:42:36.620
Renata: Thanks so much. I just wanna circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?

360
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:41.880
P12: Yeah, no problem. But are your, are your partners still on?

361
00:42:42.656 --> 00:42:44.490
Renata: Yeah, yeah, they're still here.

362
00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:46.010
P12: Renata needs a raise.

363
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:50.219
Renata: We'll make sure to put that part at the beginning of the clip.

364
00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:50.720
P12: Alright!

365
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.789
Renata: Any part of our discussion today. You would not want shared in a video clip?

366
00:42:56.691 --> 00:42:58.550
P12: No, I'm okay with everything.

367
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:13.529
Renata: Okay. Well, P12, we really appreciate you taking your time out of your day today and out of your week, really to share your thoughts, your feedback super helpful as we continue to work on the site to make it sure it really works for veterans and their families. So thank you so much.

368
00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:31.799
Renata: Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass on to other veterans and their family members, that you may know to provide them the chance to sign up and participate in future research studies. And with that thank you so much again. Enjoy the rest of your day, and have a happy weekend.

369
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:37.810
P12: Yeah. Have a wonderful weekend, all of you, and thank you very much. Thanks for everything you guys do for the Va. For the veterans.

370
00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.750
Renata: Yeah. Absolutely. Take care.

371
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.119
P12: You as well. Thank you.

372
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.080
Renata: Bye.
