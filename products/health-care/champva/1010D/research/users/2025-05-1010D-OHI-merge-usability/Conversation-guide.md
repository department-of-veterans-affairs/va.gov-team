# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we’re going to talk about VA Form 10-10D to apply for Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs benefits, otherwise known as CHAMPVA. CHAMPVA is a cost-sharing program for spouses and children of Veterans with disabilities who don’t qualify for Tricare.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take no more than 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
- **You'll be interacting with a coded prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. <mark>**Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**</mark>
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes / No

Thank you for sharing. 

## Task Zero: [Screen share] - 5 minutes

I'm going to drop a link in the chat, which I'd like you to open in your browser and then share your screen in Zoom. I can help walk you through how to share your screen, but I want to give you a moment to close any other browser windows, tabs or applications you may have running, and silence notifications on your [computer/phone] so it doesn't interfere. Let me know when you're ready for the link. 

<mark>Wait for participant's verbal consent.</mark>

Great! I'm pasting the link to the site in the chat. You can find that in the row of buttons at the bottom, under the chat icon: https://staging.va.gov/ivc-champva/10-10d-extended/

### Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says **Share** *(on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click **More...**)*
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says **Share**. Then there will be options for what to share. Please choose **"Screen"** (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: **Broadcast screen**
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to “Share” in the Zoom buttons]

- *If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant’s screen and mouse in Zoom:* `<Name>’s screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.

## First Task: [Form Intro Page] - 5 minutes

Before you start filling out the form, a few things to be aware of:
- This is our testing site so you don't have to worry about the information that you enter going anywhere. Nothing you click on in this form will have any bearing on your benefits.
- As we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, such as Social Security Numbers, if you don't want to use your real information.
- You may be asked to upload some documents; as we're not submitting the form and this isn't attached to your benefits, nothing you upload there will be sent to the VA. When we get to the screens that ask for a file to upload, you can upload something random from your desktop, or I can provide a sample PDF for you to use. If you don't know yet, I'll ask you what you'd like to do when the time comes. 
- Do you have any questions?

<mark>Wait for participant answer.</mark>

Without clicking on anything. I’d like you to take a look at the information on this page. Tell us your initial thoughts. 

- Do you know if you’re on the right page to apply for CHAMPVA benefits? How do you know?
- What does "VA Form 10-10D EXTENDED" mean to you? How about "10-7959c"?
- In your mind, why would the application for CHAMPVA form include Form 10-7959c?
- - If you were on VA.gov filling out this form for yourself/your spouse/your dependents, what research would you do before applying and completing a form like this?
- Do you know how to check your eligibility for CHAMPVA benefits for you/your spouse/your dependent children?
- What information do you think you’d need to fill out this application for you/your spouse/your dependent children?
- Do you have all that information on hand, or would you need to pause to find it if you were really applying for CHAMPVA benefits today?
- Without clicking anything, do you know how to start this form without a VA.gov account? Can you show me?

### After completing the task: **Participant rating:** 

- On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well) - how informed do you feel about the application you are about to begin based on this page's content? Why did you give it that rating?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant easily locate the information about CHAMPVA benefits and OHI? Do they understand they will be filling out two forms at the same time?]
> - [Does the participant locate the apply and supporting documents links?]
> - [Does the participant indicate they would need to pause to gather information, or would need to coordinate with others to complete the application together?]

## Second Task: [Sponsor and Applicant Loops] - 10 minutes

Now I'd like you to start the form as if you were applying for [yourself/your spouse] and one other family member [like a dependent child]. I'll let you know when to pause to ask some questions, but to help orient you, you're going to complete sections 1-3 of the form.

- As a reminder:
 - This is our testing site so you don't have to worry about the information that you enter going anywhere. Feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions such as your social security number or birth date that you don't want to share.
 - As you go through the form, please remember to think out loud. We want to hear any reactions you have as you're experiencing them.

### After completing the task:**Participant rating:** 

- On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy) - how difficult or easy was it to complete this section of the form? Why did you give it that rating?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [What does the term 'sponsor' mean to the participant?]
> - [Does the participant understand filling out the sponsor loop?]
> - [Does the participant understand how to add two applicants to the form?]
> - [Does the participant have any issues with the supporting documents that are asked in the applicant loop?]

## Third Task: [OHI Sub-form] - 10 minutes

- Before starting this section, I'd like you to take a look at the page and let me know if anything stands out to you.
- What is this section of the form asking for?
- Thinking back to the information you saw on the first page, why is the form asking for this information?
- If you were filling out this application for CHAMPVA benefits on VA.gov today, would you need to stop and collect more documents?

Thank you. 

For the purposes of today's study, I'd like you to imagine [you/your spouse] and family member both have Medicare and private health insurance. Go ahead and fill out Medicare and private health insurance information for both [yourself/your spouse] and one other family member [such as a dependent child]. When you have finished adding Medicare and health insurance plans for [yourself/your spouse] and another family member, we'll stop before finishing the form.

### After completing the task: **Questions and Participant rating:** 
- On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy) - how difficult or easy was it to complete this section of the form? Why did you give it that rating?
- On this page, do you know if you uploaded the front and back of [your/your spouse's] and your family member's Medicare and Health Insurance cards? How do you know?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant understand they are starting a the sub-form 10-7959c?]
> - [Does the participant understand the Medicare Parts questions?]
> - [If the participant is 65+, do they understand the attestation question?]
> - [Are the participants comfortable with selecting a health insurance plan before identifying an applicant?]
> - [Do participants have feedback about the v3 file upload component?]

## Fourth Task: [Review and Submit] - 10 minutes

- Without clicking submit, review your application for CHAMPVA benefits for [yourself/your spouse] and one other family member. 
- If you accidentally input some information wrong, say your family member's name, how would you fix that?
- Without clicking anything, if you submitted the form, what do you expect to happen next?
- How soon do you expect to be notified about your application?
- You won't be able to submit the application in this test form, so you can stop screen sharing now, and we just have a few more questions for you as part of this session. 

**Participant rating:** On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy) - how difficult or easy was it to review your application for CHAMPVA benefits? Why did you give it that rating?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant know how to update information on the form before submitting]
> - [What are the participant's expectations about being notified about their CHAMPVA application?]

# Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
[Type into **#feedback-backchannel**: "Any questions you want me to ask?]

1. Overall, was there anything you saw in this session that worked well for you?
2. What was unclear or didn't work well for you?
3. What research would you do before applying and completing a form like this?
4. What are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in this form?
5. [_If the participant is a current CHAMPVA beneficiary or applied in the past_] How would you compare the form you just completed to your experience filling out the CHAMPVA application previously? Why?
- Any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
