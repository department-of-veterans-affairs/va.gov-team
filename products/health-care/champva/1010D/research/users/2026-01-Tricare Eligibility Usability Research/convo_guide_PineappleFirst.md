# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (also known as CHAMPVA) application and eligibility. We are going to go through a couple of different prototypes.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

- **You'll be interacting with some prototypes today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. <mark>**Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**</mark>

- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
       
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>


# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) program?
- (NOTE: Should not be **enrolled** to qualify for study)

2. Have you ever heard about the CHAMPVA program before?

3. If so, can you explain to me in your own words what you know about the eligibility of that program?

## Screenshare & Prototype Setup
I'm going to share a link in chat with you of the prototype, I'd like you to open in your browser and share your screen in Zoom. I can help walk you through how to share your screen, but I want to give you a moment to close any other browser windows, tabs or applications you may have running, and silence notifications on your [computer/phone] so it doesn't interfere. Let me know when you're ready for the link. I'd like to confirm, are you on a (desktop or mobile) device today? 

- Great, I'm going to share that prototype link in the chat now.

- [ ] Share link in chat of appropriate prototype for Veterans

- Please open this link, it might take a minute to load being a prototype, and share that screen. Please let me know if you need help with that.
  
- [ ] Tap on the button that says Share. Then there will be options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.
- [ ] iPad: Broadcast screen

- For our first task, please select Prototype Pineapple.

## First Task: [PROTOTYPE PINEAPPLE - INTRO PAGE] - 5 minutes

- On this first page, take a minute or so to look over the instructions and when you're ready, in your own words, tell me what this means to you.
- Is there anything here that would give you pause?
- Is the eligibility criteria clear here?
     - Is there enough information for you to choose to proceed? Why or why not?
- If you proceed, would you sign in first?
     - What, if anything, do you expect to be different by signing in vs not?
- Do you have all the information required to submit the application on hand, or would you need to pause to find it if you were really applying for CHAMPVA benefits today?
- On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well) - how **informed** do you feel about the application you are about to begin based on this page's content?
     - Why did you give it that rating?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant state they reason the have not applied or would not qualify as being the Tricare eligibility?]
> - [Does the participant state that they would proceed with the application anyways?]
> - [Is the participant aware that they may be sharing personal information on their screen, and are they okay with that? - per question as needed]


## Second Task: [PROTOTYPE PINEAPPLE - ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] - 5 minutes

- If they state they WOULD NOT proceed: For the scenario today, let's proceed with the application anyway.
- If they state they WOULD proceed: Okay, go ahead and click on the blue alert box to move forward in the prototype.


- Since this is a prototype, we've pre-filled all of the information you'd normally type in if you're doing this for real.
- Please go through these next few questions and remember to think aloud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here. You can click the "Continue" button when you're ready to proceed to the next page. (They can go back if they click on the breadcrumb link).

- [ ] API Check step in prototype flow

- What is your reaction to this eligibility determination you see on this screen?

- Backing up a little bit, please explain to me in your own words what happened once you clicked "continue" on this prototype, and what this message means. 

- Did this step feel slow, abrupt, or unexpected?

- Do you understand what the system was checking?

- What is your reaction to this eligibility determination you see on this screen?

- [ ] Pause them when they arrive at the gray box eligibility screen

- In your own words, tell me what this page means.
  
- What you would do next if you were applying for CHAMPVA today?

- What options do you think were available to you at this point?
  
- On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy) - how difficult or easy was it to **understand** this screen? Why did you give it that rating?

- Go ahead and click on the "Continue" button at the bottom of the screen.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant clearly understand they are entering in their own information first being the Veteran?]
> - [Does the participant state they would stop or leave the form and not apply at any time during the pattern flow?]
> - [Does the participant say that anything is confusing, unclear or would need additional context?]


## Third Task: [PROTOTYPE BLUEBERRY - INTRO] - 5 minutes

- Now we are going to switch gears and look through the second prototype I had mentioned earlier. Again, this is a prototype where not everything works, and we are really interested in your feedback and understanding of the information presented.

- Go ahead and click on "Prototype Blueberry".

- Again, on this first page, take a minute or so to look over the instructions, and when you're ready, in your own words, tell me what this mean to you?

- Is there anything that stands out to you compared to the first prototype you saw?

- Would you take the same or a different action as compared to the other prototype?
     - Would you still proceed with the application?
     
- [ ] State their answer during the first task of prototype Blueberry - would they proceed or not

- Would you give this page a different rating from the first prototype of how informed do you feel about the application? Why or why not?


> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant have a different reaction to the intro page?]
> - [Note: be aware of familiarity bias being so similar (? What are the differences? if any?)]


## Fourth Task: [BLUEBERRY - ELIGIBILITY] - 5 minutes

- For this prototype, proceed the same as you did before by click on the blue alert box to move forward in the prototype.
- Please go through these next few questions and remember to think aloud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here. You can click the "Continue" button when you're ready to proceed to the next page. (They can go back if they click on the breadcrumb link).

- [ ] Pause them when they arrive at the gray box eligibility screen

- Would you take the same or a different action as compared to the other prototype?
  
- Would you still proceed with the application?

- On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy) 
- how difficult or easy was it to understand the second prototype of the form? Why did you give it that rating?

- Go ahead and click on the "Continue" button at the bottom of the screen.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant call out any differences from the first prototype - good or bad?]
> - [Does the participant seem to appreciate the API alert or are they thrown off by it thinking they did something wrong?]
> - [Would the participant want to proceed through the form despite what the alert stated?]


## Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] - 7 minutes

- Now that we have gone through the second prototype, I want to walk through some scenarios and messaging with you to get your feedback. 
- If you scroll down from the Prototype's main menu, you'll find a gray button labelled "warning alerts", go ahead and click on that.
- I will read a scenario, then you'll review the message. Please state any questions you may have or feedback you could provide. 

[Warning Alert A - Veteran not in VA System] 

- In this first scenario, you entered in your/the Veteran's information and you see the following message.

- Please think aloud on what your thoughts are around what this alert means and explain what actions you would take in this scenario.

- In this scenario, would you want to apply for CHAMPVA benefits despite the warning?
     - What actions, if any, would you take before doing so?

[Warning Alert B - Error with EDS] 

- In this next scenario, you entered in your/the Veteran's information just as before, but now you see the following message.

- Would you want to apply for CHAMPVA benefits despite the warning here?
     - What actions, if any, would you take before doing so?


[Warning Alert C  - Veteran not found in DEERS] 

- Third scenario, you see the following alert:

- For this scenario, would you feel more confident now before applying?
     - Why/why not?

[Warning Alert D  - Found Veteran in DEERS, Eligible for TRICARE] 

- For this scenario, your/the Veteran's information was located.

- You see this message. What would you do? Is there any additional information you want to see here?

[Success Alert E - maybe be eligible for CHAMPVA] 

- And the last scenario to go over, you see the following alert.

- [ ] Page with success alert shown

- You see this message. What would you do? Is there any additional information you want to see here?

## Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] - 5 minutes

- For the final task, I would like your feedback on several different messages that happen at the end of our scenarios today. 
- If you scroll down from the Prototype's main menu, you'll find a gray button labelled "summary cards", go ahead and click on that.

- On this screen, you'll find 4 summary cards. The first two, Card Style A, are from the prototypes we just went through. The 3rd and 4th cards, Card Style B, are alternative designs. Please take a moment to look at all four before we talk about them.

- What do you think each card is telling you?
- Which set is the easiest to understand at a glance?
     - What specifically makes [Card Style] clearer than the others?
- Was there any part of the card that felt unclear or confusing?

- [ ] End of screenshare

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant state they would not complete the application if they see one of the warning alert options?]
> - [Does the participant state any actions they would need to take or what they would do if they thought the alert warning was incorrect?]


# Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Is there any other feedback you would like to add about the two prototypes and messages you saw today?
- Do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form? 
- Any questions for me? 



## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>


## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
