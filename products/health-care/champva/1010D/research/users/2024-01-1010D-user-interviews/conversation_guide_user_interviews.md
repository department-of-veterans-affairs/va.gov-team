## Introduction (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Rachael and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to discuss your experience with the application process for applying for CHAMPVA benefits, and Form 10-10D specifically.
- The entire session should last no more than 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. If we have time at the end of the session, some of my colleagues who are observing may have some follow-up questions to ask you.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We just want to improve these processes and forms to better meet the needs of Veteran sponsors and their beneficiaries. I will not be offended by any opinions that you express, and they will not affect your benefits in any way. I welcome any any all feedback you have to offer.
- If for any reason you want to take a break or stop the session, please let me know.

- What questions do you have about the introduction I've just given you?
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? The recording is only to make sure we accurately and fully capture your feedback. Once we've done that and completed our analysis, the recording will be destroyed. No one outside of our research team will have access to it.
  - **If no, end the interview.**
  - If yes, once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
