# User Interviews Research Plan for Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) Team, Form 10-10D, December 2023

## Background
This research will consist of open-ended questions regarding [Form 10-10D](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-10-10d/), which is a component of the application for [CHAMPVA benefits](https://www.va.gov/health-care/family-caregiver-benefits/champva/). At the time this research plan was being written, Form 10-10D is a fillable PDF that applicants must print and mail in. The [project's](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/1010D/product-outline.md) overall goal is to create a fully digitized form that Veterans and/or family members can use to streamline their application process.

This research aims to explore the process of applying for CHAMPVA benefits and filling out Form 10-10D to identify opportunities to improve the experience. Based on participant feedback, we will iterate on the prototype presented in design intent, conduct at least one round of [user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/1010D/research/users/user_testing_research_plan.md), and implement the new Form 10-10D on va.gov.

### OCTO Priorities 
1. Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
2. Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy

### Veteran Journey
- Putting down roots
  - Moment: taking care of my family

## Research Goals	
The goals of this research are to:

1. Understand the user experience in applying for CHAMPVA benefits
2. Identify current pain points with the CHAMPVA application process and Form 10-10D, specifically 
3. Determine user needs for the CHAMPVA application process and Form 10-10D, specifically

### Research questions
**For users that have applied for CHAMPVA benefits in the past:**
1. Why do participants apply for CHAMPVA benefits?
2. What were participants' experiences when applying for CHAMPVA benefits?
3. How do particpants believe the application process can be improved?

### Hypotheses
**For users that have applied for CHAMPVA benefits in the past:**
1. Participants who have applied for CHAMPVA benefits will have done so because they believe they will substantially benefit from the program.
2. Participants experience confusion and frustration around the application process, especially surrounding supplementary documentation.
3. Participants will hope that, because VA has much of the information that Form 10-10D asks for, much of the process can be automated for them.

### Outcome
The findings from this research will: 
- Illuminate the user experience when applying for CHAMPVA benefits and how the digitization efforts can improve the experience
- Provide insights to understand the service design of the CHAMPVA program
- Provide insights needed to iterate upon and refine our initial prototype of Form 10-10D before user testing
- Inform the current state of the user journey map artifact for the program

## Methodology	
**User interivews**

User interivews will be conducted remotely via Zoom using the Perigean contract. A remote moderator will begin with warm-up questionss. They participants will then be asked a series of questions about their experience with applying for CHAMPVA benefits.

Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

After completion of the interviews, a qualitative thematic analysis of the data collected will be performed to uncover insights and opportunities, inform artifacts, and attempt to produce a resolution for the research questions.

## Participants and Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience is Veterans, spouses of Veterans, children of Veterans, and family Caregivers for Veterans who can sponsor or are [eligible for CHAMPVA benefits](https://www.va.gov/health-care/family-caregiver-benefits/champva/). Participants will be recruited by Perigean.

### Recruitment criteria
We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 15 full sessions. Therefore, we request that 20 sessions be scheduled.

**Primary criteria (must-haves, all numbers out of 15)**
- User groups:
	- At least 4 Veterans 
	- At least 10 spouses, children, or caregivers of Veterans
 	- The remaining participant may belong to either user group
   
- Application status:
	- All participants need to have applied for CHAMPVA benefits
 		- OK if they have not received a decision on their application yet
   		- OK if they did not receive the benefits 
    
- Demographics:
  - At least 8 participants age 55-64+- At least 8 participants have cognitive disability
  - At least 4 participants live in a rural area
  - At least 4 participants have no degree
  - At least 2 participants are women
  - At least 1 participant is an expat (living abroad)
  - At least 3 participants are Black
  - At least 2 participants are Hispanic
  - At least 1 participant is Asian
  - At least 1 participant is Native
  - At least 1 participant is gay, lesbian, or bisexual
  - At least 1 participant is transgender, nonbinary, gender fluid, gender queer, Two-Spirit (Indigenous only), or another gender beyond man or woman
  - At least 3 participants use screen readers
  - At least 1 participant uses some other kind of assistive technology

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
- At least 4 participants completed their CHAMPVA application on a mobile device (tablet okay)

## [WIP] Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### [WIP] Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 45 - 60 minutes
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 3 sessions

### [WIP] Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
