# Research Plan for [IVC Forms Modernization Team, 10-10d, March 5th, 2024]


## Background

This study will support the unauthenticated digital flow for form 10-10d application for the CHAMPVA program. We will be building this as a new digital form, so there will be no familiarity from the perspective of the Veterans and dependents interacting with the digital version. However, we will specifically attempt to recruit participants familiar with the paper form and program. \


[[Product brief]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/1010D/product-outline.md)


### OCTO Priorities



* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
* Fast-track disability claims
* Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy


### Veteran Journey

This product fits into the Veteran Journey at three primary moments. \
 \
Starting up



* Depending on their disability status and eligibility for Tricare, the Veteran and/or their family may qualify for benefits through CHAMPVA  at this point in their journey.

Putting down roots



* As the Veteran puts down roots, if they are qualified for CHAMPVA, they will need to revisit the application for their dependents over time. Veterans and their dependents who didn’t previously qualify for CHAMPVA  may be eligible if the Veteran’s disability status changes.

Aging



* Disability status can change as Veterans age. Veterans or their dependents may become eligible for benefits through CHAMPVA  as Veterans’ disability statuses change. There are moments in these scenarios where caregivers, dependents, adopted children, or step-children may be more likely to fill out the application on someone else’s behalf.


## Research Goals



* Test the usability of the current iteration of the 10-10d prototype.
* Test high-level accessibility for the current iteration of the 10-10d prototype.
* Extract insights about the participants’ experience with the current 10-10d process and CHAMPVA. This will inform artifacts and build evidence to address pain points discovered during stakeholder interviews and support continued service design efforts.


### Outcome

This research will advance our product to the next phase of the process by allowing us to identify potential usability and accessibility issues. This will enable us to assess our design's efficacy and promptly make appropriate adjustments to avoid rework in the future. We will also gain further insight into the current state of the entire service experience, which we will use to explore ways the digital form can alleviate some of the pain points discovered. In addition, this will also allow us to make recommendations to the appropriate stakeholders about how to best integrate the digital form into their processes to maximize efficiency and benefit for the Veterans and their families.


### Research questions

Usability & Content



* When interacting with the prototype through a think-out-loud protocol, will users understand and navigate the digital form experience without significant issues?

Accessibility



* Through questions and observations, are there any major accessibility issues that can be identified at this point in the development process?

Service Design



* With interview questions, can we gather further information to produce service design insights and inform our related artifacts?


### Hypothesis



* Based on our understanding of current patterns and best practices for forms, the digital prototype 10-10d will be easy to understand and navigate.
* Based on our understanding of accessibility best practices, we believe the 10-10d prototype will be free of significant accessibility issues.
* Users may be confused and frustrated when uploading files, especially with the current pattern around Medicare cards.
* Our understanding of stakeholder research about the process leads us to believe that users who have applied for CHAMPVA through the existing process will highlight similar pain points (e.g., visibility of application status, lengthy processing time, frustration with the lack of available options to submit supporting documents digitally).


## Methodology

This methodology will be a mixed-method approach, combining a usability study with a user interview. There will be 45-60 minutes of usability testing, utilizing the think-out-loud protocol to identify significant issues with the digital form. \
 \
The exit interview questions will be asked in the remaining 20-30 minutes, less any time it takes to prepare or troubleshoot for the participant. We want to ask these questions at the end to avoid any bias that may impact interactions with the prototype, and comments gathered through the execution of the think-out-loud protocol. This method is appropriate for the goals of the research by addressing said goals directly. The maturity of the design should be appropriate to accommodate all of the aforementioned research.


### Location

Zoom will be the desired location for the research.

### Recruitment approach

Our intended audience for this research is Veterans and Dependents who have applied for benefits through the CHAMPVA program. We will be utilizing Perigean to help us recruit our participants. We will use the lean maximum variation inclusive recruitment strategy outlined by OCTO.


### Recruitment criteria

We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 20 sessions in total, we would prefer to have 15 successful sessions in order to consider the study complete.

User groups:

Cohort 1: At least 6(of 20) Veterans

Cohort 2: At least 10(of 20) spouses, or children of Veterans

Cohort 3: The remaining participants may belong to either user group

Demographics:

At least 4 users on Mobile devices \
At least 4 users on Desktop/Laptop devices \
