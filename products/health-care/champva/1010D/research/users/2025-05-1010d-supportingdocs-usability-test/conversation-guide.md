# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we‚Äôre going to talk about VA Form 10-10d to apply for health insurance through CHAMPVA (the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs).

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. <mark>**Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**</mark>
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans‚Äô experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

‚û°Ô∏è **Start recording.**

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let‚Äôs start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Have you ever applied for the CHAMPVA program? (A cost-sharing program for spouses and children of Veterans with disabilities who don‚Äôt qualify for Tricare)

- If yes: 
  - Did anyone, such as a VSO or family member/friend, help you fill out the application?
  - Did you fill out the CHAMPVA application online, on paper, over the phone, etc.?
  - if ONLINE:
    - 	What was your experience like submitting the CHAMPVA application on VA.gov?
    - 	Was there anything confusing about the online CHAMPVA form?
    - 	Did you have to mail or fax in anything after you submitted your application?
  - if PAPER/FAX:
    - What was your experience like submitting the CHAMPVA application by mail/fax?
    - Was there anything confusing about the paper CHAMPVA form?
    - Did you have to mail or fax in anything after you submitted your application?

- If no:
  - Do you intend to apply for CHAMPVA benefits in the future? Why/why not?

2. Are you or anyone else in your household currently enrolled in the CHAMPVA program?
- Have you or anyone else in your household enrolled in the CHAMPVA program submitted updated health insurance information using the Other Health Insurance Certification (10-7959) form?
- Have you submitted any medical claims to the CHAMPVA program?
  - IF YES: What was your experience like?

3. Optional, omit for time) Do you have a VA.gov account?
IF YES:¬†

- How often/for what tasks are you logging into VA.gov?
IF NO:¬†
- How often are you visiting VA.gov?¬†

Thank you for sharing your experiences with VA.

Next, I'm going to share a link to our prototype to get your feedback, and I‚Äôll give you some tasks to complete. I‚Äôd like you to tell me your thoughts and impressions as they come to your mind while you do the task. This is called the ‚Äúthink aloud‚Äù method, and it will help us understand your experiences with the site.¬†

As I mentioned earlier a prototype is like a test version of a website. It might not work perfectly, but this way we can learn what we need to improve before we share it with more Veterans. I've just sent the link in the zoom chat. Do you see it?

 - IF NO: I‚Äôll walk you through how to do that‚Ä¶

Thanks! Now I‚Äôm able to see your screen too.

## First Task: Task Rose - 10-15 minutes

For this task, we‚Äôre going to have you imagine you‚Äôre applying for CHAMPVA benefits for [yourself, and your spouse/child].

As a reminder, this is a prototype that‚Äôs not live on VA.gov, and at the end of this session, none of the data populated in the form will be submitted. This will not impact your benefits or services in any way.¬†

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


# Emergency Exit üö®

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). <mark>**Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**</mark>
