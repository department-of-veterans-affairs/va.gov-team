## Research Goals ü•Ö	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Understand users‚Äô expectations around what documentation is required to provide when submitting a CHAMPVA application**

`2.` **Understand where and when users expect to upload supporting documentation for their application**

`3.` **Understand how users expect uploading documents supports their CHAMPVA application, and their responsibilities to provide supporting information.** 
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

We will synthesize the data from this study and create a summary report of our learnings. This research will inform decisions around where users upload supporting documentation when completing form 10-10d, application for CHAMPVA benefits. Moreover, the team is currently preparing to [integrate form 10-7959c (Other Health Insurance Certification) into form 10-10d](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/1010D/10-10D-OHI-Merge-Product-Outline.md); learnings from this study will inform how additional subsections of the integrated form experience handle and instruct users to upload supporting documentation

---

### Research questions
**`1.`Do users understand what supporting documentation they‚Äôll need to upload with form 10-10d based on the information provided before they start the application? (Goal 1)**

**`2.`Does the explanation for why we require some documentation for the CHAMPVA application on the intro page make sense? (Goal 1)**

**`3.`How do users interpret the content about providing proof of marriage? (Goal 1)**

**`4.`Do users prefer to upload supporting documents at the time of answering a related question (Prototype Donna), or at the end of the CHAMPVA application (Prototype Rose)? (Goal 2)**

**`5.`Do users have better recall about supporting documents to provide when uploading supporting documents within the applicant list&loop (Prototype Donna, or at the end of the CHAMPVA application (Prototype Rose?) (Goal 2)**

**`6.`Does the [v3 file upload component](https://design.va.gov/storybook/?path=/docs/uswds-va-file-input--docs#upload-status) help users understand they need to provide the front and back of Medicare and Private Health Insurance cards? (Goal 3)**

**`7.`Do users know how to provide additional documentation after submitting their CHAMPVA application? (Goal 3)**

**`8.`Would users want any confirmation around uploading files? (Goal 3)**

**`9.`Does the user understand how to fix a faulty document when it fails to upload? (Goal 3)**

## Recruitment üéØ	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 

> [!NOTE] 
> - Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
> - Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
> - Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

> [!NOTE]
> - **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
> - Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> [!TIP]
> - The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
> - Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
> - Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

**List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:**

- `Veterans:` **[n]**
- `Caregivers:` **[n]**
- `Dependents:` **[n]**
- `Total:` **[n]**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?* 

- `[Place primary criteria here between hash marks when in edit mode]`
- `primary criteria`

## Timeline üóìÔ∏è
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[Enter time length]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[Enter buffer time]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[Enter NUM per day]**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
