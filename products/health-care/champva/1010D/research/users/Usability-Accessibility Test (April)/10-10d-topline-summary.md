## **Initial Findings**

### Finding #1: Various usability issues were found through testing that should be taken into consideration.

* These usability issues were compiled into a document of 28 [preliminary form improvements](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/1010D/research/users/Usability-Accessibility%20Test%20(April)/preliminary-form-improvements.md). These were [prioritized](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1715951140109/d758e4e23ffc505d822726cd4ca660ea4c2a1d67?sender=u3844370d13a440a7859d3526) and handed off to product so improvements could be made by design and developers while full analysis was ongoing. 

### Finding #2: Interactions with the Other Health Insurance form (OHI, Form 10-7959c) PDF and its associated screen in the form flow were consistent points of frustration and confusion.

* 8 of 13 participants were confused and/or frustrated by the interaction and process surrounding the 10-7959c PDF. Participants were initially confused about the page header on the OHI upload screen because it was shared with the previous screen, which contained the “Do you have other health insurance?” question. Some participants who answered that they did not have other health insurance (OHI) were confused about why they were still being asked to provide information about it on the next page and form 10-7959c. 

### Finding #3: The file upload summary page created for this form was well-received, but participants demonstrated some confusion about the difference between “optional” and “required” documents. 

* Participants demonstrated some confusion when it came to different documentation being labeled optional versus required. Despite the confusion, the file upload summary page was generally well received.

> **Pilot:** “What are these optional documents being used for? It feels weird that they're optional…. It felt required because it was in there with everything else.”

### Finding #4: Participants want proof/confirmation of their application submission.

* Many expressed a desire for a confirmation email including the details of their application, a confirmation number, and an estimated date by which they’d receive a decision, especially those who don’t have a printer.

> **P13:** “I should get a follow up email confirming that I’ve submitted my application. It might give me some type of an ID number to track it, or if I wanted to call in and check the status.”

### Finding #5: Over half of the participants wanted information about what they would need to complete the application before they started filling out the form.

* 8 out of 14 participants wanted to know what documents or additional information they would need to complete the form successfully. They wanted lists of required documents so they could gather them before beginning the application, as well as an FAQ or other preparatory info so they would be prepared with the information the form needs.

> **P26:** "I'm a 'prepare' kind of person." 

### Finding #6: Half the participants wanted to check their eligibility before starting the form.

* 7 out of 14 participants (including 4 out of 6 Veterans and 3 out of 8 family members) stated they’d check their eligibility before starting or actually attempted to do so during the test. 

> **P3:** “Is it anything helpful... is it something I can apply for? Some of this can get very confusing."

### Finding #7: The address selector created for this form worked well, but participants wanted to see it earlier in the form. 

* Participants appreciated that they could use our newly-created drop-down address selector to populate an address entered for the first applicant and subsequent applicants on the form. However, they also wanted the ability to re-use the Sponsor’s address for the first applicant. 

> **P3:** "Many times [the address] would be the same, if you were a family."

### Finding #8: Most participants had reasonable expectations around application processing time and communication but expressed a desire for improvement.

* Most participants expected it would take 4-8 weeks to process their CHAMPVA application. The participants, for the most part, did not expect confirmation or communication of the status.  However, participants overwhelmingly expressed a desire to have more communication from CHAMPVA and to know the status of their application.

> **Pilot:** “I didn’t know how long it was gonna take to get CHAMPVA, and so I completely timed it wrong… My health insurance was due to run out in [November] from TRICARE…. I applied for CHAMPVA finally in October… I realized it was going to take 8 weeks ... .Those expectations matter because I was without health insurance for a month, because I didn’t know upfront how long this process was gonna take.”

### Finding #9: Participants started pursuing CHAMPVA benefits when they or their dependents had a lapse in insurance. They often learned about CHAMPVA  by being close to the VA or through word of mouth.

* Most participants learned about the CHAMPVA program through a close relationship with the VA or communication with other Veterans or their family members. The majority of participants explained their motivation for applying was to provide health insurance to family members after separation or between the time when they stopped working and became eligible for Medicare.
* On a related note, CHAMPVA is not health insurance but is instead a cost-sharing healthcare benefits plan. However, many beneficiaries view it as health insurance. This demonstrates a disconnect between CHAMPVA's actual services and beneficiaries' understanding of those services.

> **P10:** "I wanted to be sure I had insurance."

### Finding #10: The review and sign page generally worked well, though some users were overwhelmed by the amount of information (especially in the “Applicants” section). 

* Participants appreciated the opportunity to review their information and edit it on the same page. Some participants said they’d expand the accordions and review the information they’d put in carefully before submitting. However, others said they were so meticulous when initially entering the information that they wouldn’t feel the need to check again on the summary page.

> **P11:** “That's a lot to look at on one page.”
