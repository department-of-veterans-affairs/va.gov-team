Since those documents aren't mentioned on the PDF version of the form or any of the CHAMPVA page content, we just want to be sure the 1010D requires those forms as part of the submission process. And if so, do they allow submission of any of these third-party forms -- like the alternate signer form,  VA form 2122 or VA Form 2122a.
