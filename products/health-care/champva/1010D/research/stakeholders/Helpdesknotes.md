**Attendees:** Premal, Amanda, Brian G.

**Agenda**
Understand the helpdesk metrics better

Notes:
 - All calls are defaulted to claims as a category.
 - The data given is only for CHAMPVA data, but other programs have a far lower number.
 - 80 percent of claims calls have to do with "where are we on this claim".
 - 20 percent of claims calls have to do with what's wrong with my payment.
 - There is no integration between CXM and CRM 
 - What can we show on VA.gov to reduce claims volume? PPR report is what we need to show on VA.gov. Brian will send a copy of this. EOB is similar to a PPR
  report. 
  - Status updates will also help a lot, right now there is NO  information online forcing everyone to make a call. 
  - Beneficiary claims processing is very difficult. Most of that has to do with the very  strict business requirements.  
  - 60/40 Provider/Beneficiary calls breakdown. 
   - For enrollments and applications, status is also an  important thing. The enrollment team has to check 5 different systems to complete their job. 
   - Due to the manual process of sending letters, applicants will call to get claim status even though a request for OHI has alread been sent.   The call center will actually fill out OHI form on the phone and submit it to the enrollment team clogging up the phone lines. 
  - Is the Medicare card is really required?
