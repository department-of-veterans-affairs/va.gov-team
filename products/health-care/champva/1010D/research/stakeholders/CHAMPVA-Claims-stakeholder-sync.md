## CHAMPVA Claims biweekly stakeholder sync
Every other Wednesday at 2:35pm ET

### 06/23/25

**Attendees:** Angela P., Arleen, Joie, Cindy, Melissa Premal, Andrea, Renata, Jamie, Rachel 

**Agenda**
- Confirm pdi and claim control number format
- Confirm the screener question page and the claim identifying page content
- Check in on volume: tripled in June compared to May

**Notes**
#### PDI’s and Claims Control number

- The claim control is always 12 digits unless it is manually processed by a claims examiner then it will have a “M” followed by 11 digits

- PDI number: Consists of the date,  2 letters, the and the rest of the number are listed on the PDI
For example: 02/26/2025-CM0010031-019-001

- The fax number is the largest. Melissa gave examples of different PDI numbers already:
  - CM = Mail 02/26/2025-CM0010031-019-00
  - VA= [VA.gov](VA.gov) ex: 02/26/2025-VA1753294097390-001
  - PG = email/PEGA Digital Upload : ex of PG 01/16/2025-PG127559-001
  - FX = Fax: 02/26/2025-FX1753274595643601199-001

- Can we shorten these numbers any for an easier UX? CHAMPVA Just needs the 2 letters, the middle number, and the numbers after the dash: Users do not need to include the date in the PDI number


- Is there a consistent amount of digits after the 2 letters? No, it can vary. Each set of letters has a certain amount of digits. Fax and VA won’t change the amount of digits
PG and CM will eventually have more digits as the process more forms

- Premal: Needing users to find and enter the number is very MVP and not the best UX

- PEGA to provide error log so we can detect user data entry problems


#### Confirm the screener question page and the claim identifying page content

- From Engineering: controlling the amount of numbers required via a dropdown selection is difficult

- What if they have a medical and pharmacy? They would go back through the claim resubmission form again for MVP. This is in parity with the original claim submission.

- CHAMPVA thinks the proposed workflow should work well for single claims


- Keep it CVA reopen (bene response) as is. Attachments should be Med Docs

- Cindy changed the way Pega reads, they are just reading the JSON file now
- CHAMVPA wants the same doctype merged (on one line) even its for different claims as long as it’s for the same bene


#### Check in on volume: tripled in June compared to May

- CHAMVPA CLAIMS submissions tripled in June compared to May. Cindy hasn’t reported any issue. Melissa reported an issue that a Claims Examiner has to open each line one by one. They would rather have all of the same doctypes per bene as one document. Michael prefers to have PEGA merge the doctypes

- Premal wants to lock down an MVP. We can make it perfect later. Merging the doc types would be a iteration post MVP and  we would like to have this done for all forms

### 06/11/25

**Attendees:** Angela C., Angela P., Arleen, Joie, Nadia, Amanda, Premal, Andrea, Renata, Jamie, Rachel 

**Agenda**

* Service blueprint: resubmissions and re-opens [(Mural)](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1723309711950/72864bacb39ee1c8cd48f80735b6f6994a72b6ca)

**Notes**

* Jamie sets the expectations that we will be discussing a single form to a single date of service, rather than a shoebox or bulk claim submission
   * Resubmission flow has 3 options:
       * Duty to Assist (DTA marked off on sendback letter)
       * If PDI# provided → Claim checked again 
       * If PDI# not provided → sent to R&R
   * If claim is processed:
    * EOB and payment generated
    * EOB and no payment generated

**Questions from IVC team:**

**Resubmissions**
   * The send back letter from the claims unit will specifically identify what is missing to open and process the claim. If it's an EOB from the primary insurance provider, that's indicated as well. 

**Re-opens**
* When an EOB is sent out with missing items or a claim denial, what draws the line between a beneficiary reopen a claim, or needing to go to the appeals process
    * For Re-opens (missing items): they can resubmit with just the missing items
    * For an Appeal: needs to be denial for an appealable reason (timely filing, not a covered service or benefit). Just missing an item or document is not an appealable denial
* Does the EOB denote something that can be re-opened or an appeal?
    * It does not, it will just give a reasoning/remark code for what's missing. 
    * Either way, the bene will need to call in to get more information about the EOB remarks codes 
* When you send back an EOB, is there a letter sent with the EOB?
    * There's a denial letter, but it's not for an upfront rejection of a claim like basic missing information. It's only for reasons that can be appealed (reasons for why the claim was denied and what to do next). A basic denial would just include the remarks codes on the EOB. 
* For re-opens, are benes calling the call center to understand the reasons on the EOB for denial or missing information?
    * They are calling the call center for clarification
* What system are call center staff looking in for the EOB denial status?
    * Newer claims: CXM
        * These codes are much less detailed (ex. 16 = claim lacks information)
    * Older claims: CP&E
        * These codes are much more detailed (ex. 391 = missing diagnosis code)


**OHI**
* Health insurance: if someone previously without OHI (did not submit OHI at time of enrollment) and now have insurance at the time of filing a claim -- is there a point where you have to ask the beneficiary to reimburse CHAMPVA because something was paid out by their insurance provider?
    * Sort of. A scenario: the bene didn't have OHI at time of enrollment. We process their claims, we pay as primary because the system denotes no insurance. They submit a second claim comes in with a primary OHI/EOB, CHAMPVA will flag the OHI in the system to "questionable" and they will receive an EOB with a remark code (22) saying there's a discrepancy, asking the bene to submit the OHI certificate. Once the OHI is processed, they will ask the bene's provider to pay back to recoup the costs (whomever CHAMPVA paid out to). 
    * Joie will need to think about whether there are instances where the bene directly has to pay back CHAMPVA, rather than the provider/insurance company 
* If someone sends in a paper form without insurance info (for a CHAMPVA claim). Does that result in a send back letter, or do you just send the OHI cert to them?
    * We would process the claim and let the system to adjudicate 
    * No send back letter. The EOB would indicate we're missing the coordination of benefits from the insurance provider. No payment is initiated since our record says they have a primary insurance.

***Note about terminology***
* "Partially processed" is when we receive multiple claims and multiple dates of services in a batch underneath the same claim form, and we only process part of the batch. 


### 05/28/25
**Attendees:** Amanda, Angela P., Joie, Melissa J., Andrea, Jamie, Renata, Rachel P.

**Agenda**

* Claims resubmission/re-open walkthrough

### Notes
**Note from Renata:** This is explicitly a claim re-open walkthrough. Some of the questions and information in the walk through apply to a resubmission (when a beneficiary receives a send back letter), but it is clear from the call that the way a resubmit and a re-open are handled in the system are different. It is important not to conflate the two. 


1. In CXM, when you look up a beneficiary by claim number, the UI populates some notes on the claim:
> - M = manual submission 
> - Remarks/notes includes the claims number, the original documents that are sent in, and notes about what is missing.
> - When diagnostic codes are missing, it populates as ZZZZZZZZZZ in the claim. It also says “disallowed.”

2. Once found, transfers the claim and reopens it (transfers it to medical claims processing). 
- When re-opened, it creates a new claim number: an initial claim and the re-open will have similar claim numbers, separated by the last digit (ex. #########0, #########1)

Q: If someone gives you a partial ID, are you able to look up the claim? For example, just 10 digits of the claim number?

A: yes, but it will only give you the general claim (asks if you want to run a query with sub-10 digits)

Q: If we asked beneficiaries to send in just the first 10 digits of the claim number, is that enough?

A: Yes, it will populate results that show every claim that’s been worked on in that packet. A full Claim number or PDI# would be best, but the first 10 should let us narrow it down to a couple of claims or the only claim number. It really depends on how the claim was created.

> - Note: easier to reopen a claim if a beneficiary doesn’t have other health insurance. You just have to verify the information that was already input in the system against what the beneficiary resubmits. 

3. There’s really not a lot to the reopens. The CHAMPVA EOB (sent out via CXM) doesn’t say if it’s missing a DX code or CPT. In some cases the beneficiary calls the call center and the rep can identify what’s missing from the form. 

Q: Do beneficiaries call often to request this information?

A: We don’t have data on that. From our assumption, they’re going to call. The remarks code is very vague, it’s not clear.

Q: From a beneficiary’s standpoint, is there any difference between the EOB with the re-open instructions, or the sendback letter asking them to resubmit?

A: The re-opens, the beneficiary receives that EOB. The resubmission, it’s the sendback letter. There’s a couple of different cases to consider: 
> - Partially submitted (Sendback letter, no EOB sent)
> - Partially processed (EOB is sent, possibly after a sendback letter)
> - A beneficiary could possibly receive both a sendback letter and an EOB, based on what they submitted initially.



Q: What is the minimum amount of information needed from the beneficiary to find their past claim or prior submission (name/address/sponsor info/etc.)?

A: It depends. If they submit their SSN, that’s going to be very helpful to find all of their information. If they provide their SSN and a couple of pieces of documentation, it will be hard to find what was previously submitted and match those two submissions up. Typically the following “should” be enough:

> * Bene name
> * SSN
> * PDI/Batch/Claim
> * Provider name, date of service
> 
> If it’s a full send back, meaning nothing/next to nothing was submitted with the initial claim, it’s essential that they provide the PDI number. It would otherwise be a needle in a haystack to marry them together. Provider name/date of service wouldn’t be enough. 

**Reminder:** With a sendback, nothing has been processed and there’s nothing to marry together. The initial claim is submitted but not open.  **FYI - being changed to Batch from PDI, team needs to keep language in form consistent with the sendback letter.**

Questions from CHAMPVA Claims team for IVC:
Q: If the PDI/batch number doesn’t help marrying submissions up, then what’s the point of asking for it?

A: It depends on what department it goes to. 

Q: When beneficiaries are submitting documents, are they told to submit med docs or any supporting docs separately? How does this work online?

A: Right now they pick if it’s a medical or pharmacy claim first, and depending on what they select, they’ll be prompted to upload specific paperwork (EOB, itemized bill, pharmacy receipt). It’s asked on separate screens.

Q: Would they need to individually upload each document separately?


**IVC team AI:** Check with engineers and let CHAMPVA folks know
All docs of the same type can be uploaded in a single file - is there a way to let users know?

## 05/22/25

**Attendees:** Andrea, Jamie, Renata, Mike, Angela P, Melissa, Joie

### Notes:
[Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1742221275311/1794184f6793a8f3f1a91a54447817403dc39fec) 

IVC identified different types of claims based on past conversations emails: new claim, open claims, existing claim (with missing info), re-opened claim 

A claims submission is a **new claim** 

**Partially processed** claims result in a sendback

* Once a bene provides missing info is there a different term that is used? From Mellssa: An example would be if a bene sent in 2 documents with dates of services at the same time that would count as 2 claims. If only one of those claims can be processed it would result in a partially processed claim. 
* It happens a lot that there are multiple claims within one claim submission that the bene sends. Some benes might submit claims on a monthly basis. 
* It will be considered partially processed if one claim in the packet is missing something.
* A partially processed claim is when some of the claims in the packet were processed.
* If a bene sends in 5 pages and only four were able to get processed, page 5 is going to be a sendback. 
* There are times that they can process a claim with multiple missing items and the system will reject it and create an EOB. 
* CHAMPVA will create a sendback when a claim has two or more missing pieces
* It would be entered in the system and there was placeholder information that was entered in because they were missing info they would have to reopen the claim. 
* Anything complete will be processed, anything incomplete will be sent back (but if user submitted multiple claims, it's not stopping processing for the entire submission)

Renata reviewed current claims form (without online resubmission)
Is there a better term to use rather than “resubmission”? Melissa noted that the sendback letter calls it a “resubmission”. 

**Reopened claims** occurs when the sendback letter and missing items are received 
If some of claim info is the system and it is just missing codes CHAMPVA will reopen the claim 

The current online claim forms suggest only submitting one claim (date of service) at a time.

* Bene are sending multiple claims on the digital form despite it stating to only submit one at a time
* Just as long as the group of visits (dates of service) has the same provider and DX code it can be put in the system as one claim. 
* If the date spans across 2 calendar years CHAMPVA will break it into the 2 claims in the system
* In the case of multiple visits per claim users should enter the first date service if they are asked for it. 
* If a bene submitted for multiple services each claim will get their own unique ID unless they are all by the same provider and the same DX. 
* CHAMPVA has seen both RX and Medical claims come through in the same online form submission. 

**A resubmission** is resubmitting or adding additional info to a claim 

**Reopened claim** was partially processed and has its own claims number and CHAMPVA EOB

IVC is working on document info verification so it could detect if there is any missing info on the file upload. We would need users to upload each doc separately for this to work properly. 
CHAMPVA will do a demo of a rebsubmission/Reopen next week 5-28-25 

We still need to ask: 

* Do they need the address and contact info again for resubmission?
* How do they match it back to original resubmission? Can we see a demo of a resubmission? Pega may be able to to do most of the heavy lifting on matching up the claims and resubs
* Does the timeline differ for new claims, resubmits and reopens? 
* What  we are some things that can be missing be won’t result in a sendback or reopen 


## 05/14/25 

**Attendees:** Andrea, Jamie, Rachel P., Renata, Mike, Katrina, Erick, Angela P., Elizabeth, Arleen, Premal, Amanda

**Agenda**
* CHAMPVA Claims Resubmissions
* Backlog queues
* Any new sendbacks data (not addressed, ask over email)

### Notes

**CHAMPVA Claims Resubmissions**

* Jamie walks through the simple resubmission mocks
    * Claims folks note that PDI numbers aren't being used anymore, been replaced with the batch number (DATE + an 8 digit code = XX/XX/XXXX-VA111111-001-001)...but as a business rule the letter just includes the VA111111 instead of the rest of the code to make it less complicated
    * Angela P. notes that CHAMPVA needs to change the language on the letter from PDI to batch number
* Complex resubmission mock walkthrough
    * No feedback from CHAMPVA
* Q: Has CHAMPVA claims noticed multiple sendbacks for a single claim happening regularly?
    * It depends. As benes get savvier, they get more accurate. The first few claims can be the least accurate. 
    * Likelihood of multiple sendbacks occurs the more things we're asking them to provide. 
    * CHAMPVA concerned that this shouldn't be designed in too detailed and become a blocker to resubmission. 
    * Benes can request Duty to Assist when filing claims, which is an obligation to support beneficiaries. Maybe we need to steer more complex resubs in the direction of DTA rather than through the form. 
* Q: What information is provided on the sendback? Does it say "DX codes" or an explanation of what that is, where it might be found?
    * A: Letters, especially for pharmacy stuff, gives users context about where to locate missing information on paperwork
       * Angela P to show us a sendback letter that's filled out, plus a checklist (double check where that checklist is located)
* Q: we talked at one point about not requiring the number (PDI or batch) in case people lost the letter. Is that still a possibility?
    * If no PDI/batch number, we need their name and the date of service that's listed on the claim, and the doctor you saw.
        * Angela P. notes that if the claim wasn't already open in the system, there'd be nothing to look up and marry the two halves of the claim
    * It's possible when there's a large batch that some were entered into PEGA and others weren't (the ones that required a sendback letter)


**Backlog queues**

* Team is currently trying to understand the backlog queues right now and delays. We've heard some things take 5-7 days and other take 90 days to process. 
    * **CIPM:** all physical mail received goes through CIPM to be scanned. **This is currently a bottleneck.** 
        * Backlog of physical mail in a warehouse that hasn't been scanned in - for bene claims (about 10% bene claims, the rest of it is appeals and eligibility), that backlog should be cleared soon. Note that provider claims aren't sent the warehouse, they're submitted differently.
        * Note that when the backlog of scanning mail gets resolved, CHAMPVA will be temporarily prioritizing processing those claims first and digitally submitted claims processing will slow down for a time, at least until the scanned mail is caught up, and then everything is handled at the same rate (first in/first out)
    * **PEGA:** where digital submissions go. **No backlog of claims**, they're handled almost as soon as they hit the system (resolved within 2 weeks or less). 
        * Eligibility backlog is also in PEGA, was scanned in already. It's backlogged because of insufficient eligibility staff. More staff modernizing the flow has reduced 60% of the time to input the eligibility queue. 
* 10x as many faxes are received than any kind of mail for claims. Since eligibility went live, fax/mail has dropped 60%
    * Resubmits are expensive in terms of time
    * CHAMPVA claims says digitizing that checklist from Angela P. would be great as a simpler claims submission form (note to team: let's look at the checklist again and think it through). 
* FMP works the same way, but it's a different processing group and different backlog (currently has a higher volume of faxes and handwritten forms so it shortens from days/weeks to input information into the databases so they can process faster).


## 04/30/25
**Attendees:** Premal, Amanda, Arleen, Angela C., Angela P., Melissa, Joie, Andrea, Jamie, Rachel P., Renata

**Agenda**

* Content changes for the CHAMPVA claims supporting docs (Rachel P. demo)
* Review mockups of example EOB and itemized bills (Jamie)
* Processing time of resubmissions

### Notes

**CHAMPVA claims supporting docs content changes**

* CHAMPVA feedback:
    * We don’t need both office and billing address for the provider, just the address where the services were rendered (that is specific language to follow)
    * Add NPI (national provider identifier) above Tax ID for the provider. This is a unique 10-digit number that they may need to request specifically (it’s not necessarily automatically listed on the EOB or itemized billing statement)
        * Note: TIN/EIN is for the healthcare company or corporate entity, and the NPI is for the provider as an individual
    * To EOB upload: add HCPCs to the CPT code line
    * Asks for “date of service/care” to be consistent across all pages (DOS = date of service)
* CHAMPVA notes that DX/CPT, TIN and NPI codes are very frequently missing and result in sendbacks.
* Jamie notes that CPT codes are from EOBs missing and there will be a description of the procedure. 
    * CHAMPVA does need the CPT codes
    * As long as either superbill OR EOB has the CPT codes, that’s fine
        * Note: CHAMPVA cannot process a claim based on EOB alone (we need to require both the itemized/superbill and the EOB together)
* CHAMPVA notes that sendback rates are quite high under normal circumstances because specific pharmacies or providers will provide documents missing required information
    * Fill date is often missing from pharmacy claims (this is brand new information for the team, and it’s a required piece of information that CHAMPVA needs)
    * Melissa asks if there’s a way to add a checkbox acknowledging the list of items we’re asking them to upload. Team explains how that button won't really ensure any compliance with reading and acknowledging the material.


**Review mockups of example EOB and itemized bills**

* The goal of these pages is to educate users before they touch the form and submit the claim. This should be reinforced through the content that Rachel demoed.
* CHAMPVA feedback:
    * We can also include a sample pharmacy receipt, will need to do research into what those look like
    * Will be meeting with accessibility and content to confirm whether this design will work
* CHAMPVA feedback
    * EOB tends not to include the NPI, just the itemized bill/superbill


**Processing time of resubmissions**

* What are the timeframes around resubmissions, from initially receiving the claim to when the resub is sent back?
* Draft letter going into Box for leads review - timeline unclear
    * Angela has requested that timeline from initial claims leads and supervisors and will get back to us.
    * Note about process: currently these letters are being printed onsite, but soon they will be printed and mailed out by a vendor, which will speed up processing times
        * Also, Box (a cloud-based storage system) is a temporary solution but no timeline on replacement
* Is CHAMPVA considering email or digital versions of the sendback letter?
    * Angela P. says that they currently use emails through Box on appeals, but there’s urgency to digitize notifications at this time
* When someone receives a sendback letter for their claim and they want to send the superbill, when it is mailed to and received by VA, how does CHAMPVA know it’s a resub? Is it mailed to the same address as initial claims?
    * It gets scanned in by review & resolution team (R&R) and then walked through
    * Resubmissions are sent to the same address as initial claims, but sent to the R&R team to find the initial submission and marry the two together, using the PDI. 
    * The sendback letter asks users to submit the sendback letter with the additional supporting docs
    * If the claim is still missing documents, R&R team will draft another sendback
    * 30 days to process the resub from the date it's scanned is the goal for reopening and reprocessing claims (closer to 45 days right now).
        * As of today: working through January resubs

## 04/16/25
**Attendees:** Angela C., Elizabeth L., Erick, Angela D., Melissa, Arleen, Joie, Jina, Andrea, Mike C., Mike M., Jamie, Rachel P., Renata

**Agenda**

-   Updates on the CHAMPVA Claims staged launch
-   Review any questions that have come up from claims submissions

**CHAMPVA Claims updates**

-   Currently holding at 25% in production
-   So far there’s been 5 claims submissions - identified some concerns and want to address those with everyone on the call, and if able to address, then move to 50% in prod before EOD today
**Questions to address before increasing to 50%**

-   Q: Right now the health insurance policy number and phone number are optional fields, not required. Is that a problem or should we make that field required?
    -   **A: Leave as-is policy/phone number, not required**
-   Q: Signer relationship to patient is optional; if anyone other than sponsor is filling out the form, we’re not asking what that relationship is. Do we want to prefill “Sponsor” or ask more detailed information about the relationship between sponsor-bene? Does that relationship matter?
    -   A: The relationship to patient field isn’t really used at all on the backend but we’re assuming it’s a sponsor/parent filling out the form for the bene/child. **Leave as optional**
-   Q (from IVC team): In prior research that a parent can sign for a child for a claim no POA required, but a sponsor can’t sign for another spouse. Do we need that POA established or relationship established?
    -   This is incorrect, and no information will be released to the sponsor. The EOB will still go to the beneficiary spouse. **Leave as optional**
 
**Discussion about increasing to 50%**

- **Good to increase to 50%**
-   Q (from CHAMPVA): Is there anyone on the website explaining in detail what information is listed when they fill out the claims form?
    -   A: We know that 3 claims were submitted that were missing information like DX codes, etc. IVC team did a side-by-side comparison of what information is on the paper form and the digital form, and these errors could have happened equally with either submission type.
    -   Moving forward: IVC team has identified some subsequent improvements to make to the static/intro pages and pages within the claims form to improve this experience and reduce the likelihood of errors
        -   Mike C adds in we could add in specific document type drop-downs within the claims form (that would transfer to the BE) to help with granularity around the types of documents required
-   Q (from CHAMPVA): Are users asked to upload multiple documents (invoices and EOBs separately) or a single, combined PDF (everything together)
    -   A (from Mike C): We generate a PDF of the form itself and each individual file the user uploaded to support the claim


## **04/02/25**

Attendees: Andrea, Richard, Jamie, Melissa, Amanda, Elizabeth L., Angela P., Rachel, Elizabeth S., Mike, Renata

**Agenda**

-   Claims launch update – new timeline and demo of the new screener question
-   Resubmissions questions
-   OHI questions
-   Updates to the CHAMPVA Claims PDF form


**Early/Resubmissions/Duplicate submissions**

-   IVC team updates: getting a couple of updates into the form prior to initial launch! Walkthrough of the roadmap, what's coming after launch. Current timeline for launch (initial announcement to come in the next few days).
-   Walkthrough the initial launch updates enrollment screener question in Figma (updates for launch)
-   Walkthrough of fast-follow updates in Figma
    -   Additional enrollment info in screener
    -   Resub screener question
        -   Question from CHAMPVA claims partners: If a bene submits a document and they attach 2 of 3 documents they needed to attach - would they get a notice to not submit a resubmission right now?
            -   For the time being, they would be stopped by the resub question, until PEGA is ready to receive resubmissions
            -   CHAMPVA claims has noticed that recently, a bene will fax in an entire document, and they're receiving a duplicate submission or resubmission (if the fax didn't go through) the rest of the documents in a different submission under a different PDI number.
            -   IVC team also notes there's a submission confirmation page to help with any uncertainty around a claim going through, and this should minimize duplicate submissions as best as possible.
    -   Terminology on "I have already submitted my claim but haven't received a letter" accordion: Does the language "explanation of benefits letter" capture denials/resub letters? Is there a blanket term used for all communications from CHAMPVA claims?
        -   EOB corresponds to approvals/denials, Send back letter is for resubmissions
        -   AI: Update content corresponding to CHAMPVA claims letters and notify C/IA team


**Online claims resubmissions next steps**

-   Send back letter directs benes to submit online. What is the process like to update that letter to correspond to filing resubs online?
    -   CHAMPVA claims team says updating the send back letters, it would take 1-2 weeks to update that information. "More or less instantaneous"
    -   AI: IVC team to coordinate launch of resubmissions online with CHAMPVA Claims partners to make sure the letters notify benes of the online resub option.


**OHI questions**

-   Do we need the effective date as a separate question on the online form if we are still uploading the cards?
    -   It's possible to transfer that metadata in PEGA so that it's automatic. Having that data field filled out is used downstream, so having it populated is preferable.
-   What would happen if we completely remove the the insurance policy and insurance provider phone number? That is an optional field, and users have gotten stuck on that question in testing the online form.
    -   Same as effective date - useful to have at the time of filing, but we'll fill it in if it's not included.
-   Question from CHAMPVA claims: is OHI form live?
    -   IVC team: confirmed, it's live. Quick mention of in-progress integration work between the 10-10d and the OHI Cert


**Updates to the CHAMPVA Claims PDF form**

-   See the copy [Premal shared in Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05UDS77ZPH/p1743529863836499) 4/1/25
    -   PDF contains _desired_ changes, not set in stone. There is no launch date announced.
    -   AI: IVC team to review PDF (Jamie started an initial review) to capture any changes we need to add to the backlog. The goal is to keep parity with the PDF form.
