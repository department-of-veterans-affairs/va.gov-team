# Stakeholder Interview Methodology: Form 10-10D

## Research Goals:

* Inform the service blueprint and user journey map artifacts.
* Clarify eligibility and flow questions.
* Identify known pain points and opportunities for improvement that the digital form could positively impact.
* Identify gaps in knowledge and communication that the digital form could positively impact.
* Identify KPIs/OKRs and define the success of digitization from a stakeholder perspective.

## Extended Methodology

Potential Participants will be identified at the upcoming stakeholder meet-and-greet. Participants for this methodology will include individuals working with IVC who process the form and/or oversee the CHAMPVA program. Participants will be scheduled through **Microsoft Teams **to attend a 1hr interview session on **Microsoft Teams**. Participants will be asked in advance if they are comfortable using their webcam during the interview, having observers and note-takers in the call, and with the interview being recorded. In addition, the participants will be asked in advance if they have access needs or accommodation requests that would make the interview more comfortable for them. 

Facilitators and note-takers will arrive 10 minutes early to ensure the environment is properly prepared to conduct the interview, record the video, and take notes (checklist potentially incoming for this). A thread will be created in the **DSVA Slack - IVC Forms Interviews** channel with the naming convention **“Participant #1, Dec 1, 2023 - Feedback Backchannel Thread”** to enable communication between the observers and facilitator. Upon arrival, the facilitator will greet the participant; all other attendees will have cameras off and microphones muted. The facilitator will explain that the other attendees will observe and take notes as previously disclosed and will not interact with them. The facilitator will let the participant know they are starting the recording, clarify that they are looking for honest feedback, and reassure the participant that no feelings will be hurt and that none of the information shared will be used against them in any way. We will also inform them that their identities will be anonymized/

Once the interview starts, the note-taking team will be split into two areas of responsibility. Half of the note-takers will be responsible for gathering high-impact verbatim comments from the participant. The other half will be responsible for behavioral observations, focusing on reactions, tone, and body language in response to certain questions or at different points as they provide their answers. Upon completion of the interview, the participant will be thanked for their time and allowed to leave the call. If the interview ends early, the facilitator may ask the participant if they can open the floor for questions from observers. At this time, the observers can turn on their cameras and raise their hands to ask questions. The Q&A session will end 2 minutes before the agreed-upon meeting end time; be respectful of the participant’s time. All of the notes will be compiled in **[Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/stevenstrailytest5138/m/stevenstrailytest5138/1701453074192/73db28fc927a5425c11be118fc6a8d4cf579b75e?sender=u460f68c2fcb9586caed08329)** within 2 hours of the conclusion of the interview; please allow yourself time to process and transfer the notes while everything is still fresh in your mind. Analysis will take place after all interviews are complete so as not to bias future interviews.
