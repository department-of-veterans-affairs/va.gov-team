# Form 10-10D Questions for Stakeholders

## For Platform Content team

### Eligibility

1. ~~If the person filling out the form is applying for CHAMPVA benefits for more than one person, should we take the person filling out the form through the eligibility flow for each individual?~~
2. If an applicant(s) has another form of healthcare, they will have to fill out Form 10-7959c as part of their CHAMPVA application. Can/should we embed it here as part of the application process? Or is there a reason it should stay totally separate? _(Our recommendation would be to do this, as it will create a better user experience.)_

#### Spouses

3. ~~If a sponsor’s former spouse remarried before 55 but then the remarriage ended, are they eligible for CHAMPVA again after age 55?~~
4. ~~Are spouses who are 65+ years old and turned 65 BEFORE June 5, 2001 **always** eligible for CHAMPVA if they’re enrolled in Medicare Part B? What if they’ve remarried?~~
5. ~~Are spouses who are 65+ years old and turned 65 AFTER June 5, 2001 **always** eligible for CHAMPVA if they’re eligible for Medicare? What if they are eligible but haven’t enrolled? What if they’ve remarried?~~
6. ~~Is a former spouse eligible for CHAMPVA if the Veteran has remarried, but they have not?~~
7. Are folks who were in long-term domestic partnerships with a sponsor eligible for CHAMPVA if they were not legally married? 
    1. If yes, does it have to be a romantic partnership? 
    2. If no, are there any other programs they might be eligible for that we could send them to?

#### Children

8. ~~If a Veteran claimed a child who is currently between the ages of 18 - 23 as a dependent **AND** that child is enrolled in college or another educational institution **BUT **the Veteran has died, is the child eligible for CHAMPVA?~~

#### Family caretakers

9. ~~If a family caretaker doesn’t know if they are entitled to care or services through another health plan, where should we send them?~~
10. ~~If the family caretaker might qualify for the Program of Assistance for Family Caretakers (PAFC) but they aren’t sure, can we embed that eligibility into this flow? Or is there a reason they should remain separate?~~
11. ~~If a family caretaker qualifies for the PAFC does that mean they are not eligible for CHAMPVA? Or can they have both?~~

### Section 1: Sponsor information

12. How should we define "sponsor"? Someone doing this for the first time might not know what it is. Should we just use the word “Veteran” instead?
13. What is a Veteran’s File number (Claim number) is, and how can an applicant find it
14. What if the person filling out the application doesn’t know the Veteran’s address? 
    3. What if the Veteran does not have an address? 
    4. What if the Veteran is deceased?
15. If the sponsor was never married to the applicant (e.g., the applicant is the Veteran’s child or a family caretaker), is it still useful to ask for the sponsor’s date of marriage?

### Section 3: Certification

16. The certification language is pretty dense. Can you help us simplify this language? How and where do you recommend including the legal language?

### Supplementary documentation

17. If users have supplementary documents (e.g., VBA rating decision, Medicare card) can we have them upload it during this flow?
18. Can we embed this Standard Form 180 (request for Veteran’s DD214) here? 
    5. Submitting the form doesn’t offer immediate results, so what should we do if they want to submit Form 10-10D and then upload DD214 later? 
    6. Will the applicant have an account so they can log back in and submit it after they’ve sent off the form? 
    7. Alternatively, should we tell the applicant to hold off if they want to submit the DD214 but don't have it yet?

## For IVC Team

### General

19. Who fills out this form? Do you have a rough statistical breakdown of respondents?
20. Do you have a rough idea of the average processing time?
21. What systems does this information get entered to?
22. Could you provide us with a high-level overview of the form’s processing, from IVC’s first touchpoint to the last? A few words to describe each step would be sufficient; we don’t want to go into too much detail at this point.
23. Who is responsible for different touchpoints in the form’s processing, and can we schedule time with them?
24. What is the history of 1010D; how and why was the CHAMPVA program originally started?
25. Do you have success metrics within the team regarding 1010D? What are they?
26. Which of these data is **most** important for you in processing an application? Why?
27. Which of these data is **least** important for you in processing an application? Why?

### Eligibility

28. ~~Applicants age 55 and over will need to be enrolled in, or at least eligible for, Medicare to receive CHAMPVA benefits. If the applicant doesn’t know if they’re eligible for Medicare,  should we embed a check or Medicare application as part of this flow? Or is there a reason we shouldn’t do that?~~
29. Does answering “yes” to more than one eligibility question, or yes to different kinds of questions, change the level of coverage? Examples (not exhaustive):
    8. Is a sponsor’s child eligible for a different level of CHAMPVA benefits than a spouse or caretaker?
    9. Provided an applicant is otherwise eligible, does the applicant’s age change the level of benefits they can receive?

### Section 1: Sponsor information

30. How is “date of death” used?
31. How is “did the Veteran die during service” used?

### Section 2: Applicant information

32. Is there a limit to the number of applicants under one sponsor?
33. ~~Can children of sponsors apply for their newborns? Does the answer differ depending on if the child is over or under 18?~~
    10. ~~Or can only spouses apply for newborns?~~
    11. ~~What if the sponsor and their unmarried partner are expecting a child - can they still apply for the newborn?~~
    12. ~~Can an unmarried partner apply for benefits for themselves, or only their child?~~
34. It seems like only people with certain relationships to the Veteran are eligible: spouses, children, and family caretakers. Are there any other relationships that might make a person eligible for CHAMPVA?
35. How is the applicant’s email address used?
    13. What if they don’t have one?
36. How is the applicant’s phone number used?
    14. What if they don’t have one?
37. How is the applicant’s gender used?

## For later user interviews

### General

38. Will users be logged in when they complete this form? Is there an authenticated state and an unauthenticated state?
    15. If they are not logged in during the eligibility flow, and then want to log in to apply, can we save their answers so they don’t have to do it again?

### Eligibility

39. ~~Can we include questions to see if users qualify for TRICARE as part of this form? Or is it best to send them over to TRICARE to figure that out?~~
    16. ~~If based on the answers to eligibility questions we think the user might qualify for TRICARE, should we even let them continue this form before they find out? Or should we force a “yes” or “no” answer?~~

### Section 1: Sponsor information

40. If we have access to the Veteran’s SSN and/or file number, can we prefill most (if not all) of this information for them?

## Notes
Questions that are struck through are no longer relevant and will not play into design considerations.
