**3/18/25 CHAMPVA stakeholder call**
------------------------------------

### **Agenda**

-   Review how contact information and addresses are used for the signer, sponsor and applicants
-   Review questions about supporting documents
-   Review how duplication ChampVA applications will affect the backlog

### **Contact information**

-   Background: there are 3 user types who can fill out the 10-10d -- the sponsor (Veteran), the beneficiary, and the signer (possibly a parent/caregiver who is not the Veteran, or a third party like an accredited representative/VSO)

|\
 | **Signer**\
 | **Sponsor (Veteran)**\
 |
| **Mailing address**\
 | We want basic information on the Signer to verify who they are, will not be sending them anything through the mail, especially if they're a third party representative\
 | Traditionally that would be if there was information that was for the Veteran-only. With the digital experience that doesn't really apply anymore.\
We aren't going to contact them, but we build a sponsor profile and that information is needed to verify the sponsor (sponsor profile is built first and then a beneficiary file underneath).\
 |
| **Email**\
 | Only reason we might contact the signer is if the application is incomplete or the applicants are incapacitated but that gets into POA stuff.\

**Signer**

-   Are we going to ask signers for proof of POA or similar? POA might be on file in VBMS, but these are brand new applicants whose POA isn't established in VBMS we're not able to take action on the application until receipt of POA.

-   Unclear if ChampVA would reach out to the signer to request proof of POA if that wasn't found in VBMS.
-   Current process is just to review to make sure there's a signature on the 10-10d at all (no current process to confirm POA).

-   What happens if an application isn't signed? Do you contact the Signer to complete?

-   If an application isn't signed, there's part of a VistA flow where you mark "not signed" and a CCL letter is generated to send back. But the application is otherwise processed.
-   "It needs to be input like you normally would and then instead of updating them (P&T/PR) then you will send a CCL letter (CCL-B59-if an OHI cert isn't signed we need a CCL-A55)"\
**Action Items**

-   Determine if proof of POA is a showstopper and whether we need to revisit adding proof of power of attorney/power of representation and make that a gate on the digital form so signers can't proceed without proof.

-   ChampVA doesn't have numbers on how big of an issue this is (can we request this post-meeting)
-   Mocks were already made previously

-   Update service blueprint around unsigned application
-   Content updates

-   Update content on Signer mailing address screen
-   On signer email/phone number screen: "we use this information to contact you if we have more questions." this copy is wrong. ChampVA does not call, email or contact the Signer about the application, they contact the Beneficiary via letters.

-   In instances where the address/contact information is not the same between the signer and Veteran/beneficiary, the mail goes to the beneficiary's address
-   It sounds like there's an end goal on the ChampVA side to use email/contact info as a reachout process, but that's not going to happen until the backlog is moved through and ChampVA is transitioned off VistA to their new system.
