# Product Outline: Form 10-10d CHAMPVA Benefits Application

## Overview
Under the [IDEA Act](https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/), all user facing forms need to be digitized. Form 10-10d is the application for CHAMPVA benefits for the spouse or child of a Veteran with disabilities or the surviving spouse or child of a Veteran who has died. 

## Problem Statement
Veterans and family members of Veterans must currently download and fill out the PDF and then mail it in for processing. They need an easy way to access and complete the forms digitally.

- How might we make it easier for family members and beneficiaries to apply for and receive benefits?
- How might we improve the experience of family members and beneficiaries applying for benefits online?

 
## Desired User Outcomes

1. Veterans and family members can easily find the form they are looking for on VA.gov. 
2. Veterans and family members can complete and digitally submit the forms they are looking for on VA.gov. 
3. Veterans and family members can upload applicable documents related to their form submission to VA.gov and include the attachments in their submission. 
4. Each form has an appropriate digital experience that is accessible, user-friendly, uses plain language in accordance with VA.govâ€™s content style guide.
5. Veterans and family members receive a notification letting them know their form was successfully submitted or not. 

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion around online application process and steps
- Application takes longer to fill out online than the PDF form
- Uncertainty around personal information being submitted online


## Desired Business Outcomes

1. Provide an experience similar to that provided to Veterans on VA.gov for family members and beneficiaries. 
2. Expedite the application process for these three programs by digitizing forms. 
3. Reduce number of paper forms mailed and faxed. 

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Increase in number of incomplete or incorrect applications
- Lack of awareness in Veteran community around ability to fill out application online
- Online information not being transferred successfully for processing
