|2||General|Which phone numbers (Signer’s, sponsors and applicants phone numbers ) are required for fulfilling benefits?|||||
|3||General|Should we rearrange the content to clarify the instance of a spouse, child or caretaker applying that is also a Veteran. The Sponsor/ Veteran language may need to be retooled. How common is this situation?|||
|4||Certification|Who determines the respondent's burden time? Now that we are moving to a digital format with file upload the current time list on the form (15 minutes) will probably change|||
|5||Sponsor|Is the VBA rating decision and the  DD214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) required?  If an applicant does not submit these docs, does this significantly increase the processing time or can the applicant skip these 2 doc uploads without little impact/ delay?|||
|6||Sponsor|If a non-Veteran applicant doesn’t know where to find the VBA rating for their sponsor, how do they find a copy of it?|||

|8||Sponsor|What is the purpose of the sponsor’s address information (so we can explain to users)?|||

|10||Applicants|Are there any supporting docs needed for caretakers to upload for CHAMPVA enrollment?|||
|11|yes|Applicants|Is there or should we put a limit on how many applicants can be added to the digital form. Syd and I asked the VFF team but it seems like this is unique to the services we are using on the 1010d. (Central Mail vs Box)||limit to 3 for now|
|12||Applicants|The requirements for the School Certs are very strict based on the current state of the form. It states that a letter or a form must be submitted and sent by the school to VA. This of course will blow up the file upload experience. Are the stakeholders willing to update this process to allow for the applicant to submit it. What types of documents will they take or not?|||

|18||Certification|There may be use case where the signer is a Veteran and does not provide an address/phone number.

If it is, how can we work around this for folks experiencing homelessness?|||
|19||Certification|We accommodate potential houselessness for the Veteran/Sponsor, but not for applicants or a third party signer (e.g, a VSO). Can we shift to accommodate that on our form, as well?|||
