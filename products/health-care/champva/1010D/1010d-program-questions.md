|Number|Complete?|Form Section|Question|Blocking Testing?|Blocking for Production (1=must)|Answer|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Yes|General|Which addresses (Signer’s, sponsors and applicants addresses) are required for fulfilling benefits?|No|Yes (1)|From Luke, all are required|
|2|Yes|General|Which phone numbers (Signer’s, sponsors and applicants phone numbers ) are required for fulfilling benefits?|No|Yes (1)|From Luke, all are required||
|3|Yes|General|Should we rearrange the content to clarify the instance of a spouse, child or caretaker applying that is also a Veteran. The Sponsor/ Veteran language may need to be retooled. How common is this situation?|No|No|This is answered we are adding the VA Claim number and calling the Veteran Sponsor (Sponsor and using a sponsor and the applicant's names in the questions|
|4|Yes|General|Who determines the respondent's burden time? Now that we are moving to a digital format with file upload the current time list on the form (15 minutes) will probably change|No|No|The form owner at [OIRA](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/) would make these changes (can remind stakeholders about it).| 
|5|Yes|General|When VA receives supplemental docs in the mail separate from an application, how do they link that doc with the correct application (i.e. is there a cover page or something?)|No|Yes (1)|See https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/1010D/research/stakeholders/Stakeholder-1010D-Supporting-Doc-Questions.md for specifics on supporting docs. Stakeholder said we need the applicant’s name and confirmation number on each page of the document |
|6|Yes|Sponsor|Is the VBA rating decision and the  DD214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) required?  If an applicant does not submit these docs, does this significantly increase the processing time or can the applicant skip these 2 doc uploads without little impact/ delay?|No|Yes (1)|From Luke: This is looked up during processing, not a significant delay|
|7|Yes|Sponsor|If a non-Veteran applicant doesn’t know where to find the VBA rating for their sponsor, how do they find a copy of it?|No|Yes|Based [the only info I could find](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/shshr4/who_can_look_up_my_va_disability_information/), the only ways someone who isn't a Veteran can get the information are if they are given power of attorney by the Veteran or if the Veteran has already sent a letter releasing that information to the person. With this is mind, I don't think there is really anything we can do here.|
|8|Yes|Sponsor|What is the purpose of the sponsor’s address and phone number information (so we can explain to users)?|No|No|Check the 1010EZ, if it's on it, copy it. If not leave it off. We can also put recommendation to add content|
|9|Yes|Applicants|Can we confirm if caretakers are still eligible? There seems to be conflicting messages among the supporting informational materials for this program where caretakers are not listed as an eligible applicant.|No|Yes|Caretakers would not be filling out the 1010D. If the Primary Family Caregiver is uninsured and wants ChampVA, the Caregiver Stipend Team enrolls them in the ChampVA with Office of Community Care. ChampVA for Caregivers is a little different than ChampVA standard so I don’t think we’d want to overlap. |
|10|Yes|Applicants|Are there any supporting docs needed for caretakers to upload for CHAMPVA enrollment?|No|Yes|See above question/answer|
|11|Yes|Applicants|Is there or should we put a limit on how many applicants can be added to the digital form. Syd and I asked the VFF team but it seems like this is unique to the services we are using on the 1010d. (Central Mail vs Box)|No|Yes|we can limit it to 12 for looking into the techincal limitations |
|12|Yes|Applicants|The requirements for the School Certs are very strict based on the current state of the form. It states that a letter or a form must be submitted and sent by the school to VA. This of course will blow up the file upload experience. Are the stakeholders willing to update this process to allow for the applicant to submit it. What types of documents will they take or not?|No, we will need to address the file upload this with stakeholders but this is deemed neccessary for the digital form. We need to know what types of documents they will accept as well for production |Yes (1)|Yes, we can have applicants upload the school cert. They would need to have the form filled out by the school, a letter for school on school letterhead or an acceptence letter|
|13|Yes|Applicants|Is the school certification only required for children of the sponsor?|No|No|It's only for dependents|
|14|Yes|Applicants|Would civil union documents be accepted as proof of marriage supporting document?|No|Yes|Yes, Civil Unions (as long as their state acknowledges it)  and Common Law Marriages are eligible. We can ask that they upload the Civil Union Papers or affitdavit of common law marriage but it's not neccessary unless they is an "unusual" situations such as remarriage with step children|
|15|Yes|Third-party Signer|Do users need to submit third party signer/power of attorney supporting documents with their 1010D form? Since those documents aren't mentioned on the PDF version of the form or any of the CHAMPVA page content, we just want to be sure the 1010D  requires those forms as part of the submission process. And if so, do they allow submission of any of these third-party forms -- like the alternate signer form,  VA form 2122 or VA Form 2122a.|No|Yes|Stakeholders were unaware of the the the alt signer forms. As of now they don't ask for any additional forms to be filed by Alt signers or additional docs to be uploaded.  <br> Update 3-19-24: If you include a POA as an optional form and state if you do not have a POA in with the VBA please attach one with your 10 10 D application|
|16|Yes|Third-party Signer|Is the phone number and address absolutely required?|No|Yes|Yes, but still want to ask stakeholders to confirm|
|17||Confirmation Page|Would we be able to create a button for an applicant to email a copy of the confirmation page to themselves. We understand that some applicants may want to still mail the documents and we will provide the instructions to do so on the confirmation page.|No|No|This is more of a recommendation/backlog|
|18|Yes|Certification|There may be use case where the signer is a Veteran and does not provide an address/phone number. We want to accommodate folks experiencing homelessness, but also the signer is required to provide an address. as it currently stands. Is the signer having an address a requirement? If it is, how can we work around this for folks experiencing homelessness?|No|No|Continue with established pattern (with the thought that this is something to explore in the future) For now we will test with adding the General Delivery language but Stakholder are looking into to if they will accept that and/or a PO Box|
|19|Yes|Certification|We accommodate potential houselessness for the Veteran/Sponsor, but not for applicants or a third party signer (e.g, a VSO). Can we shift to accommodate that on our form, as well?|No|No|(same as above)|
|20|Yes|Applicants|How does the sponsor death date impact their eligibility for when remarried? In other words, does it matter if the Applicant separated from the sponsor before the sponsor died? Example: [Applicant] was married to the sponsor before or after Sponsor’s death, and did not remarry|No|Yes|If the sponsor and applicant seperated they become ineligbile at midnight when the divorce/ annullment is finalized.|
|21|Yes|Sponsor|If a sponsor died is a death certificate or causualty required? Does CHAMPVA have easy access to the causualty report/ death cert just as they do with the DD214/VBA rating decisions|No|Yes|There's only a small amount of sponsors that fall under "died on active duty" and would need a casualty report. The stakeholders can look it up in VBMS, The consensus was to remove the file upload for this to lessen the applicant's burden|
|22|Yes|Sponsor|If death documents are required what are the acceptable document types? |No|Yes|We will be removing the file upload for the "Died on active duty" questions, See questions 21|
|23|Yes|Applicants| What is the correct term for the Rating Decision for a "Helpless Child"?|No|Yes|It's just called a “Rating Decision Letter”. It may be attached for quicker processing times but not required. Sometimes the rating decision is not in the system yet after an applicant recives the letter so stakegolder agree that we should leave that file upload as optional.|
|24|Yes|Sponsor|If an applicant wants to upload a birth cert to avoid possible delays would a Social Security card work in place? |No|No|No, they need the birth certifcate to verify the birth date. This is going to be an optional document because stakeholders just need a date. They don't usually require a birth cert unless that dates don't seem to align or make sense. They can unless look up most dependents birthdates in VBMS)|
|25|Yes|Applicant|If we removed the gender question from the application would it cause issues for the applicant enrollment process |No|Yes|Stakeholder need the gender to confirm on the eligibility on claims for sex assigned at birth base illnessness (ie., testicalar cancer). Medical claims might be denied if an illness and gender submitted on the form doesnt match up.  Might have to pull policy folks in to see we can completey remove this question but for now we need to include it. We can mostly likely use the "sex assigned at birth" pattern. Stakeholders cannot pull the gender info from DEERS|
|26|Yes|Applicant|What are all of the types of relationships to the sponsor that you and team has seen in the past. Is it just mainly a spouse and/or child? |No|Yes|Stakeholders have only seen spouse, child unless caregiver (or VSO if they are signing the form.  signing the form). If they are a cargiver we can consider giving them some info on how they start this process with the caregiver program. We cna ask CAIA for thier suggestion for this. |
|27|Yes|Signer|How do you use the contact info from the signer? |No|Yes|Usually the individuals get contacted. There may a the case that they need to contact the signer if the applicant is incapaticated and the signer is the Power of Authority.|
|28|Yes|Sponsor|Should the Report of Casualty and be a required doc that is submitted by the Applicant? |No|Yes|No. see line 21 for completed answer. |
|29|Yes|Applicant|We also need to the exact name of the VBA rating decision for Helpless child. |No|Yes|“Rating Decision Letter” see answer 23|
|30|Yes|Signer|Can a family member who is not an official third party or POA sign for an applicant on the enrollment form? Do they need to fill out ant particular form to do so? |no|yes|It would be a family member… maybe a child (or an adult child) would still need to be appointed, only spouses are exempt from that. Only a spouse can fill out for another spouse or child under 23. Anyone else would need a POA|
|31|Yes|Applicant| Can you confirm that this is the form to use to start the process of a family member obtain a "helpless child rating" for a Veteran's child. Does VA require an examination of the child? |no|yes|VBA-21-686c-ARE is only for reporting dependents. That’s the form where they claim dependents (add new spouse, remove, add children, etc). The rating decision process need to start with contacting the regional office. The medical records would be examined… not the child. Rating done by the VBA(only). Done before the age of 18… unless there are special circumstances. This rating is needed for sponsor’s children only, not the sponsor. Premal may have a contact if we need more details on the process. |
|32|New|Applicant| Is there an age requirement to be a Power of Attorney?|no|yes||
