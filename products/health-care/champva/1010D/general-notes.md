- VBA: Veterans Benefits Administration
- VHA: Veterans Health Administration
- VFMP: Veteran and Family Member Program
- VR&E (or Chapter 31): Veteran Readiness and Employment

### Systems/Processes
- AVA: [Ask VA](https://ask.va.gov/) (online service where people can submit questions, concerns, recommendations, and upload documents to VA)
- CMP: Centralized Mail Portal
  - takes documents and routes them to various VBA (Veterans Benefits Administration) teams for processing
- CP&E: Claims Processing and Eligibility
  - Eligibility system where records are stored and decisions are made
- CRM: where tasks/requests from call center are created and tracked/routed
- CXM: health care clearinghouse/database
  - all CHAMPVA,  VFMP, Spina Bifida, Children of Women Vietnam Veterans claims go here
- DAPER: Document and process enabled repository (existing system that will be replaced by PEGA)
- DCDM: Document Control Data Management
- DEERS: Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System 
- EEV: eligibility, enrollment, verification
- PEGA: new document repository and management system that will replace DAPER
  - integration needs to be built still
- PRA: Paperwork Reduction Act
- VBMS: Veteran Benefit Management system
  - case management system for VBA (Veteran's name/phone number/address/Ch 31)
- VES: Veterans enrollment system
  - new enrollment system that won't be ready until sometime in 2025
  - (dev will begin in spring 2024 and plan to complete in spring 2025)
  - VHA version of VBMS
- VIS: Veteran Information System (VBA system)
  - instance of CP&E (where eligibility info is stored, service connected conditions)
- VISTA: Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA)

 
### Key Decisions/Findings
- PEGA integration [decision record](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/ADR-PEGA%20integration%20for%20CHAMPVA.md)
- 2/7/24 - **10-7959f-1 Recommendation** (long term): VBMS and VIS to communicate with each other (and eliminate need for 10-7959f-1 FMP registration form altogether). For now we will focus on digitizing the form.
- 3/7/24 - **Testing**: 10-10d will be done in staging. 10-7959f-1 - user interviews + content to be done with Figma prototype (Looked at UXPin - accessibility concerns, CodePen involves too much coding, Figma is limited - would require VA to update, since Figma is new not a lot of precedent for testing). Going forward would want to do testing in staging (as other teams are doing).
  - [Decision matrix](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1709218659350/85e1a2c931eafd52734bc66235165d15bf08d582?sender=334959bc-2aad-4cce-a6be-76386587a1e8) for prototypes created by Lois. 
- 3/7/24 - **10-7959c Recommendation**: To avoid redundancy, confusion and overlapping information during CHAMPVA enrollment (with OHI) we should consolidate 1010D and 7959c. We will still have a standalone 7959c form to capture any coverage/ address updates.
   - Question for CAIA: How may we solve this problem to best accommodate the PRA?
   - A: Per CAIA, we can make the recommendation since we are following the spirit of PRA - reduce burden time on user.
   - (Lois can help us find the contact in legal - this would go through General Council review).
   - Can we give 2 control numbers on the intro page if we consolidate?
   - expiring forms - need to go through form owner (Laura to provide us more info/point us to slack)
  - additional recommendation for 10-7959c: allow for multiple applicants (improve user experience but handle as separate applications on back end).
- 3/20/24 - **User testing decision**:
    - Get 5 forms to staging as complete as possible 
      - 10-10d: user testing in staging
      - FMP1: user testing with figma prototype
      - 7959c: user testing will be skipped for this one
      - FMP2: user testing will be skipped for this one
      - 7959a: testing may potentially be combined with FMP2, depending on research findings
    - Future testing - get all testing done in staging and then iterate

### Miscellaneous
- New list and loop pattern being worked on by VFF team but not ready to use ('classic' will be used in usability testing as well as staging review and production). 
- Houseless/no address not really an existing pattern for this currently (may revisit this at a later point in time, but not part of initial effort for launch).
