## Overview
10-10d is the application for CHAMPVA benefits. Veterans and family members of Veterans must currently download and fill out the PDF and then mail it in for processing. They need an easy way to access and complete the forms digitally.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans and family members can easily find the form they are looking for on VA.gov.
- Veterans and family members can complete and digitally submit the forms they are looking for on VA.gov.
- Veterans and family members can upload applicable documents related to their form submission to VA.gov and include the attachments in their submission.
- Each form has an appropriate digital experience that is accessible, user-friendly, uses plain language in accordance with VA.govâ€™s content style guide.
- Veterans and family members receive a notification letting them know their form was successfully submitted or not.

## Additional Efforts
- Combine the OHI form with the 10-10d application form to allow users to fill out both at the same time.
