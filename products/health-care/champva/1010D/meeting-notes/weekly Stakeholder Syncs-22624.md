# Meeting with Luke and CHAMPVA stakeholders 2/26/2024
- Talk to Michelle Johnson for further information about Caregiver program. 
  Essentially a caregiver benefits is for friend of the family who is taking care of the veteran becomes caregiving CHAMPVA and has no other health insurance. The vet needs to be P&T in that case.
- The date of marriage, if they get it from an authoritative source, is okay (VBMS or DEERS).
- 99% of the time, they pull up marriage cert information from VBMS.
- Are civil unions eligible (depending on the state)? Same-sex, civil union, and common law (with affidavit) are all accepted. Usually, this information is in VBMS.
- Usually, we need the second date of marriage when they are over 55 to determine eligibility, the termination date of the first marriage as well or if they got divorced. A lot of times, the spouse and the sponsor will get married, become eligible, get divorced, and then get remarried again; we have had that many times.
- If an applicant marries the sponsor, they get divorced, and then the sponsor dies, are they eligible? The benefits end at midnight on the date of divorce, period. If they are seperated but not legally divorced, they should still be a beneficiaries.
- We wanted to know a little more about the criteria for determining helpless children. The child has to be helplessly adjudicated by the VBA; just like the rating decision on a veteran, there will be one on the child, which typically happens before the age of 18. This information usually is in VBMS. If they don't have it, and they say they are a helpless child, they ask for a COA. If they haven't submitted any medicare information, we will ask for that.
- Do you require a birth cert, or is a SSA acceptable? Most of the time, the information is in SHARE (VBA system where we can verify data, echos VBMS) or VBMS; we only request these in case of a discrepancy.
- For adoption papers, we need the decree
- Step children? Go by the same rules as on the marriage.
- The main time we need to see accompanying documents is if things are out of the norm. Sometimes, there can be a conflict where two individuals will cause issues.
- Social Security Administration letter if that person is not eligible for medicare
- Birth certs, marriage certs, that kind of thing; if they fill out the 10-10d correctly, we don't  need any of that.
- School certs, Medicare, and OHI, are primary required.
