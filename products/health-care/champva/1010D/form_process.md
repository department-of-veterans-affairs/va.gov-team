*   [Release Plan]([https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/blob/main/Forms/26-4555/Release%20Plan.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/blob/main/Forms/26-4555/Release%20Plan.md)) sample

*   Incident Response Plan
    *   The application points of contact are listed in the Product Outline linked below. We anticipate that any vulnerabilities etc that are found will follow the same process as any other application on VA.gov in terms of support ticket creation and escalation.
