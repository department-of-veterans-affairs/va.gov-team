# Notes for CHAMPVA Dependents Management Discovery SME Interview
Moderators: Alyssa, Amanda

Participant: Elizabeth L. (IVC, EEV Program Analyst)

## Questions

**1. Could you each tell me about your role and what you do**? 
- I am a PA, program analyst, in Eligibility and Enrollment. Policy is not my wheelhouse with regards to HIPAA, will get you a point of contact. A program analyst helps to analyze worflows in EEV, anything to do with process improvement. We had a huge backlog for applications. PAs have been tasked with training a lot of people in processing applications.
- Also currently, a new system, VES, is coming on board OCT 31. That will completely change how we enroll Veterans and their families. A lot of modernization improvements are coming to fruition. I'm involved with VA.gov. I'm 10 months into this role.
- We have a Tiger team effort, anyone that has bandwith to help with backlog across IVC, training call center folks. I've been training folks outside of call center employees to help with backlog. Call center employees are contact center reps. I can give you a point of contact for them. 

**2. Could one of you (whoever takes calls) walk me through, step-by-step, what you do when you receive a call from a veteran asking for their CHAMPVA application status?**
- I do not take calls. I receive CRMs, from call center, Veteran calls in with life event like a marriage or divorcs or any concern. Contact rep creates a CRM, types in information and is forwarded to EEV if it's related to eligibility. Escalation team would address concerns. Example: Veteran calls in for status on app from a few months ago. Contact center can access PEGA to check on progress on application ETA for processes. This morning we are 35 days backlog, previous was 80 days backlog. Talk to Luke on how contact center rep handles calls, verification, conversation with Veterans and families.
- CRM, is the system that handles all internal requests, call center is main user of CRM. Also includes congressional requests. [showed CRM] Currently have 19K+ open tasks. Leadership decided to deprioritize CRM tasks for all hands on deck for application backlog with the idea that CRMs would naturally decrease when less people call in for status on applications. Avg 320+ new tasks come in daily. They have not been worked for 3 months. The things call center will be able to handle in VES, contact reps will be able to own and solve for open CRM tasks without escalating to EEV. I'm not sure the new process and which tasks will stay with contact reps. Are congressional items pulled out and worked or are those also put on hold for backlog efforts? YES. Front office pulls out congressional tasks and prioritizes them to be worked. Veteran and family have asked their congress member to intervene. Typically for application status. [showed an open task] Congress member is now involved and becomes highest priority.
- There are only two things you can do with an application, eligible or not eligible. Veteran must be CH 35 P&T (permanent and totally disabled) rated, determined by VBA. We pull info from VBA [IBMS system] to verify if eligible. Can not be Tricare eligible.
- If you indicate on app you have other insurance and don't provide ins details, all claims will be denied until OHI is received. CHAMPVA is a secondary insurer if beneficiary has another insurance.
- Most people are calling for application status or claims status.
    
**3. What is most important to beneficiaries when they call for status?** 
- Only serve dependents. We don't process any claims for the Veteran. Luke will be able to tell how many calls are about CHAMPVA claims/apps.
- They want to know where their application is and status of the claim. Digital EOBs are a large request.

**4. How is the following communicated to beneficiaries where the Veteran is now Tricare eligible, reservist becoming active duty?** 
- We don't communicate it. It's a flag in VISTA. System is broken. Future state in VES, will be automatic.
- Will send EEV training for current system. Once additional VES training.
- Training in OCT for VES, 3 days
- Alyssa to attend first day of training to learn new way of working applications

**5. If you had a magic wand for the application status tool, what do you wish was on there?** 
- "So the number one thing, what I would love and that I've recommended is before they're even allowed to submit an application that we go, hey, let's check to see if your Tricare eligible. So then and if they are Tri and it goes and it checks the sit they put in their social and they like and it's like hey, you are Tricare eligible, you need to go this route. And it redirects them to the right thing in the right place where they need to go to deal with Tricare. That would stop like 40% of my ineligible applications right off the bat."
- Pizza tracker and progress dates: app received, app is eligible, A-card (CVA ins card) mailed out to specific address (snowbirds, moved), etc.

**6. What is enough to make a bene happy with status updates?** 
- Once assigned to someone, it's processed within 48 hours. A-card mailed out w/in 10 days.

**7. If someone calls and has not been assigned yet, is there anything that can be done?** 
- They are told how many days out the backlog is and given an estimate of how many more days they can expect their app to be processed. Call center contact reps are not trained (ask Luke) on determining eligibility and have limited capacity.
- Bene cry at times when they become eligible because they now have health ins.
- Pizza tracker: receieved, assigned, adjudicated
- Pending statuses: getting rid of pending reviews in VES, once in VES will track if OHI card is missing
- If denied, show them denial reason and/or provide copy of digital letter.

**8. Once beneficiary submits missing information, do they go to the bottom of the backlog again?** 
- We would have to use the original application date so they can backdate eligibility start date.
- Let's say I submit something in June, and sent in with correct docs in September, for purposes of being reviewed, will I be processed with today's date or the June date? I don't know. I think it's first in first out and Katrina F. will know.
- Future state contact center reps will be able to speak with beneficiaries with one call resolution. Currently EEV processors process apps in the background without calling beneficiary.
