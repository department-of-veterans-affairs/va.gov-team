# Conversation Guide for CHAMPVA Dependents Management Discovery SME Interview
Moderators: Alyssa, Amanda

Participant: Lawrence R. (IVC, Policy)


## Questions

**1. Could you each tell me about your role and what you do?**   
I'm the policy liason. Trying to work out differences, provide oversight when questions on policy comes up. Right now we are all doing overtime and trained on the process to help process applications. I'm in contact with Brian G. for call center topics. I have done 3 years in escalation prior to policy.

**2. Could you walk me through, step-by-step, what you do when you receive a call from a veteran asking for their CHAMPVA application status?**
There is always going to be a verfication process, no matter who is calling they need to be able to verify the veteran. Agent will ask about beneficairy information, even if Veteran is calling in. If doesn't work, will attempt to pull up by Veteran. Needs social, name, DOB for bene, run through CRM and it will tell them if app has been approved. Once application has been entered into the system as completed, pending, or open will be able to open in CRM. If not processed yet, can look up in **PEGA with Veteran info only**. 

Once application has been processed and in CRM can look it up by Veteran but typically under a spouse or child. 

There are situations where a Veteran can cover another Veteran if married but follows previous methodology. 

If one of the beneficiaries is missing information does it have to go back to the beginning. Each bene is processed individually. Will first check if Veteran is qualified. Entire family gets entered into Vista. Children are under 18, automatically approved. Children over 18: likely to be denied, needs school of certificate to be eligible. Chances are notices of those who are denied, letter will go to Veteran. Step-chilren can be approved if live at same address as Veteran. 

People calling in to call center are usually about status of apps or claims. If we are working them within 30 days, people probably won't call in. 

How do you decide what you are allowed to share? We have a verfication process. If its' the spouse calling about a minor child and can verify name, dob, snn, can release info.

Sometimes has a pop up [located in VistA] that says do not disclose to spouse. Definitely AFTER application has been processed and mostly related to claims. "Unable to locate beneficiary/patient, not on file." Legally not able to release any info or names. An example would be: spouse is calling for status of child, can not release on other children without verification, at times may be another child on file the spouse is unaware of or multiple families. 

Once a beneficiary is in the CHAMPVA program, the Veteran is no longer entitled to any medical or claim information. The Veteran is no longer a policy holder. 

CHAMPVA is payor of last resort, secondary to any primary insurance. CHAMPVA is primary when Medicare is present, Medicare is state level and CVA is Federal. 
  
**3. As I mentioned earlier, we'd love your help understanding case by case what information we can share with different types of dependents. To structure our conversation, I've made these two tables of all the different cases we'd like to learn about. [Share screen] I'm going to take notes in each box as we chat.**

They are never calling about info on application. Just calling about a status. 
  
**4. Let's say the Veteran applied for ChampVA benefits on behalf of his entire family. The Veteran calls in for a status update on their application and we are missing documents from their spouse.**
      - **What information are we able to share about their spouse?**
      - **What if we are missing a school certification for a 19 year old daughter in college? What information are we able to share about the daughter?** Veteran has to be able to verify child with first/middle/last name, dob, ssn or 3 points of data and one has to be numerical. Could be first name, last name, and ssn or First name, middle initial and DOB. I can tell him we received the application and missing school certificate. Can disclose details if school certificate is incorrect or missing info. 
      - **Or a child under the age of 18?** 
      - **What if the daughter, spouse, or minor child was the applicant?**   

    Can never release names, DOB, or SSN for verification. Caller needs to provide in order to release information. Caller must provide this for each person requesting info for. 

    A friend can also call in for an application status and able to release app status if can verify person's PII.

**5. What about if it's a spouse calling?** Can share missing info
    **- If they are calling about their own application, how do you decide what you are allowed to share with them?**
      **- Can they know any of the Veteran's information that wasn't already in their application?**
    **- If they are calling about another dependent's application (i.e. their child who filled out a separate application), how do you decide what you are allowed to share with them?**

    Veteran does not need to know if spouse, or child has applied. They can apply without notifying Veteran. Ex: Veteran and spouse get divorced and spouse wants to enroll child only, does not need Veteran to be notified.
    
    Even in online portal, all verification rules apply. 

**6. What if it's a child over 18 calling?**

**7. What if it's a child under 18 calling?**

**8. Do you have any documentation for these guidelines? Would you be able to share them with me?**
  Will get back to us on documentation can share that states these rules. Congress sets ChampVA law, policy interprets the law, judges if there are a lawsuit can interpret law further. 
  
**9. Who makes these guidelines?**
    - What laws or policies inform the guidelines?
    - Is there any room to change these guidelines based on insights from user research?

    
**10. If only one beneficiary is missing information, can the other beneficiaries on the application be marked as complete/eligible? Or does the entire application go back to the end of the queue?** Keith Parker with IVC and group: VHA 16 IVC Family & Foreign Policy, VHA16IVCFamily&ForeignPolicy@va.gov

**11. If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about this process, what would it be?**
For CVA, anyone that is eligible for CHAMPVA, they are eligible for CH35 education assistance. It would be great if once approved for CH35, it would also automatically update CHAMPVA.

**12. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me?**

Thanks so much for your time!
