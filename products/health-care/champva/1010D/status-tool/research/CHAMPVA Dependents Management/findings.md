# Primary takeaways from 3 SME interviews - Sept 2025

1. Dependents are stored independently in CP&E.
    - If there are multiple dependents in one CHAMPVA application, each dependent will be deemed either eligible or ineligible.
    - Dependents who are ineligible because they are missing documents will NOT hold up the other dependents in the application.
    - Once they resubmit their application with the missing information, they will go to the back of the queue. Their application will be processed with the same timeline as new applications.
      
2. A caller can access a dependent's application status as long as they are able to verify 3 of the following data points (one needs to be the SSN or DOB):
    - SSN
    - first name
    - middle initial/middle name
    - last name
    - DOB of applicant
  
3. [How this would affect status tool implementation]

4. If our 3 SMEs could wave a magic wand and change anything, they would:
      - Check for Tricare eligibility. "That would stop like 40% of my ineligible applications right off the bat."
      - Give online application status
      - Tell people when their A card is mailed out, and to what address
      - If someone is approved for CH35 education assistance, automatically update school eligibility for CHAMPVA
      - Let applicants update school certifications and OHI on VA.gov (like EZR update only flow).
