# Should we pursue requesting a PoA doc on the 1010d if third party/VSO for MVP? 


## What we know



- The PDF does not ask or mention a PoA needed. 
- Stakeholders were unaware of the alternate signer forms. As of now they don't ask for any additional forms to be filed by Alt signers or additional docs to be uploaded. \
In a March update Luke had mentioned that if the applicant does not have a POA in with the VBA they should attach one with your 10 10 D application
- There may be a case that CHAMPVA needs to contact the signer if the applicant is incapacitated and the signer is the Power of Authority.
- For the 1010D form, only a spouse can fill out for another spouse or child under 23. Anyone else would need a POA. 
- For the Claims, only a parent can fill it out for children under 18. Spouses or children over 18 would need a PoA. 
- If the beneficiary has docs on file with CHAMPVA for a PoA they can complete the claim.
- If CHAMPVA does not see a PoA on file they will send the claim back to the beneficiary.
- Need to be at least 18 to be a PoA
- CHAMPVA can accept non-VA PoA forms


## What we don’t know 



- What is the equivalent VA form to use for a PoA and who can use what VA PoA form for CHAMPVA enrollment and /or claims.
    Here’s what I found on VA.gov
    - VA Form 10-0137
    - VA form 2122
    - VA Form 2122a
- What form should a non-VSO third party fill out?
    - Is it the 21-22a or something different?
- What is the process and/or info needed for VSO to fill out the form for someone else? 
   - Do they need to fill out a specific form that is different that what a non-VSO third party needs to fill out? 
- Does a parent need a PoA if there is child is over 18 and rated as a “helpless child”
- Does adding this any addtional file uploads for the PoA violate PRA?
- Do we need to only ask for a PoA on the enrollment form or do you need this on the OHI and Claims form as well. What if the person filling out the enrollment form for the beneficiary is different then someone filling out the claims? 
- How do we tell if a person needs to submit a POA versus someone that already has on file for CHAMPVA/VA?
- What is the volume of people submitting a PoA?
- What is the volume of VSOs that needs to submit a PoA?
- Are there documents required to prove that the parent can fill out the form on behalf of that child that is over 23? 
- Will the PoA be filed with VBA eventually.  Do we want to encourage them to send the POA to IVC or somehow send them to VBA instead?
- Where would someone send their PoA too? 


## What would need to happen to include the PoA in the workflow



- Add the additional upload screen/ workflows
- Add a branch of screener questions/ doc upload screen for VSO versus third party signers
- Write specific content to inform people how to obtain of send a PoA
- If it violates the PRA we will need to build a business case and get permission to add it.
