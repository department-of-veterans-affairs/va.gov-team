####  [H3] What is a service-connected disability? 
<! --- I added this based on some of the feedback from the stakeholder interviews. If we don't have enough evidence that this will be helpful to our user I can remove it to save the real estate --- >
A service-connected disability is a disability that we’ve concluded was caused—or made worse—by the Veteran’s active-duty service. A permanent disability is one that’s not expected to improve.

If the Veteran you're connected to fits that description and your status and relationship match the following the factors below you may be eligible for CHAMPVA benefits.
