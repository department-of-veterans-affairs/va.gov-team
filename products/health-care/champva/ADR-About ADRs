# How the IVC Forms team manages ADRs
##Status: Draft

##Context
An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architecture decision made along with its context and consequences. 
https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record?tab=readme-ov-file

When the IVC Forms team creates and ADR, it should progress through these stages:
- Draft: The author(s) are writing the document and it is not ready for others to review
- Proposed: The document is being reviewed by team members other than the author(s)
- Accepted: The document has been reviewed and signed by at least 3 team members other than the author(s)
- Rejected: The document has been reviewed but will not be signed by at least 3 team members other than the author(s)
- Superceded: The ADR has been replaced by a subsequent ADR and is not longer valid

##Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

##Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
