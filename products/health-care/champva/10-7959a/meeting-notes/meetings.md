-  Premal Shah (OCTO)
-  Mary Wang (Product)
- George Brittingham
- Katrina Fluss
### Discussion
1. These claims are what we call Shoe box claims with VFMP, folks mail in a bunch of claims to the CHAMPVA process.  
1. The claims submission process is "very complicated" and its better to have another team handle all the backend.
   - claims are unique and different from the rest of the forms
   - need to take paper claims and convert them to EDI claims (can't just send over to CXM)
   - need to come through standard processes (x12 industry wide standards in place)
   - PHI, PII - security around this is already part of the process that's there
3. There is a contract in place to build a "portal" to accept the 7959A form, therefore OCTO should not prioritize this work.
   - portal would allow claims to be entered by beneficiary and converted to electronic form (837)
   - don't have details on implementation
1. This was new information to Katrina and she said that she will work with the business to understand what is happening with this work.
   - claims are very different - there may be room for different solutions
