# Product Outline: 10-7959a CHAMPVA Claim Form

## Overview
For beneficiaries enrolled in CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs), filing a claim online would be quicker and more efficient than going through the current paper process.

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*
