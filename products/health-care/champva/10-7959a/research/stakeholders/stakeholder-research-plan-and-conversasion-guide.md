# 10-7959a (CHAMPVA Claims Cover Sheet) Stakeholder Research Plan and Conversation Guide

## Research Goals:

* Inform the service blueprint for CHAMPVA - specifically, understand how claims move through the CHAMPVA system, from receipt to reimbursement (i.e., how a claim gets processed).
* Inform the user journey map for CHAMPVA - specifically within the claim submission portion of their journey.
* Identify known pain points and opportunities for improvement that the digital form could positively impact.
* Identify gaps in knowledge and communication that the digital form could positively impact.
* Identify KPIs/OKRs and define the success of digitization from a stakeholder perspective.

## Extended Methodology

Potential participants were identified through conversation with Premal and additional points of contact within the CHAMPVA claims sphere. Participants for this methodology will include individuals working with CHAMPVA who process claims and/or work in escalations. Participants will be scheduled through **Microsoft Teams* *to attend a 1hr informal conversation/interview session on **Microsoft Teams**. Participants will be asked in advance if they are comfortable using their webcam during the interview, having observers and note-takers in the call, and recording the interview. We will also let them know that, if possible, we’d like to watch them process a claim or escalation (dependent on role) during the interview. In addition, the participants will be asked in advance if they have access needs or accommodation requests that would make the interview more comfortable for them. 

Prior to the time of the interview, researchers will discuss who will be the primary and secondary facilitators and who will take notes. Facilitators and note-takers will arrive 10 minutes early to ensure the environment is properly prepared to conduct the interview, record the video, and take notes (checklist potentially incoming for this). A thread will be created in the **DSVA Slack - IVC Forms Interviews** channel with the naming convention **“Participant #1, Jan 18, 2024 - Feedback Backchannel Thread”** to enable communication between the observers and facilitator. Upon arrival, the facilitator will greet the participant; all other attendees will have cameras off and microphones muted. The facilitator will explain that the other attendees will observe and take notes as previously disclosed and will not interact with them. The facilitator will let the participant know they are starting the recording, clarify that they are looking for honest feedback, and reassure the participant that no feelings will be hurt and that none of the information shared will be used against them in any way. We will also inform them that their identities will be anonymized. The interview should have a conversational, informal tone.

Note-takers may come on camera and ask follow-up questions at the end of the interview. Upon completion of the interview, the participant will be thanked for their time and allowed to leave the call. The Q&A session will end 2 minutes before the agreed-upon meeting end time; be respectful of the participant’s time. All of the notes will be compiled in the [**Mural Board**](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1718049182430/1421fe86cf6cb3c74d17d0d422b5ae0a2ab66621?sender=u3844370d13a440a7859d3526) within 2 hours of the conclusion of the interview; please allow yourself time to process and transfer the notes while everything is still fresh in your mind. 

An after-action will take place after each interview to capture high-level impressions and anything else that might be relevant for analysis or the creation of the service blueprint (i.e., diagramming how a claim gets processed). Analysis will focus on the following primary areas:

* The processes and systems used to process and a claim, and pain points for claims processors
* The processes and systems used to process an escalation, and pain points for folks handling escalations
* Most common errors on submitted claims
* Most common reasons for a claim rejection
* Most common reasons for a claim escalation
* Known pain points for CHAMPVA beneficiaries
