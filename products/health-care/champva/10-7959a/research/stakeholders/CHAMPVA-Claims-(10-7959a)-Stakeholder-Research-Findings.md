# CHAMPVA Claims (10-7959a) Stakeholder Research
June 13-21, 2024


## General Findings


### CHAMPVA Claims OKRs and KPIs



* The team’s biggest tracker of success is their KPI (key performance indicator) for processing claims in 30-45 days.
    * Their success metric is to be no more than 45 days out when processing the entire claim. This 45-day period spans the moment that CHAMPVA receives the claim in the mailroom through when the payment is mailed out to the beneficiary.
    * To be within standard, the claim form and cover sheet should move from the mailroom to processors within 30 days.
    * It usually takes 60-90 days for a claim to be processed by a teleworker.
* They currently have a 3:1 ratio of teleworkers vs office workers
* The time it takes to process a PDI (Process Document Identifier) can be anywhere from 15 minutes to multiple hours depending on what’s in it (a UB-04 hospital visit document, multiple visits on the same day, etc). Each PDI can include multiple dates of service and claims.
* They have 35 processors right now processing roughly 100-150+ PDIs/day collectively.


#### Stakeholder Comments



* P1: “You could have numerous claims in a PDI because in CP&E and Vista those are separated by dates of service. In the new platform, CXM, you could have 10 or 20 different dates of service but it would only generate one claim.” 
* P2: “If DCDM is getting us the buckets 20 days after they’ve received it, we’re already behind 20 days.”
* P2: “For our telework batches,our metric is to be no more than 45 days out and we’re 60 to 70 out.”
* P2: “You would put [the claims into the system] as dates [of service]…you could basically just pad your numbers if you wanted to.”


### **Finding 1**: The DCDM (mailroom) scans submitted documents into DAPER, often resulting in misordered and upside-down documents, creating additional work for processors.


#### Analysis

DCDM receives mailed-in documents from beneficiaries, and they are the ones who scan the documents into DAPER. This process can take up to 30 days to complete which doubles the overall claims processing times. Once scanned, many of the files show the document upside down and/or in the wrong order, which leads to the program analysts needing to re-orient and re-order the documents in order to start processing the claim(s). This can take up to an hour, in contrast to properly formatted claims that would take about 10 minutes. Additionally, anywhere a highlighter is used will show up as fully black in DAPER, so it needs to be added as a “shelf batch” so someone can process the claim in person.


#### Comments/Supporting Evidence



* P4: "It took me 50 minutes to organize all 40 piles."
* P1: "[Documents] coming out of the mailroom aren't always necessarily ideal…. We get them [scanned in] upside down, we get them backwards."


#### Recommendations



* Allow documents to be uploaded via an online submission of the claims form. This will remove the process in which the images are scanned in through the mailroom and provide a more efficient method of delivering the support documents to the program analysts for claims processing. Removing the process of scanning the supporting documents and claims form will further reduce imaging errors such as highlighter pen marks blacking out the content or out of order documents.
* Pre-sorting the claims in PEGA (document processing software) would allow for better tracking of the number of claims processed. In the future, we recommend seeking out a solution within PEGA to automatically separate multiple dates of services to be submitted as individuals claim.


### **Finding 2**: Program analysts process claims in CXM now, whereas they used to process in Vista/CP&E/Vis. The switch is causing delays in processing and employee burnout.


#### Analysis

Program analysts used Vista/CP&E/Vis for a number of years and became proficient with processing claims in these systems. In an effort to modernize their systems, they recently switched to a claims processing workflow tool called Facets, often referred to as CXM. They’ve been with CXM since October 2022, so any claims after that date will be in CXM, any ones before that date will still be in Vista. This change caused a huge disruption in the workflow, leading to increased delays in processing. Certain actions, such as overriding information that used to be able to be taken care of by the analysts in Vista, now need to be done by a third party (Signature) in CXM. This leads to additional processing delays and frustration for representatives. 

Additionally, CXM was never built for program analysts to manually enter numbers into the system, so there are many work-arounds that representatives need to take in order to input information correctly. Because of the new system, the staff is getting burned out while trying to keep up with all the training videos and content. 


#### Comments/Supporting Evidence



* P1: "My employees, honestly, they are burnt out from training."
* P4: "It's a whole new system that the voucher examiners had to learn, and we're still learning it."
* P4: [In reference to Vista] “We could strip that whole claim and have [the voucher examiner] redo it. We can't do that in CXM. We have to send something out to [Signature (company)].”
* P4: "With Vista everything was immediate...Now it can take a week or two [with Signature]."


#### Recommendations



* Continue to work with VA partners and stakeholders to facilitate the successful delivery of the necessary information needed to submit a successful claim to CXM.
* Continue to ensure that the digital form efficiently collects all the required information and strive to maintain low submission error rates through continued UX oversight and iterative adjustments.
* Continue working with VA partners to make the digital form the preferred and dominant method of submitting claims through promotion, outreach, etc.


### **Finding 3**: There are some instances where program analysts get blocked in their workflow by other teams, such as needing the Eligibility team to update addresses and OHI (Other Health Insurance) information before the representative can continue – all of which cause processing delays.


#### Analysis

Program analysts used to be able to update address information in Vista themselves, but they now need to forward a request to eligibility and wait for them to take action, which causes processing delays (usually a few days) and frustration among the analysts. For example, an  update on the beneficiary’s health insurance can take the OHI team 2-3 days to complete.


#### Comments/Supporting Evidence



* P4: "If their address doesn't match what's in our system, their claim is gonna get delayed because that needs to go to the eligibility [team]."
* P4:  “We have to send something out to [Signature] so that they can delete the claim or make it obsolete… Now it could take a week or two.”
* P3: "When we receive something the address does not match... that's another reason that would stop the process. It takes about a couple of days in order to get updated on their side."


#### Recommendations



* Develop a workflow among the different departments that would enable the claim to continue processing despite the need for updates or look into reducing the time it takes for another CHAMPVA department to make these updates (currently 2-3 days).
* In the future, research ways to better integrate the function of the OHI certification within the claims submission.


### **Finding 4**: “Send backs” are letters that get sent to beneficiaries when there is missing information that they need to provide in order for their claim to be processed. The most common missing information on submitted claims are the codes with the itemization of services. Having missing signatures is a close second. If information is missing, mailing a send back letter and waiting for the information to be mailed back can lead to a multi-week delay. 


#### Analysis

Because beneficiaries do not have adequate information on how to submit their claims (see Finding 5), they often do not submit everything that is needed for their claim to be processed. The most common mistake that is made by beneficiaries is not including an itemization of services, which means that certain codes are missing (such as DX, CPT, and NPI codes). Without these codes, program analysts cannot process the claim. When this happens, they need to mail out a send back letter explaining why their claim cannot be processed and how to fix it, which adds multiple weeks to the process. While the missing codes/itemization of services are the number one thing that leads to this delay, not having a signature on the form is a close second. When a signature is missing, it stops the entire process and a send back needs to be mailed out.


#### Comments/Supporting Evidence



* P1: "So far [I’ve reviewed] 8 out of, let's say, 15 [PDIs] so far. 2 are going back for no signed claim form."
* P2: If the beneficiaries knew what to do and they were sending these things in, a large amount of our workload would not be sent back to them.”
* P3: "What will happen is that if it's not signed and dated, the [claims analyst] completely stops processing that."
* P4: “If they send in a lot of receipts without the bill, that's a problem....we just send it back to [them].”


#### Recommendations



* Allowing people to sign and submit online will make it impossible for people to submit online without a signature. This means every online submission will no longer have this problem.
* Having clear instructions on what information is needed to submit with each claim at the time of uploading their documents should reduce the frequency of missing information.
* Consider using AskVa to allow beneficiaries to learn about updates on their claim status quicker and at their will rather than waiting for correspondence through the mail.
* In the future, allowing the online form to handle resubmissions for partial claims (that are missing information) will reduce the time needed to mail items for the claim to and from the beneficiaries.


### **Finding 5**: CHAMPVA either beneficiaries lack knowledge on how to submit claims properly or are receiving outdated information, which leads to errors and delays in processing. 


#### Analysis

There is a beneficiary handbook that gets sent in the mail with their CHAMPVA benefits approval letter, but the packet is so long that few people read it, and there is outdated information in it (though they are currently working on a new handbook). Because of this in combination with the outdated website, beneficiaries often will not submit all the information needed (such as itemized bills, for example) to process a claim. When beneficiaries don’t provide all the required information, they’re required to go through the send back process of receiving a letter in the mail and mailing in additional information.


#### Comments/Supporting Evidence



* P2: "So what we'll do is we send back that tip sheet that usually highlights what is needed or they'll actually put sticky notes on the claim saying we need this from you. We are doing what we can to educate them one little piece at a time because most people are not gonna read a 17 page handbook."
* P2: In reference to missing data: "there's a certain part of this too that [beneficiaries] have to understand what needs to be done."
* P2: "Our biggest issue is beneficiary education."


#### Recommendations



* Consider creating more digital educational resources that would supplement the printed version of the handbook. This will make this resource easier to update as the program evolves and allow the beneficiary to always have the most recent information available to them. It will also make it more manageable to consume with the use of digital tools that are already “baked in” to the digital experience such as the search and bookmark functions. This can promote wider use and adoption of the handbook to educate beneficiaries on the CHAMPVA claims guidelines.
* It is recommended that the content on the “About this form” and “Introduction” pages for the digital version of the CHAMPVA claim form be plainly worded while also explaining more complex terms in a simplistic manner.
* Having better education resources and using plain language will better assist the beneficiaries with submitting the correct documents and increasing their knowledge of the program. This in turn, will reduce the need to escalate questions and issues to the CSRs and allow some alleviation in their workloads.
* Add content in strategic pages in the online form that makes it apparent what information and documents are needed to process each type of claim. 
* Updating the handbook/beneficiary documentation to make it more digestible and accurate.


### **Finding 6**: Some reasons claims may go to the shelf include highlighted content turning out opaque black after being scanned through DAPER, missing beneficiary signature, or too many documents (40+) to be able to be processed by a teleworker.


#### Analysis

“Shelf batches'' are submissions that need to be worked on in person, causing additional work for program analysts. Shelf batches slow down claims processing because they require more time and can't go through the usual processing route.


#### Comments/Supporting Evidence



* "P1: In reference to when a beneficiary uses a highlighter pen on their claim form to call attention to certain fields: “When it scans into DAPER, it turns black"...You would be surprised you see it quite a lot."


#### Recommendations



* Submitting online will remove the highlighter blackout issue, help with the sorting of documents, and having missing signatures, leading to a significant reduction in shelf batches 


### **Finding 7**: One of the biggest frustrations for beneficiaries is the time that it takes for their claims to be processed, as well as the lack of communication once a claim has been submitted.


#### Analysis

Once beneficiaries mail in their claims, the only way they can figure out where their claim is in the process is by calling the CHAMPVA call center to ask for a status, or by receiving communication in the mail. When they receive communication in the mail, it’s either:



1. The accepted status of their claim with a check
2. A denied status of their claim with an EOB
3. A rejected claim with a claim number and instructions on how to fix the errors in order to get the claim processed

Outside of calling or getting a letter in the mail, there is no communication about the status of their claim. This is frustrating for beneficiaries because there is little transparency into their claim’s status, leading to unmet expectations. Additionally, because communication does happen through mail, everyone is subjected to the USPS timeline, which is not very efficient for communication. 


#### Comments/Supporting Evidence



* P1: “And then we stuff it (the send back letter) in an envelope, and then the mailman comes and picks it up and don't know how long it sits in the mailroom till it goes to the post office.” 
* P2: Unless they [the beneficiaries] happen to receive the paper EOB's before they actually receive the check that would be the only communication [CHAMPVA has to the beneficiaries].


#### Recommendations



* In the future, it is recommended to do some follow up research on post-form submission digital notifications to further reduce the need for follow up communication about a claim via traditional mail.
* Consider heavily promoting AskVA to allow beneficiaries to get their questions answered quicker and alleviate some of the labor on the CSRs (customer service representatives). 
* Explore options to allow CSRs to resolve some additional issues with the claims over the phone or via email rather than initiating a send back. This may allow CHAMPVA to process the claim faster and avoid resubmissions.
* In the future consider exploring integration of CHAMPVA claims into the Claims Status Tool or recommending the creation of a similar tool within the Family Member Hub that is currently in development.
* Continue and expand the digitization, automation, and outreach efforts to minimize the number of interactions with traditional mail.


### **Finding 8**: Miscommunication between processors and customer service representatives (CSRs) leads to incorrect information being passed on to beneficiaries, causing processing delays.


#### Analysis

Program analysts and VEs (voucher examiners) typically do not talk to beneficiaries. When they review the claim(s) they often write notes about what is missing or provide explanations for certain situations. When the claim is passed to the CSRs, some program analysts believe that the CSRs do not always read the notes written by the program analysts. Additionally, Program Analysts, VEs and CSRs have different areas of expertise. This can sometimes lead to miscommunication or the lack of context needed to address missing information adequately. All these factors often result in incorrect information being provided to beneficiaries, such as incorrect status about their claims. Another round of communication via mail or phone is often needed in these cases causing processing delays, confusion and frustration for beneficiaries.


#### Comments/Supporting Evidence



* P1: "[CSRs] are not reading comments put in Vista by the processors. Had they just read the comments, you could have told him that a send back letter went out to you."
* P1: "After [a beneficiary was] sitting on hold for 45 minutes they [CSRs] tell me that when this does get processed, it could be a year. It's probably not something you want them saying. "


#### Recommendations



* Consider improving communication channels between the different teams working on claims and allow for more extensive reporting of the claims status and notations left on a claim. 
* Consider adding training with the CSR’s that focuses on looking for and understanding notations left on claims as part of their standard operating procedures. 
* Consider the possibility of standardizing communications regarding missing information if there isn’t already a system in place. For example, there could be a checklist with unambiguous standardized definitions of different items, marked as needed, that is passed over with the request, in order to minimize the risk of miscommunication.


### **Finding 9**: Success metrics are difficult to define due to fluctuating PDI content. 


#### Analysis

Metrics for claims are not very standardized because of the variability of each PDI that the program analysts process. Each date of service is a new claim, but they can all live under the same PDI number. They track processing of PDIs instead of claims because the PDIs are generated by a system, meaning that the program analysts cannot change the number of PDIs they processed. Because they’re working off PDIs, which do not have a standard number or size of claims attached to them, the time it takes to process one PDI can vary greatly. Factors that contribute to varying times include: the number of dates of service covered (each new date is a new claim), how accurately the documentation was scanned into DAPER and whether the person is working in the office or via telework. Because of all these factors, there is not a standardized way of tracking how efficient the claims process is, making it very difficult to measure productivity and changes over time.


#### Comments/Supporting Evidence



* P1: “ It’s hard to hold them to any number because there is no standard form now. When they sign in a 6:00 in the morning and don’t start working until noon”
* P1:”They only way to track any kind of metrics with them, we can watch them and see they did 10 PDI’s in a day.”
* P2: “So that's why we are moving towards utilizing [PDIs] as the metric for all of our people that process claims…CP&E if you wanted to you could [...] create more claims than you realistically would.”


#### Recommendations



* Explore any metrics that Signature may have access to better analyze what can be reported on and used to track a KPI's (key performance indicator).
* Consider exploring tracking metrics by claims and types of claims rather than PDIs. This will help to gain more consistent and precise data allowing to fully understand workloads and more successfully track KPIs for daily work completed.
