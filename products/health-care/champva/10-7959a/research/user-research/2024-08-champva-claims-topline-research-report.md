This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings


**Finding #1: Participants demonstrated difficulty when navigating the form as a third party representative or sponsor.**

- Participants hesitated when filling out the fields for the sponsor information. In most cases the hesitation occurred when the person filling out the form was a Veteran.
- Participants that were Veterans felt that it wasn’t necessary to fill out their information in the sponsor fields because they entered it under the signer information. 
- 3 out of the 7 participants were not confident in defining what a sponsor is. 
- Some participants struggled to determine who each of the roles (the signer, the sponsor and the beneficiary) mentioned in the were.



**Finding #2: Participants had a basic understanding of what they may need to complete the claim form but still needed some further clarification.**

- The majority of the participants understood that they would need some level of proof of payment or charge from their doctor or pharmacy prior to entering the form or shortly after reading the introduction page. They all knew where they could find the requested proof, either in the physical format or by utilizing their insurance company’s portal.

- In most cases the participants did not understand the details of what was needed on their documents such as what a DX, or NCT code was or if it would be present on their doctor’s bill. One participant mentioned that one of the requirements (social security number) most likely won’t be present on the explanation of benefits document.

- Some participants demonstrated signs of fatigue after reading through the supporting document upload screens.


**Finding #3:  Participants were able to add 2 additional insurances with ease using the “list and loop” pattern but there was some low confidence demonstrated while filling out their insurance details.**

- Each participant was asked to complete the claim form as if they had 2 health insurance plans. The majority understood that CHAMPVA acted as a “third insurance” which would pay after the other two insurances paid.
- Some details such as policy numbers or type of insurance seemed unclear to most of the participants, though most of them knew where they could find this information.   
- The policy number and insurance phone number fields were not required but only 1 of 7 participants acknowledged this and chose to skip it. 


**Finding #4: Participants hesitated when shown the alert box after adding in the correct amount of insurance policies.**
- The majority of the participants became distracted from their current task of reviewing their insurance information when the alert box appeared on the insurance review page.
Some seemed to be caught a little off guard and stated that it seemed like they had done something wrong. 

The participants only felt comfortable moving forward after reading the description in the alert box.

**Finding #5: Participants had a good understanding of what a claim was but desired a different experience when needing to upload multiple claims.**
- All of the participants had a good understanding of what was meant by a claim (each date of service or physician location needed to be submitted as separate claims).
- Most participants explained that if they did have multiple claims to submit that they would fill the form out for each claim.
- One participant remarked that they would upload all of their claims in one form submission to see if VA would accept them and if the claims were denied in this format they would then send each claim in separate form submissions. 


**Finding #6: Participants understood the work or auto accident related injury question although they expected to have to submit more details with their claim if they chose “yes” for an answer for either question.**
- The participants were familiar with the procedure to have the claim processed through third party liability if the illness or injury was caused during work or by an auto accident. However, there were mixed feelings about whether they would continue submitting the claim through CHAMPVA.
- One participant remarked that they would not answer truthfully in fear that their claim would be denied or they would have to answer more questions.
- Some participants also expressed confusion on how to answer the question for a minor. 
- Almost all of the participants expected to have to submit additional information about the injury or illness including details on what happened and/or police or accident reports. 

**Finding #7: Participants knew how to use the file upload screen almost immediately after landing on the page but many participants were not expecting the “additional notes” accordion component to behave or contain the information that it did when they expanded it.**
- Participants confidently navigated and uploaded files on the form and explained how they would normally convert a paper receipt or bill to a digital file to upload without much guidance from the content of the form.
-  Many participants were not expecting the “additional notes” section on the upload screen to contain basic guidelines about filing a claim. Instead they were anticipating that it would contain an area that they would be able to add some more context about their claim.
