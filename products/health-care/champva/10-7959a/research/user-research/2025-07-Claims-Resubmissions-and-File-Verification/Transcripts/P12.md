00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.930
Renata: Mmm…

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:14.679
Renata: Alright, I started recording. If there's a little bar at the top that says this meeting is being recorded, you can click the OK button and close that. So I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

3
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.400
P12: Yes.

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:24.879
Renata: Alright, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

5
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.260
P12: Yes.

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:35.510
Renata: All right, and I'll just reconfirm, the recording question at the very end, and you have a chance to veto that, if you'd like, once you know what we've discussed.

7
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:48.309
Renata: So let's jump into the fun of the session. So before we look at that demo tool, just a few questions for you. Are you or anyone else in your household currently enrolled in the CHAMPVA program?

8
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.540
P12: I am.

9
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.399
Renata: You are. Is there anyone else in your household, or just you?

10
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.949
P12: that's enrolled in CHAMVA, it's just me.

11
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.710
Renata: Okay, and how recently did you apply for the CHAMPVA program?

12
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.560
P12: …

13
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.240
P12: Probably 2021, I was working when my husband was first approved for disability, so I didn't need CHAMPVA at the time.

14
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.230
P12: So, I think it was 21, January…

15
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.350
P12: No, maybe before then, yeah, because I knew I was gonna retire, so…

16
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.970
P12: like, 2021, the end of 2000… 2020, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.469
Renata: Okay, got it. And what was the pro- experience like for you, applying, if you can recall?

18
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.019
P12: Oh, it was… it was fine, actually, when I had changed the date that I was gonna retire, and I actually, …

19
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:52.980
P12: I was gonna retire a little bit earlier, they were able to expedite my application, so I had coverage, right when my other coverage was ending. So it was really good, really seamless.

20
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.509
Renata: Oh, wow. Okay. And have you submitted any medical or pharmacy claims to the CHAMPVA program?

21
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.450
P12: I have.

22
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.870
Renata: Alright, and what was your experience like with filing claims?

23
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.560
P12: When they were submitted personally, I had a lot of problems because they wanted, …

24
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.530
P12: Not only do they want

25
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:31.390
P12: COB information, EOB information, to coordinate to do the COB, which I did give them that information. They wanted, everything from the doctor, and I had a lot of dates of service.

26
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.489
P12: From the time I was submitting the claim, so it was just impossible to get specific

27
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.710
P12: Broken down, information that they were looking from from the doctor.

28
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.570
P12: … I even asked the doctor to submit

29
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.440
P12: It as a secondary to cover some of the dates of service that … kind of…

30
00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:06.320
P12: coincided with me having insurance, and they were going to be secondary, and it just didn't… it didn't go through well, and I kind of just put it to the wayside, because I just didn't…

31
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.379
P12: Had the time to go through every provider to ask them for the information that was requested.

32
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:30.470
Renata: I'm sorry, that sounds very frustrating, but, we appreciate you sharing your experiences. It helps us to make sure that this starts to work better for folks in the future. When you were submitting these claims, were you doing it with a paper or PDF form, or did you submit any of them online on VA.gov?

33
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.030
P12: It was all manual. I think I fact… no, I mailed it in.

34
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.650
Renata: Okay.

35
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:45.539
Renata: And did you receive any mail from CHAMPVA about your claim before it was processing, like, we're missing information, or we need additional info?

36
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.140
P12: That's what I was referring to, yes.

37
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.890
Renata: Okay.

38
00:03:47.890 --> 00:04:12.620
Renata: Got it. Thank you. So I am going to… we're gonna shift gears now and look at that demo tool I mentioned before. I'm gonna be sharing a link in the Zoom chat, which I'd like you to open in your browser, and then share your screen in Zoom. I can help walk you through any of that process and do any, tech support, but just giving you a second now to close out any other browser windows or programs you have open, and let me know when you're ready for that link.

39
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.700
P12: I'm ready.

40
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.820
Renata: Alright.

41
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.570
Renata: I have shared the link in the Zoom chat.

42
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.260
P12: Okay.

43
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.040
P12: I have to change my settings so I can share with you.

44
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.620
Renata: No worries.

45
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.130
Renata: I swear it asks me that every single time.

46
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.200
P12: Okay.

47
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.409
P12: So let me know if it… if it doesn't work, it says I might have to quit Zoom and open it up again, so let's see.

48
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.790
P12: Alright.

49
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.590
Renata: If you do need to quit Zoom, that's no problem, I'll let you back into the session.

50
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.070
P12: Okay.

51
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.489
P12: There you go.

52
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.590
Renata: There we go.

53
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:44.289
Renata: I can see your desktop. If you want to go back to your browser window where you have the form opened up, perfect! Okay. So before we start looking at this form and filling it out, just a few things to be aware of. So, like I said before, this is our demo site, and we're not actually submitting the form today, so nothing we click on will have any bearing on your benefits.

54
00:05:44.310 --> 00:06:02.759
Renata: As we go through the form, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, like birthdates and social security numbers, if you don't want to use real information. And in your email, confirming this session, Paragene should have sent you a couple of documents to have ready. Do you have those downloaded by chance?

55
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.439
P12: I didn't download them.

56
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:25.350
Renata: Okay, that's not a problem. I have, links to them online, so when we get to the point in the form where it's asking you to upload a document, I'll just stop and we'll make sure that we get the documents to you one way or another so we can keep going, but I'd just like to check before we get into the meat of the form. But, any questions for me?

57
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.970
P12: No.

58
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:35.440
Renata: Alright, so on this page, you can scroll up and down, but without clicking on anything, just review the information on the page, and let me know your initial thoughts.

59
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.810
P12: I mean, it's clear.

60
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.520
P12: It says the instructions.

61
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.709
Renata: Alright, so in your own words, what type of form is this page describing?

62
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.890
P12: It's a form to submit claims that have already occurred.

63
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.970
P12: From a provider, a healthcare provider.

64
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.779
Renata: Okay. So, …

65
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:14.489
Renata: Can you speak on that a little bit more? Like, when… when would you… it's after you've seen a healthcare provider, or after you've received reimbursement from another insurer? Just want to make sure I check my understanding.

66
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.670
P12: After the date of service, within one year from the date of service.

67
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:25.040
Renata: Got it, okay, thank you. Do you know what types of claims you can file, specifically?

68
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.860
P12: It would be any healthcare service, so anything that's billable.

69
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.800
P12: Including, pharmacy.

70
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.929
Renata: All right. And what information do you think that you'll need in order to fill out this claims form?

71
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.559
P12: You'll probably need a data service, … the amount…

72
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.920
P12: What was done, and for whom it was done.

73
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.490
Renata: Okay.

74
00:07:52.790 --> 00:08:01.029
Renata: And if you were filling this out on VA.gov for real today, do you have all that information on hand, or would you need to pause now to go collect it?

75
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.379
P12: I would probably need to collect it, yeah.

76
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:18.929
Renata: Okay, got it. Just a couple more questions for you about this page. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel to file a claim based on the information you see on this page?

77
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.220
P12: Very, 5.

78
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.630
Renata: Okay. Anything in particular that's making you feel very prepared.

79
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.920
P12: …

80
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:36.970
P12: Because I used to do this for… you know, that was part of my job a long time ago, so I think I have more knowledge than most people in regards to

81
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.940
P12: This process?

82
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:51.010
Renata: Okay, alright, got it. So at this point, I'm going to have you scroll down the page a little bit, and at the bottom of that big blue box, there's a link that says, start your form without signing in. I'd like you to click that, please.

83
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:51.870
P12: Okay.

84
00:08:51.870 --> 00:09:10.689
Renata: Alright, so at this point, we're going to be starting the form, and you'll be submitting a new medical claim for yourself, and I'll let you know when to pause so that I can ask you some questions, but as a reminder, you can use fake information. And as you're going through, please just remember to think out loud. We want to hear any reactions you're having as you experience them.

85
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:11.910
P12: Okay.

86
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.820
P12: Excellent.

87
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.459
Renata: So you went back and then forward. Was there any… any reason why you did that there?

88
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.419
P12: As I forget to, …

89
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:57.200
P12: when it took me to the beneficiary information, I… I thought possibly they needed a sponsor information, so….

90
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.089
Renata: Okay.

91
00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.060
P12: Go back.

92
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:16.729
Renata: Alright. Actually, I'll have you go back really quickly. For the purposes of today's session, we're going to imagine that you have a secondary, or a primary health insurer here. Okay. But just from my understanding, is CHAMPA your main, insurance at this point?

93
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.999
P12: Yeah. No.

94
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.570
Renata: Okay, got it. Yeah, so if you can click continue….

95
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.690
P12: Okay.

96
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.019
P12: Does it matter for you?

97
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.060
Renata: It does not matter at this point.

98
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:43.770
P12: Okay.

99
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.019
P12: Do you want me to have another one, or just one is fine?

100
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.120
Renata: We'll just do the one, yeah, that's alright.

101
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.789
Renata: And like I said before, we'll do the medical claim today.

102
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:12.709
Renata: All right, so I'm gonna have you pause here. I'd like you to just review the information on this screen, and then I have some questions for you.

103
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:13.460
P12: Okay.

104
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.009
Renata: Alright, so in your own words, what documentation is being asked for here?

105
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:34.009
P12: Your name, your date of birth, the doctor's name, the type of… well, the type of provider it was.

106
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:41.820
P12: doctor, nurse practitioner, etc. The address, the NPI, the tax ID number.

107
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:50.779
P12: What services received, what data service, what the diagnosis was for the service, the actual service codes.

108
00:12:52.390 --> 00:13:02.490
Renata: All right, and are you familiar with requesting a document like this from a provider to file a claim? Is this anything unusual or standing out here?

109
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.970
P12: No. Alright.

110
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:22.129
Renata: So I'm gonna drop a link in the chat, to a folder that has those files. If you could open up that link in another tab, and I'll give you some instructions on which files to download, and then we'll have everything prepped and ready to go for the rest of the session.

111
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:22.810
P12: Okay.

112
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:44.329
Renata: You might have to go down to your, doc… oh, there we go. So, if you could download the three PDFs for me, please. The ones that say Example, CHAMP VA Sendback Letter, Sample Billing Statement, and Sample EOB, that top blue one there, we don't have to download, just the three… the three PDFs.

113
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.360
P12: Okay.

114
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:09.440
Renata: Oh, I think we went to the wrong place. If you could go back to that Google Drive tab, the one on the far right.

115
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.559
P12: Yeah, I'm just trying to get out of this. I don't know why it's doing this.

116
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.380
P12: Oof.

117
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:32.820
P12: There we go.

118
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:34.930
P12: Okay.

119
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:44.690
Renata: Alright, so if you could scroll down to the bottom of the page there, please, and upload, the doc… one of the documents that you just downloaded called Sample Billing Statement.

120
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.100
P12: Okay.

121
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.600
P12: Okay.

122
00:14:55.270 --> 00:15:04.449
Renata: Alright, I want to draw your attention to that little yellow, box there. Do you understand what this error message means?

123
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.980
P12: It just says it can't complete verification for the file, so…

124
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:18.780
P12: I guess it's saying, like, the particular type of file, like, they looking for a doc file, or…

125
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:24.440
P12: you know, in PDF or whatever, that they don't like the format the file is in.

126
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:32.519
Renata: Okay, and what would you do at this point to resolve this if you saw the error message, when you were filling this out on VA.gov?

127
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:39.020
P12: … well, it says you can retry, so I could try to change it, but…

128
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:49.310
P12: It says you can continue without verifying, but I probably wouldn't continue, because I want the claim to go through clean the first time, and I don't want them to come back and say that the file was…

129
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.749
P12: You know, they couldn't verify it, so I'd probably change

130
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.620
P12: Possibly the, you know, the type of file it was.

131
00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:09.190
Renata: Okay. And if you tried uploading a different version of the file, or a different type of file type, and you got that message again, you mentioned before that you wouldn't continue with the form. At that point, would you continue, or would you stop the form?

132
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:14.730
P12: What'd you do? At that point, after trying a different format, I'll continue.

133
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:20.969
Renata: Okay, got it. For the purposes of today, we're gonna bypass, so you can go ahead and click continue.

134
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:21.649
P12: Thank you.

135
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:28.130
Renata: And then just review this page and what it's asking for, and I'm gonna ask you a couple questions again.

136
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.430
P12: Okay.

137
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:38.890
P12: Okay.

138
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:50.299
Renata: Alright, I want to just draw your attention to that blue box there, just take a look at what that says, and let me know what it means to you, what it's saying.

139
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.040
P12: Okay.

140
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:57.899
P12: I'm assuming they're gonna use AI or something to look at the documents to see that…

141
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:13.060
P12: it has at least the things that they requested up here. The document that I'm uploading has the data service, all the other information they're asking, because I guess they don't want to… it won't go forward without that information on the form.

142
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:20.440
Renata: Got it, okay. Now you can upload the same file you uploaded for the previous page, since this is our test system,

143
00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:25.759
P12: Hmm.

144
00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:28.089
P12: Okay.

145
00:17:29.009 --> 00:17:47.929
Renata: So I know we're seeing that error message again, but we're gonna assume… we're gonna pretend in this world it didn't pop up the second time. Just a couple questions for you before we keep going, though. Based on your experience with uploading these supporting documents for your claim today, would you prefer this file verification or no file verification in this form?

146
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.959
P12: Hmm… I, I prefer the file verification.

147
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:59.390
Renata: Okay, and why would you prefer it to know verification, out of curiosity?

148
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:07.300
P12: Well, I'm assuming, however they set up the sensitivities to the system, that if it bypass… if it, passes their criteria, that

149
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:14.780
P12: no one would come back later on and say that I would have to do this again, or submit it some other way, so….

150
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:26.539
Renata: Okay, got it. And on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to upload the files to support your CHAMP VA claim?

151
00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:27.550
P12: Five.

152
00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.630
Renata: 5 very easy. Alright, anything in particular that made it very easy?

153
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:40.390
P12: No, I… It just seems like it's the same process as any other upload to any other file.

154
00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.959
P12: a system that requests the file. Seems similar.

155
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.540
Renata: Alright, got it. So you can go ahead and click continue.

156
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.280
P12: Okay.

157
00:18:49.790 --> 00:19:00.530
Renata: So, like I said before, we're not actually submitting this form today, so this is the last screen we're going to be looking at for this task, but go ahead and review the claim form that you just filled out, and I'll have a couple questions for you when you're done.

158
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:01.200
P12: Okay.

159
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.150
P12: Okay.

160
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.580
Renata: Alright.

161
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:19.799
Renata: So, we're not gonna click on the submit form button, but if you did submit it today, what would you expect to happen next?

162
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.530
P12: … I would expect to have some…

163
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:45.340
P12: time period that it would state that it would take to review the claim, and whatever expectation, be it, we'll give you a call, or something like that. Also, I would expect for it to say, you know, we're going to email you a copy of what you've submitted to us, and for it to have some kind of claim number as well.

164
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.700
P12: To follow up.

165
00:19:47.160 --> 00:20:05.909
Renata: Okay, just want to repeat back, make sure that I'm understanding correctly. You'd want to see processing times, some type of expectation around, like, notification, be it email or what have you, and you would like to see a confirmation number and a copy of the claim you submitted in that submission, like, confirmation.

166
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:06.840
P12: Yes.

167
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:13.779
Renata: Okay, got it, thank you for verifying. So how soon would you expect to be notified about a decision being made on your claim?

168
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:20.029
P12: I would say, like, Within 45 to 60 days.

169
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.999
Renata: Okay, and now is that realistic, or is that, like, ideal experience? What are we talking about here?

170
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.809
P12: Realistic. It's realistic.

171
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.809
Renata: Okay, and when… what would be your ideal for getting… hearing back?

172
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.110
P12: Ideal would be 30 days.

173
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:47.429
Renata: Okay, alright. So 30… 30 to 45 days, 60 kind of out… sort of at the… the far end, got it. And how would you expect to be notified about that decision? By mail, email, text message, some other way?

174
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:53.980
P12: Possibly an email, and also, if you can…

175
00:20:54.210 --> 00:21:06.009
P12: sign in if there's a possibility of actually… because I noticed that you didn't really sign in at the beginning of this submission of the claim. If there's a way to sign in and see a status, that would be great.

176
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:22.099
P12: If not, if they won't have that real time, maybe an email stating, you know, we're sending out the check, you know, be aware that we're sending out a check, and … or something similar to that.

177
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:34.589
Renata: Okay, so if I'm hearing correctly, either some way of checking online through your VIA.gov account, or getting updates by email, sort of periodically letting you know about updates to the claim processing.

178
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:52.149
P12: Well, not so much periodically, just where they are in the process, so if there's something that needs to be done, just, oh, we reviewed your claim, we need additional information, or we reviewed your claims, it's been approved, you know, we'll mail out the check in 7 days, so….

179
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:52.500
Renata: Okay.

180
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.450
P12: Not the entire process, as they're going through the process.

181
00:21:55.790 --> 00:22:12.010
Renata: Got it, got it. So this leads into my next question. If you could check the status of a claim before a decision got made on it, you know, before it was approved or denied, would you expect to find that status on VA.gov or somewhere else? What, can you go into that a little bit more?

182
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.210
P12: Yeah, because I…

183
00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:26.840
P12: Well, yeah, I guess at this point, you guys, they are using VA.gov for everything. I know they had a separate kind of website for CHAMPVA when I was signing up.

184
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:39.720
P12: Which looked a little bit, antiquated compared to the VA.gov website now. So I guess, yeah, that would be… just to have a central place for everything, I guess.

185
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:55.660
Renata: Okay, alright. So like I said, we're not going to be submitting this form. At this point, you can either go back over to that other tab, or just, open the other download that you did, the example Champier Sendback Letter, if you double-click on that.

186
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.940
P12: Okay, let me see.

187
00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:18.510
Renata: Yeah, if you just double… yep, there we go. Alright, so I'm gonna have you imagine… oh, you know what? I'm getting ahead of myself. I have not had enough caffeine yet today. I had one more question for you about that form. On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to complete the CHAMP VA form?

188
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.600
P12: Or 5.

189
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.490
Renata: Okay, and anything in particular that made it that 5, that very easy?

190
00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:32.219
P12: fairly, … Quick and to the point, and… … It didn't…

191
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:37.010
P12: I guess because the fact that they were using the… whatever…

192
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:51.980
P12: AI or whatever to scan the explanation of benefits, it didn't require me to have to put in the dates, all the stuff that was on the form, the dates of service, the diagnosis code, all those different things, so I would say that's… that's better than having to manually do it yourself.

193
00:23:52.580 --> 00:24:12.530
Renata: Okay, got it, thank you. So, back to the thing that you have open on your screen, apologies. I'm gonna have you imagine that you did submit that claim. It's been 30, 45 days, and you received this letter in the mail about that claim that you filed. I'd like you to just review this, letter for a moment, let me know when you're done, and I have some questions for you.

194
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:15.910
P12: Okay.

195
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.040
P12: Yeah.

196
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:24.489
Renata: All right. So, in your own words, what is the purpose of the letter that you received?

197
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.230
P12: … It's just saying that they have some issues with

198
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:36.830
P12: During review of the claim, and they need additional information, and they're asking… Me to

199
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.669
P12: Submit the information that they need.

200
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.339
P12: And if I am not able to do so for whatever reason.

201
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:49.949
P12: That, I should let them know and give them the information of the person who might be able to assist.

202
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:54.319
P12: And then I also have a year to respond based off the date of the letter.

203
00:24:55.270 --> 00:25:13.780
Renata: All right, and I think you mentioned before that you received some correspondence from Champ VA with claims you filed previously. Is this similar to what you received before? Yes. Okay, got it. So what steps do you think you're going to need to take to resolve this issue with your claim at this point?

204
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:18.359
P12: So, if it's not on whatever paperwork I…

205
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.569
P12: initially sent in, I would call the doctor's office or the provider to get the diagnosis code.

206
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:31.370
Renata: Okay. Once you get that, that new diagnosis code, that new documentation, what would you do next?

207
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:33.530
P12: …

208
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:44.920
P12: Well, it's asking for attached the paperwork, so I guess it would just ask for the doctor to, you know, send me another

209
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.860
P12: Statements, not so much a bill, but a statement showing with the diagnosis code on there.

210
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:55.519
P12: Cause there's no space to complete that, it just asks for the diagnosis code.

211
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:56.820
Renata: Okay.

212
00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:08.259
P12: Got it. So you would just submit the whole packet back, whatever came with this letter, to that address on the letter, or how would you resubmit this information for your claim?

213
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:16.239
P12: With the address, because it doesn't say to call with information, it just says call if you have questions, so that's not the same as submitting.

214
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:29.740
Renata: Got it, okay. Couple more questions on this letter. On that 1 to 5 scale, 1 being poorly, 5 being very well, how well does this letter explain what you need to do in order to resolve the problem with your CHAMP VA claim?

215
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:32.429
P12: Mmm, I would say about a 3.

216
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:38.380
Renata: Alright, a 3. And what would take it from a 3 to that 5 are being very well explained?

217
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.219
P12: Well, maybe not explain as the issue, it's just…

218
00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:48.509
P12: or maybe I'm answering a question that you haven't asked, I would say it would…

219
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:55.519
P12: It would be easier if, in this case, a misdiagnosis code, it could just be a line in that…

220
00:26:55.790 --> 00:27:06.320
P12: to be completed and then sent back in, but that's not what the letter is stating. It's saying that they want the attached paperwork, they want the information, they want a copy of the letter.

221
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:10.749
P12: So it seems like it's just redundancy in that regards.

222
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:13.250
P12: So that's why I gave it a 3.

223
00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:21.679
Renata: Got it. So if it was just asking for, like, just the little snippet with the additional information that was missing, that would take it to a 5.

224
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.490
P12: Yeah.

225
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:33.570
Renata: Okay, got it. And second question for you, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being poorly, 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel to resolve this claim based on the letter's content?

226
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:35.110
P12: Bye.

227
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.940
Renata: Okay.

228
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:46.980
Renata: Got it. So I have a third link to share with you, in the Zoom chat, which I'm sharing now. If you could go ahead and open that in a new tab.

229
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.020
P12: Okay.

230
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.980
P12: Okay.

231
00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:14.769
Renata: And… that's not working. If you go up into the browser, into the URL, and delete introduction from that very long URL at the very end, so it just ends with 107959, let's see if that works.

232
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.899
Renata: We've been having some issues with this form this morning, I'm sorry.

233
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:27.370
Renata: Alright, let me see if I'm having the same problem.

234
00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:39.559
Renata: I apologize. … It's not even letting me open this.

235
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:48.210
Renata: Hmm, okay. … let's try…

236
00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:02.199
Renata: Wow, everything is freaking out on my side. Okay, let's try…

237
00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:09.050
Renata: They look identical, but this link seems to be working, so let's try the new one that I just dropped in.

238
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.670
P12: Nope. Nope, still getting an error.

239
00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:13.950
P12: ….

240
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.499
Renata: Okay… Let's see if the other link is working.

241
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:35.539
Renata: All right, so at this point, I'm gonna actually take over sharing screen, and I will just drive and have you, you just dictate while I go through this next section. Are you, are you cool with that?

242
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.440
P12: Yeah, do you want me to stop sharing mine?

243
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.850
Renata: Yes, please, yeah.

244
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:43.729
Renata: Alright, give me just a second to, …

245
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:52.070
Renata: Close out any additional tabs that I have open. Gonna close that… And close that.

246
00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.890
Renata: …

247
00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:12.709
Renata: Okay, so what you should be seeing on your screen looks a lot like the form we were looking at earlier. There's probably a bright green thing that says staging on it. Can you see that? Okay, perfect. So this is, the claims form that we looked at before. …

248
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:22.480
Renata: But looking at this page, and you can dictate when you'd like me to scroll up or down, do you think this is the right place to resubmit the claim you just received a letter for?

249
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:29.049
P12: Can you scroll up so I can see? Yeah, keep… I mean, down, scroll down.

250
00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.440
P12: Scroll down.

251
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.400
P12: Scroll down, scroll down… No.

252
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:47.279
Renata: Alright, and what information would you need to see here to let you know, like, I'm in the right place to resubmit the claim I got a letter for in the mail?

253
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.880
P12: Well, if I had that as one of the bullet points, …

254
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:57.879
P12: You know, you could use this as a resubmission or update of a previously submitted claim.

255
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.610
Renata: Okay, so right here, you'd want to see that.

256
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:08.369
Renata: Would you want to see anything in the letter that you received from Champ VA about your claim about being able to file online?

257
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:09.569
P12: Yes, I would love.

258
00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.360
Renata: Okay.

259
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:17.759
Renata: All right, any particular instructions that you would want to see in addition to the mail-in option on that letter?

260
00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:25.540
P12: … let's see… Typically…

261
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:35.960
P12: When they have an option online to upload, sometimes they'll even have an, like, an email that you can send and upload to.

262
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:44.980
P12: certain documents, so maybe even if it said… or even a fax, I know it's kind of old, but a lot of times now, the faxes are…

263
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:49.300
P12: e-fax, so maybe a fax number that would change into…

264
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.819
P12: A file that can be uploaded directly to the… to the claim.

265
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.589
Renata: Okay, got it. And what information do you think you'll need to resubmit your claim online?

266
00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:06.600
P12: I need the claim number that hopefully they gave at the end of the submission of the first claim.

267
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:15.929
P12: And maybe some other identifier, so you know that it's you submitted it, or, you know, that it's not confused with any other claim.

268
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:41.090
Renata: Okay, got it. So I'm going to scroll down and click that link that says start your form without signing in. So at this point, we're gonna start working on, resubmitting that medical claim you received the letter for. Same reminder, just to think out loud, we can use fake information, but I'm just gonna be driving, so you can just boss me around as we go through the form, let me know what you want to enter, where you want to click.

269
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:47.730
Renata: And I'll do it, and I'll let you know when we need a pause to ask some questions. But any questions for me before we do this?

270
00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:48.490
P12: No.

271
00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:54.829
Renata: All right, thank you for being flexible with us today. I'm sorry our site was being difficult. So what would you like me to do at this point?

272
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:58.210
P12: The first, option, I'm the beneficiary.

273
00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.770
Renata: Alright.

274
00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:02.330
P12: Yes.

275
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.410
P12: Resubmission for existing claims?

276
00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.139
P12: Continue, yeah.

277
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:17.070
Renata: Alright, and do you know what information is being asked for here?

278
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.260
P12: So that would be…

279
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:25.980
P12: Whichever number that they gave, we'll just say the claim number that they gave when you submitted the claim.

280
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.389
Renata: Okay, and do you know where to find that?

281
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.269
WaP12: It's on the letter that they sent requesting more information.

282
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:41.349
Renata: Okay, alright. I don't need you to, look that number up, I can put in a fake number here so that we're not opening more documents, …

283
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.920
Renata: Gonna click continue.

284
00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.270
P12: Medical.

285
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.579
P12: I don't know, Oak? Oak Street.

286
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:02.390
Renata: Alright.

287
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.830
P12: January 1st.

288
00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.820
P12: 2025.

289
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.460
P12: January 1st.

290
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.690
P12: 2025.

291
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.600
Renata: Okay…

292
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:24.280
Renata: And just review the information you see on your screen here, and then I have some questions for ya.

293
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:28.639
P12: Okay.

294
00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:35.179
Renata: So, again, in your own words, what are you being asked for on this page?

295
00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:42.689
P12: Copies of the documents with missing information they asked for, and everything I've already submitted.

296
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:55.060
Renata: Okay. So… is this what you were expecting when you saw the letter that you would need to provide to resubmit, or different? What were your expectations?

297
00:34:55.270 --> 00:35:00.559
P12: I wouldn't expect to have to resubmit all the documents that I already submitted.

298
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.530
P12: Again, redundancy.

299
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:06.449
P12: And… I mean, I guess this is just a general…

300
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:11.670
P12: statement or request, but I would think if it's certain information, again.

301
00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:27.100
P12: If they're just missing a diagnosis code, that's not really something that you need a document for, it's just, you get the code. Like I said, if I were to call my doctor and get a code, I would just type it in, but it seems like they want everything written out, so that's just…

302
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.199
P12: Just time consuming.

303
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:40.550
Renata: Okay, so in an ideal world, would you want the option to just manually input the DX code, or upload, or one or the other, you know, what would be best?

304
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:48.139
P12: Manual. Again, it depends on the information needed, so I know, like I said, this is probably just general, but if there's certain parts that can be…

305
00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:56.349
P12: completed with just completing a field. To me, that's… that's better than having to scan a copy of

306
00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:02.390
Wards-3: you know, the claim, or in this case, also resubmit everything I've already submitted.

307
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:14.029
Renata: Okay, got it. So I'm gonna scroll down, and I already have the files that I had you download. I have them downloaded. Hopefully, this works. So I am going to just…

308
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:32.099
Renata: grab a billing statement. We already saw that error message. This is just our testing tool, so like I said, we're gonna see some stuff that you wouldn't see in the normal, in… on BA.gov. But if you needed to upload multiple documents at this point, how would you upload additional files?

309
00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.719
P12: It has a button to upload another file.

310
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:36.579
Renata: Okay, this button right here?

311
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:48.920
Renata: All right, one more question for you on this page. On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to provide information related to your previous CHAM VA claim in this resubmission?

312
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:57.570
P12: I mean… 5 for, ease, but 3 for, like, how…

313
00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:03.600
P12: inconvenient it is, like, for the reasons I mentioned before, so I don't know how that would score.

314
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:11.749
Renata: We, you know, if it's… we're asking about the ease, you know, how difficult or easy it is, so it sounds like it's that… that 3.

315
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:26.830
Renata: All right. Okay, thank you for sharing that, and then we've already gone over the reasons why you'd like the ability to just share the one piece of information, or perhaps manually input it, right? Got it. Okay. I'm gonna click continue.

316
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.960
Renata: And why do you think you're being asked for this information at this point?

317
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:44.189
P12: because I'm, … I'm a benefit… I'm a… I'm a dependent, so they would need the sponsor's name to make sure I'm still eligible.

318
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.639
Renata: Okay, and let me know what you would like me to input here.

319
00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.010
P12: [NAME]

320
00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.190
Renata: Alright.

321
00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:00.850
P12: [NAME]

322
00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:04.729
P12: [DATE]

323
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.320
P12: [DATE]

324
00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.330
Renata: Alright….

325
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.190
P12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

326
00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:27.740
P12: USA… 1, 2, 3… Street.

327
00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.540
P12: … Indiana….

328
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.830
Renata: For the city or for the state? For the city?

329
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:40.470
Renata: Alright.

330
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:42.170
P12: Minnesota.

331
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.060
P12: 61333.

332
00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.310
Renata: Alright.

333
00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:55.790
P12: So

334
00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:05.320
P12: 773… 000 zero zero.

335
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:12.630
P12: [EMAIL]
336
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.410
Renata: Alright.

337
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:26.190
Renata: So, again, we're not going to submit the form, so this is going to be the last screen that we look at here. Would you do anything differently on this page, knowing that this is a resubmission versus that new claim?

338
00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:34.730
P12: … Well, can you scroll down? I don't think there's anything… Sweet.

339
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:37.890
P12: No, nothing different.

340
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:46.829
Renata: Okay. And without clicking anything, if we did submit this resubmission today, what would you expect to happen next? The same as with the initial claim, or different?

341
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.959
P12: Yes, the same, just, …

342
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:57.100
P12: An email acknowledging they received it, and … some kind of estimation on how long it would take to…

343
00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.839
P12: Review the resubmit info… the submitted information for the resubmitted claim.

344
00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:08.860
Renata: Okay, and would you expect any difference in the processing or response time with a resubmission versus that initial claim?

345
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:11.320
P12: Yeah, I would think it'd go a little bit quicker.

346
00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.269
Renata: Okay, quicker. So, what kind of a time frame are we talking about?

347
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:20.480
P12: I would say… Maybe 15 days?

348
00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.819
P12: Ideally, and 30 days max.

349
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:25.970
Renata: 30 days max. Alright.

350
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:36.310
Renata: Just a couple more questions for you here. So, 1 to 5 scale, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the resubmission form?

351
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.000
P12: 5

352
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:43.950
Renata: Alright, 5, very easy. What made it very easy to resubmit your claim?

353
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.259
P12: It was, like, the first claim, …

354
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.820
P12: I really didn't see much of a difference.

355
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.230
P12: So… I gave 5 before because it was fairly… You know, clear cut.

356
00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:04.190
Renata: Okay, so that leads into my next question. How would you compare the first claim you submitted today versus that resubmission, or the second claim?

357
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.400
P12: The same.

358
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:20.520
Renata: The same? All right. I am gonna stop sharing my screen at this point. Just a few more questions for you before we get to the end of our session. So, overall, was there anything that you saw in the forms or everything today that worked well for you?

359
00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:23.380
P12: …

360
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.440
P12: It was just not a lot of pa- not a lot of pages, I think it was 6…

361
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:41.099
P12: pages… And, … so not a whole lot of questions, and not a whole lot to fill out.

362
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:46.600
P12: And, … Yeah, so that… that… that's easy.

363
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:53.190
Renata: Okay, and was there anything that you saw in today's session that was unclear or that didn't work well for you?

364
00:41:54.280 --> 00:42:01.129
P12: I think on the initial claim, I didn't see it ask for the cost

365
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:09.089
P12: It's… it said it wanted that on the documentation, but it didn't ask for the cost, even though it asked… it mentioned diagnosis and such.

366
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.399
P12: Which is kind of, like, the whole point of submitting a claim. You're trying to get it paid.

367
00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:19.869
P12: to the insurer or yourself if you already paid it. So, you know.

368
00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.760
P12: it's just missing that part that I can… it kind of stuck out to me.

369
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:27.030
P12: …

370
00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:36.049
P12: Yeah, that's… yeah, that's about it. Like I said, besides the fact that it would be nice if you could…

371
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:46.190
P12: manually input some of the things, because some people don't have scanners or whatever to put the information in. A lot of the information that they're asking for

372
00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:51.280
P12: It could be inputted, input, manually, so….

373
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.850
Renata: Okay.

374
00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:56.340
P12: That would be a nice option if people couldn't scan their documents.

375
00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:04.360
Renata: Got it. And what are your thoughts about the amount of information in this form? Not enough, too much, just right?

376
00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.210
P12: Just right.

377
00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:15.059
Renata: Okay. And how would you compare the form that you just, filled out with your other experiences filling out and filing CHAMP VA claims previously?

378
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.549
P12: Oh, this is easier.

379
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:21.499
Renata: It is, okay. Anything in particular that made this easier than those prior experiences?

380
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:26.990
P12: Well, the fact that we had an online option… And, …

381
00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.460
P12: Yeah, I think that's the biggest thing, the fact that I had an online option.

382
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:34.720
Renata: Okay.

383
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:38.719
Renata: Got it. Any questions for me before we wrap up?

384
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.830
P12: No, Renata.

385
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:59.730
Renata: All right. I want to circle back and just reconfirm, would you be comfortable if we were to share a video clip of our session today with our VA partners? And just to remind you, we remove all information that can be used to identify you, like on-screen image and name, and we only share this internally with VA partners for the purposes of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

386
00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:02.060
P12: So…

387
00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:11.989
P12: I'm just gonna say how I feel about it. I don't mind internally, but if it's specifically the VA, I don't want any… my voice…

388
00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:18.770
P12: my name, any of that. But if it's just internal for your, you know, data process, that's fine.

389
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.940
Renata: Okay.

390
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:44.900
Renata: I… I completely understand that. Yeah, we will… we will keep it at using for internal for data analysis. Thank you for confirming that. So just to wrap up, I just want to say we really appreciate you taking time out of your day today to share your thoughts with us. This feedback is super helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for folks like you, so thank you. Lastly, Perigian will be sending you a little thank you note with a

391
00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:55.729
Renata: blurb on it you can pass along to veterans and their family members you may know, to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies. But with that, thank you so much again. Have a great rest of your day and your week!

392
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:56.920
P12: Thank you.

393
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.530
Renata: Alright, have a good one.

394
00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:59.150
P12: Bye.

395
00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:00.290
Renata: Bye.
