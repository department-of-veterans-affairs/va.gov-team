00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:13.340
Renata: All right, and if there's a bar atop the cross of your… wow, I can't… haven't had enough coffee today. Across the top of your screen that says, recording, and there's an OK button, you can just hit that OK.

2
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:22.830
Renata: So I've started the recording. I'm gonna confirm that you're okay. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

3
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.739
P10: Yes, I am.

4
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:33.060
Renata: All right. Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

5
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.240
P10: No problems.

6
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:45.160
Renata: Okay, so before we look at that demo tool I mentioned earlier, I'm just gonna start with some warm-up questions. Are you or anyone else in your household currently enrolled in the CHAMP VA program?

7
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.819
P10: Yes, my daughter and I both receive coverage under the program.

8
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.010
Renata: Okay, and how recently did you apply for the CHAMP VA program?

9
00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:05.889
P10: Let me see… it has to be right around after we got approved for the Caregiver Support Program, so I want to say within 6 months of being approved of that, that was maybe 2014.

10
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.910
Renata: Okay, alright, so you did Caregiver first. Did anybody tell you once you enrolled in Caregiver, like, you're eligible for this additional benefit?

11
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.049
P10: Yes, they did.

12
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:25.219
Renata: Okay, got it. So within 6 months of receiving the caregiver benefit, you were told to enroll. Do you remember what the application or enrollment experience was like?

13
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:43.819
P10: Vaguely, yes, it was honestly the application. It was a paper application at the time, 2 or 3 pages. It was… it was very simple. I didn't even need any help getting it in. I just made a copy and mailed it in and let the process go through. Within less than 60 days, I was already enrolled with my daughter, so it was very easy.

14
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.940
Renata: Oh, wow, great, that's great to hear. Have you or your daughter submitted any medical or pharmacy claims to the CHAMPVA program?

15
00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:04.589
P10: We did… we'd have the providers do it electronically. I did try to self-submit, and it was just more… it was way more trouble than it was worth. The hospital was very unwilling to give that… that UB92.

16
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:17.689
P10: So I ended up just giving them all the information, and they put it through without an issue. So, self-claim… self-claim… claiming is not something that I do. To me, it's just too time-consuming when the provider can do it themselves.

17
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.169
Renata: Got it, got it, yeah. Do you recall, was that back when it was a paper form that you were trying to do?

18
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.189
P10: Yes, yes. It was… it was the paper form.

19
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.939
Renata: Alright, got it. …

20
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:53.709
Renata: So, I just want to repeat back to make sure that my understanding is correct. So you tried doing the self-claim, it was just… there was a lot of back and forth with the hospital or the billing clinic, so you ended up just giving the information to them to handle it and file on your behalf. Got it, alright. Thank you for confirming. So at this point, we're going to look at that demo tool I mentioned before. I'm going to drop a link in the Zoom chat.

21
00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:01.980
Renata: I'd like you to open it in your browser and share your screen in Zoom, but just giving you a heads up now to close any other applications and silence notifications.

22
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.149
Renata: And then let me know when you're ready for that link.

23
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:17.569
P10: Okay, I am all logged out of everything. I shouldn't… I shouldn't get anything but the normal Dell notifications popping up. I still can't figure out how to disable those.

24
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.009
Renata: Yeah, that's totally fine. We just don't want, like, text messages flying across the screen or whatever.

25
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.910
P10: Sure, no, I'm well aware of that.

26
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.749
Renata: Alright, drop that in the chat, and then if you need any assistance with getting, your screen sharing, I can walk you through that.

27
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.020
P10: Okay, here we go.

28
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.199
P10: Let's see… Should know how to do that.

29
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.099
P10: There we go.

30
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.830
Renata: Alright, it's taking a second. Okay, I see it now.

31
00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:12.890
Renata: So before you start filling this form out, just some things to be aware of. So, like I mentioned before, this is a testing site. We're not actually submitting this form, so nothing we click on in it is going to have any bearing on your benefits. As you're going through the form today, you can feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions, like social security numbers, if you don't want to use real information.

32
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:23.980
Renata: You may be asked to upload some documents in this form. Perageian should have sent you an email that had some documents attached to have ready for today. Do you recall if you got that email?

33
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.970
P10: I did… I did get the email, and, I just haven't saved into the computer yet.

34
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:42.990
Renata: Okay, no trouble yet, just wanted to double check ahead of time. I also have links to those, but I'll remind you when we get to those upload pages. But we'd just like to double check before we get started. But any questions for me?

35
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:51.130
P10: No, it looks pretty… pretty self-explanatory. I like… I like that we're getting into the digital age and filing online. It just saves the paperwork, you know what I mean?

36
00:04:51.390 --> 00:05:01.390
Renata: Yeah, totally. Alright, so on this page, you can scroll up and down, but without clicking on anything yet, just review the information on this page, and let me know your initial thoughts.

37
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.500
P10: very succinct.

38
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.270
P10: Matter of fact, it gets right to the point.

39
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.380
Renata: Okay.

40
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.879
Renata: And in your own words, what type of form is this page describing?

41
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:24.000
P10: This is a claim form for, to filing… file a claim for reimbursement from any kind, like, a medical service, is what this says to me.

42
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.569
Renata: And you said medical service. Are there any other types of claims that you think you could file with this form?

43
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:44.819
P10: No. It's very… it's like I said, it's just very specific. Everything I've ever dealt with with the VA has always been, you literally need to have just the right form to do something, or go to just the right website. So, it falls in line with those parameters.

44
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.920
Renata: Got it. And what information do you think you'll need to fill out this form?

45
00:05:50.660 --> 00:06:06.080
P10: Honestly, I'm going to need the provider's information, any kind of patient information, like legal name, social security number, you know, the CHAMPA number, which is, I think it's our social security numbers, and information about the claim, like, things like that.

46
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.220
Renata: Okay.

47
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:15.680
Renata: And if you were filling this out for real on VA.gov today, would you have all that information on hand, or would you need to pause at this point to go collect it?

48
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.369
P10: Honestly, I would have it ready beforehand.

49
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:26.350
Renata: Okay, got it. So you would… you would check that list there of things you might need, and then… and go get it before starting the form.

50
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.780
P10: Yes, absolutely.

51
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:38.180
Renata: Alright, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel to file a claim based on the content on this page?

52
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:55.079
P10: I would say a 4, just in case, because there's always that, sometimes you don't have every… literally everything you need, sometimes you gotta make a call, but that's usually rare. I usually, like I said, when everything is just filed from the provider to CHAMPA, I'm not in the…

53
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.970
P10: self-service type, like, where I would file the claim myself, so… but this is, like I said, it's pretty self-explanatory.

54
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:13.960
Renata: Okay, so it sounds like you're giving it that 4 because there's always room for, like, one of the things your doctor's office sends you doesn't have the right information on it, and there's going to be some checking involved. Okay.

55
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:24.980
Renata: Got it. So at this point, I'm going to have you scroll down the page. At the bottom of that big blue box, there is a link that says, start your form without signing in, if you could click that for me.

56
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.990
P10: Okay.

57
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:38.339
Renata: All right, so just before you get started here, I'm gonna have you imagine that you are submitting a new medical claim for yourself using the form today, and I'll let you know when to pause, so I can ask you some questions.

58
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:48.560
Renata: But just as a reminder, this is the testing site. You can use fake information, and as you go through the form, please just remember to think out loud. We want to hear any reactions, as you're experiencing them.

59
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:49.920
P10: Gotcha.

60
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:57.040
P10: Okay… I like the simplicity of the wizard.

61
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.899
P10: it just takes you right through, step by step. That's what I've always appreciated about the VA.

62
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:08.199
P10: Let's see, a new claim… Okay. Sponsor's name.

63
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.660
P10: Let me see…

64
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.940
P10: Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.

65
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.030
P10: Hmm.

66
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.360
P10: Let's see…

67
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.690
P10: Right, don't put the dashes in.

68
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.409
P10: Let's see…

69
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:41.149
P10: Okay, I like the part where they ask about the mailing address, providing an opportunity to update.

70
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.970
Renata: Got it.

71
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.410
P10: Let's see….

72
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.629
Renata: So for today, I'm gonna have you select yes. Do you have secondary insurance?

73
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.290
P10: …

74
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:14.139
P10: We do, but it's like one of those medical bill-sharing communities, so it's not actually insurance. It's actually very specialized, like the CHAMPA program.

75
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:20.820
Renata: Interesting, okay. Yeah, I'm gonna have you select yes today, just curious about, … About that.

76
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.499
P10: Do not include CHAMPVA, okay.

77
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.179
P10: Let's just go with…

78
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.359
P10: Very easy to do.

79
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.040
Renata: Okay.

80
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.889
Renata: You can select a medical claim for this one.

81
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.090
P10: Okay… Okay.

82
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.489
P10: Checking for workers' comp.

83
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.150
P10: That's curious.

84
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:30.960
Renata: Alright, so before we do anything further, I'd just like you to review the information on this page, and then I'm going to ask you some questions.

85
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.500
P10: Sure.

86
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.490
P10: Technologist or so… The MPI number. Okay.

87
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.930
P10: Cuts, okay.

88
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:49.000
P10: Yeah, that looks like a UB92, or some variation of it, depending on where the provider's located.

89
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:55.240
P10: I like how it, … Tells you what file types are accepted and the size of the file.

90
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.430
Renata: Okay.

91
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.690
P10: Pretty good.

92
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.910
P10: Alright, ask away.

93
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:08.989
Renata: Okay, so do you understand, what document is being asked for here?

94
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:19.329
P10: Yes, it's the itemized billing statement, Super Bill, UB92, depending on who you talk to. It always has… it's very detailed with the diagnosis codes.

95
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:26.780
Renata: Got it. So in your own words, what needs to be included on the document? I heard you mention diagnosis code. Anything else?

96
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:44.910
P10: the patient or client being treated, exactly what services were rendered, and it needs to have all of the provider's information, from their NPI to their tax ID, and the date of services. Of course, it's always very important, especially when you're submitting a claim. I think it's within a year

97
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.800
P10: Or… insurance will not pay out.

98
00:12:48.360 --> 00:13:00.400
Renata: Okay, got it. So at this point, we're going to need, those files that, Shannon at Paragian sent you. Do you have a way to save them to your desktop now?

99
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:06.930
P10: Unfortunately, I've already logged out of my email. If you want to send me the links, then I'll just save them to the desktop.

100
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:15.160
Renata: That is not a problem at all. So I'm going to drop some additional links in the chat. I just need to pull it up.

101
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.090
P10: Gotcha.

102
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.530
Renata: Alright, so, … Sent you one….

103
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.730
P10: link.

104
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.050
P10: Gotcha.

105
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:30.029
Renata: And then once that one has been saved to your desktop, I will have a second link, for you to download and…

106
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.850
Renata: Gotcha. ….

107
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.330
P10: Let's see, here we go.

108
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.370
P10: Okay.

109
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.030
P10: Second… go.

110
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.080
Renata: If you go to the, yeah, top right corner, yeah, that one.

111
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:47.990
P10: Sure.

112
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.150
P10: There we go.

113
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.480
Renata: Alright.

114
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:59.680
Renata: And then if you can navigate back to the Zoom chat once you've got that saved to your desktop, I will drop in the next link.

115
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:00.940
P10: Gotcha.

116
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.780
P10: There we go.

117
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:15.319
Renata: Alright, so I dropped in a second link in the Zoom chat. I'm gonna have you just download both of these right now, so that, we don't have to do any more back and forth.

118
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:16.820
P10: Gotcha.

119
00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:32.330
Renata: And yeah, once that's downloaded, you can go back to the form where you were filling it out.

120
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:44.799
Renata: All right, so at this point, I'd like you to upload the document that you saved that was called Sample Billing Statement. It should have been the first file that you downloaded.

121
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.550
P10: Gotcha.

122
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.440
P10: Yeah, that one right there.

123
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.120
P10: Alright….

124
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:08.199
Renata: So, I just want to draw your attention to that little yellow box right there. What do you think this error message means that you're seeing?

125
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:18.009
P10: Well, let's see, if they can't verify the file. Honestly, simplistically, it's in either a file type that cannot be accepted, or it's too big.

126
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:23.569
Renata: Okay, got it. And what would you need to do to resolve the issue at this point?

127
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:36.850
P10: Yeah, that's a… that's a good question. Probably go back to the provider, and maybe ask either for a paper copy that I can scan in with my scanner, and I can choose a compressed file type, or ask them to just resubmit it to me.

128
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:37.580
Renata: Okay.

129
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:47.190
Renata: Got it. And if you could bypass this and sort of keep going and submit the form without resolving anything, would you do that, or would you genuinely, like, hard stop here and call the doctors.

130
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:57.769
P10: Honestly, I would… I would hard stop, because I know if… if I submit this and not everything is needed, I'm gonna have to go back and resubmit. It's just gonna delay the claim being paid out properly.

131
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:09.729
Renata: Okay, got it. Because this is our test form, in our demo tool, we are going to bypass the error, but I did want to ask about what you would do if this was for real on VA.gov, so you can go ahead and click that continue button.

132
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:17.979
Renata: Okay. And once again, just review this page, and then I'm gonna ask some questions, once you've had a chance to look at everything.

133
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.000
P10: Okay.

134
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.780
P10: Okay, like the little blue box at the end, helping to reduce errors.

135
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.889
P10: Works for me.

136
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.000
P10: Very straightforward.

137
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:49.890
Renata: Alright, so same question as the last page. What document are you being asked for on this page?

138
00:16:50.420 --> 00:17:01.450
P10: let's see… the EOB, or Explanation of Benefits, Christian Care Ministries, they would call it an explanation of sharing. They're, like I said, their terminology is different because they're not traditional insurance, so….

139
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:09.239
Renata: Okay. Since they're not traditional insurance, do they explain how some of their terminology, like, maps to traditional health.

140
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:24.740
P10: They will. The EOBs and the EOS are actually very similar in setup, and they did that so providers would not struggle submitting claims. You wouldn't have to resubmit them five times in a row, just to make it… just to make it easier.

141
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:30.139
P10: Gotcha, gotcha. The format's the same, the information's the same. They're just different names, if you will.

142
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:45.640
Renata: Yeah, yeah, I'm just always curious, like, how… whether the terminology maps, like, one-to-one, so thank you for explaining that. So what do you think needs to be included in that, explanation of sharing, or explanation of benefits that's being asked for here?

143
00:17:46.100 --> 00:18:00.449
P10: Date of service, healthcare provider's information, and any services they performed, and if anything's been paid, say, by another insurance, that definitely should be noted on that, depending on the processing, which is first.

144
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:10.629
P10: I believe I'm correct, CHAMPVA's usually a secondary, so any kind of discount program, any coupons or whatever, that needs to be applied first.

145
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:20.399
Renata: Okay, got it. So you can go ahead and scroll down, and I'm gonna have you upload the other document I asked you to download. It's called Sample EOB, parentheses 1.

146
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.690
P10: God.

147
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:28.290
P10: Okay.

148
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:46.609
Renata: Alright, so we're seeing that error message again, that's just part of our test system, but I have a couple questions for you before we keep going in the form. So, based on your experience uploading files for your claim today, do you prefer having that file verification, that blue and yellow box, or would you prefer no file verification in this form?

149
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:58.809
P10: Honestly, I would prefer the file verification, because if it's not getting uploaded for some reason, that means something is up. Either it's not in the right file format, or it's actually missing information that's needed.

150
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:11.289
Renata: Okay, and would you want any more explanation in the blue or yellow box about what's happening, the error that's occurring, or are you fine with the amount of information that's being provided right here?

151
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:18.560
P10: Honestly, a specific reason would help, because given the reason, that would show… that would show me how to maybe proceed.

152
00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:30.839
Renata: Okay, got it. One more question for you on this page. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard, and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy is it to upload files to support your CHAMP VA claim?

153
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:43.970
P10: Very easy. As long as you follow those parameters, it really isn't that hard. Just to me, make sure to save the document in a place where you can easily pull it. Like I said, I put it on the desktop and gave it a very recognizable file name.

154
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.950
Renata: Got it, okay. So you can go ahead and click continue now.

155
00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:58.940
Renata: So, as I mentioned before, we're not actually submitting this, so this is going to be the last page we look at in this form, but I'd just like you to review the claim that you filled out, and then I'm going to ask you a couple of more questions.

156
00:19:58.940 --> 00:19:59.750
P10: Sure.

157
00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.489
P10: All right.

158
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:34.679
Renata: Okay, so without clicking anything, if you actually did submit the form today, what would you expect to happen next?

159
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:43.530
P10: Honestly, after reviewing it, signing and dating it, and submitting it, I would expect to maybe receive a confirmation email of submission.

160
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:52.119
P10: And then, depending on the form of communication back from Champa Selected, I would either expect a letter or an email stating.

161
00:20:52.300 --> 00:21:12.139
P10: it's in process, and maybe giving status updates, at least when the claim is completed, something by email. Like I said, I see the shift to the digital, and the heavy encryption, the simplicity of the form, it's all… it's… I've been wanting this for ages. Digital, just like I said, it just, to me, it makes it easier.

162
00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:21.559
Renata: Yeah, I hear you on that. So, I think I heard you say you'd either receive a letter or an email. Is that something where you want to indicate a preference, or do you think it could go either way?

163
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:39.810
P10: You know, I think it could go either way. I mean, the older… the older generations than myself, I mean, I just turned 40 myself this year, but I still grew up in the 90s and in the digital age as a millennial. I would prefer it by email. I do paperless whenever I can, because it reduces the turnaround time.

164
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.929
P10: And it saves… to me, it saves money for paper.

165
00:21:43.960 --> 00:22:00.890
Renata: Yeah, yeah. And you also mentioned, like, in that notification that you'd get by email or letter, some sort of processing time and maybe a way to check on the status. If you could check the status of a claim before a decision on it was made, where would you expect to find that?

166
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:20.269
P10: I would say through a CHAMPA health portal, something that you would have a user ID and password. I honestly have it with my medical coverage. Hospital systems offer a health portal, so through there, maybe, like, the… almost like the BARD timeline you see underneath filing a CHAMPA claim, showing kind of where you are in processing.

167
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.570
P10: That does help.

168
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:29.649
Renata: Okay, and how long do you think it would take Champ VA to process a claim and make a decision on it?

169
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:37.070
P10: If they had everything they needed, I would say maybe 30 to 90 days, which seems standard for insurance.

170
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:45.170
Renata: Okay, that's standard. Is that, like, an ideal world for you that you would expect it in 30 to 90 days, or is that kind of the realistic expectation?

171
00:22:45.510 --> 00:23:03.259
P10: To me, that is ideal. With Champa and the… like I said, we're, you know, we're trying to switch to a digital age. I think there's a lot of stuff going on with the new administration. I've honestly noticed claims do take longer, depending on how they're submitted. But if it's a clean claim.

172
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.800
P10: I would say 6 months at the most.

173
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.310
Renata: Okay. Would be… Okay, alright.

174
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.020
P10: To me, that would be reasonable.

175
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:19.079
Renata: Alright, so I'm hearing 30 to 90 days is, like, is, like, a good… a good amount of time, but if we hit 6 months, then… then it's, like.

176
00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:31.040
P10: We're starting to get into why, like, are we actually missing something? Did they lose, you know… Okay. Like I said, with digital, you don't have a chance of it getting lost in the mail, but even with digital, there's more room for error.

177
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.569
Renata: Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

178
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:33.750
P10: Things happen, you know?

179
00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:41.200
Renata: Yeah, so, at this point, I'm gonna drop another link in the chat, which I would like you to open in a new tab.

180
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.100
P10: Sure.

181
00:23:48.560 --> 00:24:03.440
Renata: Actually, I just realized I did not finish all of my questions about that other form. So one last question about the form that's in the other tab that we just were looking at. 1 to 5, 1 being hard, 5 being easy. How difficult or easy was it to fill out the Champ VA claim form?

182
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:15.199
P10: 5. Super easy. Honestly, it was easier with CHAMPA than with other medical providers I've had through past employers. I mean, they just… they overcomplicated it, I think, but this is very simple.

183
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:30.309
Renata: Okay, great, thank you for that feedback. All right, we can go back to the other tab. I'm sorry, caffeine is kicking in as we're speaking. So, I'm gonna have you imagine that, you did submit that claim in the other tab. It's been about, you know,

184
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:38.269
Renata: … Shoot. … Hold on a second, looks like I sent you the wrong…

185
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.950
Renata: Link. We have many links, in case you haven't noticed.

186
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:44.510
P10: Yes.

187
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:49.079
Renata: Try clicking the new one that I just sent you. There we go.

188
00:24:51.520 --> 00:25:04.800
Renata: In the chat. There we go. Alright, so I'm gonna have you imagine we did submit that claim, it's been 30 days, and you received this letter in the mail about your claim. I'd like you to just read through this and let me know when you're finished reading it, and I'm gonna ask you some questions.

189
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.740
P10: Okay.

190
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:29.410
P10: right off the bat, I like that I don't have the requested documentation to require assistance to obtain it. I've had doctor's offices, literally, I submitted a request for records and got completely ignored. So having that checkbox is actually very reassuring. I like the simplicity of the letter, definitely.

191
00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:30.650
Renata: Alright.

192
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:35.349
Renata: That is great feedback. Anything else, you want to share before I ask some questions?

193
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.860
P10: No, that was it.

194
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:42.489
Renata: Okay, so in your own words, what is the purpose of the letter that you received?

195
00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:47.380
P10: To inform the client that there is information missing.

196
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:54.640
Renata: Okay. So what do you think you're going to need to do to resolve this issue with your claim?

197
00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:14.990
P10: well, let's see, I mean, look up the claim information, look again at, say, the UB92 or the Super Bill, and see what's missing. You know, again, everybody… there's room for error. Doctors make mistakes. If it's missing it. I would try to call and handle it myself, but again, if I get any kind of

198
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:35.350
P10: I don't know, problem. I would just check that box. Before trying, like, submitting that letter, I would try to get the information myself. But again, knowing that window of, like, you have a year to get that service covered by insurance, or they could… well, they're gonna come after you for the money, one way or the other, because they need to get paid.

199
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:44.650
P10: So, to me, I'll call and try to deal with it myself, or if I just see if it's just missing and I know they're just gonna give me a problem, I'll just check that box and return the letter.

200
00:26:45.120 --> 00:27:02.280
Renata: Alright, so let's imagine you did call your doctor's office, you said, hey, those codes were missing, and they're being incredibly reasonable, and they send you a new, you know, itemized billing statement that has those codes on it. What are you going to do in order to resolve this with CHAMPVA so they can finish processing your claim?

201
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.010
P10: Let's see.

202
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:08.529
P10: at least refer to the copy of the letter if I had any further questions, I would just call customer service.

203
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:17.780
P10: and just say I have this to submit, how exactly could I do it? I would maybe ask, could I fax it or scan it in, maybe to get it a little bit faster than the mail.

204
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:26.089
Renata: Okay, if you could submit that missing information online, would you prefer to do that over the snail mail submission?

205
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:30.849
P10: Yes. Just, again, you don't have to pay for postage, and it's just faster.

206
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:40.210
Renata: All right, and if that online submission option was available, would you want to see steps in this letter to explain where to go to do that online?

207
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:45.870
P10: I would say, especially for people just, again, older people that don't really use the internet very much.

208
00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:57.960
P10: even people like myself, we just… sometimes we need it spelled out for us, so it's just easy. So we don't… that eliminates maybe having to call customer service and ask an agent to walk you through those steps.

209
00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:10.620
Renata: Got it. Alright, couple more questions on this letter. On a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being poorly, 5 being very well, how well does this letter explain what you need to do in order to resolve the problem with your CHAMFA claim?

210
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.920
P10: 5 very well.

211
00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:22.730
Renata: Okay, and second scale question, same 1 to 5, 1 being poorly, 5 being very well. How prepared do you feel to resolve this claim based on the letter's content?

212
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:31.500
P10: very prepared. Like I said, it's just… it just spells it out in plain English, what is needed and how to ask for help, and again, the reassuring checkbox.

213
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:39.559
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. So, I'm gonna drop one last link in the Zoom chat that I'd like you to open in a new tab.

214
00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:02.889
Renata: Alright, so this is the form that we used before, but looking at this page again, do you think you're in the right place to resubmit your claim?

215
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.969
P10: No, to me, it would have resubmission of a CHAMPA claim or something like that.

216
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:13.830
Renata: Okay, where would you put that on this page to let you know, like, I am definitely in the right spot?

217
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:18.059
P10: Honestly, right up top in bold, right where it says to file a JAMPA claim.

218
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:24.050
Renata: Alright, got it. And what information do you think you're going to need to resubmit the claim?

219
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:34.479
P10: perhaps that letter, the new bill with all of the information, and again, any information that I had before, just in case it's asked for again. Patient name.

220
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:45.030
Renata: Alrighty. So I'm gonna have you scroll back down the page, and once again, click on that link at the bottom of the big blue box. Thank you.

221
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:59.690
Renata: Alright, so at this point, I'm going to have you go through this form as though you are resubmitting that claim that you received a letter about from CHAMP VA, and again, I'll let you know when we're pausing to ask some questions, but just again, remember to think out loud, use fake information, all of that.

222
00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:00.960
P10: Gotcha.

223
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.640
P10: Resubmission… okay.

224
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.190
Renata: And do you know what information you're being asked for here?

225
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:22.849
P10: Claim identification number, usually it's in the top right, kind of like an account number.

226
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:27.450
Renata: Okay, so top right of, of what, exactly?

227
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.910
P10: Of the bill itself.

228
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:33.489
Renata: Oh, okay, alright. So you would find that on the billing statement from your doctor.

229
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.900
P10: Yes, to me, that's exactly where it would be.

230
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:40.320
Renata: Got it, okay. Yeah, and go ahead and use fake information as you have here.

231
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.010
P10: Gotcha.

232
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.250
P10: Gotcha.

233
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:56.200
P10: Let's just say… January 25th.

234
00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:16.609
Renata: Alright, so just review this page, let me know what it's asking for in your own words.

235
00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:24.580
P10: Let's see… it is asking… as this is a resubmission, it is asking for the corrected super bill.

236
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.739
Renata: Okay. So I would, again, save it in a very easy place with a recognizable file name.

237
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.450
P10: And upload it per those parameters for uploading files.

238
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:41.039
Renata: Got it. So you can go ahead and upload either of the two documents I already had you save, doesn't matter since this is just a test.

239
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:42.450
P10: Gotcha.

240
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:52.239
Renata: And if you needed to, how would you upload another file to support your resubmission?

241
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.800
P10: Click Upload Another File.

242
00:31:54.940 --> 00:32:05.959
Renata: All right, one more question for you on this page. 1 to 5 scale, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy is it to provide information related to your previous CHAMFA claim?

243
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:09.540
P10: I would say 5. It's still just as easy.

244
00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.979
Renata: Okay, got it. You can go ahead and click continue.

245
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:26.639
Renata: Jen, why do you think you're being asked for this information, just out of curiosity?

246
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.550
P10: They are using it to verify my…

247
00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:39.899
P10: eligibility for the CHAMPVA program. I am asked this… I've been asked this so many times since I got enrolled in CHAMPVA, I'm just used to giving it out. It's to confirm that eligibility.

248
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.790
Renata: Got it. Alright, thank you.

249
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.340
P10: Excellent.

250
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:55.439
Renata: All right, so again, we're not gonna actually submit the form, so I'm just gonna have you review this, and then let me know when you are ready to answer some more questions.

251
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:06.720
P10: Okay.

252
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:07.760
P10: It's all set.

253
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:18.979
Renata: All right, so, before we get to the final questions here, anything confusing, unusual, unexpected that stood out to you during the resubmission flow that you just did?

254
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.460
P10: No, nothing at all.

255
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:28.309
Renata: Alright, and then on this review page, would you do anything differently here, knowing that this is a resubmission as opposed to an initial claim?

256
00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:35.879
P10: more carefully review it to make sure, so I don't… again, so I don't have to go through the process again. Hopefully, everything is correct.

257
00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:42.869
Renata: Got it. I'm sorry if you can hear my dog. He decided at this very moment to become a huge problem.

258
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:48.050
P10: I've got 3… I've got 3 families with 3 barking… they bark at every leaf that moves, so I totally get it.

259
00:34:48.360 --> 00:35:00.230
Renata: Yeah, yeah, they know, they just know. So, without clicking on anything, if you were submitting this, resubmission claim, what would you expect to happen next? Anything different, the same as an initial claim?

260
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:24.380
P10: honestly, the same, some kind of acknowledgement email that it's been received, like, say, when you pay your utility bill, you get a receipt of sorts in the mail. And again, going through a health portal of some kind, which is… I think that's what I'm seeing here, is we're building toward an online profile where you can submit, check the status, issue a payments, maybe, in the future. So, that's what I would do, that's what I would expect.

261
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:31.170
Renata: Got it. And in terms of processing a response time, would you expect it to be the same, faster, slower.

262
00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:37.720
P10: Honestly, I would expect the same time frame. It might even take a little bit longer, because they're making sure the information is correct.

263
00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:46.340
Renata: Okay, longer. So, in your initial claim, you said 30 to 90 days, but, like, up to 60, so where would you put the resubmission on that timeline?

264
00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:57.470
P10: honestly, maybe 180 days, perhaps an extra month, because obviously they get thousands… I'm gonna guess that at least thousands of claims a day, if not more.

265
00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.380
P10: And there's only so many processors to go around.

266
00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:10.110
Renata: Got it. So, like I said, we're not going to be submitting this, this test form, so you can stop screen sharing now, and I just have a few more questions for you to wrap up.

267
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.390
P10: Alright, alright.

268
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:23.059
Renata: So, one last question about the form, we just didn't need it up at this point, but that 1 to 5 scale again, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to complete the resubmission form?

269
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.580
P10: Very easy. Five.

270
00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:32.380
Renata: Okay, and how would you compare the initial claim to the resubmission claim? Same, different?

271
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:39.959
P10: I would say same. It's pretty much the same process, you're just resubmitting, you're uploading a new and changed document.

272
00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:40.890
Renata: Okay.

273
00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:46.779
Renata: Got it. So overall, was there anything that you saw in the session today that worked really well for you?

274
00:36:47.240 --> 00:37:02.290
P10: Just honestly the usability of the website. It's so much… sometimes I feel like dealing with VA forms is much easier than dealing with anybody else. Everybody's usually slightly different. I've had… sometimes I feel like I have to give them a blood sample.

275
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:13.719
P10: to actually get something done. But this is very… this is very user-friendly, and it doesn't… it seems like we're trying to shorten processing times and, you know, get things a little more streamlined, which I appreciate that, too.

276
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:20.660
Renata: Got it, thank you for sharing. Was there anything unclear or that did not work well for you that you saw today?

277
00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.979
P10: Not really.

278
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:26.869
P10: honestly, zero. Because, again, it was just easy. It wasn't, you know.

279
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:36.309
P10: a perfect experience, but more so because of my typing, because I'm trying to use keyboard shortcuts and the mouse at the same time. I need to, you know, pick one.

280
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:44.730
Renata: I totally get it. What were your thoughts about the amount of information provided in the form? Not enough? Too much? Just right?

281
00:37:44.730 --> 00:38:01.869
P10: It was a… [NAME], I'm in the middle of a study. It's okay, that's… there's my husband. Inopportune times. I mean, I think they asked for all of the information they needed without, like I said, asking for a blood sample, you know? We're not submitting for a treaty here, we're just filling out a medical claim.

282
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:08.939
Renata: Okay, and how would you compare this to the previous time that you attempted to fill out a CHAMP VA claim form?

283
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.220
P10: Oh, God, a hell of a lot easier.

284
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:26.340
P10: Honestly, I think the paper form, it just made it so much harder. And it was after I had… I was resubmitting for, like, the third time, so your frustration grows, because you're literally giving them everything you have, and it's still getting, you know, returned back to you.

285
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:31.240
Renata: Yeah. Have you ever gotten a letter like the one that I showed you today from CHAMPVA?

286
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:45.999
P10: You know, I've maybe got one or two, but those were on the self-submitted claims. Once I started having the provider do it directly, and if they still had an issue, they reached out to me, it was usually because they were trying to charge Champa first.

287
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:52.369
P10: Even though I told them it's sec- secondary means you do it after the primary insurance.

288
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.280
P10: But that's just me.

289
00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:53.770
Renata: got it.

290
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:54.360
P10: Without trying….

291
00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:54.839
Renata: I could be.

292
00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:01.189
P10: at that point, I was probably being rude, but sometimes you just, you gotta say, people can.

293
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.580
Renata: Yeah.

294
00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:05.519
P10: Fortunately, people can be stupid, even when it's right in front of them, so….

295
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:20.899
Renata: Yeah, yeah. So if, in the future, would you… would you ever use an online form like this? I know that the last time that we talked about the submitting… self-submitted claims, it was just… it was such a hassle that you gave it over to the providers to do.

296
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:31.510
P10: I would… I would actually be more willing to try to do it on… on my own. I mean, honestly, other than yearly physicals, we really don't go to the doctor unless we're sick.

297
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:37.439
P10: So, if it was me, I would probably do it myself. If I was working.

298
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.519
P10: I might actually have the provider still do it.

299
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:45.119
Renata: Got it, alright. Any questions for me before we wrap up?

300
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.160
P10: No, very, very simple.

301
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:49.360
Renata: I could eat.

302
00:39:49.530 --> 00:40:03.160
Renata: Well, we're very glad that you could make some time today. I know that you're really busy, and there's a lot going on, so we really appreciate it. I just wanted to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.

303
00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.160
P10: Very comfortable, whatever helps.

304
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:10.170
Renata: Right. And is there any part of the discussion today you would not want shared in a video clip?

305
00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.470
P10: Not really. I was pretty… I was pretty general with what I said.

306
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:28.569
Renata: Okay, and again, we remove any identifying information in the clips, like your name and on-screen image and all of that, so… and if you do change your mind, you can just, email Paragian, the folks who emailed you to set up this, session today, and let them know. Sure.

307
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:53.530
Renata: But with that, I just wanted to say thank you for genuinely taking time out of your day today, to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so, so helpful to us as we're working to make the site better and work for everybody. So thank you. Lastly, Paragian's gonna be sending you a thank you note with just a little blurb in it. You can pass it along to veterans and their family members you may know, so that you can provide them the chance to participate

308
00:40:53.530 --> 00:41:00.170
Renata: in future research studies like this one. But with that, thank you so much again. Have a really great rest of your day and week.

309
00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.020
P10: Thank you, you too.

310
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.319
Renata: All right, take care.

311
00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.060
P10: Alright, thanks, you too. Bye.

312
00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:05.700
Renata: Bye.
