Jamie Fiore: Okay, we are recording if you do see a bar at the top that says this meeting is being recorded, you could just hit the okay button just to get rid of that bar. Sometimes it blocks the the screen.

2
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.610
Jamie Fiore: and then I'm going to ask you those 2 questions again.

3
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.470
Jamie Fiore: So I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

4
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:45.359
Jamie Fiore: Okay, and are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion to share with our Va partners. If we remove any information that can be identified, do you.

5
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.580
P4: Yes.

6
00:00:46.990 --> 00:01:00.060
Jamie Fiore: All right, great, all right. We got that out of the way. So just before we jump in, I just got a few questions for you? Are you or anyone else in your household, currently enrolled in chant Va.

7
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.350

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.489
Jamie Fiore: Okay. And how was that experience? If you remember?

11
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.580
P4: It was the the website. I think

12
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.759
P4: it. I mean, we we got the task of finished. But

13
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.150
P4: I think the the documents gathering ahead of time. I think that that can be improved.

14
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.265
P4: Okay.

15
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.649
Jamie Fiore: Like, what? What kind of things do you think would help that and help your experience be better.

16
00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:05.890
P4: I think, gathering like marriage certificate the information about the veteran.

17
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.639
P4: You know that that

18
00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.819
P4: some sort of information that I'm I'm looking for before I start the application might might help.

19
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.219
Jamie Fiore: Okay. So you want to be notified before what? What all needs to happen and be gathered.

20
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.460
P4: Yes.

21
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.449

22
00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:34.059
P4: Not not yet.

23
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.040

28
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.650
P4: I think that part. It's okay with Id, dot. Me.

29
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.910
P4: But I I think I'm just

30
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:42.349
P4: yeah. I think if my phone or anything ever you know, be out of service, I think that's I'm not sure how how I would be able to get in at that point.

31
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.199

P4: Hmm, no, I I would have to check the receipt

86
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.150
P4: if it's 1 year or not.

87
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.590
Jamie Fiore: And.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:01.310
P4: Cause.

89
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.659
P4: I think you know I wouldn't start it if I

90
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:12.389

P4: It does a way to

98
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:54.790
P4: search the service, or what they call a...I believe ICD code full problem

99
00:11:55.030 --> 00:12:04.570
P4: for medical service. I mean the way most private provider

100
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.780

P4: you know how they format.

145
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.740

151
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.079
Rach.: they can scan for these things, and then tell me you know what else I need.

152
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.220
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

153
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.120
P4: Oh!

154
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:51.589
Jamie Fiore: Well, that that's perfect. We could go ahead and try to do that. That upload tool there. So if you have those documents that Perigean sent you. I'd like you to upload the one named Sample billing statement here.

155
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.009
Jamie Fiore: Do you notice anything on this page that happened.

156
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:39.660
P4: and let me, it said, we cannot verify so, but

157
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:47.380
P4: that's not really telling me what them what I can do to resolve it. Making a complete verification.

158
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:55.739
Jamie Fiore: So how would you improve this like? What would you need to know if you you were sent back that message that they can't verify it.

159
00:20:57.598 --> 00:21:01.900
P4: Maybe a list of options of what I can. I can do.

160
00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.870
Jamie Fiore: So what would you do in this this moment if it's not giving you much information.

161
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.420
P4: I would, I don't know.

162
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:19.180
P4: or go line by line to check.

163
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:23.019
P4: and then reference it to make sure it have all these.

164
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:23.990
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

165
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.440
P4: Manually, which?

166
00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:30.860
P4: Yeah, that could be another pain point.

167
00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:44.340
P4: What else? We cannot complete. I'll maybe go.

168
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:50.309
P4: you know, back to the form to make sure I enter everything correctly.

169
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:56.160
P4: But I don't know the the tool. I'm not sure if it's checking.

170
00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:02.350
P4: You know the file here versus what I've input earlier in the form.

171
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.219
Jamie Fiore: Oh, okay.

172
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:09.839
P4: There's maybe, you know, like, for example, I put Jane, you know, maybe in here.

173
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:16.919
P4: I don't know. I don't know. The tool is is that intuitive, or that intelligent, to

174
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.590
P4: to do that kind of checking.

175
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:26.960
Jamie Fiore: Okay, no, that's a fair assumption. Yeah, so

176
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:37.130
Jamie Fiore: you can actually just go ahead and hit continue like I said, it's a prototype. So it's not really doing much here. Then, yeah.

177
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:45.949
Jamie Fiore: alright. And then same thing on here. Just want you to read through and just let me know what do you think it's asking for?

178
00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:05.860
P4: Oh, okay, so this one looks like it's asking for an eob from the my other insurer, my insurer.

179
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.839
P4: us family, that I put in.

180
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:11.240
Jamie Fiore: Great.

181
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.679
P4: And they need to see these things.

182
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.760
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

183
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.100
Jamie Fiore: you could go ahead and upload that second Pdf, that was given to you labeled like sample eob. I believe it says.

184
00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.259
Jamie Fiore: and we'll see what happens when you upload here.

185
00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:48.859
P4: Again.

186
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:51.950
P4: I guess the same error here.

187
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:52.560
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

188
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:59.380
Jamie Fiore: so what would you do now? You saw 2 errors. How would you react to this? What would your next steps be?

189
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.090
P4: Yeah. Just trying to read whatever message.

190
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:14.759
P4: Maybe something red, maybe like the color red. Just to jump out to tell me.

191
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.800
P4: Need to do or what's missing

192
00:24:18.675 --> 00:24:22.350
P4: the wording. Sometimes I'm not sure what

193
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:27.180
P4: what the you know meeting documents require really mean

194
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:33.800
P4: it could be. I don't know the format size.

195
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.729
P4: Sometimes I've I've scanned and upload

196
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:45.129
P4: to other portals before with it doesn't like it when it's too too big.

197
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:47.380
P4: Size. Wise.

198
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.600
P4: What else?

199
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.510
P4: Yeah, I would say it here.

200
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:04.669
P4: So yeah, I guess the next thing just check the size. Okay, file.

201
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:06.850
P4: See?

202
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.399
Jamie Fiore: Sounds good some some good next steps here.

203
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:21.040
Jamie Fiore: So based on your experience uploading these supporting documents today.

204
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:30.589
Jamie Fiore: would you prefer there be some sort of file verification that is on here, or would you prefer no file verification.

205
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:39.380
P4: Of I would. No, I would prefer here, cause I guess the

206
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:45.550
P4: the evaluation or checking later, can either delay the claim.

207
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.610
P4: You know the payment or the decision.

208
00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:50.340
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

209
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.739
P4: I would.

210
00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:06.785
P4: Maybe by default. Yes, but then maybe give the option of, you know override to to

211
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.510
P4: to still submit.

212
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.880
P4: So just foregoing what those checks mean.

213
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:25.209
Jamie Fiore: Okay, excellent on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult do you think it was to upload these files to support your claim.

214
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.009
P4: 4!

215
00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:30.380
Jamie Fiore: 4.

216
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:35.259
Jamie Fiore: Okay, what would what would be like the tipping point to bring it from a 4 to a 5.

217
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:41.720
Jamie Fiore: If you could wave a magic wand and change something on here to make it the perfect experience. What would that be?

218
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:52.330
P4: Maybe you know, seeing the tool live what what it's doing?

219
00:26:55.340 --> 00:27:02.680
P4: Like the scanning, just to show me what what it's checking for.

220
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:03.390
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

221
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:09.760
P4: And you know, maybe highlight the part of the form to show me what what it's looking for, or what

222
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:15.849
P4: what problems with the form like, you know. Let's just say

223
00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.699
P4: I don't know my name on that. Pdf.

224
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.510
P4: Is wrong.

225
00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:27.159
P4: you know. I wanted to yell at me to say, you know, hey? It's not matching things like that.

226
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.120
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

227
00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.619
Jamie Fiore: So something more specific and clear on

228
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:37.949
Jamie Fiore: what what it's doing and what went wrong. That makes a lot of sense

229
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:43.610
Jamie Fiore: awesome. So you can go ahead and scroll down to the bottom, hit the continue button.

230
00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.759
Jamie Fiore: and we can move on.

231
00:27:49.500 --> 00:28:01.460
Jamie Fiore: Okay, and just take some time. Review this page and let me know your thoughts. And we're not going to be submitting the form today. So you don't have to hit, you know. Submit, or anything

232
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.690
Jamie Fiore: cool. So

233
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.690
Jamie Fiore: How would you? What would you expect to happen next after you hit? Submit.

234
00:28:50.176 --> 00:28:55.169
Rach.: Maybe get some sort of reference or confirmation number or claim number.

235
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.680
P4: And then I would get an automated email.

236
00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:00.550
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

237
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:08.690
P4: Saying it was, you know, received, and then tell me, like a estimated date.

238
00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:19.059
Jamie Fiore: How soon do you expect to be notified after they made a decision on your claim?

239
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:31.490
P4: I think 10 business days reasonable, reasonable.

240
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:36.260
Jamie Fiore: Okay, and how would you expect to be notified by mail email text.

241
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.700
P4: Our email.

242
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:48.220
Jamie Fiore: Email. Okay? And if you could check that status of your claim before a decision was made, where would you expect to find that claim status.

243
00:29:50.276 --> 00:29:52.360
P4: This the same portal here.

244
00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.799
Jamie Fiore: Okay, so right in the same same area.

245
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:12.139
Jamie Fiore: Yeah, awesome. So one last question on this, before we move on to the next one, another rating question on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this Champ Va claim form.

246
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.190
P4: Up! 3.

247
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:25.209
Jamie Fiore: 3. Okay. And what would same question as before, what would push it to? 5 for you?

248
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.519
P4: There's no live live chat support.

249
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.110
P4: I'm just look hoping to get that.

250
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.685
P4: Hold on, maybe.

251
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.760
P4: I don't know that the page can be a little bit more.

252
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:50.928
P4: I believe they call that a 5 0 3 compliant, or Ada

253
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.719
Jamie Fiore: Oh, okay.

254
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.270
P4: Right.

255
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.436
Jamie Fiore: So what? What things kind of

256
00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:02.699
Jamie Fiore: stood out to you? That isn't really following the 508 compliancy.

257
00:31:04.953 --> 00:31:09.290
P4: Like. I don't see a magnifying feature feature or.

258
00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:09.870
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

259
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.090
P4: Text to...

260
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:16.039
P4: Oh, you know text to speech.

261
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:26.460
P4: Because, you know, sometime I'm not doing it. Another representative or my spouse can be doing it.

262
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.690
P4: What else?

263
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:31.840
P4: So

264
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.539
P4: yeah, that's that's that's it. That's I think that's what I was.

265
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.040
Jamie Fiore: Kind of, okay. Yeah.

266
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:55.219
Jamie Fiore: Good good feedback. So we're gonna move on to the next part of this. You can leave this window open. That's fine. I'm gonna send you a Pdf through the chat.

267
00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:59.741
Jamie Fiore: And if you could download that and open that

268
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:05.219
Jamie Fiore: And yeah, we're gonna we're gonna take a look at this letter. Here.

269
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.659
Jamie Fiore: let me know when you downloaded it and opened it.

270
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:16.449
P4: Get back to the chat here.

271
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.060
P4: Okay.

272
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:25.039
Jamie Fiore: Yeah. And if you need help, I could give you some direction on how to

273
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.179
Jamie Fiore: get that downloaded, for you

274
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:34.870
Jamie Fiore: should be like 3 dots in the corner of that that file that you could click and download.

275
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:39.930
P4: Okay. So now you want me to open the letter.

276
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:51.660
Jamie Fiore: so imagine you submitted this claim. It's been a few weeks. And then you get this letter in the mail

277
00:32:51.810 --> 00:33:01.519
Jamie Fiore: regarding your claim that you submitted. Take a minute to read through this letter, and I just want you, in your own words, to explain what what it's saying to you.

278
00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:31.830
P4: Yeah, it's missing the the diagnose code.

279
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:41.070
Jamie Fiore: Okay, so it's missing the diagnosis code. How? What would your next steps be to resolve this.

280
00:33:52.060 --> 00:34:00.250
P4: probably check the claim again, just to make sure. I you know what was enter, or the actual

281
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:06.430
P4: eob or bill have it.

282
00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:12.479
P4: Just to make sure, like, you know, this.

283
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:20.219
P4: Okay, you know, this department or the missing information is true.

284
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.320
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

285
00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:27.720
P4: And then, if it is, I would call the number.

286
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:36.919
Jamie Fiore: Okay, so you'll call, and then talk to them and see what the next steps are from there.

287
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:43.290
Jamie Fiore: Like. If you need to submit any additional paperwork, or anything.

288
00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:59.339
P4: you know. I know. Maybe not calling right yet. I I maybe submit back to the claim again like a resubmission.

289
00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:00.370
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

290
00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:06.280
P4: If if I if I can get the the missing code, you know, and.

291
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.100
Jamie Fiore: Okay, how? How do you think you go about getting that missing code.

292
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:21.450
P4: Yeah, if if it is truly missing, yeah, I would have to call the provider.

293
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.160
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

294
00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.160
P4: Or the insurer.

295
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:34.520
Jamie Fiore: Okay, out of curiosity. Once you got that missing code and all this paperwork, how would you submit this like? What would you prefer to do at this point

296
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.549
Jamie Fiore: to get it over to Champier.

297
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:51.229
P4: My, yeah, I prefer to submit a re like a claim back here again. Not a new claim like there was an option.

298
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.740
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

299
00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.270
P4: Resubmitting. Yeah.

300
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:57.099
Jamie Fiore: Alright great. So on the form you want to do like an online resubmission.

301
00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.980
Jamie Fiore: Awesome. Yeah.

302
00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:19.979
Jamie Fiore: yeah. Oh, one more question or a couple more about this letter, and then we could switch over to the next process here. So more rating questions on a scale of one to 5, 1 being poorly and 5 being very well. How well does this letter explain what you need to do in order to resolve the problem with the claim.

303
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.370
P4: 3.

304
00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.490
Jamie Fiore: 3.

305
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:33.510
Jamie Fiore: So what? What other information do you are you looking for

306
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.120
Jamie Fiore: on here, or would be helpful.

307
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.910
P4: Maybe a little direction on

308
00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:48.359
P4: how to do this online, because it looks like calling or snail mail is the only way.

309
00:36:50.970 --> 00:37:04.370
Jamie Fiore: Okay, how well do you feel prepared to resolve this claim, based on a letter content using the rating system again, one being poorly and 5 being very well prepared.

310
00:37:09.273 --> 00:37:11.159
P4: At 2.

311
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:12.040
Jamie Fiore: Because.

312
00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.629
P4: One. You know. The reason why I get this is because I didn't prepare.

313
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:25.499
P4: Well, maybe maybe I did. But it's just we don't have enough to, you know. I guess the unpreparedness is out of my control. If that is true.

314
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.310
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

315
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.130
P4: I don't know.

316
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.980
Jamie Fiore: Great So

317
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:49.469
Jamie Fiore: oh, what is going on? My zoom here? Sorry, quirky zoom stuff alright. So right now we're gonna go back to that original form. But we're not gonna work on the form that you already started. I'm gonna post a a new link like a fresh link in the chat for you to click on

318
00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:03.061
Jamie Fiore: and let me know if you have any. There we go, awesome.

319
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:13.860
Jamie Fiore: So, taking a look at this original introduction page again. Do you feel like you're in the right spot to resubmit a claim.

320
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.750
P4: Yes.

321
00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.460
Jamie Fiore: Okay. And what? What would lead you to think that.

322
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:27.389
P4: I think it was just from experience of doing the 1st one, the new one.

323
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:28.220
Jamie Fiore: Okay?

324
00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:33.779
Jamie Fiore: Great and what information do you think you would need to resubmit a claim.

325
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:43.019
P4: It's just the form with the corrected info this time.

326
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:47.640
P4: Okay, the the billing statement or the eob.

327
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:57.530
Jamie Fiore: Alright sounds great. So you can scroll back down to the bottom to that link to start your form without signing in, and then you could go ahead and jump back into the form.

328
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.819
Jamie Fiore: and then we're going to fill this out as if you're resubmitting the claim.

329
00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:18.990
Jamie Fiore: All right.

330
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.383
Jamie Fiore: So oh, yeah, you're already ahead of me. Here.

331
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:27.720
P4: Oh, okay.

332
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:33.779
Jamie Fiore: No, you're good. This is, this is great. You found it right away. So yeah.

333
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:41.860
Jamie Fiore: so you obviously know what information you're being asked here to look for a Pdi, and then you found that number right away.

334
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:43.350
Jamie Fiore: So

335
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:52.740
Jamie Fiore: you found. I think you do know where to find the Pdi number right. I think you just pulled it up a second ago, right.

336
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.779
P4: Yeah, I was also looking for control number.

337
00:39:58.170 --> 00:39:59.100
Jamie Fiore: Oh, okay.

338
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.829
P4: If if let, maybe this is missing.

339
00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.499
Jamie Fiore: Okay? So you're also looking for the control number.

340
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.280
P4: Guess it's not on here.

341
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.990
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

342
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.649
P4: Oh, maybe it's called something else. I'm not sure.

343
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.650
P4: Oh, yes, it's here.

344
00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.510
P4: Oh, okay.

345
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.760
P4: So this, I guess, could mean

346
00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:35.469
P4: the claim. Did the well, the the 1st round of of you know

347
00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.729
P4: the the claim that was having issue.

348
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:43.320
P4: I would get an eop, but if I only got the

349
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:49.479
P4: the what they call a sent back letter here. Then I would use the Pdi number.

350
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.800
Jamie Fiore: Okay, great.

351
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.590
Jamie Fiore: So you did get an error here, what do you think about that?

352
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:04.099
P4: But yeah, just do what it suggested.

353
00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:05.770
Jamie Fiore: Take care.

354
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:08.150
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

355
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:29.320
P4: It's diagnosis. It sounds like medical. Then.

356
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:30.280
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

357
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:27.799
Jamie Fiore: alright. Same thing. You got to another upload page. Just read through this and let me know if what you think you're being asked to do on this page, or ask for on this page.

358
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.700
P4: Okay, yeah, it's asking for that same letter.

359
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:55.820
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

360
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:04.920
Jamie Fiore: so I have to resubmit that letter they sent you. Yeah, you go ahead and upload a file here.

361
00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:14.200
Jamie Fiore: and we're gonna get that same error. But we don't need to talk about that anymore. Yeah.

362
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:17.720
Jamie Fiore: So you go ahead and hit. Continue.

363
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.910
P4: Okay.

364
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:26.300
Jamie Fiore: Oh, I'm sorry. Let me backtrack a little bit. If you needed to upload more than one file. How would you go about doing that?

365
00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:31.600
P4: Yeah. Upload. Another.

366
00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:37.952
Jamie Fiore: Okay. Alright. So that's pretty clear. You don't have to upload. Now, I'm just curious.

367
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:40.710
Jamie Fiore: Thank you.

368
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.930
P4: So ask to upload what I submitted.

369
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:44.360
Jamie Fiore: Oh!

370
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:45.670
P4: Older.

371
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.090
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

372
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:55.420
P4: Yeah, I mean this. I mean, this whole stuff might not be necessary.

373
00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:56.170
Jamie Fiore: Hmm.

374
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.790
P4: Because, you know, I'm hoping the system.

375
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.349
P4: No, there's a letter created for me already.

376
00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:04.320
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

377
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:09.279
P4: And then, maybe, if it should ask for any other new.

378
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:10.120
Jamie Fiore: Hmm.

379
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:17.979
P4: Documents to help with the you know them, you know. Whatever the the reason

380
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:22.220
P4: of missing a reason of denial is.

381
00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.340
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

382
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:31.339
Jamie Fiore: So if you could update this you would prefer just to send in only the new information and not everything

383
00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.090
Jamie Fiore: that you already submitted.

384
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:43.629
P4: Yeah, cause I mean, I it's just more redundancy for the review.

385
00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.360
P4: The reviewer later.

386
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:47.210
Jamie Fiore: Yeah.

387
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:51.450
Jamie Fiore: So you think that would that might possibly delay the process

388
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.599
Jamie Fiore: if they had to review everything again.

389
00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:56.810
P4: Yes,

390
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:02.990
P4: Cause the Pid number here or earlier. I

391
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:05.940
P4: I think it was like, step one, whatever. Yeah.

392
00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:08.670
P4: Would have tied that back to.

393
00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.580
Jamie Fiore: Okay, it's fair enough.

394
00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:20.760
Jamie Fiore: Okay? Yeah. You may go ahead and continue through the rest of the form. And then I got a few questions at the end. And yeah, then we can get you out of here.

395
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:45.485
Jamie Fiore: So just out of curiosity, what do you think's being asked for, or

396
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:51.369
Jamie Fiore: Why do you think we're asking for the sponsor and the beneficiary information? Again?

397
00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.909
P4: I think because I never signed in.

398
00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:01.030
Jamie Fiore: Hmm.

399
00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:07.209
P4: So, yeah, this is like a way to do it without signing in. So you guys, I mean the

400
00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.000
P4: the you know, the the system

401
00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:16.160
P4: doesn't know who I am yet, or what my eligibility is.

402
00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.040
P4: So that's why.

403
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:24.999
Jamie Fiore: So if you what would you expect to happen if you were signing in, or you did sign in.

404
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.860
P4: Yeah, I guess my sponsor or my own info

405
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.700
P4: wouldn't. Maybe that these stuff would be eliminated.

406
00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:35.435
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

407
00:46:54.270 --> 00:47:00.080
P4: Yeah. So this step, maybe because might have changed since then.

408
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.160
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

409
00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:27.600
Jamie Fiore: alright.

410
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:35.820
Jamie Fiore: So on this page. Would you do anything differently on this page, knowing that it was a resubmission.

411
00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:55.570
P4: Maybe a confirmation that I am addressing.

412
00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.289
P4: You know this issue.

413
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:59.460
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

414
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:09.849
P4: Because I would. I was hoping when I put this number in it would. Then the system would know

415
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:16.949
P4: what you know, what it's it's needing.

416
00:48:17.507 --> 00:48:24.669
P4: I would hoping to see that again here and then, just to remind me how to address that here.

417
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:25.920
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

418
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:33.840
Jamie Fiore: that's good. So if same questions as before, if you submitted the form, what would you expect to happen next?

419
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:46.050
P4: Yes, I mean, take some review time and then get an email of a new.

420
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.659
P4: I guess. Claim number at that.

421
00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.360
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

422
00:48:50.365 --> 00:48:55.159
P4: And then, yeah, like an estimate date. Again.

423
00:48:55.850 --> 00:49:05.629
Jamie Fiore: Okay, would you expect any difference in the time it takes to submit the the original claim compared to the the resubmission.

424
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.189
P4: No, I think. Still, I'm still at 10 business days. Yeah.

425
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:24.650
Jamie Fiore: Okay, sounds good. So we're done with this form right now. So if you want, you could stop sharing your screen. And then I just have a few more questions for you, and then

426
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.349
Jamie Fiore: we could send you on your way.

427
00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:38.950
Jamie Fiore: Awesome. So reading question again on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult was it to complete this form!

428
00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:45.500
Jamie Fiore: And we're talking about the whole entire process claims to resubmission.

429
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.819
P4: But yeah, at 3.

430
00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:52.849
Jamie Fiore: But 3.

431
00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.840
Jamie Fiore: Okay, what would make that a 5 for you?

432
00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:25.139
P4: Yeah, I'm still wanted some sort of tool to scan and give instant feedback on.

433
00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:29.780
P4: on the, on the required uploaded documents. So then

434
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:37.900
P4: it'll just take the the second guess, or the possibly the resubmission that's needed.

435
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:47.229
Jamie Fiore: Okay, that that sounds good. How would you compare the 1st claim that you submitted today versus the resubmitted claim.

436
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:53.840
Jamie Fiore: like your overall experience with both.

437
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:06.040
P4: Probably like resubmission better, because it tells me exactly what's what's needed.

438
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:09.770
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

439
00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:15.609
Jamie Fiore: great. So it's do you like the de? The level detail a little bit better on the resubmission?

440
00:51:16.319 --> 00:51:22.940
Jamie Fiore: Great overall. Was there anything that you saw in today's session that worked well for you?

441
00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:33.360
P4: I guess the signing in without

442
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:37.950
P4: completing without signing in that that does help.

443
00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:45.900
P4: And if I you know, if I just whatever reason cannot sign in.

444
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:57.169
P4: I, you know, because sometimes the the one year, the one year deadline there.

445
00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:02.000
P4: and because documents needed can take some time to get

446
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:06.920
P4: to even start to claim can sometimes get to me very late.

447
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:11.300
P4: you know. I guess it give a peace of mind that

448
00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.659
P4: that I can. I can still do it.

449
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.789
P4: submitting it before the one year deadline.

450
00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:23.869
P4: Because, you know, if once the claim doesn't start, I you know, from

451
00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:34.150
P4: any other va va law! It's it's very important to at least, you know, to meet that

452
00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:38.350
P4: for them to do anything, or even repo.

453
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.770
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

454
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:54.970
Jamie Fiore: that's that's fair enough. I do want to do a time check. So we are at 10 o'clock, and I believe the session was gonna end at 10. Do you? And this is totally up to you. Do you have an extra 2 min to hang on the line. If not, we could just end it right now.

455
00:52:56.176 --> 00:52:57.199
P4: Yeah, sure, it's fine.

456
00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:06.270
Jamie Fiore: Okay? Yeah. I just had a couple more questions for you here. So we talked about what went well, what didn't work out so well for you.

457
00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:22.300
P4: maybe the have.

458
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:27.480
P4: I guess the form. Maybe I I could have.

459
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.610
P4: you know, give it more time to review before uploading.

460
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:32.360
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

461
00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.380
P4: Oh, for the resubmission!

462
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:43.459
P4: I was hoping that for them to ask, you know. Well, I guess, for this particular issue of missing diagnosed code.

463
00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:49.670
P4: You know I'm I'm not a medical profession or a coder to

464
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:55.510
P4: to find that out, but maybe I don't know if there's another way

465
00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:02.070
P4: on there to let me pick what service was done.

466
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.030
Jamie Fiore: Hmm.

467
00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:09.140
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

468
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:18.489
Jamie Fiore: yeah, no, that that makes a lot of sense. So you, you want some additional details. For like, how to find these things.

469
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.160
P4: Yeah, or.

470
00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.900
Jamie Fiore: Or a different way to find it.

471
00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:27.839
P4: Yeah, without relying on. You know other parties.

472
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:29.690
Jamie Fiore: Okay.

473
00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:38.710
Jamie Fiore: so what are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in this form? Was it not enough too much? Was it just right.

474
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.520
P4: Things. Okay? The the instruction.

475
00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:57.029
P4: Yeah. To just to tell me what to go look for. Yeah, I think that's just okay.

476
00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:58.450
Jamie Fiore: Okay?

477
00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:03.710
Jamie Fiore: Yeah. So actually, that was my last question, do you have any questions for me?

478
00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:10.039
P4: When's the study finished by and.

479
00:55:11.432 --> 00:55:21.779
Jamie Fiore: This one is going to wrap up at the end of next week, and then we got to do some analysis and stuff on top of that. So we're yeah, we're moving right along with this.

480
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:30.390
P4: Yeah, I'm just hoping the the improvement. I guess I'll see some point in the future.

481
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:53.289
Jamie Fiore: Yeah, at some point. So the claims form right. Now, it's available online. So just so you know, if you do have to submit a Champ va claim in the future. You can find it on va.gov. I believe it's on the family benefits. Section. You should see something for Champ Va, or you could just type in Champ Va claims form on va.gov, and it should pop up.

482
00:55:53.290 --> 00:56:03.669
Jamie Fiore: But the resubmission part of this. That's the part that we're working on trying to to get online, to be able to allow people to resubmit

483
00:56:03.976 --> 00:56:23.259
Jamie Fiore: their claims online. So keep a lookout for that. We don't have any like strong like timelines, for when that's gonna actually appear online, but this is kind of the 1st steps of it is just gathering information and testing what we have in the prototype. Let's see if we can make any further improvements before it actually launches. So

484
00:56:23.785 --> 00:56:27.264
Jamie Fiore: yeah. So hope to see this up soon.

485
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:30.379
P4: Got it. Got it. Thank you guys so much.

486
00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:47.359
Jamie Fiore: Great. Thank you. So right before we close I just want to circle back and ask you that question again about sharing a video clip. So just again to reconfirm. Are you comfortable if we share a clip of this video session with our Va partners

487
00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:56.856
Jamie Fiore: and just reminding, oh, you're good. Yeah. So great, we'll be sure to remove any information that could be used to identify you before sharing the video.

488
00:56:57.390 --> 00:57:23.490
Jamie Fiore: But yeah, I just want to thank you again so much. This is great. You provided a lot of great insight here really appreciate it. So lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, they could pass along to other veterans that you might know to provide them a chance to participate in future research studies. But yes, once again, thank you so much. Enjoy the rest of your day.

489
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.219
P4: You, too. Thank you.

00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.669
