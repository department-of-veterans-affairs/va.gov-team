00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.519
Participant 8: Yes, that's fine.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:25.569
Jamie: Okay, great. And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners, if we remove any information to identify you.

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.380
Participant 8: It's fine.

7
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:27.790
Jamie: Alright.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.195

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.740
Participant 8: About 5 years ago.

14
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.630
Jamie: 5 years. Do you remember what the application process was like.

15
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.124
Participant 8: It honestly was a pain because

16
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.393
Participant 8: it took longer than normal, because at that time it was

17
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:23.453
Participant 8: you know, issues with Covid and stuff getting backed up and waiting for the Id and paperwork to get through. E, that's with it. Even faxed

18
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.479
Participant 8: calling, emailing. Yeah, it was a pain, I think, only because of situation. At that time.

19
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.011
Jamie: Okay? Oh, sorry to hear that hopefully. We can make it better in the future.

20
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.259
Jamie: so it doesn't take as long.

21
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.919
Jamie: Have you submitted any medical or pharmacy claims to CHAMPVA. Since then.

22
00:01:47.548 --> 00:01:49.541
Participant 8: Yes, I have for them.

23
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.440
Participant 8: With the older one it was some issues

24
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.431
Participant 8: with clearance and medication for her.

25
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:11.639
Participant 8: her [reacted] and some other stuff and coverage for certain doctors, and switching over to another provider.

26
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.017
Jamie: Oh, okay, so it was.

27
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.019
Jamie: How was that experience? Was that like.

28
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.819
Participant 8: That's a headache like, was, it? Was almost considered where.

29
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.270
Participant 8: like, we almost decided to just go to like an outside doctor.

30
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.130
Jamie: Oh, wow!

31
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.859
Participant 8: Did you receive any mail from CHAMPVA about the claim before it was processed?

32
00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:37.489
Participant 8: After the fact? Not before.

33
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.939
Jamie: Okay, was that just like a decision letter or.

34
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:51.979
Participant 8: Yes, it was decision letter, and it was another letter where they gave me a network of certain providers and

35
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.040
Participant 8: options of how to handle it. So

36
00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.507
Participant 8: when we 1st processed the claim and we were waiting,

37
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.890
Participant 8: they said. Just go ahead, and

38
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.710
Participant 8: you know, wait for the Bill, and you're still covered. Just give them, you know, like the insurance number and everything. So.

39
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.730
Jamie: Okay.

40
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:26.299
Jamie: alright, great. So gonna ask you a few questions about the excess sorry assistive technology. That you're using right now,

41
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.470
Jamie: so when you're filling out these forms online for va.gov, do you sometimes use assistive technology while doing so?

42
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.039
Participant 8: Yes, I I've used Jack's, and I've used another one.

43
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.505
Participant 8: And now it's

44
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.040
Participant 8: Okay.

45
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:56.850
Participant 8: it's weird, because, like, I use it partially now, because I'm in the process of surgery. So I had one ear done.

46
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:05.439
Participant 8: and it's not totally clear yet, so I just had it done and then I'm

47
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.810
Participant 8: in a few months I have to get the other one done.

48
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.459
Jamie: Okay, so are you using any assistive technology right? Now.

49
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.809
Participant 8: Right now. Yes.

50
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.380
Jamie: Okay?

51
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.690
Jamie: And I'm sorry. What? What was that again, that you're using.

52
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.810
Participant 8: Checks.

53
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.090
Jamie: Jacks. Okay, what I'm not familiar with that. What is that.

54
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.530
Jamie: And.

55
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.324
Participant 8: It's it's like screen, reader, and

56
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.300
Participant 8: see, when I when I do zoom, it will talk over you.

57
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.459
Jamie: Okay, yeah, which is fine.

58
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.110
Participant 8: Yeah.

59
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.929
Participant 8: And then sometimes, like, it's hard to like hear, because

60
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.480
Participant 8: even when I type it will say it out loud. So.

61
00:04:44.980 --> 00:05:00.006
Jamie: Yeah, that's that's all stuff that we're familiar with. And have conducted these interviews before. So I don't mind. You know. I'll I'll take your time, you know. Take your time with it, and you know hopefully we won't talk over it too much.

62
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.809
Jamie: So yeah, we'll we'll we'll work around it. It's not a problem. Yeah.

63
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.789
Jamie K: Can you spell the name of that screen, reader? I haven't heard of it before.

64
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.239
Participant 8: Okay. Jaks.

65
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.590
Jamie K: JAKS. Okay, thank you. This will be new for me. I'm excited.

66
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.210
Participant 8: Overall.

67
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.630
Jamie: Awesome.

68
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:31.442
Jamie: So I guess we can, we can try to get the actually, a couple more questions before we get this. The screen, reader, up and running.

69
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.580
Jamie: oh, actually, yeah. Well, you you will be using that today. Right? If.

70
00:05:39.712 --> 00:05:44.449
Participant 8: I can. Yes, I don't. I don't.

71
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.916
Jamie: That. See how it goes?

72
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:56.979
Jamie: We could, you know, like at least, you know, give it a give it a shot here. How would you rate, like your level experience with using jacks.

73
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.990
Participant 8: Well, I just went back to it so like I was using that one. Then I switched to another one.

74
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:12.769
Participant 8: and then I ended up taking it off because it wasn't compatible with another meeting. I had.

75
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.650
Jamie: Hmm.

76
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.730
Participant 8: Let me see, where is it? I don't know if I have to exit out of this screen to get back into it.

77
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:20.360
Jamie: Hmm.

78
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.930
Participant 8: Or if I have to. Well, let me see if I can go to my.

79
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.339
Jamie: Yeah, take your time and figure it out.

80
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.936
Participant 8: I'm a i'm gonna drop the

81
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.280
Participant 8: the view real quick. Hold on.

82
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.570
Jamie: Yeah, go for it.

83
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.059
Participant 8: Where did we go?

84
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.652
Participant 8: I can't find it.

85
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.454
Participant 8: I can't find it.

86
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.590
Jamie: Okay.

87
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.350
Participant 8: I can't find it. I don't know why.

88
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.970
Jamie: Like, so.

89
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.290
Participant 8: That's weird.

90
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.680
Jamie: Oh, I thought Jamie was coming in.

91
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.459
Jamie K: Yeah, yeah, I was gonna ask, are are you on are you on a tablet, or are you on a or.

92
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:33.830
Participant 8: I'm on a laptop. It's chrome, so usually it will link together.

93
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.900
Participant 8: Let me see something.

94
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.459
Jamie K: Are you trying to share your screen.

95
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.160
Participant 8: No, I'm trying to

96
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.029
Participant 8: see if it will pop up on my laptop because I have it connected with my phone.

97
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.800
Jamie K: Oh, interesting. Okay.

98
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.130
Participant 8: Huh!

99
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.640
Participant 8: Yes.

100
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.690
Participant 8: I don't know why it's

101
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.079
Participant 8: let me try. Let me try a different one and see if it'll link over.

102
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.100
Jamie: So you're connecting it from your phone to use.

103
00:08:17.547 --> 00:08:24.699
Participant 8: Well, it it just like automatically does it. So like anytime like I've downloaded anything because

104
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:30.520
Participant 8: I use chrome on my phone, it automatically verifies me on the laptop.

105
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.290
Jamie: Oh.

106
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:46.159
Jamie: Google, it's very, very clever. I was just generally curious about it. Because usually when we have these sessions, or even when I'm doing using the screen reader connects directly from my from my laptop. So.

107
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:54.390
Jamie: Interesting the way other people use these. How long have you been using a screen, reader? For, by the way.

108
00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.910
Participant 8: Maybe about 5 years.

109
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.869
Jamie: Okay, great. So had some some time with it.

110
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.700
Jamie: yeah, I mean, are you? Do you want to give it another shot to try to get it up. If not.

111
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.040
Participant 8: Yes, I'm gonna I'm gonna try it again.

112
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.880
Jamie: Okay.

113
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.860
Participant 8: Think that's gonna link to my email.

114
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.245
Participant 8: Continue with Google.

115
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.610
Participant 8: That's it.

116
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.659
Participant 8: I'm here.

117
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.140
Participant 8: Oh, took me out of it. Hold on.

118
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.660
Participant 8: natural.

119
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.480
Participant 8: Hmm!

120
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.670
Participant 8: It's just a verified man. I don't know why.

121
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:46.090
Jamie: Hmm.

122
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.810
Participant 8: Let me try a different one.

123
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.520
Jamie: Okay.

124
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.049
Participant 8: It's already installed. Why is it?

125
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.469
Participant 8: I can't get it to transfer over

126
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.150
Jamie: Okay.

127
00:11:54.870 --> 00:12:00.580
Participant 8: So, yeah, that's perfectly fine. Are you comfortable? Still participating without the screen, reader?

128
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.280
Participant 8: Yes, I'm fine.

129
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:21.540
Jamie: Okay, yeah, we could just proceed without it. I'm gonna drop a link in the the chat for our demo tool. But before you go ahead and click on it, I just wanna give you a moment to close any browsers or windows or notifications or anything that you just don't want us to see.

130
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.110
Participant 8: Oh, oh, no! That's nothing.

131
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:29.000
Jamie: Okay, yeah. So you can go ahead and click that link whenever you're ready.

132
00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:33.219
Participant 8: Okay. Where's the link at.

133
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.789
Jamie: Oh, I just put it in the zoom chat. Let me know if you could see that or not.

134
00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.769
Participant 8: Can you still hear me.

135
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:52.240
Jamie: Yep.

136
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.169
Participant 8: Okay, okay, I'm there.

137
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.159
Jamie: Okay, do you mind sharing your screen?

138
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.270
Jamie: Should be that green share button at the bottom of the zoom, with the arrow pointing up.

139
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.929
Participant 8: Let me see green button.

140
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.240
Participant 8: Where is it? At? Again the.

141
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:19.840
Jamie: Are you? You're on a laptop right.

142
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.350
Participant 8: Yes.

143
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.689
Jamie: Okay? Yeah. It should be on the towards the center

144
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:31.609
Jamie: of the of the zoom window, the same window that you see all of us on so it's just say share with yep, you got it.

145
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.760
Participant 8: Okay. Yes.

Jamie: It's loading.

150
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.279
Jamie: Might take another second or 2.

151
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:05.500
Jamie: Hmm!

152
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.278

Jamie: So this is the form that we're gonna be taking a look at today.

155
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:37.260
Jamie: so just a couple things before we really dive into this. This is the our testing site. So we won't actually be submitting this form today. So nothing you click on this form will have any bearing on your benefits. And as we go through this form today, just feel free to put any fake info or fake

156
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:54.970
Jamie: information in, especially for those sensitive questions like your social security numbers or birth dates or id numbers, and then also Perigm should have provided you with some documents to upload. Did you receive those?

157
00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.700
Jamie: Oh, you're muted, Participant 8.

158
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:23.600
Jamie: There should be a little icon at the bottom with the microphone that says, unmute. Yeah.

159
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.099
Jamie: did it? Not unmute?

160
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.810
Jamie: Oh, no.

161
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:42.280
Jamie: Hmm.

162
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.439
Jamie: Browser, stop sharing audio.

163
00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.150
Jamie: I think it's because you're sharing your audio as well as the screen.

164
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.870
Jamie: Oh.

165
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.230
Jamie: zoom is always so quirky. Apologize.

166
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.440
Jamie: Okay.

167
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.170
Participant 8: And can you hear me now?

168
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.770
Participant 8: I could hear you now.

169
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.528
Participant 8: I had to stop share.

170
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.200
Participant 8: I I don't know if I go. If I go back into it.

171
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.850
Jamie: Yeah, maybe did you click on something that said share audio as well.

172
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:40.029
Participant 8: Yes, cause I I thought you wouldn't be able to hear me. Can you still hear me now?

173
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:43.800
Jamie: Yeah, I could still hear you. Now. I don't know if that is what messed it up. Maybe.

174
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.100
Participant 8: I think so. Probably.

175
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.002
Jamie: Yeah, I'm just guessing here. You never know

176
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.530
Jamie: again.

177
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.210
Participant 8: Oh!

178
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.840
Jamie: And take your time. If we get through what we get through.

179
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:24.759
Jamie: We understand. We, you know, usually have technology issues and little quirks to work out during these things.

180
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:41.510
Participant 8: I was looking. Okay. I found the the the forms from Shannon, from Perigjan.

181
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.530
Jamie: Oh, okay, great. So you you have those.

182
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:47.320
Participant 8: Yes, I have.

183
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.809
Jamie: Awesome so that that should make that part go quicker if you have them already, so

184
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.230
Jamie: we'll make up some time there.

185
00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.039
Jamie: So you wanna try sharing your screen one more time. See if it works.

186
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.665
Participant 8: Yes,

187
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.200
Participant 8: Oh, I have to go back. Wait one second self screen share

188
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:26.890
Participant 8: no audio, this one, this one, this one.

189
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.349
Jamie: See? Yep, I see it now.

190
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.200
Participant 8: Okay.

191
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.700
Jamie: And I think I could hear you.

192
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.540
Participant 8: Okay.

193
00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.780
Jamie: Awesome! Oh, great.

194
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.147
Participant 8: So no audio.

195
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:51.579
Jamie: Yeah, we got audio. We got visual. We're good to go. So I'll prompt you when we get to that screen about uploading the documents. But before we start, do you have any questions for me?

196
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.580
Participant 8: No.

197
00:18:52.750 --> 00:19:07.350
Jamie: Okay, great. So you can take a look at this screen. And just scroll down. Give it a second, you know, absorb it, and in your own words, I just want you to explain what type of form this page is describing.

198
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:14.910
Participant 8: Civilian health and medical program.

199
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.910
Jamie: Okay.

200
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:23.209
Participant 8: So excuse me, and if you want to file a claim for reimbursement.

201
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.140
Jamie: Okay.

202
00:19:24.547 --> 00:19:28.209
Participant 8: Has to be with them one year. Let's see.

203
00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.010
Jamie: Documents.

204
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:41.750
Participant 8: Itemized billing, explanation and pharmacy, receipt, insurance provider sign in with verified account.

205
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.869
Jamie: Okay, what type of information do you think you'll need to fill out this form.

206
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:58.790
Participant 8: I would think proof of the billing

207
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:03.179
Participant 8: the pharmacy receipt who the provider is?

208
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:16.533
Participant 8: Possibly condition. But I would think the the provider would have that documented somewhere.

209
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:25.139
Participant 8: and if it's more than 1 1 beneficiary, it would be more than one document. So I think

210
00:20:26.568 --> 00:20:32.950
Participant 8: just proof of your itemized bill.

211
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.780
Jamie: Okay, any charges

212
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:47.219
Jamie: sounds good. Do you? Would you have that information on hand, or would you need to take a pause to kind of go grab everything before you jump into the form.

213
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.370
Participant 8: Hmm!

214
00:20:53.630 --> 00:21:00.539
Participant 8: I I probably would have to have that on hand before I I would go on in a on the form.

215
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:06.210
Jamie: Okay, so you you would collect it before you. You jump on the form.

216
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:06.960
Participant 8: Yes.

217
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:19.970
Jamie: Okay, so on a scale of one to 5, 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel at this moment to file a claim based on what you're seeing on this page.

218
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.879
Participant 8: I would have to. Probably I would think I would be

219
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.340
Participant 8: prepare, so I wouldn't be so comfortable, unprepared.

220
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:40.790
Jamie: Okay.

221
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.180
Jamie: So you would be prepared.

222
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.929
Participant 8: Yes, I would be prepared before I started filling it up.

223
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.213
Jamie: All right.

224
00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:55.160
Jamie: So at this point, if you could scroll down to the bottom of that blue box on the screen

225
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:59.959
Jamie: and click, submit your form without signing in.

226
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:02.670
Jamie: Yep.

227
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.939
Jamie: okay, So

228
00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:28.430
Jamie: now, I'd like you to start the form as if you're submitting a new medical claim, for let's see one of your children, so I'll let you know when to pause, so I can ask some questions. But just as a reminder, this is a testing site. So you don't have to worry about any information that you enter going anywhere.

229
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:44.009
Jamie: It's literally just not going anywhere. It's going to the Black Hole right now, because it's not linked up to any databases or anything, but feel free to put some fake information, especially when it comes to those more sensitive questions like birth dates and social security numbers

230
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:58.979
Jamie: And then, as you go through the form, just remember to think out loud, we want to hear your reactions and how you're experiencing, experiencing the form going forward so you can get started. You're already started. So.

231
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.570
Participant 8: Yeah, that's a habit. Sorry.

232
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:03.898
Jamie: No, no, that's fine.

233
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:13.189
Participant 8: I did that one time with a tens unit, as the guy was talking, and shocked myself right when he was saying, Whatever you do. Don't do this, and I was like.

234
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.030
Participant 8: but it's a habit.

235
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.570
Participant 8: Let me see, I'm just going to put partial.

236
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.220
Jamie: Okay.

237
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.850
Participant 8: And make up something.

238
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.630
Jamie: That's fine we like we like made up information.

239
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.180
Participant 8: How does that go there? Let me see.

240
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.820
Jamie: Are you, sir, for a specific suffix.

241
00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:02.200
Participant 8: No it when I was scrolling down it automatically picked one.

242
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.820
Jamie: Oh, that's silly!

243
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:10.440
Participant 8: Country.

244
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:19.159
Participant 8: Well, it has it up there. So just gonna make out one.

245
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:22.680
Participant 8: Oh.

246
00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:34.559
Jamie: Any thoughts on the form right now. Anything hard, anything easy.

247
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:41.520
Participant 8: It's not difficult at all. It's when I submit a form it's like so much more.

248
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.340
Participant 8: This one's very easy.

249
00:25:46.153 --> 00:25:47.299
Participant 8: Excuse me.

250
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:51.080
Jamie: Great.

251
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:10.489
Jamie: Yeah, it might have a problem with, we'll we'll see if it works sometimes. With sequential numbers. It yells at you. Oh, it works. Okay.

252
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.699
Jamie: it's it's almost too smart at that point.

253
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.170
Participant 8: Let's see.

254
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.870
Participant 8: No.

255
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.910
Participant 8: Hmm!

256
00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:29.880
Participant 8: So a certain amount.

257
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:33.783
Jamie: I guess. So keep going.

258
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:34.925
Jamie: Okay.

259
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:45.080
Participant 8: It's like permission. Last provider.

260
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.160
Participant 8: Well.

261
00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:22.739
Jamie: So for this, we're going to do a medical care claim.

262
00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:23.880
Participant 8: Okay.

263
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:08.200
Participant 8: Car accident. No.

264
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:26.169
Jamie: Okay. So this is the page where we're gonna have to do some uploads. But before you upload anything, I just want you to take a look at this page, and just describe to me what documentation you think you're being asked for here.

265
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.120
Participant 8: The itemized billing.

266
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.030
Participant 8: interesting!

267
00:29:51.162 --> 00:29:59.270
Participant 8: I would think they would ask for her provider's full name.

268
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.230
Jamie: Hmm.

269
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:06.770
Participant 8: Or it needs to be documented on the form somehow. Medical title.

270
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.617
Participant 8: probably whether she's a doctor. PA,

271
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:11.930
Jamie: Okay.

272
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:23.350
Participant 8: Where she got the care at the address. The doctor's Mpi and their tax identification number

273
00:30:23.934 --> 00:30:35.770
Participant 8: charges for whatever care she got so like. Say, if she had a pelvic exam, and it cost 500, then I would think, you know, like whatever charges

274
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.451
Participant 8: that that doctor charges the date.

275
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:49.439
Participant 8: the diagnostic codes for those specific conditions. A list of procedure codes.

276
00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:56.810
Participant 8: healthcare, common. Yeah. So probably be like medical terminology.

277
00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:57.850
Jamie: Okay.

278
00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.399
Participant 8: Of certain codes.

279
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.040
Jamie: Is this something that you think you could obtain easily.

280
00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.014
Participant 8: No.

281
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:08.100
Jamie: What would be the the steps you need to take? To get all this stuff.

282
00:31:08.868 --> 00:31:21.410
Participant 8: Well, 1st I would ask my doctor, hey? Can I have your Mpi? I think that would be

283
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:32.320
Participant 8: very difficult asking directly. I don't think every doctor would be comfortable with that, but

284
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:43.269
Participant 8: if not, I probably will pull it from a chart or record somehow, and see if I see it on there some hand prescriptions

285
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:47.751
Participant 8: before you take it to the pharmacy, it will show certain.

286
00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:54.042
Participant 8: you know, like Mpi's or their their codes

287
00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:02.620
Participant 8: But the form would be, I would think I would be asking for

288
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:12.789
Participant 8: the provider to be showing that instead of me searching for it and giving the information that way.

289
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.880
Jamie: Okay.

290
00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.599
Jamie: So you go back to the provider and ask them.

291
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:17.264
Participant 8: Yes,

292
00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.460
Jamie: Stuff.

293
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.830
Participant 8: Yes, but I you know again I think it would.

294
00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:28.349
Participant 8: It would take longer for them to provide it and submit it.

295
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.780
Jamie: Okay.

296
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.959
Participant 8: Enough for me to be able to provide it.

297
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:38.210
Jamie: So at this point, do you think you would need to pause the claim process to go find all this stuff, or coordinate this stuff with the doctor?

298
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:39.560
Participant 8: I think so. Yes.

299
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.485
Jamie: Okay?

300
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:54.750
Jamie: So at this point, if you do have those 2 documents handy that Paragene sent to you, I'd like you to upload the one called, What is it? Sample billing statement?

301
00:32:55.691 --> 00:32:58.278
Jamie: Gotta get my window up to.

302
00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:03.000
Participant 8: Okay. She sent me that one as a second attachment.

303
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:04.250
Jamie: Okay.

304
00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.980
Participant 8: Let me see.

305
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:09.409
Participant 8: Okay, I haven't.

306
00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:15.833
Jamie: Yeah, you could go ahead and upload that to this page, and we'll see what happens.

307
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:30.640
Participant 8: Well, I wonder if would I share screen my email?

308
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.280
Jamie: Oh, you don't have it like downloaded right now.

309
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:38.639
Participant 8: I can you see my screen, or you see the share screen.

310
00:33:38.942 --> 00:33:44.089
Jamie: I see the form on your screen with some open tab. So yeah, I see your.

311
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.800
Participant 8: Can you see me now.

312
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:48.029
Jamie: No, I see me.

313
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:52.370
Participant 8: Oh, oh, like it! Because I have it on my phone.

314
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.460
Jamie: Oh, okay, you can't see me but I'm wondering if I come.

315
00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.029
Participant 8: Like, if I go into my email, is it gonna share.

316
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:02.190
Jamie: Yeah, it.

317
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.600
Participant 8: Oh!

318
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:09.319
Jamie: You might, if you're sharing your screen, would it be easier if I send you the link to download it directly.

319
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:10.862
Participant 8: Yes, that's fine.

320
00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:18.247
Jamie: Okay, let me see if I could. I could either do it 2 ways, either attach it in the zoom chat, or let's see if I can

321
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:21.439
Jamie: get get it over to you somehow.

322
00:34:22.244 --> 00:34:23.846
Participant 8: Sometimes it works.

323
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:29.020
Jamie: It directly in the chat did this time.

324
00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:31.509
Jamie: Let me send that over to you.

325
00:34:32.359 --> 00:34:35.213
Jamie: I get excited when this stuff actually works.

326
00:34:36.999 --> 00:34:51.239
Jamie: I don't know why it didn't work this morning for me, but we're good alright. So you should see a file in the Zoom chat, and if you click those 3 dots when you hover over it. There should be a selection to download.

327
00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.889
Participant 8: Show and open, and edit.

328
00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:57.909
Jamie: Oh, possibly I'm having different.

329
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.620
Jamie: Says different things on mine.

330
00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.420
Participant 8: Okay, can you see that.

331
00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:08.420
Jamie: Yeah, is there a way you could like save that file on your computer? So this way, you could upload it in the form.

332
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:14.279
Jamie: Maybe. Is there an option on the top? Those 3 dots.

333
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.130
Participant 8: I'm just thinking, yeah, save as

334
00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.470
Participant 8: save.

335
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:23.710
Jamie: Oh, got it!

336
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.590
Participant 8: Sample billing.

337
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.070
Participant 8: Okay?

338
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:29.090
Participant 8: Whoops.

339
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.530
Jamie: You go back to the form.

340
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:47.909
Jamie: would you be able to go?

341
00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.189
Jamie: Are you on the form again?

342
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:51.480
Participant 8: Yes.

343
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.529
Jamie: Okay. I'm I'm only seeing that receipt.

344
00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:57.639
Participant 8: Yeah. So you don't see the form.

345
00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.830
Jamie: No, I don't see the form anymore.

346
00:35:58.830 --> 00:35:59.555
Participant 8: What?

347
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.213
Jamie: It's crazy.

348
00:36:02.307 --> 00:36:05.442
Participant 8: I'm gonna drop it down.

349
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:07.190
Jamie: Okay.

350
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.960
Participant 8: Let me try to reopen it.

351
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.069
Jamie: Now I see me.

352
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:16.269
Jamie: I see up there's a tab on the right side of the browser window that looks like the form.

353
00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.040
Participant 8: Showing folder. Let me try showing folder.

354
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.660
Participant 8: Do you see that or no?

355
00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.320
Jamie: I?

356
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:35.179
Jamie: Oh, yeah, yeah, I see your downloads. I just need you to go back to the the claims form that we were working on, and.

357
00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:35.980
Participant 8: Oh, okay.

358
00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:41.369
Jamie: Yeah, there's should be a an upload file button on there somewhere that you can actually take that.

359
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.990
Jamie: Yeah, the Pdf and upload it. Yeah.

360
00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:46.930
Participant 8: Oh, okay. Right? Here.

361
00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.221
Jamie: Yeah, awesome. We got it.

362
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.320
Participant 8: It's.

363
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.052
Jamie: It's it's so difficult to do this virtually.

364
00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.819
Participant 8: So play files.

365
00:36:57.221 --> 00:36:59.309
Jamie: I think it was under your downloads right.

366
00:36:59.310 --> 00:36:59.750
Participant 8: Download.

367
00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.736
Jamie: I don't know where it saved it.

368
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.960
Jamie: I believe I saw it on your downloads.

369
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.740
Jamie K: Yeah, it was in downloads.

370
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.930
Participant 8: Hmm.

371
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:09.314
Jamie: Jamie.

372
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.949
Participant 8: All right. Oh.

373
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.859
Jamie: Confirming my memory skills.

374
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:16.529
Jamie: awesome.

375
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.460
Participant 8: Cool.

376
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.799
Jamie: Cool so do you notice notice anything on this page that you might want to call out.

377
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.469
Participant 8: It automatically. Put the file name up there on.

378
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:28.000
Jamie: No.

379
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:33.700
Jamie: What about those? Those boxes, the blue and the yellow boxes.

380
00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:42.759
Participant 8: We cannot complete verification for this file. You can retry verification, or you can continue without verifying.

381
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.780
Jamie: So what does that mean to you.

382
00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:48.950
Participant 8: Hmm.

383
00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.150
Participant 8: okay.

384
00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.189
Participant 8: They couldn't verify the file. Maybe that it's

385
00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:05.100
Participant 8: I don't know, somehow corrupted but I can still continue.

386
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.010
Jamie: Okay.

387
00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:06.979
Participant 8: To file.

388
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:20.930
Jamie: Now I don't know if you notice, but in the top, in that blue box it talks about file verification. Would you mind taking a look at that, and let me know what you think about that that might help understand what's going on here. Yeah.

389
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.299
Participant 8: Might result. We'll scan your uploads to verify.

390
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:35.319
Participant 8: Please don't refresh your screen. What I think about that.

391
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.040
Jamie: Yeah.

392
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.739
Jamie: Like what it might be doing with the file and.

393
00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.799
Participant 8: It might, it might be trying to verify it, but

394
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:57.929
Participant 8: I mean, which is understandable. But you know, at the same time these forms are always time burdened so

395
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.570
Participant 8: that might be an issue.

396
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:15.360
Participant 8: and I know this form already is like 10 min time burden. So you take a well, it's taking one to 2 min. If it does, that's then you have 8 8 min from start to finish.

397
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.680
Jamie: They could be an issue

398
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:27.929
Jamie: could be an issue. So you wouldn't want to wait that that delay there, or or would you, for the file. Verification purposes.

399
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:34.940
Participant 8: I mean I I probably would wait just to see

400
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:43.539
Participant 8: I've I've made file like travel files before on my healthy vet, and it does that

401
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.178
Participant 8: and it it takes a while. But

402
00:39:48.367 --> 00:39:56.369
Participant 8: It still goes through like, even if I'm over the time burden. But as long as it. It's not an issue. Once you finally submit it.

403
00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.350
Jamie: Okay.

404
00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.270
Jamie: So, seeing that you saw an error pop up, what would your next steps be?

405
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.070
Participant 8: I might just put it again like, or just continue.

406
00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.959
Participant 8: if I put it again and did the same error, I would just try. Continue.

407
00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:22.130
Jamie: Okay, good to know. You could just hit. Continue for the sake of this.

408
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.950
Participant 8: Okay.

409
00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:37.510
Jamie: And then same kind of questions on this page. So this is going to be another upload page. So while you're looking through this, I'll get the other one queued up for you to download, but you can take a look at this, and just kind of explain to me in your own words. What what do you think it's asking for?

410
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.529
Participant 8: a copy of

411
00:40:50.570 --> 00:41:00.394
Participant 8: benefits. Excuse me of Sam's insurance provider. It's not the same as the summary for the health insurance.

412
00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.410
Participant 8: yes, sorry specifically.

413
00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:18.890
Participant 8: Let's see what date the providers again, like the provider's information. The name

414
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:29.070
Participant 8: which insurance paid for it. 5 digit Cpt.

415
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:34.189
Participant 8: Or Hcpcs. Comma proceed. It's a coding system,

416
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:43.196
Participant 8: current procedural terminology. So I'm thinking, like some type of 5 digit terminology that they use and

417
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:55.310
Participant 8: a coding system description of service or medical procedure, the amount paid by the provider explanation.

418
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.850
Participant 8: She was just sent by mail or email

419
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:16.960
Participant 8: contact Sam's insurance provider. If you have more questions about where to find this document, so I would think if I didn't ask her doctor directly, I would probably have to wait for mail if they want this type of information for me to be able to upload it or provide that

420
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:18.970
Participant 8: that info.

421
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.799
Participant 8: Okay? So you have to wait for it to come in.

422
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.390
Jamie: In order to complete this claim, form.

423
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:25.270
Participant 8: Yes.

424
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:33.250
Jamie: Okay, so I did. Put that second download on there, called Sample Eob.

425
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:44.600
Jamie: Yeah. You go ahead and download that again and then upload it again into the form.

426
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:29.050
Participant 8: Let me drop this down and go back here, so excuse me.

427
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:30.040
Jamie: Pretty good.

428
00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:34.180
Participant 8: I've had like coughing issues since last night.

429
00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:34.770
Jamie: Oh no!

430
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:42.160
Participant 8: I think it's because I had the fan like directly in my face, because I'm getting older and having menopause issues.

431
00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.840
Jamie: Sorry to hear that hope. You feel better.

432
00:43:45.754 --> 00:43:54.140
Participant 8: Thanks. Okay, so this is the same thing as the last one.

433
00:43:54.140 --> 00:44:00.090
Jamie: Okay. So in real life, if you would have got this message twice. Now, what would your next steps be?

434
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:01.300
Participant 8: Honestly.

435
00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.844
Jamie: Feeling about that, too.

436
00:44:03.669 --> 00:44:14.209
Participant 8: My next step would be like I I probably would try it a second time, like just to wait and see what happens if

437
00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:20.689
Participant 8: I say continue, and then, like the former, just seems too corrupted.

438
00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:27.499
Participant 8: and how I feel about it is, if it doesn't, I would be very frustrated.

439
00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:39.520
Jamie: Okay, fair enough. So, based on your experience with uploading some files today to your claim, would you prefer a file verification, prefer no file verification.

440
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:47.870
Participant 8: I prefer no file verification, I would think, as long as they can see it somehow, like

441
00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:54.740
Participant 8: I mean, you should be able to upload it more than one way besides. Pdf,

442
00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:56.850
Jamie: Okay.

443
00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:02.419
Participant 8: Or, you know, have an option for them to send that request to the

444
00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:06.960
Participant 8: provider or community care. They usually have that information.

445
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.820
Participant 8: I have the insurance provider send it directly to chant. Va.

446
00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.590
Participant 8: Yes.

447
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.064
Jamie: Yeah, I mean, that would be great.

448
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.159
Participant 8: No, it was.

449
00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.376
Jamie: They have to do this.

450
00:45:17.008 --> 00:45:19.341
Participant 8: Hey! Hey! I need your info.

451
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:34.410
Jamie: So, yeah, another rating question for you on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to upload supporting documents to your claim.

452
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.952
Participant 8: Very easy. Only because

453
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:50.700
Participant 8: like, I'm familiar, like, well, depending on what device I'm using, like, especially the phone, like, I know how to

454
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:59.629
Participant 8: upload a document. And this form is

455
00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:05.421
Participant 8: somewhat similar when you upload, like, you know, like for veterans,

456
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:11.969
Participant 8: when you submit for travel, or you submit for certain things.

457
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:19.140
Participant 8: It's similar, like, I don't usually get that error where for some reason they're not able to

458
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.342
Participant 8: verify it. Usually.

459
00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:34.250
Participant 8: you know, like, and I know this is off subject. But still on subject, even though it's the same site, but different link for the form.

460
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:48.290
Participant 8: There's so many verification issues just to log in with my healthy vet, this one already being on it and on the form. The only issue I saw was the verification.

461
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:49.030
Jamie: Hmm.

462
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:54.119
Participant 8: And not knowing what happens. If you decide to not

463
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:59.409
Participant 8: choose to wait one or 2 min, and then you press. Continue. What's after. Continue.

464
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:00.560
Jamie: Hmm.

465
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.519
Participant 8: So you might be submitting a form that

466
00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:09.550
Participant 8: there is no proof for what is being asked of the claim.

467
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.949
Jamie: Okay, that's all good information. Yeah.

468
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:21.879
Jamie: So at this moment you go ahead and click, continue and move on to the next screen.

469
00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:37.529
Jamie: And then, like, I said, we're not going to be submitting the form today. But if you could just take a look and review the screen for a second, and let me know any thoughts on it. How you feeling about it.

470
00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:49.300
Participant 8: I feel fine about it. It's simplified. It's not difficult. It's not

471
00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.770
Participant 8: redirecting you to many other pages.

472
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:59.390
Participant 8: Form is definitely easier than forms I have to fill out for myself.

473
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.840
Jamie: Hmm.

474
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.500
Participant 8: But definitely easier.

475
00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:14.400
Jamie: Okay, great so just out of curiosity. If you were to click the submit form, button down, down at the bottom, what do you think would happen next.

476
00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.710
Participant 8: I think it was.

477
00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:29.520
Participant 8: Go through to be reviewed, and you will find out if

478
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:42.210
Participant 8: they approved it or not. Based off of the upload that didn't get that didn't chose to continue before

479
00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:47.420
Participant 8: the like the one or 2 min, or it actually being verified.

480
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:48.270
Jamie: That's correct.

481
00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:56.590
Jamie: So they will make a decision based on the the verified documents or unverified documents at that point.

482
00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:58.970
Participant 8: Yes, what was provided?

483
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.689
Jamie: You don't have to go and do anything else on this page.

484
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:03.450
Jamie: Oh, okay.

485
00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:25.600
Jamie: no extra typing. If you don't have to. A couple more questions about this, and then we can move on to our next task, which requires one more download. But we'll explain it when we get there. So after you submit your form. How long do you think it would be until you got notified about a decision from champion.

486
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:39.510
Participant 8: depending on what day it was, I would say 7 to 10 days.

487
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:41.359
Jamie: 7 to 10 days. Okay.

488
00:49:41.932 --> 00:49:48.989
Jamie: and how would you expect to receive that notification by like a mail, a mailed letter or email or text?

489
00:49:51.448 --> 00:49:55.220
Participant 8: Probably male. Yeah, probably male.

490
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:56.160
Jamie: Okay.

491
00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:03.879
Participant 8: From experience, like seeing how how much quicker I get it in certain ways.

492
00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:08.618
Participant 8: The only other way, like I would see it is if I went looking for it

493
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:15.829
Participant 8: or if it popped up somehow. But it usually doesn't like I usually get mail like physical mail.

494
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:16.740
Jamie: Okay.

495
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:29.779
Jamie: kind of related to that. It's something that you touched on just a second ago. If you could check the status of the claim before you received that letter. How would you expect to find it.

496
00:50:30.805 --> 00:50:37.889
Participant 8: On the same site, and then probably the same link.

497
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.840
Jamie: And the option.

498
00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.410
Participant 8: For submitted claims.

499
00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:44.650
Jamie: Okay.

500
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:52.680
Jamie: so you would expect to go to the same form, and there'll be something on there for, like past submitted claims. Okay? Excellent.

501
00:50:53.509 --> 00:51:07.929
Jamie: So on another rated question here, there's a lot of them on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the CHAMPVA form.

502
00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:09.330
Participant 8: Very easy.

503
00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:14.880
Jamie: Awesome any other insight into? Why, it was easy.

504
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:16.988
Participant 8: It's not as difficult as

505
00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:22.450
Participant 8: my healthy vet and me filling out my forms.

506
00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:27.030
Participant 8: The that's for sure. Mine is much more.

507
00:51:28.443 --> 00:51:33.756
Participant 8: you know like more verification more issues, more time loading.

508
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:34.720
Jamie: Hmm.

509
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.429
Participant 8: There's just a lot of issues.

510
00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:44.770
Participant 8: like navigation and back and forth to pages and links. And this one is simple.

511
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:47.680
Participant 8: It's not. It's not difficult at all.

512
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.430
Jamie: Well, great to hear. And thanks for sharing.

513
00:51:51.114 --> 00:51:57.195
Jamie: Yeah. So the the next task I'm gonna I'm gonna put another download. Apologize.

514
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:58.429
Participant 8: No, you're fine.

515
00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:19.509
Jamie: In the chat. And this one, I want you to imagine that. Okay, we submitted the form, and then, after a certain amount of time while you're waiting for the decision to come back, you get this letter from Champion in the mail. So once you download that, open it up and take a look at the letter and let me know what you think.

516
00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.420
Jamie: Yeah.

517
00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.620
Participant 8: Just have to remember to delete these files.

518
00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:28.105
Jamie: Yeah.

519
00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:32.265
Participant 8: It's gonna eat up my data now. So oh, no, see.

520
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:33.818
Jamie: I don't want that.

521
00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:38.659
Participant 8: It's oh, it's control. Si believe. Let me see. Yeah.

522
00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.300
Jamie: There it is!

523
00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:45.420
Participant 8: One, this one.

524
00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:47.539
Jamie: Maybe not to save this one this time.

525
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.126
Participant 8: Oh, okay.

526
00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.310
Jamie: We're not gonna be uploading it, but.

527
00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:53.259
Participant 8: Well, is is it? Gonna pop up, though? That's the thing.

528
00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.137
Jamie: Oh, yeah, you might lose it.

529
00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:56.850
Jamie: Put it.

530
00:52:59.260 --> 00:52:59.890
Participant 8: Okay.

531
00:53:00.246 --> 00:53:07.730
Jamie: Through this and yeah, just let me know when you're done. And just wanna ask some questions about it.

532
00:53:10.314 --> 00:53:11.490
Participant 8: Yes.

533
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:27.170
Participant 8: messing time. Cisco.

534
00:53:28.585 --> 00:53:31.019
Participant 8: You said you wanted my opinion.

535
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:34.042
Jamie: Yeah. Like, do you understand the purpose of the letter?

536
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.820
Participant 8: Yes, there was a denial somewhere. Let me see.

537
00:53:59.133 --> 00:53:59.910
Participant 8: Hmm!

538
00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:11.629
Participant 8: Well, not. Well, not necessarily a denial, then. Well, yeah. Well.

539
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:19.519
Participant 8: in the beginning of the letter. It's if you want to add more or submit more. You have

540
00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:24.279
Participant 8: an option to send it in by mail to address, or

541
00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:30.910
Participant 8: if you have a question you can call, it's missing a diagnosis code.

542
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:31.480
Jamie: Okay.

543
00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:42.930
Participant 8: And then the option to check. I do not have the documentation and require assistance obtaining it. Please do not check this box if you're returning

544
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:45.740
Participant 8: the requested documentation.

545
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:51.610
Jamie: Okay, so what do you think about all that?

546
00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:10.110
Participant 8: I mean, it's fine. Thank and thank you for notifying me. But it could have been because I submitted without it verifying the document that was uploaded.

547
00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:14.880
Jamie: Okay, so what do you think you need to do to resolve this at this point.

548
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:22.870
Participant 8: let's see.

549
00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.071
Participant 8: I would probably do it the old way.

550
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:39.619
Participant 8: Try to get some type of physical document or just print the document somehow, scan it up, upload it.

551
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:46.560
Participant 8: maybe fax it in, or

552
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:57.100
Participant 8: see if I can call in some other way. Try to provide it instead of going through the link. Maybe I could

553
00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:00.386
Participant 8: send it to an email.

554
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:04.589
Participant 8: I wouldn't want to check the box off

555
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:07.180
Jamie: Hmm! Why is that?

556
00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:16.439
Participant 8: Because it says I don't have the requested document and require assistance. So this looks like a letterhead.

557
00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:21.380
Jamie: It doesn't look like an email. So if it's a letterhead.

558
00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:26.769
Participant 8: And I have time to do that. Possibly

559
00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:33.310
Participant 8: I wouldn't check this out until after I've called that number. If

560
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:45.442
Participant 8: that number. I'm not able to get a hold of somebody that can assist me in a quicker way to provide it or somehow get it. Then then this will be like my ultimate

561
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:47.610
Participant 8: thing.

562
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.440
Participant 8: I mean, I have one year, from what it says.

563
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.540
Jamie: Okay?

564
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.759
Jamie: So you would. You would take a look at this.

565
00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:02.930
Jamie: see if you call it. If you call the number if you have any questions, then try to resubmit it.

566
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:03.700
Participant 8: Yes.

567
00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.120
Jamie: Yeah, okay?

568
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:12.399
Jamie: And you're you're comfortable because you do have time to kind of work this out. Is that what you're saying.

569
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:17.544
Participant 8: Yes, but it it would be a pain, you know, like you have to do it that way.

570
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:29.089
Jamie: Yeah. So if you did have the option to do this online, would you? Would you skip that and still want to do it manually, like via the mail, or calling, or sending an email.

571
00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.530
Participant 8: hmm!

572
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:46.170
Participant 8: I probably would wait till I'm able to get that code from

573
00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:54.320
Participant 8: the doctor. I probably would also still call the phone number and see if I could submit it

574
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:59.270
Participant 8: in a quicker way. Since the upload

575
00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:03.746
Participant 8: is not working for verification on the site,

576
00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:07.560
Participant 8: could be a site issue, could be anything.

577
00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:08.640
Jamie: Okay.

578
00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:22.850
Jamie: cool. So on a scale of one to 5, 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how well do you think this letter explains what you need to do in order to resolve the problem with your chant. Va. Claim.

579
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:28.032
Jamie: I think it does very well.

580
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:37.540
Participant 8: My only thing is like, not many people walk around with, you know codes.

581
00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:49.900
Participant 8: you know. So it it's it's like, you know, pressure, because then you have to go searching for stuff that you're not that familiar with. So.

582
00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:50.730
Jamie: Yeah.

583
00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:57.609
Jamie: Really understandable. So if you could add anything to this letter, what would it be.

584
00:58:59.051 --> 00:59:02.770
Participant 8: A box for the option for them

585
00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:06.269
Participant 8: to request that information from the doctor.

586
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:09.080
Participant 8: Okay, and let them provide it.

587
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:11.639
Jamie: Fair enough.

588
00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:27.269
Jamie: awesome. Thank you for that. So, on a scale of one to 5 again, one being poorly and 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel? You are to resolve this claim, based on this letter.

589
00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:35.220
Participant 8: Right away. Right away, or just just knowing what you need to do

590
00:59:35.678 --> 00:59:39.349
Participant 8: knowing what I need to do. 7

591
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.920
Participant 8: But as far as providing 5.

592
00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:44.730
Jamie: Okay, so

593
00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:54.309
Jamie: so very prepared. But actually, when it comes down to providing not so much, not not so confident.

594
00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:55.060
Participant 8: Correct.

595
00:59:55.060 --> 01:00:04.295
Jamie: Okay, I gotcha so at this point we're gonna go back to the claims form. You might still need to reference this letter.

596
01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:13.840
Jamie: in in a few moments when you get to the part in the form. But we're gonna we're gonna hop back over to the claims form. I'm gonna give you a fresh link, because this will.

597
01:00:14.387 --> 01:00:16.030
Participant 8: Excuse me. Sorry.

598
01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:16.950
Participant 8: No problem.

599
01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:23.669
Jamie: So if you go ahead and click that link in the chat that I just sent you, that will basically restart the form for you.

600
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:34.900
Jamie: Yeah, you could leave without making changes. You're good.

601
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:47.490
Jamie: Alright. So this is the form that we used before. So, looking at this page, do you think you're in the right place to resubmit your claim. We're gonna pretend that you are. Gonna go forward and try to resubmit this online.

602
01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:47.930
Participant 8: Friend.

603
01:00:48.205 --> 01:00:50.405
Jamie: I know you said that you wouldn't. But

604
01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:59.599
Jamie: we're gonna we're gonna try, anyway. So yeah, let me know. If you think this is the right page that you need to get this started with.

605
01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.130
Participant 8: Yes.

606
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:04.150
Jamie: Okay, what makes you think that you're in the right spot.

607
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.139
Participant 8: It. It looks the same from when I submit it.

608
01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:15.779
Jamie: Okay? So you're familiar with the the form. So, yeah, you could go ahead and click that. Start your form without signing in button. Oh.

609
01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.130
Participant 8: Oh, here we go.

610
01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:20.319
Participant 8: Exit out of that. Yeah, that that's not working. So

611
01:01:20.666 --> 01:01:22.743
Participant 8: I know what that one is.

612
01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:28.729
Participant 8: Let's see.

613
01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.900
Jamie: Yeah, that link right under there.

614
01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:37.144
Jamie: Oh, should be under that blue button, the start your form with, yeah, it's a little hidden.

615
01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:46.773
Jamie: Okay? So yeah, you could go through this and submit it as if you're submitting the resubmission. The re, yeah.

616
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:49.810
Participant 8: A resubmission.

617
01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:50.910
Jamie: Yep.

618
01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:51.950
Participant 8: Okay.

619
01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:59.451
Jamie: Okay, take a look at this page,

620
01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:05.100
Jamie: and just let me know what you think it's asking for and where to find it.

621
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:19.080
Participant 8: I would think it would be a number on the letter that they sent somewhere.

622
01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.620
Jamie: Okay.

623
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:29.590
Participant 8: I don't know to put that so make one up.

624
01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:39.280
Jamie: You could make one up or if you wanna if it's handy, you could go back to that letter and reference it. If not. That's totally fine, too, because I know it's a struggle to switch things.

625
01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:43.329
Participant 8: So many things right.

626
01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:44.530
Jamie: Okay.

627
01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:53.780
Participant 8: Continue was the original type. Medical. It was it? Yeah, it was.

628
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:54.540
Jamie: Yep.

629
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:58.689
Participant 8: Let's see, provider some makeup.

630
01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:02.849
Jamie: Yeah. Would you have all this information on hand?

631
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:04.283
Participant 8: No, no.

632
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.660
Jamie: Need to take a pause and go look for it.

633
01:03:07.198 --> 01:03:12.310
Participant 8: Yeah, I probably would make up

634
01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:37.349
Jamie: Hmm! What is going on over here? Oh, and right now.

635
01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:39.570
Jamie: Oh, it's a past date. Oh.

636
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:44.639
Jamie: maybe we could change it to like 2024. It work.

637
01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.860
Jamie: I thought we found a bug for a second.

638
01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:50.320
Jamie: I'm good.

639
01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.162
Participant 8: Excited, but

640
01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:55.860
Jamie: Oh, that one needs to change too.

641
01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:04.569
Participant 8: Wait. What's the same day? That's just a say, a day later.

642
01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:09.619
Participant 8: okay. A day later, took a whole day to help her.

643
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:11.730
Jamie: Sometimes it, it does.

644
01:04:13.885 --> 01:04:19.229
Participant 8: And then I would think I would have the option again.

645
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:29.750
Jamie: Yeah. Yeah, just take a look and read through the the content on this page. And same thing. Let me know what you think, and what it's asking for.

646
01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:39.839
Participant 8: I think it's asking for that missing document that they needed.

647
01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.429
Participant 8: Well, no code. It's a code or something. They they need. It.

648
01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.459
Jamie: Okay, so what? What would you upload here?

649
01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:54.470
Participant 8: I would upload this. The health summary.

650
01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.949
Participant 8: No cause it. No, I think it asked for the doctor's

651
01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:02.641
Participant 8: code. Some some code of the the provider.

652
01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:05.370
Jamie: Okay. The code that was listed on the letter.

653
01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:11.430
Jamie: Yeah, is there anything else that you would upload here?

654
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:12.060
Jamie: Thank you.

655
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:13.130
Jamie: Missing code.

656
01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.400
Participant 8: The I will resubmit the claim again and

657
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:38.300
Participant 8: attach prescription, pharmacy statements, and that code.

658
01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:41.980
Jamie: Okay.

659
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:49.750
Participant 8: And since it didn't verify it through pdf, maybe I will try Jpeg or.

660
01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:50.820
Jamie: Format.

661
01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:56.719
Participant 8: Yes, I wanna make sure it's smaller than the file size is smaller.

662
01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.200
Jamie: Okay? So you just check that. How to upload files. Make sure that

663
01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:05.199
Jamie: it's it's in the correct parameters is what you're saying.

664
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.160
Participant 8: Yes.

665
01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:21.420
Jamie: Okay and give it another shot. Alright. You could go ahead. Just upload one of the other files that I sent you. It doesn't matter which one just long as it uploads. And you're gonna see the error screen pop up again. But we're gonna ignore that because we already talked about it so we could

666
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:25.260
Jamie: just hit. Continue like I said, it's a demo.

667
01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.300
Participant 8: Okay.

668
01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:35.420
Jamie: It's not totally functioning. A hundred percent right now. So on this screen. Why do you think it's asking you for the sponsor information?

669
01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:45.249
Participant 8: because I'm the one submitted it. And they're my beneficiary, my dependent.

670
01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:46.400
Jamie: Okay. Great.

671
01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.590
Participant 8: See.

672
01:06:47.590 --> 01:07:00.994
Jamie: So you could go through and just fill this out and same thing. Let me know if anything pops up, how you're feeling about it. If it's, you know, frustrating or super easy, just, you know. Talk out loud and let me let me know.

673
01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:06.370
Participant 8: It's easy. It's not difficult.

674
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:07.130
Jamie: Okay.

675
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:22.260
Participant 8: And normally, that'll be easier anyways, because, like, I usually have auto fill.

676
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.210
Jamie: Hmm.

677
01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:27.979
Participant 8: I wouldn't have to, you know. Do all this?

678
01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:32.630
Participant 8: Okay? So you rely on that, that Autofill function within your browser.

679
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:33.510
Participant 8: Yes.

680
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:34.250
Jamie: Okay.

681
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.190
Participant 8: I didn't.

682
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:36.200
Jamie: Same. I love it.

683
01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:42.649
Participant 8: It's convenient. It's very resourceful.

684
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:43.350
Jamie: Yeah.

685
01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:48.890
Participant 8: Email.

686
01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:45.699
Jamie: And being. This is a resubmission. How do you feel about the amount of information it's asking for.

687
01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:51.720
Participant 8: Fine. It's pretty much, mostly the same.

688
01:08:51.849 --> 01:08:52.669
Jamie: Okay.

689
01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:59.809
Participant 8: Oh, continue sense information.

690
01:09:00.649 --> 01:09:03.069
Jamie: Is there anything you would change about this process.

691
01:09:05.223 --> 01:09:11.459
Participant 8: I probably would. If I'm resubmitting

692
01:09:12.169 --> 01:09:17.189
Participant 8: just for verification of one thing that maybe they need it.

693
01:09:17.489 --> 01:09:24.529
Participant 8: I would eliminate all of this, and probably just only put

694
01:09:25.619 --> 01:09:33.869
Participant 8: a section to where I can provide that documentation. When you on the the site.

695
01:09:34.089 --> 01:09:42.419
Participant 8: you have to verify anyways. And so they would already have that information usually so.

696
01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.270
Jamie: Okay.

697
01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:45.403
Participant 8: That's the only reason why I would do that.

698
01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.450
Participant 8: Oh.

699
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:50.809
Jamie: I'm distracting you.

700
01:09:51.362 --> 01:09:53.017
Participant 8: Know you're fine.

701
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.020
Participant 8: Let me make that one.

702
01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:08.780
Participant 8: I type really fast. What my indexes hold on.

703
01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:17.820
Jamie: You're good. So we're on the the review page again, knowing that this is a resubmission. Would you do anything differently on this page?

704
01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:51.465
Participant 8: no, so far I wouldn't.

705
01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.330
Jamie: Okay.

706
01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:57.449
Participant 8: Since I've already uploaded what they needed.

707
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:14.900
Jamie: Okay, that's fair enough. So same questions. As I asked you before about reviewing the sorry about the review page. So without hitting submit. Just what would you expect to happen next?

708
01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.949
Jamie: Now that this is a resubmission, not a not a regular claim.

709
01:11:20.725 --> 01:11:26.609
Participant 8: I think it would be under review.

710
01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:27.790
Jamie: Okay.

711
01:11:28.193 --> 01:11:31.020
Participant 8: Just like it, like the 1st one.

712
01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:37.060
Participant 8: But with, you know, the documentation on what they wanted

713
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:43.340
Participant 8: or needed to, I guess, like, start the process of, you know, like approval.

714
01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:48.879
Jamie: Okay, I got you so like, there would be like a status change. Basically.

715
01:11:50.206 --> 01:11:51.073
Jamie: Okay,

716
01:11:52.340 --> 01:12:01.559
Jamie: so would you expect there to be any difference in the amount of time it would take to process the original claim as compared to a resubmission.

717
01:12:04.085 --> 01:12:08.240
Participant 8: I think resubmission should be quicker.

718
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:09.310
Jamie: Okay.

719
01:12:10.937 --> 01:12:14.630
Jamie: How how much quicker would you expect that just out of curiosity.

720
01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.989
Participant 8: I would hope, within 7 to 10 days at least.

721
01:12:23.150 --> 01:12:23.880
Jamie: Okay.

722
01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:39.689
Jamie: sounds good. So coming back to these fun rating questions on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this form.

723
01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:40.936
Participant 8: Very easy.

724
01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.670
Jamie: Great. Okay?

725
01:12:43.333 --> 01:12:47.569
Jamie: Anything that like sticks out in your mind as being super easy.

726
01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.697
Participant 8: The form itself.

727
01:12:52.820 --> 01:13:01.256
Participant 8: I wish you know my end. My forms were this easy, so I think it's it's very easy, very simplified. It's not

728
01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.269
Participant 8: It's not difficult.

729
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:05.050
Jamie: Okay.

730
01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:12.759
Jamie: Great. How would you compare your experience with submitting the original claim versus submitting the resubmission.

731
01:13:14.107 --> 01:13:15.660
Participant 8: Easy. Very easy.

732
01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:16.470
Jamie: Okay.

733
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:19.220
Jamie: Great. What made it easier or hard?

734
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:24.379
Participant 8: What made it easy is you're just

735
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:28.357
Participant 8: providing that one part that they needed

736
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:33.670
Participant 8: and it's pretty much the same information that they asked you the 1st time.

737
01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:41.150
Jamie: Okay, so easy, because it's just asking for like one different thing. Compared to what you originally filled out.

738
01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:41.940
Participant 8: Yes.

739
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:55.569
Jamie: Okay, awesome. So I just have a couple other questions for you, and then we could wrap this up if you want, you could stop sharing your screen. We don't need the forms or the documents anymore. But that's totally up to you.

740
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:58.239
Jamie: If you want to turn that off.

741
01:13:59.630 --> 01:14:00.400
Participant 8: Okay.

742
01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:07.120
Jamie: Okay, great. So overall. Was there anything in the session that you saw that worked well for you?

743
01:14:09.238 --> 01:14:15.730
Participant 8: The form itself. The upload is very quick.

744
01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:25.719
Participant 8: I don't usually get that quick of a upload and the options to resubmit.

745
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.950
Participant 8: Yeah, like I, I liked it.

746
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:30.510
Jamie: Okay.

747
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:37.489
Participant 8: I honestly wish my my links and my claims were like that.

748
01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:39.419
Participant 8: for for when I do mine

749
01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:45.430
Jamie: What which claims are. If you don't mind sharing. Is it a va benefit.

750
01:14:45.802 --> 01:14:51.150
Participant 8: Yeah. So like, if like, say, if I do travel, you know.

751
01:14:52.400 --> 01:15:20.600
Participant 8: I have to log in to my health event, and then I have like, it'll go from my health event to Yougov. And then, once you verify, it's a it's a phone call. It sends a code. I have to put that code in, and then once you get in there, it takes you right back to my health event, and then you go right back to Yougov. And so I have to go to another portal within that site just to submit a claim which is Btss.

752
01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.070
Jamie: Hmm! And.

753
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:26.890
Participant 8: And it takes forever to load. So like if you upload documents like, says community care.

754
01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:29.860
Participant 8: It takes forever.

755
01:15:30.614 --> 01:15:34.565
Participant 8: And it's it's not easy like that.

756
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:39.400
Participant 8: So their their claims forms is much easier.

757
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:44.440
Jamie: Interesting, but well, I'm happy to hear ours is easy, at least.

758
01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:45.140
Participant 8: Unless.

759
01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:58.910
Jamie: Thing to burden you with. But yeah, I understand that that could be really frustrating. It have to be bounced around, and all the verification stuff. The I think it's what the id me send you the phone call.

760
01:15:59.050 --> 01:15:59.625
Jamie: Yeah.

761
01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:04.754
Participant 8: And yougov cause they just redesigned it. And

762
01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:12.449
Participant 8: now I noticed they asked you a question. If you would like to share your information. They've never asked that before.

763
01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:13.130
Jamie: Oh!

764
01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:23.950
Participant 8: So, Pop, it's like a auto pop up at the bottom. And I'll say, you guys never asked me this before. Why would I want to share that like when it's always been a security issue.

765
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:25.410
Participant 8: Yeah, I don't know. That's.

766
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:30.680
Jamie: I haven't seen that before. I'll have to check it out. But that that's new to me.

767
01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.209
Participant 8: You know.

768
01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:38.999
Jamie: Great. So on this. These claims form that you submitted. Was there anything unclear, or didn't work well for you?

769
01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.250
Participant 8: No, it wasn't anything.

770
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:53.370
Jamie: Okay, so pretty like you said, pretty simple. Easy. With that, you know. Past experience of having use my healthy vet and the the travel claims and all that stuff.

771
01:16:55.011 --> 01:17:04.009
Jamie: So what were your thoughts about the information that was provided on this form? Was it just enough? Was it too much information? Was it just kind of right in the middle.

772
01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:09.669
Participant 8: It was. It was enough. Yeah, it was enough.

773
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:11.529
Participant 8: It definitely was enough.

774
01:17:11.970 --> 01:17:12.580
Jamie: Okay.

775
01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:21.950
Jamie: so. And I did. You fill out a champion, for I think I remember you saying you were filled out a champion one time before right.

776
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:22.440
Participant 8: Yes.

777
01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:28.779
Jamie: A few times. So how was that experience compared to this one with filling it all out online?

778
01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:30.079
Participant 8: This one was better.

779
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.100
Jamie: Okay, and what?

780
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:31.890
Participant 8: I'm gonna.

781
01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:33.165
Jamie: In what ways?

782
01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:43.819
Participant 8: Paperwork complications with the timeframe of processing the claims.

783
01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:44.150
Jamie: And.

784
01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:49.390
Participant 8: But you know, then again, it you know, part of it was situational issues with

785
01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.171
Participant 8: you know, Covid and stuff. But

786
01:17:54.360 --> 01:18:04.309
Participant 8: this this was just more simpler, because I was like mostly doing a lot of what was requested like hand paperwork. And it was

787
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.640
Participant 8: it wasn't fun.

788
01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:14.830
Participant 8: This one is very simple, easy, straight to the point, and I would prefer it like that.

789
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:23.040
Jamie: Okay, well, that's great information. I appreciate that. That's actually all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions for me?

790
01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.720
Participant 8: No.

791
01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.330
Jamie: Yeah. Great.

792
01:18:25.330 --> 01:18:27.260
Participant 8: I like your guitars and your lightsaber.

793
01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:35.208
Jamie: Oh, yeah, I have a guitar obsession, and I'm also a little bit of a nerd

794
01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.990
Jamie: cool. Cool. That's cool, though.

795
01:18:36.990 --> 01:19:00.490
Jamie: Thanks. Yeah. So I just gonna ask you that one question again about the video clips. So now that we had our discussion, just wanted to circle back and ask if you're still comfortable with us sharing a video clip from your session today with our Va partners, just to remind you we'll remove any identifying information. You know, if we do go forward and use it.

796
01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:01.430
Participant 8: That's fine!

797
01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:25.380
Jamie: Okay, great, yeah. So I just want to say, Thank you. And we really appreciate you hopping on. I'm glad we were able to to get things sorted out and get through the form and be able to get some great feedback from you. So one last thing, Perigan, we'll be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you could pass along to other veterans

798
01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:38.720
Jamie: or families that you may know just to give them a chance to participate in future research studies like this. So yeah, keep an eye out for that, and thank you so much.

799
01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.540
Participant 8: Cool. Thank you.

800
01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:41.470
Jamie: Have have a nice day.

801
01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:42.150
Participant 8: You too.

802
01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:42.990
Jamie: Okay. Thanks.

803
01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:43.780
Participant 8: Bye, bye.
