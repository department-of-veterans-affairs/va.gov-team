00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:16.659
Renata: Alright, if you've got a little pop-up bar in Zoom that says this meeting is being recorded, you can hit the OK button and close out of that. So now that I've started recording, I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.450
P14: Yes.

3
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:27.260
Renata: All right, and are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our session today to share with our other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.290
P14: Yes, I am.

5
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:37.120
Renata: Oh, right, so let's get rolling. So, first question for ya, are you or anyone else in your program currently enrolled in the CHAMPVA program?

6
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.030
P14: Yes.

7
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.040
Renata: Alright, and who, who in your household is, is currently enrolled?

8
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.260
P14: My wife.

9
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.849
Renata: Okay, got it. And how recently did your wife apply for the CHAMPVA program?

10
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.500
P14: In March.

11
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.970
Renata: Oh, okay, so pretty recently.

12
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.830
P14: Yeah, yeah.

13
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.399
Renata: And do you recall what the application experience was like?

14
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.100
P14: it was… pretty, like… forward, so it was pretty, like, easy. …

15
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.460
P14: But the process of getting approved, I mean, it just took, you know, a very long time. I mean…

16
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.940
P14: We haven't even got her, like, card yet.

17
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.180
P14: ….

18
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.840
Renata: Okay.

19
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:29.480
P14: But… we have been… Like, using it a little bit, because, you know, she's been without health insurance, so…

20
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.900
P14: ….

21
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.270
Renata: Got it.

22
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.520
P14: Yeah, they said that they would…

23
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.930
P14: You know, either, like, reimburse or, …

24
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.910
P14: I guess, like, the urgent cares and stuff have just been calling.

25
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.130
P14: …

26
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.709
P14: To, like, confirm that she has it, because she got approved, but, you know, it just takes, like, a really long time to process.

27
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.409
Renata: Okay, wow, so I just want to double check my understanding.

28
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.850
Renata: She's been approved, but the card hasn't arrived in the mail, so everything's, like, manually checking coverage at this point?

29
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:18.329
P14: Yeah, yeah, like, if we go somewhere, we will tell them that we're using, like, CHAMPVA, but we don't have, like, an insurance card, so they have to call, I guess, some number that they have.

30
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.830
P14: To confirm it.

31
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.839
Renata: Geez, I'm sorry, that's frustrating, I apologize.

32
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.989
P14: No, it's all good.

33
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:33.069
Renata: When you applied for CHAMPVA, did you do a PDF form, a paper form, or anything online on VA.gov?

34
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.849
P14: Yeah, it was a PDF form.

35
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.610
Renata: Okay. Yeah.

36
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.440
P14: Yeah.

37
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.950
Renata: And have you submitted any medical or pharmacy claims to the CHAMPVA program, or have the providers all handled that?

38
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.860
P14: The providers usually… Yeah, I'm pretty sure the provider sent it at all.

39
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.730
Renata: Okay, got it.

40
00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:15.940
Renata: Thank you for answering all my questions. So at this point, we're gonna go to the point in the session that I mentioned before with that demo tool. So at this point, I'm going to be sharing a link in the Zoom chat, which I'd like you to open in your browser, and then share your screen in Zoom, and I can… I can walk through any of the tech to get that set up. But I wanted to just give you a second to close out any other apps you might have running.

41
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.540
Renata: Silence notifications, so that when you screen share, we…

42
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.090
Renata: We can't get all up in your business. And then let me know when you're ready for that link, and I'll put it in the Zoom chat for you.

43
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.099
P14: Oh, yeah.

44
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.430
Renata: Alright.

45
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.260
Renata: Sharing that now.

46
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.569
Renata: There you go.

47
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.029
P14: So… let's see… Am I sharing yet? My screen?

48
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.719
Renata: Not sharing it. Are you in the Zoom app, or are you in your browser?

49
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.530
P14: Now I'm back in the Zoom app, so let's…

50
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.940
P14: Here we go.

51
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.959
Renata: Alright, yep, I can see your screen. If you can go back to your browser.

52
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.930
P14: Yeah.

53
00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:31.699
Renata: Perfect. Okay, so before we start filling this form out, just a few things, to be aware of. Like I said before, this is our testing site. It's a demo tool, and we're not going to submit anything today, but…

54
00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:43.259
Renata: Just a reminder again that nothing we click on in the form will have any bearing on your benefits. As we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers, if you don't want to use real information.

55
00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:51.169
Renata: And you should have received an email, confirming the session today that had some documents attached. Did you download those by chance?

56
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.050
P14: Oh, I didn't download them, but….

57
00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:10.500
Renata: Oh, not a problem. I also have links to them, so when we get to pages where it's asking you to upload stuff, we can either pause screen share and you can download those, or I can give you the links or whatever, but I just like to ask before we get in the weeds. But any questions for me before we get going?

58
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.120
P14: Nope.

59
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:19.119
Renata: Alright, so you can scroll up and down this page, but without clicking anything yet, I'd just like you to review the information and let me know your initial thoughts.

60
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.820
P14: Alright…

61
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.940
P14: Mmm…

62
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.869
P14: Anything that's good. …

63
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:53.119
P14: Yeah, I think this is pretty, pretty normal, like, for most of the stuff I click on on VA.gov, like, this is how it looks.

64
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.150
P14: … Okay.

65
00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:11.150
P14: You'll need to submit separate claims for each beneficiary. I mean… Yeah, all that… Sounds good, makes sense.

66
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.250
Renata: Okay.

67
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.609
Renata: So, a few questions for you about this page. In your own words, what type of form is this page describing?

68
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.240
P14: …

69
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.789
Shane Burke: A claim form to, like, file a claim?

70
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.370
P14: Oh, sorry.

71
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:38.310
Renata: Oh, you're good. You can actually swipe on my face on the video down there, and it should… yep, and then it… then it's out of… it should be out of the way.

72
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.590
P14: Oh, okay, cool.

73
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.859
Renata: Oh, it might have taken you back in.

74
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.570
P14: Yeah.

75
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.720
Renata: That way you're not…graced

76
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:53.840
Renata: with my presence on top of the form the whole time. So next question, what types of claims, can you file with this form?

77
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.219
P14: … It looks like if you have…

78
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.660
P14: CHAMPVA, you can file, like, a, …

79
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:19.459
P14: So I guess it's just claims, and you have to submit, like, your supporting documentation, like, your billing and your, you know, EOB.

80
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.830
P14: Pharmacy receipt, find out which support documents…

81
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:37.999
P14: So you can only submit this form, though, right? The VA Form 10-7959A?

82
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.559
Renata: For what specifically?

83
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:48.480
P14: … I believe you're filing a claim to… Like…

84
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.530
P14: For anything, like, if you go to the hospital for a migraine, or…

85
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.419
P14: Maybe if you got in a car crash, or, you know, pretty much anything, …

86
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.930
P14: You just gotta submit your documentation to show that…

87
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.630
P14: you know, you were there. … And what happened, so….

88
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:18.729
Renata: Got it. Thank you for clarifying. So what information do you think you would need in order to fill out this form?

89
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.769
P14: So, you need your itemized billing statement, Explanation of benefits.

90
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.450
P14: From another insurance provider, or a pharmacy receipt.

91
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.640
Renata: Okay.

92
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:44.039
Renata: And if you were on VA.gov today filing a real medical claim, would you have all of that information on hand for your wife, or would you have to stop now and, like, go collect it before filling out the claims form?

93
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.989
P14: … I would probably have at least, like, the…

94
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:57.060
P14: like, if we went to urgent care, I would have… Some sort of documentation showing.

95
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.120
P14: I'd probably have it ready.

96
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:12.329
Renata: Okay, got it. One last question for this page. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel to file a claim based on this page's content?

97
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.740
P14: I'd say 4.

98
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:25.619
Renata: A 4, okay. What would take it from that 4 to a 5, meaning, like, very well prepared?

99
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.670
P14: …

100
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:36.890
P14: Okay, yeah, it says sign in to start form, so that's what I was gonna say, like, sometimes I have problems…

101
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.260
P14: … like, I'll get to these pages on VA.gov, and…

102
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.999
P14: I won't have, like, a button to press.

103
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:54.360
P14: That just brings up the form, you know? It will… Yeah, it just…

104
00:09:54.490 --> 00:10:02.840
P14: Will take me to different places, or it won't be the form that it was just talking about, or, you know, something…

105
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.119
P14: And that nature, so… But this one, I mean…

106
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.370
P14: sign to start your form, as long as I can click that and sign in, and then…

107
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.769
P14: it pulls it up, I mean, that would bring it to a 5.

108
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:26.019
Renata: Okay. Do you normally sign in to do forms for VA? Oh, yeah. It's an option? [P14 nods] Okay, got it, thank you. …

109
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:40.670
Renata: So at this point, I'm gonna have you scroll down to the bottom of the page, and actually where it says below, start your form, like, sign in to start your form, there's a smaller link that says, start your form without signing in, and unfortunately, we're going to pretend we don't have a VA.gov account today. Okay.

110
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:56.900
Renata: So, from this point on, I'm gonna have you fill this form out as though you're submitting a brand new medical claim for your spouse. Just a few things to bear in mind before you get rolling. Again, this is the testing site. We're not submitting anything, but feel free to use fake information for the questions.

111
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:07.199
Renata: And just as you go through the form, please remember to think out loud. We want to hear any reactions as you're experiencing them, and I will pause you to let you know when we have some questions for you.

112
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.480
P14: Okay, cool.

113
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.290
P14: So, which of these best describe you?

114
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.639
P14: I'm a veteran submitting a claim for my spouse.

115
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.590
P14: Yes.

116
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:25.429
P14: But it's still gray area, because, like, do we have a card yet? No, it might ask me if I have…

117
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.540
P14: You know, those numbers. Is this a new claim or a resubmission?

118
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.270
P14: new.

119
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:55.490
Renata: Oh, this is a quirk of our demo tool, like I mentioned, sometimes we get weird error messages. It doesn't like autofill if you're using.

120
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:56.220
P14: Oh, okay.

121
00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.610
Renata: in your browser, so you… you might have to type it the long way, and I apologize.

122
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.720
P14: Oh, no worries.

123
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.630
Renata: So you mentioned that this was a gray area, and you might not know this number [CHAMPVA member number]?

124
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.060
P14: If it's just the same as her social, you know.

125
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:25.770
Renata: Okay.

126
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.860
P14: It should be cool.

127
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:36.110
Renata: Okay, alright. So, a little less scary if it's the same as the social, but if it was asking for, like, a physical card, we might have a problem here.

128
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:44.489
P14: Definitely, yeah, and like, as long as it, you know, this little area… Is… is really helpful.

129
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.570
P14: the, … I'm trying to highlight that this number is usually the same as [Spouse's] social.

130
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.380
P14: …

131
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.059
P14: Yeah, because then I know. If not, I'd be like, oh, you know, what's her CHAMPVA member number?

132
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:43.089
Renata: Alright, for the purposes of today, we're going to imagine that Reese has additional health insurance coverage. In real life, does your spouse have…

133
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.110
Renata: Other health insurance, or is CHAMPVA the primary?

134
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.960
P14: CHAMPVA's the primary.

135
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:58.479
Renata: Okay, got it. Yeah, so I'll have you click yes on this, and then it's gonna ask you some questions about a health insurance provider. Feel free to use fake information there.

136
00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.420
P14: Okay.

137
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.560
P14: I don't even know how… a State Farm one? Probably not. It's like….

138
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.110
Renata: Okay, so we're not testing knowledge or abilities.

139
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:14.470
P14: Yeah.

140
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.699
Renata: This is purely theoretical, so you're good.

141
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.370
P14: Oh yeah.

142
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.389
Renata: And you can click no for additional, health insurance.

143
00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:05.920
Renata: All right, so, we're gonna pause here for a moment, just review the information on this page, let me know when you're done looking at it, and I have some questions for you.

144
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:06.880
P14: Okay.

145
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.850
P14: Alright.

146
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:31.039
Renata: Okay, so before we upload anything, what document are you being asked for on this page?

147
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.129
P14: Pretty much, like.

148
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:47.699
P14: like, the document probably from the hospital, because I think it would have most of that information on it, …

149
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.290
P14: Like, [spouse's] name, date of birth…

150
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.569
P14: the provider's name, medical title, all that stuff. List of charges, date of service.

151
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:07.840
P14: diagnosis, … And then a list of, like, the procedural codes. Procedure codes.

152
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:16.019
Renata: Okay. So you already listed a bunch of stuff off, but, which leads into my next question, which is, what needs to be included in the document?

153
00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:24.059
P14: Basically all of… yeah, all of this stuff. So, [spouse's] name, date of birth, provider's name, medical title.

154
00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:33.079
P14: Address, 10-digit… NPI, 9-digit tax number, illicit charges, date of service, when she got it.

155
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:37.789
P14: Diagnosis for the care, list of procedure codes…

156
00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:45.599
P14: I guess either of those two, CBT or HCSPCS.

157
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.720
Renata: Okay.

158
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.100
Renata: And…

159
00:17:50.650 --> 00:18:10.480
Renata: At this point, I'm gonna… we're gonna need one of those documents that, was in that email, so two options for you. We can either stop sharing screen, you can go to your email right now, download the documents in the email, and then when you're ready, we'll restart the screen share. I can also provide a link in the Zoom chat.

160
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.490
Renata: … and you could download the documents from that link. What would you prefer to do?

161
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.570
P14: I can stop and download it really fast.

162
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.939
Renata: Okay, there should be two documents in there, ….

163
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:33.990
P14: Yeah, I saw them… … Here we are.

164
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:46.190
Renata: And I think with iPhones, you have to save them, like, to the files on the phone, …

165
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.960
Renata: We've had a couple of folks, like, save it to the cloud, and then they can't upload it.

166
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:04.940
P14: Alright.

167
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.480
P14: Alright, you want to reshare?

168
00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:20.910
Renata: Yes, please, yeah, we'll reshare and go back to that screen that you were on in your browser.

169
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.090
P14: Okay.

170
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:37.889
Renata: I think you'll have to switch back to, whatever tab you have the form in, if it's in a different tab in Safari, or….

171
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.360
Shane Burke: There it is.

172
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:54.719
Renata: All right, so whenever you're ready, please go ahead and upload, the document that was labeled Sample Billing Statement that you just downloaded.

173
00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:55.770
P14: Hell yeah.

174
00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.590
Renata: Yeah, that first one.

175
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.960
Renata: …

176
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:14.600
Renata: Oh, interesting. Okay, I've never seen that error before. If you saw this on VA.gov, you got that error, and you saw that little yellow, like.

177
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.060
Renata: Error notice. What would you do at this point?

178
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.549
P14: Probably continue without verifying.

179
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.780
Renata: Okay.

180
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.099
P14: Yeah, I… Yeah, I don't know, I…

181
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:33.170
P14: I'd try to upload it again, maybe, and then if I did the same thing, I'd just press continue and see if it takes it.

182
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:39.540
Renata: Okay, let's go ahead and try uploading a new file, clicking on that Upload New File button.

183
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:46.029
Renata: And you can also try uploading the other file I gave you, which was called sample EOB, parentheses 1.

184
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.650
Renata: Let's just see if either one of those will work.

185
00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.470
P14: Yeah, that's the EOB.

186
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:03.090
Renata: Yeah, if you click the continue button to continue without verifying, does it let you continue on?

187
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:13.190
P14: Mmm… It does not.

188
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:24.000
Renata: Alright, do you have any random document saved on your phone that you want to try one more time to upload a different file? Because it seems like our files aren't working at the moment.

189
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.540
P14: Yeah, let's do this one.

190
00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:52.140
Renata: All right, that does not seem to be working. So you already mentioned that if you saw that… that yellow box, you would… you would try and re-upload it, then continue on in the form. What does file verification here mean to you?

191
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:58.180
P14: … I guess maybe, like, I…

192
00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:06.029
P14: I would think that it needs a different format, even though it did say, like, PDF file.

193
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.160
Renata: Okay.

194
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.060
P14: So different style.

195
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:08.990
Renata: File format?

196
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.430
P14: Yeah, so maybe I would try to, …

197
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.310
P14: I don't know why this is.

198
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:23.519
P14: Yeah, maybe a different file format, or … Yeah, I don't know.

199
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:43.680
Renata: All right. I apologize, this is… this is just one of the quirks of our testing website that we use. Like I said, we sometimes see errors and stuff that, you know, we're working the kinks out. So, based on your experience uploading supporting files for those claims today, would you prefer that file verification in place, or no file verification?

200
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.650
P14: Probably no file verification.

201
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.659
P14: Just because I feel like it could get tricky, because I just tried… you know.

202
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.129
P14: I guess 4 different ones, and they, you know, didn't take them, so….

203
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:08.930
Renata: Yeah, yeah. And on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to upload a file to support your CHAMPVA claim?

204
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.849
P14: 5. Very easy.

205
00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:20.149
Renata: Okay, got it. So even though there were error messages, and we can't continue in the form, you'd still consider, like, the upload process easy? Just want to double check.

206
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:29.670
P14: Yeah, so the… like, the verification thing, obviously, not easy, one, but the uploading the file was, you know.

207
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.239
P14: Just took me a second, so….

208
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:46.920
Renata: Got it. Okay. So typically, once we get beyond the file upload, we would see that… what you see on a standard VA form, which is you can review your application or your CHAMPVA claim, and then you can sign it and submit it.

209
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:57.619
Renata: So we're just gonna imagine we got to that screen, since it's not letting us move forward. So if you clicked submit on this CHAMPVA claim, what would you expect to happen next?

210
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:08.679
P14: I would expect, like, a confirmation, like a, you know, just saying that everything's submitted is the date and time.

211
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:14.709
P14: Then maybe it's saying that I'll get an email for my records.

212
00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.200
Renata: Okay.

213
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:21.969
P14: … And then… Like, a timeline to expect.

214
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:32.650
Renata: Okay. Would you expect that… that confirmation to be on VA.gov, like, on the website, or would you expect an email, text message? What… what is that looking like?

215
00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:33.730
P14: …

216
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:42.430
P14: I would like an email. But right when I would click submit, I would like it to say, you know, like.

217
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.219
P14: Thanks for submitting your form.

218
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.639
P14: You're gonna get an email.

219
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:52.130
P14: And… You know, please wait 2-3 weeks.

220
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:58.140
P14: … To hear back, or, you know, whatever the case may be.

221
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:08.979
Renata: Okay, so that leads into my next question, actually, which is how long would you expect to wait before you receive a decision on the claim? Like, it's been processed, and they've decided if it's approved or denied?

222
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:16.240
P14: I'd probably expect to wait, like… 6 to 8 weeks.

223
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.760
Renata: Okay, 6 to 8 weeks. Now, is that, like…

224
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:27.559
Renata: the longest you'd be willing to wait? Like, what's… what's ideal for you? Is 6 to 8 weeks ideal, or would you want to hear sooner, you know?

225
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.829
P14: I'd, like, I'd want a response as soon as possible, but …

226
00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:37.179
P14: like, 3 to 4 weeks would be a good, realistic spot, I think.

227
00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:45.909
Renata: Okay, and if you could check the status of this claim before a decision was made, where would you expect to find that?

228
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.570
P14: …

229
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:55.280
P14: See, that'd be nice to be in, like, the email, like, click on this link to check the status.

230
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.660
Renata: ….

231
00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:05.680
P14: that would be the best, but right now, if I, you know, if that wasn't the case, VA.gov, then I would go to, like, claims.

232
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.279
P14: And, you know, hopefully it pops up there.

233
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:20.529
Renata: Okay, got it. And when you say claims, is that, like, your claims as the… as the veteran, like, looking at your claims, or would there be a separate spot for your wife's claims on CHAMPVA?

234
00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.090
P14: She has her own login, ….

235
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.750
Renata: Okay.

236
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:28.539
P14: So, I think she could check her. Hers don't pop up on mine, so….

237
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.299
Renata: Okay. … Got it.

238
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:48.740
Renata: So, one more question for you here. I know that we didn't get to all the way to the review page, we got stuck, like, one page before, but on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to complete the CHAMP VA claim form?

239
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:56.090
P14: I think it was a 5. I mean, it was pretty self-explanatory for the most part, and…

240
00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:07.339
P14: You know, not… to, … Yeah, not too complicated or anything, I mean, it's pretty straightforward, so…

241
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:12.189
P14: I thought it was pretty easy. All the buttons, you know, upload new file.

242
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.800
P14: Continue. I mean, I mean, everything's pretty simple, so….

243
00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:16.950
Renata: Okay.

244
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:30.539
Renata: Got it. And if, if, you know, you'd been on VA.gov today doing this for a CHAMPVA claim, and you hadn't been able to fix the issue with the file verification, that error you're seeing, what would you do at this point if you couldn't submit? Would, you know….

245
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:35.500
P14: Oh my goodness, I'd probably… Try to call, and then…

246
00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.579
P14: Get thrown around to, like, 20 different people, and then…

247
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.189
P14: Probably give up and try tomorrow.

248
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.500
Renata: Okay.

249
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:49.040
P14: Yeah, I usually get frustrated when… because I'll call, and then…

250
00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:53.899
P14: you know, I'm… it just doesn't take you to the right people.

251
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:58.979
P14: … Hey, if I called this one…

252
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:10.080
P14: you know, I don't know. I feel like sometimes just the people are like, oh, you know, let me transfer you, then I get disconnected, and then… I don't know.

253
00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:11.410
Renata: Yeah.

254
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.660
P14: But I also understand that there's…

255
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.499
P14: Millions of people probably filling out the form, too, so…

256
00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:31.469
P14: Alright, thank you for sharing that. So, I'm gonna imagine we were able to successfully submit this claim. It's been 3 to 4 weeks, maybe, and I'm gonna drop a link in the chat, and I'd like you to open that in your browser.

257
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.080
P14: Okay.

258
00:28:45.120 --> 00:29:07.860
Renata: And if you could click on the top right PDF that says Example PD… Example Champ VA letter. Yep, perfect, alright. So you can pinch and zoom in on this if you'd like, but I'd like to imagine that it's been about 3, maybe 4 weeks, and you've received this letter in the mail from Champ VA about the claim that you just submitted. Please review the letter and let me know when you're done reading it, and I have some questions for you.

259
00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:09.050
P14: Okay.

260
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.170
P14: Alright, I got it.

261
00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:24.859
Renata: Okay. In your own words, what's the purpose of the letter that you just received from Champ VA?

262
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.610
P14: It's just letting you know that, …

263
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:32.019
P14: Like, your claim was missing the diagnosis code.

264
00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:39.470
Renata: Okay. And what are the steps that you would need to take in order to resolve the issue with your CHAMPVA claim?

265
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.140
P14: …

266
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:49.259
P14: So you gotta resubmit it, including the paperwork.

267
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.779
P14: The requested information below, and a copy of this letter.

268
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.609
P14: It looks like you gotta mail it in.

269
00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:08.709
Renata: Okay. If there was an option to submit… resubmit the form online instead of mailing it in, would you prefer to resubmit online or to do the snail mail option?

270
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.820
P14: 100%, I'd prefer to, submit it online.

271
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:23.670
Renata: Alright, and if we could redesign this letter today to make it clear that there is a submission option online, what would you want to see on this letter that lets you know, like, yeah, I can do this on VA.gov?

272
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:29.320
P14: … You may resubmit the enclosed claims.

273
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:39.449
P14: So, after that, … Please send your submission to that address, or… go to VA.gov.

274
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:45.589
P14: … And then, you know, claims, and submit it there.

275
00:30:46.650 --> 00:31:00.739
Renata: Okay, gotcha. I've got a couple more questions for you about this letter. On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being poorly, 5 being very well, how well does this letter explain what you need to do in order to resolve the problem with the CHAM VA claim you submitted?

276
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:09.010
P14: I think it's a 5. I mean, it's… You know, it… It's pretty, …

277
00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.120
P14: reasonable. I mean, it… it tells you what…

278
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:19.319
P14: The issue is, and how to fix it, and… you know, I feel like…

279
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.080
P14: It's not too complicated or anything.

280
00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:33.290
Renata: Okay. Second question, same 1 to 5 scale, 1 being poorly, 5 being very well. How prepared do you feel to resolve this claim based on the letter's content?

281
00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:41.100
P14: I feel… So let's, … a 5, I mean…

282
00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.969
P14: the missing diagnosis code, I feel like…

283
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:53.250
P14: We'd have that, or we'd be able to get a form with it on it, from wherever we got the…

284
00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.000
P14: … You know, urgent care, wherever we went.

285
00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:06.209
Renata: Okay, got it. So I'm dropping one last link in the Zoom chat for you to open in your browser. Sorry about all of the links.

286
00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.339
P14: No worries.

287
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:08.350
P14: Oop.

288
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:19.909
Renata: Alright, so this is the same form that we used before, but looking at this page again, do you think you're in the right place to resubmit the claim you just got a letter for?

289
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.550
P14: No.

290
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:30.869
Renata: Alright, what would you need to see here, to let you know that you're in the right place, to resubmit the claim?

291
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:37.429
P14: Yeah, because I would think that I'm filing a new claim, and then…

292
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:45.679
P14: I feel like that's a little friction point, because it's like, do I wanna… File a completely new claim.

293
00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:51.460
P14: Or… Do I want to just fix the claim I already filed?

294
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:59.269
Renata: Oh, good question, okay. What would help you decide between submitting a brand new claim and resubmitting a claim?

295
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:05.420
P14: Maybe if… you know, if I could just…

296
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:15.629
P14: Maybe if it had a spot on here that said, to… Continue with a…

297
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.200
P14: Previous claim, or something of that nature.

298
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.550
P14: Click here, and it just brings you to your claims.

299
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.970
Renata: Okay. You know, ….

300
00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:28.149
P14: I don't know if I'm… Describing that correctly, but….

301
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:49.539
Renata: I think I understand, so let me… let me repeat back to you, and we'll see if we have the same idea in mind. If I click on that link, it takes me to, like, a list of all of the claims I've submitted, and I can just open up the one that the letter got sent for, and I'd be able to just drop in the information that was missing, or whatever.

302
00:33:49.540 --> 00:34:01.660
P14: Exactly, yeah, or like… a spot that says… Like, re… yeah, like, resubmit… a previous claim. ….

303
00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.250
Renata: I hope.

304
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.869
P14: Yeah, because like I said, it's like…

305
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:09.300
P14: This one, I'd feel like I'm doing a whole new claim.

306
00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:16.150
P14: And… you know, I don't know if I wanna do that.

307
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:27.360
Renata: Yeah, I gotcha. So, thinking back to the letter you received, what information do you think you're going to need, to resubmit a claim online?

308
00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:31.159
P14: I'll just need that code.

309
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.360
P14: I believe it was, like, the DX code, …

310
00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.659
P14: I'll just need that code, and…

311
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:44.210
P14: everything else that I used previously, so I'd submit all that, and then I'd add in

312
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:51.139
P14: You know, something with that code on it, so whether that's a file or… a letter, or…

313
00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:53.179
P14: You know, whatever.

314
00:34:53.389 --> 00:35:00.869
Renata: Got it. So I'm gonna have you go down to the bottom of that blue box and click that link again to start your form without signing in.

315
00:35:01.249 --> 00:35:02.469
Renata: Oh.

316
00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:04.669
Renata: Yeah, the one below it.

317
00:35:04.939 --> 00:35:21.229
Renata: So at this point, I'm gonna have you start filling out this form as though you're resubmitting the claim that you got that letter for, and as a reminder, again, you can use fake information. I'll stop you when we're at a point to ask you some questions, and just think out loud as you're going.

318
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.220
P14: Okay.

319
00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:29.760
P14: I'm a veteran, submitting it for my spouse. Does the… Yes.

320
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:37.490
P14: Resubmission for… okay, here we go. So this would be, you know, this is good.

321
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:38.360
Renata: Okay.

322
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.630
P14: So, it's a resubmission for existing.

323
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:49.030
Renata: Got it. And I'm gonna pause you here. What information is being asked for on this page?

324
00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.120
P14: They're…

325
00:35:55.340 --> 00:36:04.490
P14: PDI, or control number, … Just to find, like, their original claim.

326
00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:10.099
Renata: Okay. And do you know where to find that PDI or control number?

327
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:17.710
P14: I would go… Probably to, like, my confirmation email, and hopefully that was… that'd be on it.

328
00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:20.909
P14: But I don't… I don't know.

329
00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.960
Renata: Greater ladies.

330
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:29.329
Renata: Go ahead and just pick one of those at random, and you can input a random number. There's, …

331
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.629
Renata: Nothing where… it's not gonna kick you out.

332
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:33.640
P14: Okay.

333
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.260
P14: Original Medical.

334
00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:04.380
P14: Beginning day of service.

335
00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:28.790
Renata: All right, so just take a look at this page, and then, let me know when you're ready. I'm going to ask you some more questions.

336
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.250
P14: Alright, I'm ready.

337
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:35.099
Renata: Okay, so what, are you being asked to upload on this page?

338
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:43.820
P14: Basically, that… that code, … That… was asked in the…

339
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.980
P14: document that, you know, I guess we got mailed.

340
00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:52.169
P14: It then… All of the original documents, so…

341
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.689
P14: Just everything, but also adding that code.

342
00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:05.659
Renata: Okay, got it. So you can upload one of the documents I already gave you on this page, and let's see if we, if it goes through this time.

343
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:24.969
Renata: Oh, it looks like it did. If you needed to upload another file, because like you said, you have to upload multiple things, how would you do that?

344
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:27.810
P14: Upload another file.

345
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:31.330
Renata: All right. You don't have to click it today if you don't want

346
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:44.010
Renata: cancel out. So, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to find and provide that information related to your previous CHAMPVA claim?

347
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.630
P14: 5.

348
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:54.579
Renata: 5, okay. And any change in… in thoughts about that file verification, now that we're not seeing that error message this time?

349
00:38:54.580 --> 00:39:02.760
P14: … Yeah, I mean, I made it pretty… self-explanatory, you know, I mean…

350
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:07.659
P14: Pretty easy, just like the last one.

351
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:11.660
Renata: Gotcha. You can go ahead and click continue at this point.

352
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:18.269
Renata: And why do you think you're being asked for your name and information at this point?

353
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:26.070
P14: Because… I am the veteran that, like, I guess it allows…

354
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.510
P14: My spouse to get those benefits, so they want to, like, confirm.

355
00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.550
Renata: Okay, you can go ahead and fill this section out.

356
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:49.079
Renata: No issues with filling this information out here.

357
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:51.410
P14: No.

358
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:52.130
Renata: Okay.

359
00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:56.880
P14: Yeah, everything's pretty… Or his contact info.

360
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:18.319
Renata: Alright, so like I said, we're not going to submit this, so this will be the last screen we look at, but just review the resubmitted claim you just completed, and then I'm going to ask you some questions.

361
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.480
P14: Alright.

362
00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.550
P14: Alrighty.

363
00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:50.459
Renata: Okay, so would you do anything differently on this page, knowing that this is a resubmission and not an initial claim?

364
00:41:52.050 --> 00:42:01.359
P14: … No, I, you know, since I got that letter just requesting that,

365
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:07.709
P14: code, I would just make sure that that was included, but I would try to keep everything

366
00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.039
P14: You know, the same.

367
00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:11.160
Renata: Okay.

368
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:17.499
Renata: So if you submitted this resubmission of the claim, today, what would you expect to happen next?

369
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:25.020
P14: Probably just like, thank you for your submission, … You'll receive an email.

370
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.060
P14: Confirmation shortly.

371
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:35.809
P14: And then, that email… you know, I'd hoped that it had, like, again, like, a timeline, And then…

372
00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:41.410
P14: you know, just, like, confirmation that I've done everything that I need to do.

373
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:49.280
Renata: Okay. And would you expect any difference in the processing or response time with a resubmission versus an initial claim?

374
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:57.430
P14: I would hope so, … But… I wouldn't really expect it.

375
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:04.159
Renata: Okay. If it was different, would it be faster, slower? What are… what are you thinking?

376
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.940
P14: … faster, hopefully.

377
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.580
Renata: Okay, and what would be the ideal time frame for you for that resubmission?

378
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:16.889
P14: Maybe, like… 2 weeks?

379
00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.969
P14: would be realistic, I think.

380
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:29.819
Renata: Okay, got it. So on a one… on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to complete the resubmission form?

381
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:39.200
P14: I'd say 4, and that's just because… like…

382
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:48.140
P14: I don't know if I would have started it, because it says, like, file a CHAMP VA claim, and it doesn't say, or…

383
00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:56.620
P14: a resubmission. It doesn't say that until you click start, and then it has the option to go, you know, like, resubmission.

384
00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:07.469
Renata: Got it. So if this was a… if it let you know, like, confidently this is the place to resubmit a claim on that… that first page you saw, it would take it from a 4 to a 5?

385
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:08.700
P14: Definitely, yeah.

386
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:16.199
Renata: Okay, got it. And how would you compare the first claim you submitted today versus the second claim that you… the resubmission claim?

387
00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:23.469
P14: Well, if the codes weren't, you know, if it wasn't, like, flagging those uploads.

388
00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:26.630
P14: I think they both were…

389
00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:31.079
P14: we're pretty good comparing them, I mean, both FAs, you know.

390
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:38.430
Renata: Okay, gotcha. So, we are done with this portion of the session, so you can stop sharing your screen, …

391
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.569
Renata: And we'll close out, the session.

392
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.870
P14: Okay, stop sharing.

393
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:51.700
Renata: Alright, so overall, was there anything that you saw in the session today that worked well for you?

394
00:44:53.190 --> 00:45:01.850
P14: … There we go. Yeah, I mean, I think everything was pretty efficient,

395
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.839
P14: Yeah, so I think it all worked well. I mean…

396
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:08.719
P14: I'm sure we'll have the file, you know.

397
00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:13.510
P14: That same form, you know, like, in the future, so…

398
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:16.769
P14: I'm confident that it will be a pretty smooth process.

399
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:22.339
Renata: Okay. Was there anything that you saw today that was unclear or that did not work well for you?

400
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:26.819
P14: Just that initial, … on the…

401
00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:35.609
P14: to resubmit the claim, just that little part that we talked about where, it would be nice to say, file a…

402
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:40.029
P14: New claim, or resubmit an existing claim.

403
00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.740
Renata: Okay, yeah, make it a little clearer there. Yeah.

404
00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:50.019
Renata: What are your thoughts about the amount of information in the form? Not enough, too much? Just right?

405
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.540
P14: I feel like it's just right. I mean, that's pretty, standard for most…

406
00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.949
P14: VA forms, you know, I get it, they want to make sure that

407
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:03.239
P14: You know, everything's squared away, you know, that…

408
00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:07.379
P14: So they need a good bit of information, …

409
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.119
P14: But yeah, I don't think it was too much or anything.

410
00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:11.680
P14: Crazy.

411
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:15.700
Renata: Okay. Any questions for me before we wrap up?

412
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:18.220
P14: Nope, I don't think so.

413
00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:26.039
Renata: Alright, so I just wanted to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a clip of the session with our VA partners.

414
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.050
P14: Of course.

415
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:31.719
Renata: Alright, is there any part of our discussion today you would not want shared in a video clip?

416
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.920
P14: No.

417
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:45.099
Renata: All right. Well, P14, we really appreciate… appreciate you taking time out of your day to share your thoughts with us. This feedback is super helpful as we continue to work on the site, make sure it really works for veterans and their families, so thank you.

418
