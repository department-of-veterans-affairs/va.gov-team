219
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:10.700

225
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.150

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.989

229
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.430

234
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:14.680
Renata: And what would the content need to… how would the content need to change for it to go from, like, sort of prepared to feeling, like.

235
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.959
P15: I'm not really prepared.

236
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.750
Renata: Alright

237
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.230
P15: And maybe it would be me rereading it, but….

238
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.410
P15: Items you will need, or something like more…

239
00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:31.310
P15: You know, it did say invoice, like, it did say that, but like… maybe

240
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:37.770
P15: you know, this is good for, I don't know, medical… lab result… lab…

241
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:45.620
P15: test, or like, you know what I mean? Like, is it for, like, an entire stay? Is it, like… so that's why I was like, I don't know…

242
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.590
P15: … Based on what I read.

243
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:57.569
P15: I don't know if this form is, like, for… but then again, I haven't looked at the form. Is it, like…

244
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:06.169
P15: for the entire time, like, if I'm an inpatient, let's say, is it the whole stay, and it includes…

245
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.760
P15: …

246
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:16.540
P15: the labs, or is that separate, or like, you know what I mean? Like, it can be very broken down, I guess.

247
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:31.100
Renata: Okay, so just to re… just to, repeat, to maybe just confirm my understanding, so maybe a little bit more detail on what's covered, so you're not, like, filing a claim for an uncovered,

248
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.239
P15: And then I wasted my time, yeah.

249
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:45.780
Renata: Okay, and I heard you also mention something about, like, additional information about what's going to be needed. So, like, more detail about the specific bills? Like, what were you thinking there?

250
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.779
P15: Yeah, like, … I guess, you know, like, for, like.

251
00:21:52.340 --> 00:22:00.220
P15: does this cover an ER visit, right? Well, ER usually has your bill, and then you get other bills afterwards.

252
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.710
P15: You know, like, so…

253
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:09.819
P15: would this be part of the same thing, or do you file separate things? So, like, I don't know, based off what I just read.

254
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:29.100
Renata: Oh, okay, I gotcha. So, like, if you had an ER visit, and you ended up getting multiple bills for the same visit, like, do I file each of those separately, or do I file them once, like, I get all of them? Okay, got it. Thank you for clarifying it, that's really helpful. So there is a link on this page that says, start your form without signing in.

410
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:32.240
Renata: All right, so I want to stop us here before we continue. That, that area that you just focused on, it said we could not complete verification for this file, you can retry verification, or you can continue without verifying. In your own words, what do you think this error message means?

411
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:38.819
P15: I have zero idea. Like, I have no clue what is meaning.

412
00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:42.219
P15: Maybe is it looking for the…

413
00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.069
P15: things it wants in it? I don't know.

414
00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:45.870
P15: I really don't.

415
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.020
Renata: So, things at once in that, meaning, like, from that huge list.

416
00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:58.079
P15: that was read off at the top of the page. Do you think it's verifying that information? Is that what you're referring to?

417
00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.610
P15: That's what I'm thinking.

418
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:01.090
Renata: Okay. From that.

419
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:10.690
Renata: So, if you were filing a claim for real today, and you saw an error message like this, what would you need to do in order to resolve it?

420
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:20.040
P15: Well… huh… I… would want…

421
00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:30.110
P15: I would want to know what I need for it to verify. I mean, it just… it's very… I don't understand.

422
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:36.389
Renata: Okay. If… if this message was telling you, like, we're missing the provider's name, for example.

423
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.710
P15: Yeah.

424
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.679
P15: Something like that, yes.

425
00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:45.310
Renata: Okay, so you'd like to see a little bit more specificity in this message about what's missing, or… okay, got it.

426
00:41:45.310 --> 00:42:00.470
Renata: So I want to note that in this error message, it says you can continue without verifying, meaning you could continue and submit the claim. Would you prefer to submit without verifying, or would you prefer to pause at this point and fix the attachment?

427
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:08.569
P15: I would fix the attachment if that's the case, because you're gonna get denied. You could possibly get denied.

428
00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:16.209
Renata: Alright, so because this is our test site, I'm gonna have you hit the continue button, and just bypass this error message.

463
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.860
Renata: Why?

464
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:51.149
P15: Yeah, because it's… if it's… if the verifying is looking for those things.

Renata: Okay.

468
00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:11.679
Renata: One more question for you on this page. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to upload files to support your claim?

469
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.869
P15: It was… It's pretty easy.

470
00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:22.129
Renata: Okay, and on that 1 to 5 scale, is that, like, a 4, meaning easy, 5, very easy?

471
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:32.860
P15: You know, I would say a 4, because it's not even the way you guys… it's just sometimes finding the stuff within your own computer

472
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:43.059
P15: Can be a little confusing, so it's… it's more like that's the issue, not… Not your guys' process.

473
00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:47.639
Renata: Okay, I get it, it's a whole thing to find and save documents.

474
00:46:48.290 --> 00:47:00.269
P15: Yeah, because it's like, oh my god, okay, I have to open the right one, and then I have… so I have to play around with it, so it is easy once you've got the, okay, the flow of where I need to be.

475
00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:04.779
P15: But that's why I'm not saying it's very easy, but I'm saying that…

476
00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:08.020
P15: Once you got it, it's good. It's very easy.

495
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:43.009
P15: Statement of Truth. I confirm that the identifying information in this form is accurate and has been represented correctly.

496
00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:48.920
P15: I have read and etc. Link privacy policy of your full name left. Your full name left, parent star required, my tarot is required.

497
00:49:49.980 --> 00:50:01.840
Renata: Alright, we can stop here, you don't have to put your name in. So, like I said, we're not going to be submitting this form, but if you did submit this claim today, what would you expect to happen next?

498
00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:17.270
P15: … to get a okay… Congratulations, we… you successfully filed the claim, … whatever the next process is, maybe…

499
00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:23.079
P15: you'll receive a letter, or you'll receive something, I don't know. Something about…

500
00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:26.030
P15: The succession of me submitting the claim.

501
00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:38.449
Renata: Got it. So, actually, that leads into my next question. How would you expect to be notified about a decision on your claim? By mail, by email, text message, some forth?

502
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:41.120
P15: I would think it's by mail.

503
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:43.309
P15: Oh, fortunately, but….

504
00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:50.939
Renata: … Yeah, what would you prefer if you could… if you could make a choice here?

505
00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:56.890
P15: … I would prefer… Electronically?

506
00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:58.160
Renata: Okay.

507
00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.350
P15: Follow email would be better.

508
00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:01.500
Renata: Alright.

509
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.169
P15: And maybe even a text.

510
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:04.720
Renata: Okay.

511
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:11.449
Renata: And, … How soon would you expect to be notified about your claim after you file it?

512
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.829
P15: Oh my god, at least… I don't know.

513
00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.140
P15: Probably a month or more.

514
00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:23.619
Renata: A month or more. And in an ideal world, would that timeline be the same, or would it be different?

515
00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:36.870
P15: Honestly, I would think it's more, but… In an ideal, world, … Mmm…

516
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:45.850
P15: It would be nice within the 30 days, because what if I used a credit card? It'd be nice to get the money so you could pay back.

517
00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:59.109
Renata: Okay, got it. And if you could check on the status of this claim before you got that letter or email letting you know the decision, where would you expect to find that claim status?

518
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.700
P15: I have no idea.

519
00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:01.510
Renata: Nice.

520
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.969
P15: Thank you.

521
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:02.630
Renata: Okay.

522
00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:13.290
P15: No, I don't… I wouldn't know. But, I mean, I would hope… It would be under… like…

523
00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:19.559
P15: Benefits when you, like, in the app, where it says claims, you know, pending claims or something.

524
00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:22.300
P15: That would be nice to have it there.

525
00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:27.539
P15: But I don't know if this is… this is, like, VHA, I think, so…

526
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:29.710
P15: I don't think it would be there.

527
00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:42.009
Renata: Got it. If VHA had a similar thing to the benefits claim status, you know, would you want to see that online in a similar place, like in the app or something?

528
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:42.940
P15: Yep. 

529
00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:53.920
Renata: Okay. Got it. So just a couple more questions for you. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to complete this CHAMPVA claim form?

530
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.280
P15: It's really easy.

531
00:52:55.700 --> 00:53:01.989
Renata: Really easy, okay. And on that 1 to 5 scale, you'd give it that 5, meaning very easy, then? [P15: Yeah.] Okay.

532
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.009
Renata: Anything in particular that made it very easy?

533
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:11.589
P15: the flow, the way it flowed, I like the…

534
00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:19.139
P15: asking a question, then continue. Asking the question, then continue, versus having a whole bunch of things

535
00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:29.270
P15: and then continue, and oh my god, I missed something, or… you know what I mean? Obviously, I missed the one about yes, because it seemed like it was just asking me

536
00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:37.680
P15: the… You know, the spouse's address, but it was asking me, has it changed?

537
00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:43.580
P15: So… there, I obviously missed it, but it was good because it also tells you

538
00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:48.779
P15: This is required, and it takes you right to what I missed.

539
00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:50.240
Renata: Got it.

540
00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:56.080
P15: That makes it simpler by it being one action versus three actions, you know?

541
00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:04.140
Renata: Yeah, I hear ya. So, overall, was there anything in the session today in this form that worked really well for you?

542
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:13.010
P15: … Yeah, I mean, the whole… I thought it was really well… well developed, like…

543
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:18.450
P15: I thought the whole form was pretty simple to understand on…

544
00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:22.959
P15: On, … once you're in it, once you're in it, you know?

545
00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:28.700
Renata: Gotcha. Was there anything that was unclear or that didn't work well for you?

546
00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:32.769
P15: So, the verify, obviously, I didn't know what that… what that meant.

547
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:37.969
Renata: Okay, but if… if the… we made those changes, like you mentioned…

548
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:49.669
Renata: would that… would… you mentioned you would want the file verification. If we made the changes that you mentioned before, would that make it a better experience for you? [P15 nods]

549
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:57.809
Renata: Alright. What are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in this form? Not enough, too much? Just right?

550
00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.310
P15: Mmm… I felt it was just right.

551
00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:02.250
Renata: Okay.

552
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:05.579
Renata: And any questions for me before we close out?

553
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:07.440
P15: Mmm, no.

554
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:14.949
Renata: All right. I just want to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.

555
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.409
P15: No, that's fine.

556
00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:32.870
Renata: All right, and just to remind you, we will remove any, information that could be used to identify you, and these videos will only be shared internally with VA partners for the purposes of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences. Is there any part of the discussion today you would not want shared in a video clip?

557
00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:35.369
P15: No, there wasn't anything.

558
00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:42.590
Renata: Alright, well, P15, thank you so much. We really appreciate you hanging in there as we got through all the technical issues today.

559
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:43.569
P15: Sorry, yeah.I forgot I didn't have [Zoom] on this laptop.

560
00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:48.780
Renata: Oh, no, it is… 

561
00:55:49.120 --> 00:56:11.169
Renata: You are totally fine. But again, I just want to say thank you, because your feedback is super helpful for us as we continue to work on the site to make sure it really works for veterans, so thanks. Lastly, Paragene's going to be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb in it you can pass along to other veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies like this one. And with that, P15.

562
00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:14.149
Renata: Thank you so much, have a really great rest of your day. Have a good weekend, too!

563
00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:15.730
P15: You too, thank you.

564
00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:17.829
Renata: Alright, thank you, yeah, take care.

565
00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:19.000
P15: Bye.
