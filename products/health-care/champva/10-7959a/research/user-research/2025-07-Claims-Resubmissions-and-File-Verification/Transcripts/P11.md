00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:14.810
Jamie: Alright, well, it looks like we're all set. If you do see there's a bar at the top saying this meeting is being recorded, you could go ahead and click OK, and yeah, just get rid of that. Sometimes it gets in the way.

2
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.689
Jamie: Okay, so for those two questions, that I do have to ask you, …

3
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.360
Jamie: So, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

4
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.880
P11: Yes, I am.

5
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:37.520
Jamie: Great! And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with the VA partners if we remove any information that could be used to identify you?

6
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.650
P11: Yes.

7
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.890
Jamie: Okay, great!

8
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:52.570
Jamie: So, before I send over the link and get you on the prototype, just a couple questions. Are you or anyone else in your household currently enrolled in CHAMP VA?

9
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.939
P11: Yes, I am.

10
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.769
Jamie: Great! How, recently did you, apply for CHAMPVA?

11
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.200
P11: … 3 years?

12
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.460
Jamie: 3 years? Okay. Do you remember what your experience is like with applying?

13
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.129
P11: It was actually pretty simple, …

14
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.800
P11: from what I recall, it wasn't, you know, just a regular fill the forms out type thing, and …

15
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.090
P11: Wasn't… wasn't no major, … or didn't… wasn't like a tax war.

16
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.329
P11: It's actually quite simple.

17
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.130
Jamie: Okay, great. Have you submitted any, medical or pharmacy claims to Champ VA?

18
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.420
P11: Yes, I have.

19
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.479
Jamie: Oh, great. What was your experience like with that?

20
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:46.819
P11: … I guess it's more of a typical government form, there's plenty of information to fill in.

21
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.070
P11: But, on, I do it on the computer, so it's, pretty simple.

22
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.110
Jamie: Okay.

23
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.869
Jamie: Is that on the online form, or were you filling out a PDF on the computer?

24
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.869
P11: Both of them.

25
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.420
Jamie: Oh, great, great.

26
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.509
P11: I've got one of my, doctors, they've…

27
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:23.360
P11: don't understand there's a difference between CHAMPVA and the VA itself, and so they want to send all my stuff to the VA, and so I get back from the VA saying, this is not covered, you're not…

28
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:35.579
P11: And so I gotta go back and re… resubmit it. So if I take a PDF form, fill it out, take it with to the doctor, give it actually to them, it seems to work better.

29
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.210
Jamie: Oh, okay.

30
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.529
P11: Than them shutting it off.

31
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.549
Jamie: Okay, so you hand them the actual claim form?

32
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.680
Jamie: version of it? Yeah. Okay.

33
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.990
Jamie: Do you recall if you received any mail from Champ VA about your claim before it was processed?

34
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.380
P11: …

35
00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:07.079
P11: The only one that I know that I get is not from CHAMP VA, again, actually, I get it from the actual VA, telling me that the claim was denied, but that's because it was sent to them, and not to the, Champ VA.

36
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.960
Jamie: Oh, okay, alright, that makes sense. Yeah.

37
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.980
Jamie: So awesome, thank you for answering that. I am gonna go ahead… let me get my link going here and drop the link to the prototype.

38
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.929
Jamie: In the Zoom chat.

39
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.780
Jamie: If I could find my Zoom chat, I always have a problem with that.

40
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.649
Jamie: Hold on.

41
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.449
Jamie: There it is.

42
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.340
Jamie: Alright.

43
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.739
Jamie: Okay, it should have sent, …

44
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.209
Jamie: And let me know if you need help opening up that chat and seeing it, or if it popped up right away. Sometimes it does.

45
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.989
P11: Nothing popping up yet.

46
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.809
Jamie: Nothing popping up yet.

47
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:06.569
Jamie: … Let's see, I got it on my end. Do you have the chat open?

48
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.029
Jamie: This should be on the right side.

49
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.210
Jamie: If it is open.

50
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.360
P11: There we go. Okay, ….

51
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:30.950
Jamie: Awesome, yeah, if, before you click on a link, just wanna… well, actually, you can click on the link, but, just make sure before I… we go ahead and do the screen share that you close anything that you don't want us to see, or any notifications.

52
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.985
P11: Oh.

53
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.049
Jamie: So let me know when you're ready, and when you.

54
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.820
P11: I'm ready.

55
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:51.110
Jamie: You got the form pulled up? Awesome. Would you mind sharing your screen? It should be… there should be a button on the bottom with a green arrow that says share.

56
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.840
P11: Caption, record, share.

57
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.060
Jamie: Yep.

58
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.010
P11: Photo file doc… photos at… or screen, right?

59
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.379
Jamie: The screen.

60
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.959
P11: Okay, start somewhere.

61
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.719
P11: Entire screen start.

62
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.770
P11: Okay, I got a green border, so you're seeing everything?

63
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.439
Jamie: I'm seeing me, so I'm seeing the Zoom, but if you can navigate over to where that form is…

64
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.559
Jamie: on your mobile. I guess you gotta switch, …

65
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.219
Jamie: which applications… Should be if you navigate back to the browser.

66
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.220
Jamie: on your phone.

67
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.020
P11: There we go, how about that?

68
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.659
Jamie: Yeah, I could see your screen. I'm not seeing the form, though.

69
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.440
P11: Okay, what are the… Alright.

70
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.349
P11: Whatever the fault.

71
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.870
P11: a minute ago, there's a way to send a link back, or mute to start?

72
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:08.309
Jamie: Yeah, if you could, … it should be in the chat on the bottom, so if you scroll to the left, the little icons on the bottom, there should be a chat one.

73
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.150
Jamie: And that will have the link in it.

74
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.500
P11: Oh, there we go, okay.

75
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.900
Jamie: Awesome, fantastic. Oh, oh no! Hold on.

76
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.960
Jamie: What's going on with that?

77
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.279
Jamie: Link. That's not right.

78
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.550
Jamie: Let me just double check on my side.

79
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.740
Jamie: What is going on here?

80
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.920
Jamie: Sorry, just give me a few minutes.

81
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.520
P11: Oh.

82
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:43.830
Jamie: Oh, no.

83
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:52.139
Jamie: It looks like staging, the server that we have are… Formon is down.

84
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.539
Jamie: Alright, just give me one second, let's see if we could do a workaround here.

85
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.270
Jamie: Sometimes this happens. Like I said, it is a demo.

86
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.460
Jamie: We're trying to work on the problem.

87
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:44.380
Jamie: Okay, it looks like that link is… Pretty much dead.

88
00:08:50.630 --> 00:09:04.240
Jamie: Okay, so we're gonna change things up a bit here, and just kind of improvise, being that Link's dead. We don't want to, you know, waste this session, so we do have some backups that we can try.

89
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:11.569
Jamie: So, instead of you sharing your screen, I'm going to share my screen, with you.

90
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:24.069
Jamie: And just show you a couple of our… it's actually our design files, so you can actually see the, … what's… what should have been on the screen. Just give me a moment to pull that up here.

91
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.129
Jamie: So… So hold on, I apologize.

92
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.040
Jamie: See if you get the correct file up.

93
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:59.180
Jamie: Might have to flip back and forth between some screens here to get the right… Files going.

94
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:42.830
Jamie: Okay, let's see if we can do this. If not, you know, we'll… we'll try our best. So I'm gonna… Okay.

95
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:54.770
Jamie: I'm gonna take the screen from you. You could actually, on the bottom, there's a red X that says stop sharing, if you could click on that.

96
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.639
Jamie: There you go. Oh, awesome.

97
00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.170
Jamie: And, …

98
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.260
Jamie: Trying to figure out what's the best way to share here, being I might have to…

99
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.600
Jamie: Go back and forth a few times.

100
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.990
Jamie: Nope.

101
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.589
Jamie: That is not it.

102
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.960
Jamie: I guess my Zoom is being nutty right now.

103
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:36.690
Jamie: I think that is it. Can you see a screen that says File CHAMPVA Claim?

104
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.559
P11: … well, yes, I can.

105
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:41.750
Jamie: Awesome.

106
00:11:42.780 --> 00:12:02.760
Jamie: So let me just get my bearings a little bit here, now that we had to switch things up. So I'll apologize. We'll, like I said, we'll get through this, but, I want you to take a look at the… the information on this one screen here, and I'm gonna see if I try to blow it up a little bit more.

107
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.310
Jamie: …

108
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:13.290
Jamie: And take your time reading through it, and just let me know in your own words what you think this page is telling you.

109
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:20.669
P11: So, let me know if you need to… if you need me to scroll up, scroll down at any point. You can scroll up for a moment.

110
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.460
Jamie: Sure.

111
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.230
P11: Okay, reflecting.

112
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.140
P11: Okay, I can go ahead and scroll down.

113
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:51.639
P11: Excuse me, okay, scroll further.

114
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:52.810
Jamie: Okay.

115
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.960
P11: Need to…

116
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:06.280
P11: Actually, I think I remember something like this when I did, where you had to read all this information and get the information of what you need.

117
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:13.719
P11: And, so it's actually quite, quite simple, and to the point, and very easy to understand.

118
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.309
Jamie: Okay, great, …

119
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:24.670
Jamie: So, based on this page, would you know what type of information you need, in order to fill out this form?

120
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.669
P11: As far as all the documents and stuff, yes.

121
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.390
Jamie: Okay.

122
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.919
Jamie: And what would those documents be?

123
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:33.770
P11: …

124
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:46.830
P11: It says, it says here, the billing statements. Now, what I was surprised, and I don't remember this part, I've got a year to supply the, to put the claim in.

125
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:54.450
P11: For some reason, I thought it was a lot shorter period, because up here it says you have to file within a year of the care.

126
00:13:54.630 --> 00:14:09.139
P11: And I, for some reason, always thought that I had, like, a month or something like that to, to submit the information. So this… I don't know if that changed or not, but that's good to know that I've got more than, 60 days.

127
00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:15.250
Jamie: Okay, well that's great, and great that you're able to see it on here nice and clear.

128
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.149
Jamie: Yeah, it is… yeah. Sorry, what was that?

129
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.160
P11: …

130
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:35.689
P11: And that's the information I… this much I do remember is that everything's got to be on its own form, so if you're saying multiple doctors in a day, you've got to have, …

131
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.610
P11: A form for each and every incident.

132
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.790
Jamie: Okay, so…

133
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.089
Jamie: Hold on, we might…

134
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:57.919
Jamie: Oh, the form just came back online, if you want to look at that.

135
00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.550
Jamie: If that's easy.

136
00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:00.700
Jamie: Oh, yeah.

137
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.609
P11: You wanna try that?

138
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:03.630
Jamie: Sure.

139
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.170
Jamie: Yeah, so I'm gonna put that link back in there.

140
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.260
Jamie: We'll see, we'll, you know.

141
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.910
Jamie: Apologize, all this, ….

142
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.509
P11: I figured, not necessarily.

143
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.700
Jamie: 4th year.

144
00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.430
Jamie: Alright, let me just put that.

145
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.899
Jamie: It might be a different link.

146
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.219
P11: Okay, here's a second one popped up, let's try.

147
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:31.760
Jamie: Okay.

148
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:46.620
P11: When I click on the, new one, I see… yeah. When I click on the new link, it goes to the same page.

149
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.410
Jamie: Okay, ….

150
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.240
P11: … We can't find that page, and….

151
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.669
Jamie: Oh, man.

152
00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.949
Jamie: Yeah, it was.

153
00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:05.599
Jamie: Oh, sorry, our, … it worked for a split second. We got super… wait, no, why was that working?

154
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.780
Jamie: This is bizarre, what's going on with this.

155
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:22.050
Jamie: I've tried it, like, two times now, and there's a new one.

156
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:36.209
Jamie: Let's give this one a shot. I apologize. If this doesn't work, we'll go back to sharing you some screens, and we can ask you some questions about it. So, thank you for hanging in there.

157
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.839
P11: Not a pro, here we go.

158
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.530
P11: Oh, something different.

159
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.140
Jamie: Yeah, it's a different link.

160
00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:43.690
P11: Yep.

161
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.669
Jamie: You got it up?

162
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.580
P11: Yadda yada, but I can see it.

163
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.520
Jamie: Fantastic, alright, let's up?

164
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:56.399
P11: Do I need to… do I need to hit that green button again to share type thing, or can you see what I'm looking at?

165
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.870
Jamie: No, if you could go ahead and hit that green button, that would be great.

166
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.090
P11: Excuse me, that was… Here.

167
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.349
P11: Spring.

168
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.440
P11: Okay.

169
00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:18.549
Jamie: Okay, and just, navigate back over to that link, if you could… Yes.

170
00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:19.399
Jamie: Got it.

171
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.259
P11: What's that one? Where did I go?

172
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:23.050
Jamie: We're.

173
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.949
P11: Oh, chat. Go to chat.

174
00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:29.730
P11: Bottom one.

175
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.150
P11: Steer wheel.

176
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:37.890
Jamie: Awesome, okay, great. So this was that same form that you were just looking at on my screen.

177
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:51.580
Jamie: But just one more quick question on here. Would you have to take a pause, to go find everything that's needed for the claim, or would you be ready to, just jump into the form and submit it?

178
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.190
P11: …

179
00:17:53.390 --> 00:18:06.610
P11: Personally, I would have everything with me, because I'm that kind of a person, make sure that I would have it, and I've done it enough times that I would know, but this would be helpful to know that, you know, okay, when you, when you see this, it'll give you a little…

180
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.409
P11: Cheat sheet to say, okay, have you got all this stuff with you?

181
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.490
Jamie: Okay.

182
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:23.500
Jamie: Great! And, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel you are to file a claim based on this, page's content?

183
00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.500
P11: 5?

184
00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.280
Jamie: Bye.

185
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:32.499
Jamie: Anything that sticks out, that's particularly, good to prepare you?

186
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:48.190
P11: Yes, because on the bottom floor here, with the, you've got the link where you can touch the link to say which documents, do you need to submit your claim, so that would be helpful to, have a quick lookup, as it was.

187
00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.900
P11: And then make sure that you've got everything with you.

188
00:18:51.760 --> 00:19:02.449
Jamie: Okay, great. So if you could scroll down to the bottom, there should be a link that says, like, right under that, yeah, start your form without signing in, so we're gonna do this as if we're… we're a guest.

189
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:03.420
P11: Oh, good.

190
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.750
P11: She'll hit that? Okay.

191
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:12.890
Jamie: And, so I would like you to start filling out the form as if you're submitting a medical claim for yourself.

192
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:31.650
Jamie: So just a reminder, this is a testing site, so you don't have to worry about any of the information you enter in these fields going anywhere. But feel free to use some fake information, you don't have to use your real name, and we do, strongly recommend you use fake information when it comes to sensitive questions like birth dates and social security numbers.

193
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:41.699
Jamie: So, yeah, just as you move through this form, just remember to think out loud. We do want to hear your reactions as you're experiencing them.

194
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.060
P11: Oh, okay.

195
00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.360
Jamie: So yeah, go ahead and, yeah, we're gonna file a new claim.

196
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.410
P11: He's filing a new claim. Yeah.

197
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.850
P11: Continue.

198
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.010
P11: I'm gonna go.

199
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:16.100
P11: Suffix, don't have a suffix, so we'll leave that blank. And… continue. More information.

200
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.100
P11: Did I?

201
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:30.860
P11: Okay, so it's back to the original stuff, so put first name, middle initial…[LAST NAME]

202
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:40.150
P11: What is today? August 12th, right? So, August 12th for her birthdate.

203
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.770
P11: … Continue.

204
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:53.420
P11: Your identification number… this system number is the same as… So… 1, 2, 3, 4…

205
00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:04.760
P11: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9… Oh, it didn't want spaces, okay. 3, 4… Okay.

206
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:11.349
P11: … And submit the… must be numbers only. What did I do? Did I put a space in there?

207
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.069
Jamie: Oh yeah, there's one… there's a space in the middle. Okay.

208
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.029
P11: Okay, there we go.

209
00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.539
P11: Alright, I live in the U.S. military base outside of [CITY].

210
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.590
P11: Oops, a little on the human.

211
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:36.170
P11: So I don't click the first one, because it wants to know if I live on a military base. I don't. Pick my country, and that's good that it's at the top of the form.

212
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:40.790
Jamie: A lot of times, they've gotta… you gotta go scroll all the way down and looking for it.

213
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.770
P11: Yeah. And the one that annoys me is always next to, …

214
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:50.159
P11: the United Kingdom, and with my fingers, I always hit the United Kingdom instead of the United States.

215
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:50.530
Jamie: Oh.

216
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:57.369
P11: rates. Then the address, …

217
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.139
P11: [STATE]

218
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:22.939
P11: Your address have changed since the last time? No.

219
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.600
P11: Same mailing address, so that's always good.

220
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:45.220
P11: Emailing address… We… I don't want that much.

221
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.830
P11: me, at…

222
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.720
P11: Oh, there we go.

223
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.959
P11: Does it want my actual email, or… let's see, try that.

224
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.820
Jamie: That should work. Oh, I see you got two.

225
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.389
P11: I've got two dots, it's got two dots in it, don't I? Okay.

226
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.750
P11: Try that. There we go. Okay.

227
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.689
P11: It's a bit….

228
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:25.129
Jamie: For this question, we're gonna hit yes, that you do have additional health insurance.

229
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.320
P11: Okay.

230
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:36.990
P11: Okay, he wants to know more continuing name of insurance. Medicare?

231
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.695
P11: Ugh.

232
00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.289
P11: I don't know the policy number if I wanted to.

233
00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:56.559
Jamie: That's okay, you could just enter in whatever. Would you need to take, would you need to take a pause to go find your Medicare card at this point?

234
00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:02.110
P11: Yes, because I wasn't sure… I didn't know I needed the Medicare card, and I don't know my number.

235
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.640
P11: … offhand.

236
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:12.789
P11: But actually, now that I think of it, in my case, I don't know if the average person has it, …

237
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:30.520
P11: I've got my Medicare number stored in my phone, so I would have to stop taking the… stop taking the information, you know, look on my phone, because that's what I'm using right now, is go on my phone, and pull up my account number so I can see it. I don't have to go look for my card.

238
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:36.600
P11: But I've got my card actually saved on the phone, but in most cases, people probably don't do that, so now…

239
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.860
P11: If they don't have their card with them.

240
00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:47.469
P11: And whatever insurance is there, secondary or primary, actually, it'll be primary, because Medicare's my primary.

241
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:52.659
P11: But, … I'd have to go look, or they'd have to go look for their card number.

242
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:53.790
Jamie: Okay.

243
00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.750
P11: Oh, and what policy number?

244
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.899
Jamie: Yeah, what is it asking for? Tegent tout.

245
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.039
P11: Put it down. I was one number short.

246
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.849
Jamie: No problem, I do that all the time.

247
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.720
Jamie: Okay, you can go ahead and hit continue.

248
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:15.470
P11: Type of insurance, employee, individual, Medicare Part A and B. I've got A and B.

249
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.010
P11: Alright, continue.

250
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.049
P11: Does the beneficiary have other health insurance coverage that isn't?

251
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.160
P11: You go ahead. No.

252
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:26.860
Jamie: No, yeah.

253
00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.190
P11: But this is just a….

254
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.469
Jamie: more.

255
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.370
Jamie: Okay, and for this, we're going to do a medical claim.

256
00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:35.720
P11: Okay.

257
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.390
P11: Claim work-related injury, no.

258
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:46.859
P11: There's a claim for injury condition caused by a car accident.

259
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.400
P11: Nope.

260
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:58.680
Jamie: Okay, so on this page, I just want you to look through the… the content here, and just let me know if you,

261
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:03.130
Jamie: What you're… what you think you're being asked to do on this page.

262
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:18.019
P11: Okay, just a quick question, is there another page I want to fill all this information out, so I have to have this with me, or is this just making sure that this is the information on the, on the billing statement?

263
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:27.960
Jamie: So, sorry to be annoying, but I'm gonna answer your question with the question. What do you think is gonna happen after this? Do you think it's…

264
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.369
Jamie: You're gonna have to answer, like, fill in this information, or do something else.

265
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:44.939
P11: I'm thinking from looking, reading the yellow box that I'm just gonna submit a form with the billing statement, and it's got to have all this information already on it.

266
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.370
Jamie: Okay.

267
00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.860
P11: And so, that's how I'm in… that's how I'm interpreting this.

268
00:26:50.720 --> 00:27:01.580
Jamie: Okay, that's fair enough. So, Perageian, at the beginning of the study should have sent you, some documents to upload here.

269
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:10.030
Jamie: I'm just curious if you received those, and if you have those handy on your phone. If not, I could attach them in the chat.

270
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.850
P11: If they did, I didn't see them.

271
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:17.739
Jamie: Okay, that is no problem. Become prepared.

272
00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.460
P11: Okay.

273
00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:23.600
Jamie: So, we'll see if we can get this. So, let me send this over.

274
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.980
Jamie: to you?

275
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:32.030
Jamie: So this is gonna be a sample billing statement, and it should have got, …

276
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.689
Jamie: A message in the chat with that file.

277
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.779
P11: Oops, I didn't want to go back, I don't think.

278
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.659
Jamie: Any questions on this so far?

279
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:34.889
P11: So far, we're good, but as far as uploading it, do I want to upload the files?

280
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:41.199
Jamie: Yeah, so… do you… did you see my message come through in the chat?

281
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:42.185
P11: Oh.

282
00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.330
Jamie: In the Zoom chat?

283
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.790
Jamie: We might have to go back to Zoom.

284
00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:47.610
P11: I don't know.

285
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.759
Jamie: Oh, I see the little red bubble.

286
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:50.390
Jamie: Yep.

287
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:54.990
P11: This one here, okay. Alright, sample PDF, okay.

288
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.670
Jamie: Yep.

289
00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.880
P11: There we go.

290
00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.750
Jamie: Okay.

291
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.499
Jamie: So now the tricky part…

292
00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.649
Jamie: Is going back to the form and uploading this file.

293
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.980
Jamie: So we're gonna pretend this is your billing statement.

294
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.230
P11: Okay.

295
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:20.020
P11: Like this, and then go back to… Is it?

296
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:23.990
P11: Okay, so if I hit Upload File….

297
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.540
Jamie: Yep.

298
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.450
George Cwik: ….

299
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:33.600
Jamie: What's gonna do it?

300
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.010
Jamie: Possibly photos and videos, I'm not sure where it saved it on your phone.

301
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:49.290
Jamie: And if we can't find that same exact file, if you feel comfortable using Something else…

302
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.989
Jamie: That would be totally fine. Maybe my file, I'm not sure.

303
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.350
P11: Go back to here for a second.

304
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.770
Jamie: Okay.

305
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:03.319
P11: This is our place to upload this on the… What do this.

306
00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.579
Jamie: Yeah, you should be able to upload that on the form. Did you download it to your phone?

307
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.789
P11: Not yet, so let's see. Open with app….

308
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.810
Jamie: Maybe cancel it. So, if you go back to the Zoom chat.

309
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:20.770
P11: Okay.

310
00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.910
Jamie: Oh, sorry, the Zoom chat, the window was.

311
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.429
P11: Oh, this one here, okay.

312
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:35.159
Jamie: Yeah, maybe hit that back arrow? Yeah, so there's three dots at the bottom underneath the file, where you see sample… where the… you see.

313
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.670
P11: PDF file?

314
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:40.960
Jamie: Yeah, maybe click on those, and there might be a….

315
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.529
P11: Send you an emoji.

316
00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:50.829
P11: Let's see, try to go back to the three dots, reply, cancel.

317
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:51.770
Jamie: That's bizarre.

318
00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:55.049
P11: Three more dots, and you cannot chat with it. Okay.

319
00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:55.830
Jamie: Hmm.

320
00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:02.270
Jamie: Maybe a double tap on the, … on the file.

321
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.859
Jamie: And… Millie….

322
00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.819
P11: So if you're open with app….

323
00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:10.180
Jamie: I see three dots on the top right. Maybe that will give you the….

324
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.200
P11: That's good.

325
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:13.010
Jamie: No.

326
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.739
P11: It's open with another app, but I don't want…

327
00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.099
P11: Now, what if I took a screenshot of this and then saved it? Would that work, or…?

328
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.240
Jamie: That might work.

329
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:25.480
P11: I like that.

330
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.220
P11: Okay.

331
00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:35.090
Jamie: I like the way you think with the screenshot. I wasn't even thinking that.

332
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:39.840
P11: Well, I've learned doing screenshots.

333
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.789
Jamie: I'm gonna use that for now on. We have problems with that.

334
00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:44.810
P11: Blue trailer.

335
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.930
P11: Camera.

336
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.340
Jamie: Maybe vote, photos and videos?

337
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.300
P11: Pulled back.

338
00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:01.250
P11: Upload file… Those videos that we built.

339
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.169
Jamie: Awesome, man, I see it.

340
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:07.560
P11: Okay.

341
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.879
P11: Okay, so I've got the… I've got that form uploaded.

342
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:16.260
P11: There's document, you know.

343
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.710
Jamie: Okay.

344
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.180
Jamie: Would you be able to scroll down a little bit?

345
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.299
Jamie: Okay, so it looks like you got a little message here.

346
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.519
P11: We cannot complete the verification file. We can retry…

347
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.359
P11: What do you think that means?

348
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:40.720
P11: Well, something went wrong, but I'm not sure what it's trying to verify. It says we cannot complete the verification for this file.

349
00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.979
P11: You can retry the verification, or you continue without verifying.

350
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.879
P11: I guess you're trying to verify if it's a true, …

351
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:55.259
P11: Billing statement, versus, in this case, it was just a screenshot.

352
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:56.730
Jamie: Okay.

353
00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:00.809
Jamie: So what would you do to resolve this at this point?

354
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:11.070
P11: I can, … I would try to verify. We can have verification. You can enter…

355
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:23.139
P11: But I'm not sure how to retry, unless it's upload the file a second, is that… what's that? It doesn't ask to re-upload the file, it's just to verify, but I'm not sure how to verify.

356
00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.070
Jamie: Okay.

357
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:29.810
P11: I don't see a button trying to… as I'm scrolling to see if there's something that says to verify this.

358
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.609
Jamie: Okay. Document.

359
00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:36.330
Jamie: So you're looking for something specific to take action on verifying the document.

360
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:37.090
P11: Right.

361
00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:37.890
Jamie: Okay.

362
00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.409
Jamie: That's helpful to know. ….

363
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:45.669
P11: So, for now, what I would do is I would continue to see what the next screen gives me.

364
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:51.209
Jamie: Okay. You could go ahead and hit continue, it should pass you through.

365
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:59.000
P11: Okay, and same thing, take a look at this page and let me know what you think it means.

366
00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:09.819
P11: It's asking you to make sure that what the information they want, like the data service, the healthcare provider's information, is all on the,

367
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.430
P11: The, the, submitted form?

368
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:18.829
Jamie: So, I would just double-check, make sure that the information they're looking for is included.

369
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:25.760
P11: And then it gives me more information on how to upload the file again.

370
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:37.779
Jamie: I just want to draw your attention to that blue box. I'm not sure if you saw that on the other screen, but what does that mean to you?

371
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.610
P11: It's a, …

372
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:46.179
P11: I can't think of the right word, but it's a little prompt to help you to make sure that in order that

373
00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:59.719
P11: you're not sitting here waiting, like in the case of not verifying it, whatever wasn't verified, if I read this and make sure everything that they want is on the form, then it'll, make things go simpler.

374
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:07.790
Jamie: Okay. Now, it says that there's gonna be… might be a 1-2 minute delay. What do you… what do you think about that?

375
00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:09.570
P11: …

376
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:30.079
P11: I guess I'm used to delays with computers, depending on the size of the file. Every time you go to upload something, sometimes it'll upload real quick, and sometimes it will take a few minutes. So, I guess in today's digital world, you sort of get used to,

377
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.900
P11: Waiting for things to download.

378
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:33.970
Jamie: Okay.

379
00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:48.620
Jamie: Makes sense. Great, so we're gonna… I'm gonna send another file, I apologize, but now… now that we know how to do this, it should be easier. Okay. So there's another file in the, the chat to upload here.

380
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:53.690
P11: This one here.

381
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:57.560
P11: That's the picture, so I don't want that.

382
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.819
P11: This is the picture I'm looking at.

383
00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.140
P11: Okay.

384
00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.159
P11: Oh, there's a couple of pages.

385
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.770
Jamie: Okay.

386
00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:21.749
Jamie: Yeah, we could… we could try the screenshot again with that. It should work just fine.

387
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:28.850
P11: Okay.

388
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.760
P11: Back to… I'll go back over here to the…

389
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:42.400
P11: And then upload the second one.

390
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:42.960
Jamie: Yep.

391
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:47.689
P11: We'll hit upload file, we know it's in the photos, and it's this one here.

392
00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:53.040
Jamie: You got that.

393
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.509
P11: Okay, and we get the same thing, it's couldn't verify the file.

394
00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:07.310
P11: And because I would sit here and look around, how do I verify, looking for a button to… or do I… and it doesn't say to re-upload, but that would be my first initial

395
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:13.609
P11: reaction is maybe I need to, re-upload the file a second time, making sure that it

396
00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.519
P11: It, got everything.

397
00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:18.390
Jamie: Okay.

398
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:24.070
P11: The second file… the second file would have been two pages, it looked like, versus the first one was a one page.

399
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:33.399
Jamie: So, at this point, what would you do if you now have seen this the second time?

400
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.040
P11: Hit continue and move on.

401
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:41.449
Jamie: Okay, you go… go ahead and take action and hit continue and move on.

402
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.490
Jamie: … Okay.

403
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.540
Jamie: Alright, so you made it to the review page, …

404
00:37:47.890 --> 00:38:05.029
Jamie: So, at this point, we're not gonna have you submit the form, but you are at the end of the form, so if you were to hit, you know, submit at the bottom, you know, in theory, it would go over to, Champ VA to review. So I do have, I promise, the last…

405
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:13.659
Jamie: file attachment to send over to you. And this one, you don't have to download,

406
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:16.709
Jamie: Just want you to take a look at it and read through it.

407
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:18.660
P11: Okay.

408
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.430
Jamie: Okay, and it should be… there it is.

409
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:41.619
Jamie: So imagine, and hopefully you can zoom in on this, there you go. Imagine you went and you submitted a form, over to CHAMPVA, and after some time, you received this letter in the mail from them. Just, yeah, do your best with reading through this, and let me know your thoughts on the letter.

410
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:56.869
P11: And it's very simple and explains, that something was missing.

411
00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:06.370
P11: Now, this was… would this be an actual mail form that would come through the U.S. mail, or is this something that they would send to the, CHAMPVA site that I would get?

412
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:12.610
Jamie: So this would, typically come through U.S. mail, ….

413
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:13.110
P11: Okay.

414
00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:17.899
Jamie: But, out of curiosity, how would you prefer to receive communication like this?

415
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:27.710
P11: This might be better going through the mail, because I don't always go back and check my different, …

416
00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.039
P11: information from the VA, if that makes sense.

417
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:41.110
P11: And so I might be sitting there, unless there's something on the VA site, and I'm not aware of it, telling me that I've got messages.

418
00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:53.519
P11: But yeah, this would be something that I would, you know, catch my attention real quick when I opened up the mail and go, oh, I didn't… I forgot to send the, … in this case, it wants the diagnosis code.

419
00:39:53.520 --> 00:40:03.260
P11: So, whether it was the diagnosis code or some other information not on the form, then I can simply go back, trying to see if it says anything about which…

420
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.830
P11: form…

421
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:18.069
P11: Okay, so according to what I'm reading, they would send a copy of the actual form back, too, so I'd know which of my doctor's visits this was referring to.

422
00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:18.950
Jamie: Okay.

423
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:26.900
P11: So that would be helpful, too. That way, you know, I've got 5 different doctors. Well, which one didn't I fill the information on?

424
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:37.559
Jamie: Okay, great. So, what would you do, like, what would the next steps after receiving this letter be to, to resolve this claim?

425
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:52.499
P11: In this case, the first thing I'm gonna do is look at the form, and, okay, this is my, this is my general care doctor, I've got to call them and get an updated form from… an updated, billing statement with the code on it.

426
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:52.820
Jamie: Okay.

427
00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:53.970
P11: proper code.

428
00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:01.689
Jamie: So you would, find out what's missing, and then call your doctor to get the updated form.

429
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:19.860
P11: Correct. If it's something, like in this case, if it's from the doctor, then I'll call the doctor. If it's something I forgot to put on the form, or submit, you know, something that, like my Medicare number or something, but in this case, it's information from the doctor, so I would call the, …

430
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:27.640
P11: The doctor's office to get a form that had, or a billing statement that had the right information on it, or the necessary information.

431
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:32.349
Jamie: Okay, great. So I just want to draw your attention to the bottom of the letter.

432
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.819
Jamie: And let me know if any of that stuff means anything to you.

433
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.070
Jamie: what you think?

434
00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:38.530
P11: [inaudible]

435
00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:39.690
Jamie: What are you referring to?

436
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:43.180
P11: All these long codes on the bottom?

437
00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:48.780
P11: … I'm not sure if the employee number is me, but I would…

438
00:41:49.030 --> 00:42:00.070
P11: I think that would be what they have, is that it's considered to be me as the employee, and that would be their identification number. And then the other information here is all of it, …

439
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:09.729
P11: from what I'm looking at, the PDI and the 701 and all that, that's all the information for them, the, how they, …

440
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:17.150
P11: … Number their forms so that they know where it's at and is saved in their files.

441
00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.530
Jamie: Okay.

442
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:21.120
P11: Does that make sense, or did I explain that right?

443
00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:35.559
Jamie: Yeah, it's however you understand it, honestly. We just want to get information on, you know, what kind of, text they're putting on this letter, and information they're communicating to their beneficiaries, so that's great.

444
00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:43.040
Jamie: So, on a scale of 1 to 5, how well do you think this letter explains what you need to do in order to resolve your CHAMP VA claim?

445
00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:51.800
Jamie: 1 to 5, it explains very well. Okay. Simple addressing, it gives me the necessary information of either.

446
00:42:51.800 --> 00:43:08.490
P11: to, mail the new information back, or if I've got a question, it gives me a 800 number, which makes it, you know, even easier, so that if I have more questions on to what, you know… In this case, it's quite simple as far as missing the diagnosis or number.

447
00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.800
P11: That's a simple call to the doctor.

448
00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:20.390
Jamie: All right, great. So at this point, you could… let's see, where are you at here? Maybe go back to the Zoom window?

449
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:32.430
Jamie: There you go. I just sent you another thing in the chat, apologize, so this is the last part. So, hopefully this link works.

450
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:50.400
Jamie: Yes, okay, so we're gonna… we're gonna, see, so you got this letter in the mail, and now you need to resubmit all that information. Let's say you choose to try to do it online, just as you submitted your… your other claim. So….

451
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.010
P11: Okay.

452
00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:58.299
P11: Just out of curiosity, looking at this page, this is the page that we were in before, … Right.

453
00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:02.440
Jamie: Do you think you're in the right place to resubmit information for your claim?

454
00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:03.870
Jamie: To resolve it.

455
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.329
P11: I think so.

456
00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.820
Jamie: It says, he wants to file a claim for reimbursement.

457
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:25.319
P11: Now, the other one, I thought, maybe I read it wrong, but it said for either a claim or for a resubmission.

458
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:26.149
Jamie: Okay.

459
00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.239
P11: Let your client find us?

460
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:32.420
Jamie: Okay.

461
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:38.230
Jamie: So you thought you saw something about a resubmission on the last time you filled this out?

462
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:46.469
P11: Yeah, on the last one, I thought it had either, you know, a new form or a resubmission form. I remember something about that.

463
00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:54.950
Jamie: But you're not seeing it on here, right now. Okay, that's fine. You could go ahead and click that link, start your form without signing in.

464
00:44:55.410 --> 00:45:00.619
Jamie: Oh, not other link. I just hit that X out of there. Yeah.

465
00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.379
P11: Sign and start your form.

466
00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:08.350
Jamie: Right below that, start your form without signing in. That, yeah, that purple link there.

467
00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:09.890
P11: Okay, there we go.

468
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:16.249
Jamie: Alright, so I want you to go through this as if you're trying to resubmit some information, so….

469
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.659
P11: myself, do you receive a yes.

470
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:28.790
P11: Okay, this is what I saw, because this is a resubmission of an existing claim.

471
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.160
P11: Okay, ….

472
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:33.940
Jamie: Okay.

473
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:38.030
Jamie: What information do you think you're being asked for on this page?

474
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:46.729
P11: On the bottom of the form, there was this real long PDI number, and so that's what they're looking for, is the PDI number from there.

475
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:47.900
Jamie: Okay.

476
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.500
P11: ….

477
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.090
Jamie: Yeah, true.

478
00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:58.320
P11: Do you want to try and fill that in, or just….

479
00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.549
Jamie: Sure, yeah, go ahead and try to fill it in, you don't have to remember the exact number. …

480
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:06.409
Jamie: I don't know.

481
00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:20.510
P11: Okay, so it gives me an explanation of what I do need. I don't need to put the whole number in there, for control numbers, on the CHAMPVA register…

482
00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:37.730
P11: explanation of benefits. And then it gives me where to find this, information on that form, so if I wasn't sure what information they wanted, I can click on one of these two, and it'll give me a location on the form to what information I need, correct?

483
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:38.999
Jamie: Yeah, sounds great.

484
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.420
Jamie: Alright, you can go ahead and hit continue.

485
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.630
P11: This was a medical claim.

486
00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:48.730
P11: …

487
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:05.780
P11: Data service… in June.

488
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:30.389
P11: Validation… Okay, and this is gonna be….

489
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:43.020
Jamie: Yeah, this is gonna be the last page we look at. Same thing as the other pages where you would need to upload a file, just take a look at this page and let me know, in your own words, what you think this page is asking for.

490
00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:47.650
P11: It's making… it's asking you to double check, and…

491
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:52.799
P11: make sure that the form has all the necessary information, and I guess…

492
00:47:52.850 --> 00:48:08.720
P11: Theoretically, if I had done my job right the first time, it sells me in this blue box to me, I'll make sure that all the information's on there. Had I checked the form before I uploaded the original one and saw that it didn't have my, …

493
00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:16.980
P11: diagnosis code, I could have saved time and called the doctor and got a… got a diagnosis code on… on it.

494
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:19.549
P11: So it's sort of like, …

495
00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.090
P11: People see it, but they don't read it.

496
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:36.909
Jamie: We're familiar. It's part of our job, making people read it. So, what documents do you think you need to upload here?

497
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:46.170
P11: A new, … billing statement with the correct, diagnosis code on it.

498
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:46.810
Jamie: Okay.

499
00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:57.000
Jamie: All right, so we're done with sharing the screen. I just got a couple wrap-up questions for you, and then we could, could let you go after this.

500
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:57.720
P11: Okay.

501
00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:11.129
Jamie: So yeah, if you want to go back, yep, excellent. So overall, in these, two, sessions where you submitted claims and resubmitted claims, was there anything that worked particularly well for you?

502
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:16.149
P11: Having all the little extra boxes there, like, …

503
00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:39.739
P11: when that second one where it had to find your PDI number on the form, so there were… there were boxes, I'm not sure what the PDI… what information they're looking for, so I could click on there, and it'll… I'm… I'm… we didn't click it, but I would think that if I did click it, it would have showed me a copy of the letter, and said, your PDI form is down here in the lower left-hand corner.

504
00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:40.170
Jamie: Okay.

505
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.560
P11: And then it's also said I didn't need the whole date, because that's…

506
00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.379
P11: Half the numbers are just a date in there.

507
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:48.650
Jamie: Okay, so then….

508
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:50.420
P11: There were a lot of little…

509
00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:58.699
P11: buttons to click on that, would give you hints on what it is, the information they're asking for.

510
00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:13.370
Jamie: Okay, so having that… those details kind of laid out, you think would help you figure out how to enter in that information, okay? So was there anything that didn't work well for you on these two forms?

511
00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:18.620
P11: The… we're said to click to verify.

512
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:24.010
P11: There was that little yellow box that popped up that said something about it wasn't able to verify

513
00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:39.529
P11: And do you want to re-verify? There was no button that said for me to click to re-verify, so I'm sitting there looking, and that's when I said, well, I would just… I couldn't find how to re-verify, so I would just click continue and see if something pops up in the next screen.

514
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:42.839
Jamie: Okay, so that verification, yeah, was it….

515
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.040
P11: Transportation box, yeah.

516
00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.799
Jamie: Okay, yeah, that wasn't… that needs some more, clarity, I presume.

517
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:59.289
Jamie: So, being that you submitted claims in the past, how would this experience compare to how you filled out claims previously for Champ VA?

518
00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:13.690
P11: It's pretty similar. I don't notice any real difference. There may be something subtle in there, but, as far as previous submissions, and…

519
00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:25.720
P11: I've had similar things. I would get the letter from the VA telling me that it's been denied, but that's because the, …

520
00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:27.740
P11: Doctors sent it to the wrong

521
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:41.509
P11: They send it to the VA instead of CHAMP VA, so I've done… I've had to do stuff like that, where I turn around and now resubmit my claim, and make sure it goes to the CHAMP VA versus they sending it to the VA office.

522
00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:42.570
Jamie: Okay.

523
00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:49.719
Jamie: That's fair enough. Thank you for the information. So that's all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?

524
00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.899
P11: No, very simple.

525
00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.799
Jamie: Okay, good to hear.

526
00:51:54.210 --> 00:52:09.350
Jamie: So I just want to circle back with that one question that I did want to ask you again, in, regards to the video clips. Are you comfortable if we share a clip of our video, from our session today with our VA partners?

527
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:10.799
P11: Yes, I am.

528
00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:28.290
Jamie: Okay, great. Yeah, and that's all I have for you today. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback's super helpful, it just helps us continue to work on these forms and make them better. And, so thank you again, and …

529
00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:47.299
Jamie: Lastly, Paragian will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you could pass along to other veterans, or families that you may know, and that will provide them a chance to participate in future studies like this. So, once again, thank you, we all appreciate it, and enjoy the rest of your day.

530
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.700
P11: Oh, thank you, you too.

531
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.330
Jamie: Yeah, thanks! Alright. Take care now.

532
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.510
P11: Take care.
