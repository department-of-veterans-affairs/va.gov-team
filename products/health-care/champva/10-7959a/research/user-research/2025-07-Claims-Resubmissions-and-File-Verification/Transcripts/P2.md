00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:10.010
Renata: I have started the recording I'd like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.660
P2: Yes, ma'am.

3
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:20.990
Renata: And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners? If we remove any information that can be used to identify you.

4
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.400
P2: Yes, ma'am.

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:31.630
Renata: All right. So before we look at that website, just a few warm up questions for you. Are you or anyone else in your household currently enrolled in the CHAMPVA program.

6
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.843
P2: Yes, ma'am.

7
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.419
Renata: All right just you or other folks as well.

8
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.440
P2: That's me!

9
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.969
Renata: Just you. Okay, how recently did you apply for the CHAMPVA program?

10
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.590
P2: It has been since 2 min 20.

11
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.950
Renata: 14 or 15. Something like that.

12
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.739
P2: Oh, wow! Okay.

13
00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:58.979
Renata: And thinking back to when you originally applied. Can you remember anything about your application and enrollment? Experience.

14
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.810
P2: Well, I did it with the social worker, and they put me in there, and that's all I know.

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.066
P2: I haven't

16
00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:19.850
P2: can't recall anything. I just I think I signed paperwork, and that was it through my caregiving program. And I had a social worker.

17
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.049
Renata: Okay. Oh, you, said the caregiver caregiver. Wow! I can't talk today.

18
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.449
Renata: The caregiver program was that a Va medical center or a regional office that you did that.

19
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.379
P2: Medical Center.

20
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.679
Renata: Okay, got it. And have you ever submitted a medical or pharmacy claim to the CHAMPVA program?

21
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.970
P2: I did.

22
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.125
Renata: Okay,

23
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.760
Renata: Do you recall what the experience was like having to submit that yourself?

24
00:01:50.050 --> 00:02:13.499
P2: I had a number, and I'm gonna have to call them again to really go through with it, because I haven't since to get my epipen because I'm [redacted]. So I called the pharmacy. It was some sort of pharmacy number, and I'm definitely going to. I'm glad that we're going through this, too, because I'm gonna have to have someone to contact me. So I could

25
00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:21.220
P2: figure it out again of how to do these things because I moved from

26
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:31.590
P2: [City] to I mean sorry, [City] to [State], and then it was just things just got muddled, and I got lost in the in the system just lost.

27
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.170
Renata: Okay.

28
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.079
Renata: So if I'm hearing you correctly, you did submit a claim originally for Epipen, and something happened to it. And so you're gonna have to resubmit that claim.

29
00:02:41.080 --> 00:03:05.660
P2: Nothing. Nothing happened to it. I submitted it when I was in [city], so when I moved to [state] I got lost in the sauce. And then it was Covid. And you know things like that. And my main focus then, was just not even about my health or anything. Well, it was about my health, but not about that aspect of it, you know. So I kind of just shut down.

30
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.315
P2: And it was just really mainly focused on my husband, and just for us not to get comfy.

31
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:21.129
Renata: Yeah, yeah, okay, do you recall when you submitted that claim? Was it using a paper or Pdf form? Or did you submit the the claim online?

32
00:03:21.754 --> 00:03:33.375
P2: It was online. And then I called them. And then it looked up my credentials and everything you know, to see that I was in the caregiver program and and champ, and then they they sent me

33
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.900
P2: They sent me the epipen.

34
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:46.530
Renata: Okay, got it. And do you recall if you received any mail from the CHAMPVA program about a claim before it was processed like telling you. Hey? We need more information.

35
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.100
P2: No, ma'am.

36
00:03:48.100 --> 00:04:05.860
Renata: Okay, got it. That's totally fair. So at this point, we're gonna be looking at that demo tool I mentioned before, I'm gonna be dropping a link in the Zoom chat in a moment, which I'd like you to open in your browser and share your screen in zoom. I can help walk you through that if we have any technical difficulties. But just if at this point you have any other.

37
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.260
P2: Maria.

38
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.790
Renata: Public.

39
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.170
P2: Anyone.

40
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.550
Renata: Oh!

41
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.600
P2: I see you.

42
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.780
Renata: Okay. If you have any notifications up or any other applications, open, go ahead and close them at this time, and let me know when you're ready for that that link.

43
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.380
P2: Okay.

44
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.999
P2: Okay. I'm ready.

45
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:39.890
Renata: Alright. I posted that in the zoom chat. So go ahead and click that link. Open it up in your web, browser, and then share your screen in zoom, and I can help walk you through that. If there's any issues.

46
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.959
P2: Okay. One sec. Let me go back to the zoom chat here.

47
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.279
P2: All right. Here we go. Now we're cooking with grease.

48
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.300
P2: It's okay.

49
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.900
P2: I did.

50
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:04.249
Renata: I can't see your screen yet, so if you can come back into the the Zoom Platform, there should be a

51
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:12.660
Renata: couple of icons at the bottom of the zoom, and one of them is a a green box with an arrow pointing up. That says, Share, if you could go ahead and click on that.

52
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.500
P2: Can you see it?

53
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.760
Renata: I can't yet did a.

54
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.750
P2: You see them.

55
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.510
Renata: Pop up, pop up when you click the share, button.

56
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:36.049
P2: Yeah, it says, everything on your screen, including notifications, will be recorded. Enable do not disturb, to prevent unexpected. Let me let me do that first, st

57
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.809
P2: I don't want anyone texting me, or what have you?

58
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:48.010
P2: let's see, focus. Do not disturb. Okay, here we go.

59
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.519
P2: Can you see it now?

60
00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:55.789
Renata: I think you'll have to in that pop up that says to put on, put it on.

61
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.280
P2: It says.

62
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.479
Renata: Yeah, share screen, or like, start broadcast, I think, is the button in there.

63
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.249
Renata: See if that works.

64
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:15.439
Renata: There we go. Okay. If you could go back to the browser where you open that link for me, please. Right now we can see your zoom screen.

65
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.120
P2: Right.

66
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.960
Renata: Yes. Perfect. Okay.

67
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.520
P2: Okay.

68
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:35.342
Renata: Yeah. So before we start looking at this form, just a few things for you to be aware of. So this is our testing site, and we won't be filling out submitting the form that we're filling out today. So nothing you click on will have any bearing on your benefits

69
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:57.470
Renata: as we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers. If you don't feel comfortable using real information, there's a few screens in this form where you're going to be asked to upload documents. The email you should have gotten about the session today should have had some documents attached to it. Do you? Did you receive those documents?

70
00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:03.340
P2: Yeah. Let me look on another give me one sec. I'll just look at my phone to see.

71
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.950
Renata: Okay.

72
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.712
P2: So that I'm not messing up the zoom.

73
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:19.280
P2: Shannon. Okay, I see medical supplies and things like that.

74
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.149
Renata: Yeah, those there should be 2 attachments in there.

75
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.519
P2: Mister John Smith. Okay.

76
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:41.329
Renata: Alright, so we will be using those a little bit later in the session, but just wanted to make sure you receive those, and I also have a copy of those that I can give you in a link. When we get to those screens where you need to upload a document. We're going to be using them, but just like to check ahead of time. But any questions for me before we jump in.

77
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.860
P2: No, ma'am.

78
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:53.130
Renata: All right, so you can scroll up and down this page, but without clicking on anything, let on anything. Yet if you could just review the information on the page, and let me know your initial thoughts.

79
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.610
P2: So

80
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:11.009
P2: my initial thoughts are, you must file your claim within a year of when you got the care. Okay? So that that stands out.

81
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.379
P2: Okay? Because that's boldly highlighted.

82
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.359
P2: Let's see, each claim needs its own form. If you need to submit more, you need to.

83
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.830
P2: Okay, you gotta sign in.

84
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.049
P2: Here's where it gets tricky for me.

85
00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:32.320
P2: because my only sign in is for my husband.

86
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:45.110
P2: you know, and it saved everything because I forget stuff like, what is this this login and things like that? Would it be under my own, or is it gonna go through my husband's.

87
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:56.419
Renata: That's a great question. I'm gonna be a little annoying, and answer it with another question, which is, would you want your own account, or a non login non account option to fill this out.

88
00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.219
P2: I would, because simple fact is, not unless

89
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:22.270
P2: the only reason why I say I would is that I wouldn't want to get it muddled his care within my care, you know, or if it said, if it's under him it would specifically say my name, you know, as to a different place to where to click, or if there was a pull down that said, You know my husband's name or my name.

90
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.590
P2: you understand, so I don't want it to get muddled so.

91
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.320
Renata: Yeah.

92
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:38.519
Renata: So what I'm hearing is you want to be able to manage your care separately, without like accidentally submitting a a champion claim for your husband, or or vice versa. Okay.

93
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.700
P2: Yes, ma'am.

94
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:45.530
Renata: Got it all right. A few questions for you about this page. What type of form is this page describing.

95
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:53.530
P2: To me. It sounds like the type of form that if I if if I have gotten care.

96
00:09:53.680 --> 00:10:02.584
P2: you know, and and to submit for the claim for reimbursement like if I paid out of pocket for something.

97
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:09.369
P2: I guess if it's for an emergency or whatever, and I couldn't get an appointment, or whatever I don't know.

98
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:19.270
P2: and to submit for a claim for them to reimburse me. If it's for pharmacy, or what have you? Then I would get it reimbursed.

99
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:28.039
Renata: Okay, I heard you mentioned pharmacy and also medical reimbursement. Any other types of claims you can file based on what you see on this page.

100
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:32.760
P2: No.

101
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.779
P2: not that I'm seeing that stands out to me. What stands out is is, you know.

102
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:49.979
P2: you know, like the the care like if I went to a doctor or something, or hospital, or had to get medication.

103
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:57.579
Renata: Okay, got it. And what information do you think you're going to need to have in order to fill out this claims? Form.

104
00:10:58.127 --> 00:11:09.840
P2: Well, I would. I was thinking that I would have to have you know the receipt from the doctor, the doctor's appointment receipt from the pharmacy, you know things like that.

105
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:18.229
P2: and maybe having it, you know. Make sure that it has my name.

106
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:19.890
Renata: Okay.

107
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.370
P2: All right.

108
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:32.109
Renata: Got it? So if you were filling this out on va.gov for real today, would you have all of that information on hand, or would you need to pause here? To go collect it.

109
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:56.209
P2: Well for me, I more than likely would just have all the information on hand. I like to do like when I get my with anything. I'm either going to take a picture of it. And I'm gonna load it up. You know, I put things in folders so that okay, I could access that, you know, at a time where I need it.

110
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:57.689
Renata: That we've got.

111
00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.200
Renata: Okay.

112
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:06.179
P2: Somewhere like in my computer. You know the you know, the copies of it scan copies things like that.

113
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:20.079
Renata: All right. Sounds very prepared. One more question for you on a scale of one to 5, 1 being poorly and 5 being very well. How prepared do you feel to file a claim based on this page's content?

114
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:31.119
P2: Let's say about a 4 or 5, you know, and it's pretty much self explanatory of what they are needing.

115
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:51.030
P2: because this is an itemized bills, billing statement, an explanation of benefits from another provider. Maybe they need to say, make sure that your name is attached to it as well, you know, because it could be anyone's medication. They could, I mean, I don't know.

116
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:57.709
Renata: Got it? If I had to tie you to one of those numbers, would it be more of a 4, or would it be more of a 5.

117
00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.710
P2: I would say about a 4.

118
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:11.399
Renata: A 4. Okay, got it. And to make it a 5, would we just need a little bit more detail around like, make sure your name as a champion beneficiary is on all of the documents something like that.

119
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.560
P2: Yes, ma'am.

120
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:25.390
Renata: All right. Got it so at this point I'd like you to scroll down a little bit on this page at the bottom of that light blue box. There is a small link that says, Start your form without signing in, if you would please click on that for me.

121
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:46.930
Renata: All right. So at this point I'd like you to start the form as if you're submitting a new medical claim for yourself. Just a few things to know. I'll stop you when we have questions. But again, you can use fake information. And please just think out loud as you're filling the form out. We want to hear any reactions you're having as you experience them.

122
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:53.659
P2: Okay. Is this a new claim or resubmission for an existing claim? But a new claim

123
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.850
P2: doing that man?

124
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:16.880
P2: -Oh!

125
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.199
P2: Here we go sometimes with my name. Here we go.

126
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:29.280
P2: I am hyphenated, so it's not going to allow me to put hyphen, so I.

127
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.109
P2: I have to put.

128
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.519
P2: Together. So would that be an issue.

129
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.129
Renata: Has that been an issue with you before for you before with with BA forms.

130
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.150
P2: No? Well, because

131
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:51.008
P2: I can't remember if it did before, but when I fill in things for my husband, he's just only [LAST NAME], so.

132
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.390
Renata: Interesting.

133
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.500
P2: Yeah.

134
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.620
P2: So the exact name as listed. So

135
00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.440
P2: is this, oh, this is my information.

136
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.710
P2: So I'm doing this again

137
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.469
P2: with this. Okay.

138
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.520
P2: I guess I'm filling it out again.

139
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.830
P2: But I'm gonna take the

140
00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:34.200
P2: I'm gonna see whether or not if it's gonna take [LAST NAME], because what they're asking me is that? Enter the name exactly as it is listed on your chat. Va. Identification card.

141
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.130
Renata: Does it have the hyphen on your card?

142
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.099
P2: I don't know where the card is, ma'am, I'm gonna.

143
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.100
Renata: I did that.

144
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:42.780
Renata: Okay.

145
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.439
P2: When I moved from [STATE] to [STATE].

146
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:57.019
P2: things just got I don't know where it is, so that's another check. I'm glad that you all are doing this because I'm gonna call in and say, how do I get my card, please? I don't know.

147
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.470
Renata: Hmm.

148
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.899
P2: Who do I call into?

149
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.700
P2: I don't know.

150
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:02.750
Renata: Got it.

151
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:08.270
P2: So you all know that information, please pass it on.

152
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.489
P2: Okay, we're gonna say, if this

153
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.919
P2: if this rush great Nope, Nope, Nope, wait a minute.

154
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.189
P2: Okay, here we go.

155
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.969
P2: I'm just going to go rush.

156
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.699
P2: It's gonna put it all together.

157
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.579
P2: Let's see if that happens.

158
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.950
Renata: Hmm! I don't know why it's giving you trouble with your 1st name. It might just be our our test system. I'm sorry about that.

159
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:49.619
P2: Oh, that's okay. Well, I'm just gonna put [INITIAL]. Then I don't know. Maybe maybe they don't like that name.

160
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.520
P2: I thought everyone would like [MY NAME].

161
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.460
P2: There we go.

162
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:04.369
P2: It just worked with just tea. Alright, I don't know.

163
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:16.220
Renata: Sometimes our system doesn't like chronological numbers. If you flip those last 2 numbers around so it's not oh, never mind. It took it.

164
00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:22.519
P2: Oh, I live in the Us. Base! Now

165
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:26.019
P2: do I put my actual street address.

166
00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.459
Renata: You can put a fake one in if you don't want to put your real one in it's up to you.

167
00:17:45.942 --> 00:17:47.507
P2: Let's go.

168
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:08.530
P2: Has your network address changed since your last CHAMPVA. Claim or benefits?

169
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.550
P2: Well, I'm just gonna say no.

170
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.339
P2: I'll put in my real number.

171
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:31.430
Renata: I think our system is having issue with Pre fill, so you might have to like manually enter it in as annoying as that sounds.

172
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:48.420
P2: Now will that happen on the real thing?

173
00:18:49.150 --> 00:19:02.730
Renata: I think that might just be our demo tool having issues with it. But I will have our engineers look into that. So on this question, do you have additional health insurance just out of curiosity, or is champion your primary.

174
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.360
P2: That is my primary.

175
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:10.510
Renata: Okay, for the purposes of today's session. I'm gonna have you imagine you have additional insurance. So please select yes, for this question.

176
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:11.569
P2: All right.

177
00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.130
P2: Next.

178
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:24.060
P2: ask you to enter information about your health insurance. Okay, you can add up to 2 health insurances, but do not include Chat Va.

179
00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:30.510
Renata: The, and you can go ahead and make something up for this section.

180
00:19:48.990 --> 00:20:06.400
P2: Of insurance does the beneficiary have through this provider employer, sponsored insurance, individual private insurance medicare insurance part, a part B insurance type not listed. I'm just gonna say, let's just make it up.

181
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.889
P2: Since we're making this up.

182
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.646
Renata: Totally fair.

183
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.665
P2: Okay.

184
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.000
Renata: And you can select. No, we'll just add the one insurance plan here.

185
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.770
P2: Okay.

186
00:20:18.362 --> 00:20:22.830
Renata: Alright. And like I said before, we're gonna do a medical claim.

187
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:23.600
P2: Okay.

188
00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:39.609
P2: this is claimed for an injury or condition caused by a car accident. No, I don't want to throw that out in the universe.

189
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.210
P2: And now.

190
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:50.850
Renata: All right. So we're gonna pause on this page for a moment. Just take a look at and review the information that's on this screen, and then I'm going to ask you a few questions.

191
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.590
P2: Okay.

192
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:03.869
P2: you'll need to submit a copy of your itemized billing statement often called a super bill.

193
00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:10.670
P2: Never heard of that for the slate master provided for an itemized bill is page and copies often

194
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.630
P2: missing critical information required by CHAMPVA to process claims

195
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:25.969
P2: all the information. Okay, here we go. So it's stating what it's going to be. Now you're going to need your

196
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.430
P2: full name, date of birth.

197
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:37.579
P2: The provider's full name, medical title, address, or service. Render 10 digit National Provider identifier.

198
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:48.599
P2: 9, digit tax identification number. Maybe that's from the provider. A list of charges, the date of service diagnosis with care, a list of

199
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.109
P2: procedure codes for the care current procedure, terminologies.

200
00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:01.899
P2: healthcare, common procedure, coding system codes for more information about the codes that should be included.

201
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:09.359
P2: Chapter 8. Will not be able to process your claim. If your statement does not include all

202
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:22.550
P2: also listed information, you may need to ask your provider for a statement that has all of the information listed here. I would like to see that boldly, even though it does say note in bold, but it's kind of

203
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.439
P2: would love to see it like kind of boldly.

204
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.760
Renata: Got it.

205
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:53.919
P2: You can also submit any other documents you may think may be relevant to this claim how to upload. Okay, it's telling you that make sure that the file size is 20 MB or less. If you only have a copy, have a paper copy, scan or take a photo and upload the image. Okay? So that's a good thing that you can do, but it still has to be under 20 MB or less. Am I correct? Yeah.

206
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.540
Renata: Yeah.

207
00:22:55.139 --> 00:23:12.109
P2: Other helpful information. You must file the claim within a year. Okay, they're repeating that which is good, and if you stayed in hospital care. You must file your claim within a year of when you left the hospital. Please retain a copy of all documents submitted to chat Va.

208
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.879
P2: Learn more about supporting medical claims opens in a new tab

209
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:32.530
P2: to produce errors that might result in a claim denial. We'll scan your uploads to verify. They meet document requirements. This may cause a 1 to 2 min delay during the upload process. Please don't refresh your screen.

210
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:41.439
Renata: All right. So just those questions for you. What documentation is being asked?

211
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.270
Renata: 4 on this page.

212
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:53.639
P2: Itemized statement of the services that were rendered to you, the dates, and you know the list of charges. You know all that stuff should be on there.

213
00:23:54.230 --> 00:24:00.920
Renata: Okay. And do you understand what needs to be included on the document in that? In that itemized statement.

214
00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.280
P2: I do. But I

215
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:32.736
P2: some terminology. I do not like the 10 Digit National Provider Identifier, you know. I might have to call? The doctor said, well, where is that? What is that? I don't know. What that is? A 9 digit tax identification number. Will that be on there I don't know but a list of charges the date of service that should be on there to diagnosis for the care list of procedure codes.

216
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:40.880
P2: and then, if I have problems with that of knowing what those codes would be.

217
00:24:41.466 --> 00:24:47.440
P2: You can click. Let me see. More information about the code should be included.

218
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.310
P2: Do you click there?

219
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.509
P2: Okay, I didn't click there.

220
00:25:00.952 --> 00:25:06.309
P2: I would just look for those codes on it to see if they're on it, and if not

221
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.569
P2: I would just have to call the doctor.

222
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.880
Renata: All right.

223
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:24.779
Renata: Sounds fair. So do you have access to that email that Perigean sent you with those 2 files because we need to download them at this point in order to use them for uploading. And if you don't, I have a link that we can use to download them.

224
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.710
P2: Can you send a link and I can open it up.

225
00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.870
Renata: Yeah, the link will be in the zoom chat.

226
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:32.510
P2: Okay.

227
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.519
P2: let's see, where are we at?

228
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:42.849
P2: Just a chat here.

229
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.570
Renata: Yeah, it'll be that drive.google.com link.

230
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.135
P2: Oh!

231
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.289
P2: Here we go!

232
00:26:00.203 --> 00:26:11.469
Renata: And if you could please download the 2 bottom documents there, the sample billing statement and sample eob parentheses one. Those are the 2 that we're going to need to download

233
00:26:14.455 --> 00:26:23.910
Renata: and up at the top right of the screen, directly left of that share button. There's a download icon. It just disappeared. But if you tap your screen it might reappear.

234
00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.809
Renata: Yeah. You see the down arrow in the upper right hand corner.

235
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:30.810
P2: Yeah.

236
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.870
Renata: Perfect. Yeah. And you can click download.

237
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:35.850
P2: Okay.

238
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.470
Renata: But.

239
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.629
P2: The other one. Let me see. Hold on!

240
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.210
P2: How do I get back there?

241
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:44.930
Renata: If you.

242
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.530
P2: Let's go like this.

243
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:57.170
Renata: Yep.

244
00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.219
P2: Did it download.

245
00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:58.970
P2: Okay.

246
00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:12.900
Renata: Looks like it's downloading. So you can go back to the other tab you have open where we had the the form, and we'll just leave that Google drive Link up for now, because we're going to look at it later. But go ahead and scroll down the page

247
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:24.799
Renata: and where it has says, upload file in that button. Go ahead and select that and then upload the sample billing statement. File that you just downloaded.

248
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.532
P2: I don't know where it went.

249
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.620
P2: We're gonna stay downloads.

250
00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.060
P2: Huh!

251
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:43.659
P2: Look at all my downloads. Oh, my word! What would it be called?

252
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:45.740
P2: I don't know.

253
00:27:46.667 --> 00:27:48.249
P2: Let me see.

254
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:56.110
P2: do you know what it would be called? So I could search for it.

255
00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:03.459
Renata: Yeah, it will be sample hyphen, billing hyphen statement. If you want to try typing that in the search.

256
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.300
P2: Okay, here we go.

257
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.229
Renata: There we go. Yeah, it's that 1st one there on the left.

258
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.440
P2: Oh.

259
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:16.370
P2: okay.

260
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:28.729
Renata: All right before we hit. Continue. I just want to draw your attention to that little yellow alert that just popped up. It says we could not complete verification for this file. What do you think this error? This error message means.

261
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.750
P2: I don't know. We could not

262
00:28:39.595 --> 00:28:46.345
P2: verification for this phone. I it could be a various reasons. Maybe it's too big. I don't know

263
00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:52.310
P2: but it's you can continue without verifying, but it probably wouldn't.

264
00:28:52.550 --> 00:29:01.080
P2: Would you want to continue without verify? Would it stop anything like for my reimbursement or I don't know.

265
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:15.399
Renata: So if you encountered this in the wild on va.gov. You saw this alert that said we couldn't verify. Would you want to continue? Or would you be hesitant to continue in case it might affect your your reimbursement?

266
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.999
P2: I think I would be a little hesitant to continue, but what I would like to see is

267
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:26.889
P2: of why or who can I call for help?

268
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:28.530
Renata: Okay?

269
00:29:29.028 --> 00:29:47.659
Renata: So just repeating back to make sure that I got this. If if you did see this in the wild, you'd be hesitant to keep going because it might affect your reimbursement. You want to see some more detail in that box about what specifically went wrong, how you can fix it, or if you can't fix it, who you could talk to to get this fixed.

270
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.759
P2: Yes, and if I if all of those things are not there now.

271
00:29:52.970 --> 00:30:00.440
P2: just to throw caution, I I perhaps with my curiosity, I might go forward to see what

272
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:01.930
P2: I could do.

273
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:12.790
P2: But in the back of my mind I'm still hesitant, like, Wow, this is really not gonna go through. And I'm not, you know, I'm gonna have to do this all over again. And then that's where frustration and challenges come in.

274
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:20.220
Renata: Yeah, totally understandable. So for today, we're just gonna hit the hit, the continue button and sort of roll the dice.

275
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.386
P2: Right. We roll the dice.

276
00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:30.330
Renata: So on this page. What? What type of file is it asking you for.

277
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:37.960
P2: Okay, upload explanation of benefits for this claim from me. You'll need to submit a copy of the explanation

278
00:30:38.010 --> 00:31:07.129
P2: of benefits from your insurance provider. This is not the same as the summary of benefits for the health insurance policy, the explanation of benefits lists what your other health insurance already paid for this specific claim. The explanation of benefits must include all the information, the date of service that matches the date of care, the health care provider's name, 10 digit Npi. The National Provider

279
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.359
P2: identifier code.

280
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:18.140
P2: The services, the insurance provider paid for this make a 5 digit Cpt.

281
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:36.569
P2: The amount paid by the insurance provider. An explanation of benefits is usually sent by mail or email contact your insurance provider. If you have questions, you can also submit any other documents you think may be relevant to this claim how to upload. Okay, they're telling me how to upload

282
00:31:37.499 --> 00:31:50.979
P2: paper copy scans or, take a photo. What I'm getting from this since we put in another insurance. Is that what they're asking is.

283
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:58.849
P2: my 1st thoughts are okay. We're not gonna reimburse you for this whole thing. What did they

284
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:05.460
P2: provide? What does your other insurance pay for as well.

285
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:20.979
Renata: Got it. Okay? You can go ahead and scroll down the page, and where that button says, upload file. You can select the other file that we download the one that said sample hyphen eob parentheses. One.

286
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:21.820
P2: Oh!

287
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.670
Renata: Yeah, that second one there on the list.

288
00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:52.520
Renata: All right. One more question for you before, or 2 questions. Actually, I can't read my own notes before we keep going based on your experience with these supporting file uploads on the claim today, would you prefer having that file verification that's giving you that little pop up there, the yellow one or no file verification.

289
00:32:54.490 --> 00:33:00.199
P2: Prefer having it, because obviously there is some sort of issue

290
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:05.136
P2: I want to know upfront. But I kinda wanna know kind of what it is, too. But

291
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:16.399
P2: if we keep going forward and it didn't have it, and then at the end, you see it, it's more frustration like, Oh, my goodness, more challenges, I should say.

292
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:16.990
Renata: Okay.

293
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:28.230
Renata: alright. So yes, to file verification. But we want to see some more information in that yellow box to tell us like what's going on and how to fix the problem. So we don't have frustration.

294
00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.888
P2: Yes, I mean a little little something as to.

295
00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:39.760
Renata: What is there to come. But as my curiosity would go, I'm gonna click. Continue to see, you know.

296
00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:41.984
P2: They'll tell me I don't know.

297
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:52.820
Renata: All right. One more question for you here on a scale of one to 5, with one being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to upload files to support your CHAMPVA Claim.

298
00:33:53.407 --> 00:33:55.702
P2: I would say, it's just it's it's

299
00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:57.480
P2: It's easy.

300
00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.719
P2: But I just have to remember what this file, you know.

301
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.039
Renata: 5 was very easy.

302
00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.820
P2: Yeah, I would say about a 4.

303
00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:07.690
Renata: Okay.

304
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:19.450
P2: You know I you just have to make sure that wherever you put your file you remember what that is, the name of it, you know, so that you could find it.

305
00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.680
Renata: Yeah, for sure. At this point you can go ahead and click, continue.

306
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:25.909
P2: Okay.

307
00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:40.790
Renata: So like, I said, we're not submitting the form today. So this is the last screen we're going to look at for this initial claim. Just go ahead and review your claim, but don't hit the submit button, and then I'll move us on to our next task.

308
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.610
P2: Okay, may I click the buttons where it's plus.

309
00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:47.870
Renata: Go right ahead. Yeah. Just don't click the button at the bottom that says, Submit claim.

310
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:50.400
P2: Okay, alrighty.

311
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.520
P2: Because for me, once I get to this page

312
00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:00.650
P2: I would click the buttons. You know this to make sure.

313
00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:04.490
P2: That I put in all the right information.

314
00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.620
Renata: Totally get it.

315
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:16.010
P2: Just to make sure. So there's no surprises, you know, like, Oh, man, I forgot to where I put my wrong address, or things like that.

316
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:36.129
P2: 2, we're going to jail.

317
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.140
P2: Yep, do something bad and

318
00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:54.030
P2: confirm that the identity information in this form is accurate has been represented directly unacceptable. So

319
00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:58.010
P2: open a new tab, may I.

320
00:35:59.335 --> 00:35:59.870
Renata: What.

321
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:06.270
P2: Where it says, I have read and accept the privacy policy open in a new tab.

322
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:11.398
Renata: Oh, we're not gonna click on that today. I don't think it'll open if you click on it. But

323
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:13.660
P2: All right.

324
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:25.650
Renata: So one last question for you about this form, that one to 5 scale again, one being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the the Chamfa claim form.

325
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.500
P2: I would say it was about a 4.

326
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:34.039
Renata: Okay? A. 4. And what would take it from a 4 to that? 5. Meaning very easy.

327
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:41.670
P2: Just knowing like like that box the you know some.

328
00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.769
P2: What was that? The box that we talked about.

329
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.270
Renata: Oh, the the verification Box.

330
00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:55.209
P2: Yes, that's really about it. Everything else was like pretty much. It was very straightforward.

331
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:59.649
P2: you know. You just have to read it all. Make sure that you're reading it all.

332
00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:26.099
Renata: Okay, that is fair. So if you could go back to that other tab, the Google drive tab that I gave you, I think I saw it in your browser. If you can go back over there. I have one other file. I want you to look at. Yeah, click on that. If you click the X in the top left hand corner it'll close you out of that preview. Please click on the second file in that list. It says example. Champ, va. Send back letter.

333
00:37:27.087 --> 00:37:30.689
P2: And I just wanted to know to you real quick that

334
00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.809
P2: did see a phone number at the bottom

335
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:41.389
P2: that you can contact if you need help or anything with CHAMPVA. So I need that number. I was like, I was gonna talk.

336
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.950
Renata: Yes.

337
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.993
P2: I could call them and say, I need my card, please.

338
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:46.280
P2: Yes.

339
00:37:47.110 --> 00:38:02.430
Renata: Got it. Okay? So for this task, I'd like you to imagine that you received this letter in the mail from CHAMPVA. Regarding a previous claim that you filed. Please just read through the letter carefully, and let me know when you're done reading. I have a few questions for you.

340
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:07.520
P2: I mean, if you all don't mind kind of read out loud sometimes it's more.

341
00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.110
Renata: Go right ahead. I will not judge. I do it all the time.

342
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:10.590
P2: Okay.

343
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:32.499
P2: in this fresh screen we are returning the enclosed claim for the reasons listed below. If there were claims in your initial submission that are not enclosed. Those claims are still being processed. You may resubmit the enclosed claims. Please include the attached paperwork.

344
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:50.519
P2: the requested information below, and a copy of this letter. With your resubmission, please send your submission to office of integrated care CHAMPVA Po. Box 500 Spring City, Pennsylvania, 1, 9, 4, 7, 5 for questions, please.

345
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.080
P2: 7, 3, 8, 3.

346
00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.310
P2: Okay. The missing diagnostic code

347
00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:16.690
P2: is it is your responsibility to provide supporting evidence for your claim. If you do not have the requested documentation and need assistance obtaining it. Please check the box below and return a copy of this letter with

348
00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:22.630
P2: the content information of a person who possesses the necessary information. Okay?

349
00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.030
Renata: All right. All done. Reading.

350
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:28.950
P2: Yes, ma'am.

351
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:35.709
Renata: Okay. So in your own words, what is the purpose of this letter that CHAMPVA mailed to you.

352
00:39:36.446 --> 00:39:44.369
P2: The purpose of this letter. What I am gathering is that the code was not submitted.

353
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:48.440
P2: that the missing diagnosis code.

354
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:49.950
Renata: Okay.

355
00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:56.980
Renata: so what would you need to do to resolve this claim that they're sending you a letter about.

356
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:07.450
P2: I would have to send them for me. It seems like they're asking for one sec.

357
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.610
P2: You have to resubmit it.

358
00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:24.000
P2: but make that you have that code on. So in the beginning, it says, are you submitting a new claim, or for

359
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:36.110
P2: a claim that's pre-existing? So I probably would click that button pre-existing claim, and then add all the information. Once I get it from the doctor, or you know.

360
00:40:37.041 --> 00:40:39.080
Renata: In the online form that you just.

361
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:50.700
P2: When you 1st start out, remember when it said, You know, is it a new claim, or is it, you know, for previous claim that you already submitted. I probably click that button.

362
00:40:51.250 --> 00:41:02.599
Renata: Okay, so this letter doesn't say that you can submit the form online. Would you want it to indicate? Like, Hey, you could do this online. You don't have to send it snail mail to that Po box.

363
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.940
P2: Yes, I think that should be an option.

364
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.220
Renata: Okay.

365
00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:36.907
P2: Everything from the beginning was an option and snail mail. We don't know, you know, that they receive it, because, trust me, I have done. You know I was submitting for to get my records my dad died in war, so I had to submit to get records, and I didn't know if they got it or not. So my husband said, You know what we're sending priority, but we're gonna send where they have to sign for pay extra money. And you know things like that. So

366
00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:57.090
P2: that would be great, you know, to contact them. You know, via online, it could be an option. Because who knows? Who has CHAMPVA, who is older, who, you know, doesn't know the ins and outs nuances and of submitting it online so they could do snail mail. But

367
00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:01.199
P2: question is because I know a lot of older veterans, and they do not

368
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:09.019
P2: do this online stuff. I help them. But what do they do

369
00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:18.079
P2: when they have this online thing that I have to do it online to submit it? Or could you submit it by snail mail from the beginning?

370
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.365
Renata: Hmm!

371
00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:31.660
Renata: Great question. Would you want it to sort of provide both options and the steps for each, so that folks can choose which one they're more comfortable with, like, what would this look like in an ideal world?

372
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:45.230
P2: In an ideal world. I mean, a lot of people are tech, savvy? But we have to always keep in mind that we do have some people that aren't tech savvy, that are older? Or

373
00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:50.159
P2: maybe they're not older, you know, I'm not gonna just put it on older people. But

374
00:42:50.260 --> 00:43:02.040
P2: in my experience. A lot of the older veterans. Oh, forget about it! I can't do that. Forget about, you know, and they get very frustrated because they don't know so.

375
00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:02.660
Renata: Yeah.

376
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:05.969
P2: I would think, in all fairness

377
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:26.220
P2: to have the ability to have both, so that the tech, savvy ones, could, you know, go through it, and the ones that aren't, you know that are, you know, more accustomed to writing out the letter, and you know, and sending it in that could be an option as well. So we're catering to both.

378
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:38.559
Renata: Okay, I have 2 more questions for you here on a scale of one to 5, 1 being poorly 5 being very well. How well does this letter explain what you need to do to resolve the problem with your CHAMPVA. Claim?

379
00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.740
P2: I think that it would be a 5 and

380
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:52.090
P2: I like to the fact that at the bottom you have a check, and I do not have a requested documentation and require assistance to attain it.

381
00:43:53.560 --> 00:44:03.679
P2: it says, please do not check this box if you are returning, requested document. Okay, so. But my question is, what happens when you check that box?

382
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.089
P2: How will it get resolved.

383
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:24.299
P2: you know. Will the CHAMPVA take over and call that, doctor, or you know the place that you went to, and try to get that information? Or are they going to send you back another letter and say you need this information in order to get reimbursed.

384
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:33.339
Renata: Got it. So some more information about what that means when you check the box would be helpful. Okay, one more. Oh, go ahead.

385
00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:43.759
P2: No, I was saying that I would say so. I I think because you don't know, is it just okay? Well, you'll just be denied. And I'm gonna send you another letter

386
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:50.309
P2: stating that you were denied because you didn't provide this information.

387
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:55.309
P2: What does it entail when I check this box.

388
00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:10.400
Renata: Got it. Got it? Thank you for that feedback. Next question. Honest, that one to 5 scale again, one being poorly 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel to resolve this claim, based on the content in the letter.

389
00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:26.597
P2: To resolve it in the moment or resolve it. Okay, I get this letter. I'm gonna put it, you know, aside as I'm calling the doctor to get all this information.

390
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:29.560
P2: I would say.

391
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:40.859
P2: that's that's a tricky one. I mean, it is self explanatory, of course, but if I didn't have the information when I send it in.

392
00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:53.520
P2: I might not have it right then and there. I would need a moment to contact the doctor, or you know someone to help me. But good thing is, they're showing me exactly

393
00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.529
P2: what I missed.

394
00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:01.220
Renata: Okay. So if you had to pin it to a number on that scale, what what would you give it.

395
00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.830
P2: And the question is, how.

396
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:09.539
Renata: Prepared you feel, to resolve this, based on what the letter is is telling you.

397
00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:38.248
P2: I would say a 4 it is preparing me to get all these things, but if I didn't have it from the beginning, I might not have it when I get this letter, you know I would have to get it and call the doctor, or you know, if it wasn't on any of the receipts. The itemized statements. Obviously, I have to call the institution that I went to to kind of say, Hey, can I get another copy, you know of that, and they are

398
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:46.930
P2: requiring you know, Xyz, the missing diagnosis code for it. Can you please make sure that it's on there.

399
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:57.449
Renata: Got it. I wanna make a quick time check. We're at 10 min to the end of our session. Would you have a couple of minutes to stay over, or do you have a hard stop at at.

400
00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.750
P2: I'm open right. I have this.

401
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:00.300
Renata: Okay.

402
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:06.050
P2: And I thank you all for believing in me. And I wanna you know, listen to my feedback.

403
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:16.110
Renata: Yeah, of course. Yeah, we won't. We won't keep you much longer, but I have one more link in the zoom chat. I just posted it. If you could go ahead and open that link.

404
00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.970
P2: Okay.

405
00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:25.780
Renata: It's that 3rd one in the chat.

406
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:26.530
P2: Is that it?

407
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:27.420
P2: Oh, no!

408
00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.629
P2: Is that it? Or.

409
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:35.540
Renata: Yeah, that's it. Should look. It happened.

410
00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:39.100
P2: The staging.

411
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:46.070
Renata: Yeah, the staging one. It's gonna be exactly the same as the 1st one that we looked at. But we're just gonna start over again.

412
00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.160
P2: Okay. I was like, wait a minute. I saw.

413
00:47:51.160 --> 00:48:02.809
Renata: I know it's it's deja vu. So we're looking at the claims form that we already looked at. But looking at this page again, do you think you're in the right place to resubmit a claim based on that letter? You looked at.

414
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:19.137
P2: If you want to file a claim within a year, you state.

415
00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:24.120
P2: I don't know.

416
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:28.970
P2: It just says file a Va. Claim.

417
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:30.900
Renata: Thing about the resubmission.

418
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.410
P2: No.

419
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:34.000
Renata: Okay.

420
00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:35.755
Renata: Alright!

421
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:42.550
P2: It doesn't pop out to me until maybe I maybe click into something and maybe but

422
00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:49.510
P2: maybe perhaps they could put on there somewhere. Resubmission claim as well.

423
00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:55.730
Renata: Okay, and what information do you think you're going to need to resubmit your claim?

424
00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:05.289
P2: I don't know that once we submit the claim, would they give me a

425
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:08.969
P2: like a code or something, you know.

426
00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:19.440
P2: and I have that. And I could just put that code in. But I'm sure that I'm gonna have to have my name address, and you know all that stuff.

427
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:29.589
Renata: Okay, got it. So you can scroll back down the page again. And at the bottom of that blue box there's going to be that link that says start without signing in. You can click that again.

428
00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:31.100
P2: Okay.

429
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:42.969
Renata: So we're going to go through the form this time as if you're resubmitting that claim you received a letter, for again, you can use fake information, and just think out loud as you go, and I'll stop you when we have some questions.

430
00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:47.250
P2: Okay, which of the following describes me, great.

431
00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:53.439
P2: Did you receive a champion? Do you receive? Yes.

432
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:59.420
P2: okay, Bam, that's where I remember seeing that right there.

433
00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:00.010
Renata: Okay.

434
00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:02.440
P2: Shall I go forward?

435
00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.849
Renata: Go ahead and and go forward.

436
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:14.330
P2: Okay your claim identification number to identify the original claim. That's the number I was talking about.

437
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:15.569
P2: Go ahead.

438
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:22.430
P2: I would have had to have written that down somewhere, or

439
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.440
P2: yeah, or was it in that form?

440
00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:32.658
P2: Remember that form where they sent they sent me, and you don't have

441
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:34.570
Renata: In the letter.

442
00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:36.100
P2: Yeah. Was it in the letter.

443
00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:41.310
Renata: Do you want to check the letter? You have the the letter still open in the other tab. We can check it.

444
00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.690
P2: Is that the Pdi number? Let's see.

445
00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.869
P2: Yup, that's it.

446
00:50:55.160 --> 00:51:05.763
Renata: Alright. So you don't need to enter the actual number in here. You can copy and paste it. I can provide it to you, or you can just put in a random string of numbers.

447
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:10.789
P2: You say, is it this whole whole number, this big? Oh, no, I can't do it. I cannot.

448
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:20.830
Renata: Oh, I'll be annoying before we go back out. Do you think it's that whole string, including the date, or or is it just a part of it. What would your assumption be?

449
00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:28.009
P2: Oh, man, what did I do? I closed it. Which one was it? Was it December?

450
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:31.340
Renata: Example. Champ, Va, example, that one. Yeah.

451
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:33.640
P2: The okay?

452
00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:36.189
P2: No, I think it's the Cm.

453
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:37.760
Renata: Okay.

454
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:46.459
Renata: got it? Well, at this point, like I said, you can put in just a random string in the form just to keep you moving along. But we just wanted to ask about that.

455
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:56.140
P2: And continue.

456
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:57.910
Renata: Continue. Yes.

457
00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.190
P2: Okay. Medical claim.

458
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:03.639
Renata: Medical claim. Yep.

459
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:07.859
P2: Damn okay. Here we go.

460
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:12.160
P2: Shall I put this provider information and all that.

461
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.950
Renata: Yes, please, yeah. And you can just make something up.

462
00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:19.720
P2: Dr. Me.

463
00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.430
P2: good!

464
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:32.616
P2: This is.

465
00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:14.780
P2: you'll need to submit these documents, copy of documents, and missing information that we requested in the letter mailed to you and all documents you submitted with your claim. These documents could include paperwork attached to your

466
00:53:15.788 --> 00:53:20.329
P2: prescription or pharmacy statement, how to upload

467
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.180
P2: okay.

468
00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.929
Renata: All right. So what are you being asked to upload on this page?

469
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:35.400
P2: I am being asked to upload whatever was missing on that that told me in the letter.

470
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:47.019
Renata: Okay, got it? So at this point we can just upload those 2 files that you are already downloaded. The sample billing statement and sample eob parentheses. One.

471
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:58.359
P2: Oh, how do I do this again?

472
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.770
P2: And then upload another one.

473
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.290
Renata: Yeah. Upload the other one for me. Please.

474
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:18.030
P2: Okay.

475
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:39.870
Renata: Alright, since we already saw that verification message, we can just continue at this point.

476
00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:46.149
P2: So this would be my husband.

477
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:47.260
Renata: Okay.

478
00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:47.935
P2: Right.

479
00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:52.549
Renata: Is that what you assume, based on what you're seeing on the the screen.

480
00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:58.599
P2: Officer's name enter the information for the sponsor. This is the veteran or servicemen member that you're connected to.

481
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:02.949
P2: so it will be my husband.

482
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.120
Renata: Okay.

483
00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.657
P2: That I'm assuming

484
00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:13.870
P2: I do all this stuff like they always ask me like for school like, who is the sponsor? And things like that?

485
00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:17.550
P2: Let's see.

486
00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:26.584
P2: Enter. Okay, now they're asking me for my information.

487
00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:37.100
Renata: And for your last name, let's see if it takes it with a space between your your 2 last names instead of a hyphen.

488
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:40.330
P2: Oh, a space. Okay.

489
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.610
P2: okay.

490
00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:10.740
P2: should I continue?

491
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.040
Renata: Yes, please.

492
00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:20.530
P2: Okay, move you over states.

493
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:54.480
P2: has your mailing address change no phone number.

494
00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:33.530
Renata: All right. So this is the last screen that we're going to look at today. Would you do anything differently on this page, knowing that this is a resubmission.

495
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:41.339
P2: No, I would still look in here to see whether or not you know, if everything is everything.

496
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:42.270
Renata: Okay.

497
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:46.180
P2: I would still do that in my mind. That's just how I do.

498
00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:52.129
Renata: Got it, and without clicking anything. If you submitted this form today, what would you expect to happen next?

499
00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:59.099
P2: I would expect to have an email confirmation, perhaps

500
00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:02.549
P2: that, you know, must admit it. They're working on it.

501
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:09.060
P2: and I probably would expect another letter.

502
00:58:11.116 --> 00:58:14.860
P2: either in the mail or something email stating that

503
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:20.060
P2: we have all the information that we need. We're going to move forward with it or we don't.

504
00:58:20.815 --> 00:58:23.389
P2: You need to submit more.

505
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:29.200
Renata: Okay? And what would you expect in terms of processing time for this resubmission?

506
00:58:29.736 --> 00:58:36.790
P2: Oh, my! We're talking Va, because I've done ba.gov ask?

507
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:43.049
P2: It's taken 30 days, maybe 30 days or less. How about that?

508
00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:50.350
Renata: 30 days or less. Okay? And would you expect the same processing time for an initial claim? So 30 days when you did that initial form.

509
00:58:50.350 --> 00:58:51.790
P2: More than likely.

510
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:52.795
Renata: Okay, got it?

511
00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:54.720
P2: Down there, you know.

512
00:58:55.023 --> 00:59:08.389
Renata: So a couple more questions for you here on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to provide the information related to your previous CHAMPVA claim on that upload page.

513
00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:09.610
P2: 5.

514
00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:21.229
Renata: 5. Very easy. All right. One more scale question, one to 5, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the resubmission form.

515
00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.859
P2: Difficult. It wasn't difficult.

516
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:30.520
Renata: Okay? So would you consider it? a a 5 very easy or 4 just easy.

517
00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.450
P2: I would say about a 5.

518
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:40.659
Renata: Okay. And how would you compare the 2 forms you submitted today, the 1st one being that initial form, and the second one being the resubmission.

519
00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.860
P2: I know what to expect.

520
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.260
Renata: You know what to expect. Okay, got it?

521
00:59:46.955 --> 00:59:53.190
Renata: So we're done looking at all of this stuff today. So you can stop sharing your screen. I just have a couple more questions for you to wrap up.

522
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:56.200
P2: Okay.

523
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:58.969
Renata: Oh, right.

524
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:03.879
Renata: So overall. Was there anything you saw in the session today that worked really well for you?

525
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:16.372
P2: It all worked pretty well for me, you know. Self explanatory.

526
01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.967
P2: It wasn't a whole bunch, you know things, I mean

527
01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:30.402
P2: what was a little bit hard with the codes, you know, moving forward, and since I'm able to go through this

528
01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:42.940
P2: you know this this session with you all. I know. Now, if there's anything, make sure you have that code on there to the doctor.

529
01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:49.320
Renata: Got it. Was there anything, unclear, or that didn't work well for you that you saw in today's session?

530
01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.930
P2: I wouldn't say so. I mean no.

531
01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:55.990
Renata: Okay.

532
01:00:56.490 --> 01:01:01.809
P2: Okay, see? To kind of maybe an estimated time frame.

533
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:04.029
Renata: Oh, for processing!

534
01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:05.440
P2: Yeah, okay.

535
01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:13.770
Renata: Got it. Got it good to know what are your thoughts about the amount of information you saw in the form? Not enough too much, just right.

536
01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:26.599
P2: I thought it was just right, because in any of the forms that I do from educational benefits there, there is a lot, you know. I mean, they have to know who you are, who you're connected to.

537
01:01:27.339 --> 01:01:33.089
P2: So those things for me. It wasn't that hard because I'm used to it already.

538
01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:42.559
Renata: Got it. And how would you compare the online forms that you just looked at with your previous experience of filing CHAMPVA claims.

539
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:45.409
P2: I think it's good.

540
01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:57.279
P2: you know. Really, do I think it's good. And you know, it's a it's a way to kind of connect. It seems like, okay, it's a fast way to connect straight to them. Okay, here it is.

541
01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.640
Renata: Got it any questions for me at this point.

542
01:02:02.092 --> 01:02:09.550
P2: No, I'm just going to look up the Chan number and call them today and get my identification card.

543
01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:11.981
Renata: There you go, all right.

544
01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.290
P2: Now, is there a way for me to do this online.

545
01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.489
Renata: Not. Yet. Would you like the ability to do this online.

546
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:30.505
P2: That would be great, and when they give me the card I can't remember. Is it laminated? I can I get it laminated, or you know whatever, because I have to have my card.

547
01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:41.440
Renata: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Thank you for that feedback so at this point I just wanted to circle back and reconfirm. You're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of our session with our Va. Partners.

548
01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:46.020
P2: Sure, even though I look like a geek on film. But okay.

549
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.636
Renata: Well, we blur, we blur your on screen image out.

550
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:55.839
Renata: But is there any part of our discussion today? You would not want shared in a video clip.

551
01:02:56.969 --> 01:03:00.000
P2: No, ma'am, I mean, I'm very transparent and

552
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:08.663
P2: you know I just call it like I see it. I I appreciate, you know, being one of those test samples. And you know, with

553
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:21.219
