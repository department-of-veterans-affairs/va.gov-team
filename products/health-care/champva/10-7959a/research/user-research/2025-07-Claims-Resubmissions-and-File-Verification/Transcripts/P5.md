00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:09.800
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.710
P5: Yes.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:20.440
Renata: Alright. Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners? If we remove any information that can be used to identify you.

4
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.380
P5: Yes.

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:32.570
Renata: All right. Thank you. With that before we look at that demo tool I mentioned before, just some warm up questions. Are you or anyone else in your household currently enrolled in the CHAMPVA program.

6
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.580
P5: I am.

7
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.289
Renata: You are just just you or anyone else in the household.

8
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.890
P5: Just me!

9
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.110
Renata: Okay, how recently did you apply to enroll in the CHAMPVA program?

10
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:50.159
P5: I applied February of 20,

11
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.500
P5: 3, or 24 February of 23, I think.

12
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.529
Renata: Okay. So a year or 2 ago.

13
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.260
P5: Yeah.

14
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.480
Renata: Got it. What was your application experience like? If you can recall.

15
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.026
P5: Terrible 1st of all, it was, you know,

16
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.187
P5: a pdf, that that part was okay. But then you had to fax it.

17
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:32.350
P5: I'm computer savvy. I've been in the tech industry for 35 years. So but I had, you know, to fax it in. And then, you know, then they you had to make sure you had all the right forms. All this stuff.

18
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:45.529
P5: a lot of hoops and to to fax all this stuff in, and as a matter of fact, I think I was missing a form, and then I had to fax it again, and

19
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.749
P5: then they managed to lose my application.

20
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:57.219
P5: And so I kept calling, calling, calling, and it wasn't until August or September

21
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.470
P5: before they had me refax. And they made an emergency decision because I had no insurance. I had lost my job.

22
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.079
P5: And so yeah, it was not good.

23
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:24.449
Renata: I am so sorry to hear that, but I really appreciate you sharing your experiences because it's the best way that we can share with our partners and make sure that this improves in the future. I just wanna repeat a couple of things back to make sure that I understand correctly.

24
00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:45.289
Renata: The Pdf form was fairly straightforward, but there was some confusion about everything that was needed. There was some send backs and resubmissions, and it sounds like there was almost 7 or 8 months when you were waiting between that initial application and actually getting a decision on your application, and your coverage had lapsed. In the meantime.

25
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:57.920
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. Thank you for letting me confirm. I just wanna make sure when we're when we're writing this out. We we know exactly. Have you ever submitted any medical or pharmacy claims to the CHAMPVA program?

26
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.050
P5: Me personally. No, because I didn't want to go through the hassle.

27
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:12.040
P5: but the billing part of it submitting through my doctors.

28
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.895
P5: That's a nightmare, but that's because the

29
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.590
P5: where I'm at advent health, they're always billing it backwards instead of CHAMPVA being secondary.

30
00:03:25.658 --> 00:03:27.200
Renata: That's that is very frustrating.

31
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:36.399
Renata: So you're you're just coordinating with your the billing offices with your medical providers to have them arrange that you're not doing any claims yourself. Okay?

32
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:46.070
P5: Yeah, I I didn't want to mess with it. I I probably could have gotten reimbursed for that out of pocket. But I was not gonna mess with it.

33
00:03:46.070 --> 00:04:07.899
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you for sharing so at this point, we're gonna look at that coded prototype I mentioned earlier. And I'm gonna have you share your screen while we're doing that so just gonna give you a heads up. Now to close any additional applications. You have open silence notifications, and let me know when you're ready for the link. I'll drop it in the zoom chat, and we'll go from there.

34
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.970
P5: I'm ready.

35
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.749
Renata: Alright, and if you have any issues with sharing your screen and zoom, let me know I can help troubleshoot that.

36
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.389
P5: Alright. Can you guys see it?

37
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.269
Renata: Can't see it yet. Oh, it's loading, it's loading.

38
00:04:46.360 --> 00:05:06.339
Renata: There we go, perfect. Okay? So before we start filling this form out, just a few things to be aware of. Like I mentioned before, this is a testing site, and we're not actually going to be submitting the form today. So nothing we click on in the form will have any bearing on your benefits as you're going through the form, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers.

39
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:24.900
Renata: There's going to be some screens in this form where you're going to be asked to upload documents. As we're not submitting the form. Nothing you upload here will be sent to Va. But you should have received an email from Shannon at Perigan that had some documents attached to have prepared. Did you receive an email with those documents?

40
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.129
P5: Yes, I have those up, too.

41
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:43.380
Renata: Okay, perfect. We don't need them quite yet, and I'll remind you I'll remind you of which we need to upload when we get there, but I just wanted to double check. So on this page you can scroll up and down, but without clicking on anything yet. Just review the information on this page, and let me know your initial thoughts.

42
00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:50.012
P5: Pretty straightforward. You know how to file a claim

43
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.880
P5: telling you what to know before you file it.

44
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.660
P5: and then, you know very clearly start the form. There.

45
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.485
Renata: Okay?

46
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.379
Renata: So a few questions for you on this page, in your own words, what type of form is this page describing.

47
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:20.910
P5: That I'm not sure. So, knowing how the Va. Has been, it's more than likely a Pdf form, but it'd be nice if they started using online forms.

48
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.800
Renata: Got it

49
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.579
Renata: and based on the content on this page. What types of claims can you file with this form.

50
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.950
P5: Well, it just says CHAMPVA. So I'm assuming it would be your medical and pharmacy.

51
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.670
Renata: Okay?

52
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.959
Renata: And what information do you think you're going to need to fill out this form.

53
00:06:43.597 --> 00:06:55.479
P5: Probably your bills, or whatever you paid. Let me see here says here it's been within the last year. Each claim needs its own form.

54
00:06:56.524 --> 00:07:13.720
P5: Let's see here, each beneficiary has to do their own. Each claim. Then your supporting documents where your eob or your billing statement and then any receipts, pharmacy, receipt.

55
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:25.399
Renata: Okay? And if you were on va.gov, filling this out for real today, would you have that information on hand, or would you need to pause and go collect any receipts, billing documents.

56
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:32.589
P5: Because I'm a i'm an organized person. So everything I have I have scanned in and saved off.

57
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.189
Renata: Okay, alright. So you are ready if you.

58
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:50.129
Renata: this page today got it all right. One last question for you about this page on a scale of one to 5 with one being poorly and 5 being very well. How prepared do you feel to file a claim based on the pages? Content? You see here.

59
00:07:50.893 --> 00:07:55.980
P5: Me personally. So I guess. What is it? 5 is very.

60
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.930
Renata: Yeah.

61
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.350
P5: Yeah. So the 5.

62
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.360
Renata: Okay.

63
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:07.350
Renata: alright. Sounds good at this point. I'd like you to click that small link that says, Start your form without signing in at the bottom of that big blue box.

64
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.900
P5: Okay, so start the form or the one without signing in. I can do either way.

65
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:32.770
Renata: Without signing in. We're not going to sign in today. So at this point, I'm going to have you fill out the form as if you're submitting a new medical claim for yourself, just a few things to keep in mind, though again, it's a testing site, you can use fake information, and if you could, please think out loud as you're going through the form, we want to know any reactions you're.

66
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:38.320
P5: So it says, which best describes you. I'm clicking on the beneficiary, submitting claim for myself.

67
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.139
P5: Do I receive CHAMPVA benefits? Yes.

68
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.920
P5: Is this a new claim or resubmission? New claim?

69
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:56.309
P5: And then sponsors name a veteran service member. So that would be my husband.

70
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.770
P5: and then my information

71
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.080
P5: and my date of birth.

72
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.883
P5: my id

73
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.150
P5: and then mailing address

74
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.070
P5: and mailing address changed. No.

75
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.930
P5: And let's see here, phone number.

76
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.380
P5: email.

77
00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.940
P5: oh.

78
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:14.719
P5: and do I have health coverage that isn't through CHAMPVA for me. Yes, now, let's see, information policy

79
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.040
P5: is [Health insurance provider]

80
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.540
P5: I'll just make up a policy number because we're not submitting it right.

81
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.180
Renata: Yeah, yeah, this doesn't need to be real.

82
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.746
P5: If I was doing it I would have it all up.

83
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.750
Renata: Okay, got it?

84
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.920
P5: Alright employer sponsored.

85
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.250
P5: and any other health coverage. No

86
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.450
P5: type of claim I'm submitting is gonna be a medical care.

87
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.330
Renata: Yep.

88
00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:04.629
P5: And claim relationship to work work related. No car accident, no.

89
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.380
Renata: Right.

90
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.820
P5: Supporting the document upload, supporting documents.

91
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:17.389
Renata: Yeah. So I'm gonna pause you on this page just have you review the information on the screen before we get to uploading. And I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions.

92
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.520
P5: All right.

93
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:35.869
P5: says, make sure it's got my full name. Date of birth. Got providers name, title, address, Npi. Their tax Id. The charges data service.

94
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.040
P5: the Dx codes and the procedure codes.

95
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.510
Renata: All right.

96
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.169
P5: And then says how to upload.

97
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.620
P5: And let's see here, alright, let's bring that up.

98
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.079
P5: So you actually want me to upload these right.

99
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:11.080
Renata: Yeah, I have a couple of questions for you before we get to the upload. But if you want to get those downloaded and like saved and ready to go. That's totally fine.

100
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.910
P5: Yeah. And then let me save the other one.

101
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.070
P5: Oops.

102
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.130
P5: Okay?

103
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:39.230
Renata: Awesome. Alright if you can go back to the form in your browser. So questions for you here. What documentation are you being asked for on this page.

104
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.579
P5: Basically, they're asking for my medical bill.

105
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:49.069
Renata: Okay, and do you understand what needs to be included on that medical bill document?

106
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:57.790
P5: I do because I've had to do this before, not CHAMPVA, but for other stuff. So yes, I understand it.

107
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:05.130
Renata: Okay, anything in that list of items that needs to be included that you're not familiar with or haven't seen before.

108
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.150
P5: No.

109
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:06.800
Renata: Okay.

110
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.230
P5: Not.

111
00:13:07.675 --> 00:13:14.800
Renata: Okay, at this point you can upload the document that is titled sample billing statement. Here.

112
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.640
P5: Okay.

113
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.920
P5: Anyway.

114
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.569
Renata: Let me see which ones which I'm interested.

115
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:33.910
P5: Not sure which one was which the billing statement medical supply.

116
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.800
P5: So the medical supplies one, I think right. That's.

117
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.899
Renata: Yeah, yeah.

118
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.060
P5: So that's this, one should be.

119
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:58.279
Renata: Alright. So I want to draw your attention to that little yellow box that's down below the the button that says, Submit another file. What do you think this error message means?

120
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:16.649
P5: We cannot complete verification of this file. You can retry verification or continue without verifying. So I don't know if they couldn't read the file. I mean it's a Pdf. And that it should. Take it, as they say they take Pdfs.

121
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.890
P5: But they're saying they just couldn't verify, probably because of the name.

122
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:27.920
Renata: Okay, so what would? What steps would you take to resolve this at this point.

123
00:14:28.531 --> 00:14:35.260
P5: For me, I would probably turn around and go in here

124
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.810
P5: and rename it.

125
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.620
Renata: Okay.

126
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:47.769
P5: I would do is rename it to the itemized. Let's see, what was it called?

127
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.470
P5: Msi.

128
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.930
P5: Let's wise.

129
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.364
P5: let's see. And then what was the other one called just

130
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:20.759
P5: alright. So now I've renamed it. So let's see if that does any good.

131
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.749
P5: and I'm gonna delete the file

132
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.179
P5: and see if it helps to.

133
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.372
P5: Yeah. So at this point I would say, I don't know what the problem is.

134
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:50.600
Renata: Okay, would you continue with the form? Would you stop here? Call the VA? What would you do at this point?

135
00:15:51.043 --> 00:16:06.560
P5: I would probably call because I go. You know it's it's given me a warning that it couldn't verify the file. And yet it's in the form. What's the size? Aha! 20 mill!

136
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.549
P5: So that would be the other thing. But then.

137
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.169
P5: again, I know how to look and see the size of the file.

138
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:21.090
P5: and it is oh, no, it's not that big.

139
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:29.119
P5: Oh, wait a minute. What does this say? Oh, 20, Meg so files too big.

140
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:43.409
Renata: Okay? So at this point, is there any additional information that you would want in that error? Message to sort of tell you what to do to resolve the problem, or or is it enough information? There.

141
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.740
P5: No, there's not enough information. They should tell you the files too big.

142
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.499
Renata: Okay, got it?

143
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:54.819
P5: And I'm computer savvy? So I know how to go and look and see the size of the file.

144
00:16:55.550 --> 00:17:02.150
P5: But someone else may not. I also know how to compress a file, but it's still not, may not compress it down enough.

145
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:10.079
Renata: Okay, got it? At this point. Because this is our testing site. We can hit that continue button. So I'm gonna have you continue with the form.

146
00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:10.519
P5: Okay.

147
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.060
Renata: And what is this page asking you to upload.

148
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:30.760
P5: They're asking you to upload the eob. The explanation of benefits. And then, you know, make sure it has the data service on it got the provider name 10 digit PIN,

149
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.800
P5: So on the elb. Let's see here.

150
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.460
P5: So that's got.

151
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.860
P5: That's a subscriber name data service.

152
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.559
Renata: Are you looking at both at the.

153
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.009
P5: Yeah, I'm looking at the actual.

154
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.430
Renata: Okay.

155
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.200
P5: It'll be to make sure it's got everything on it.

156
00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.109
P5: Claim number.

157
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:10.600
P5: I don't know that the EOB is not gonna have that information on it that they're asking for.

158
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.215
Renata: Okay. So some of what they're asking for here, you're not.

159
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.340
P5: Yeah, that's never happened to be on an eob.

160
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:32.130
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you for that feedback. At this point we could just upload that sample eob file. It's but we're we're like Disney imagineers. Here we made that sample eob it's not a real document.

161
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.950
P5: All right.

162
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.889
P5: Yeah. And again, it's probably too big.

163
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:55.129
Renata: Okay, got it. So one a couple of questions for you here before we keep going with the form based on your experience uploading these supporting files to your claim today? Would you prefer that file verification? You're seeing or no file verification in the form.

164
00:18:56.535 --> 00:19:04.410
P5: It. No, I like the file verification. Just if it's if there's something wrong, they need to give you more information.

165
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.400
Renata: Okay, got it. So a little bit more detail there. But it's helpful to have that in the in the

166
00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:11.030
Renata: yeah.

167
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:20.849
Renata: okay, on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to upload files to support your CHAMPVA. Claim.

168
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.769
P5: Easy to upload.

169
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:34.519
P5: Not so. And maybe here's another recommendation is, you know, make the file size bigger.

170
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.550
Renata: Okay.

171
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:45.569
Renata: got it. So if I had to PIN you to a number on that one to 5 scale, where? Where would it land given given everything that you've said so far.

172
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:52.960
P5: Well, I mean to me there's 2 parts to that question. Uploading. It was simple. That would be a 5.

173
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.250
Renata: Okay.

174
00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:00.304
P5: But the fact that it's rejecting it would be a 1.

175
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:07.590
Renata: Oh, one. Okay, got it. Thank you for giving me both numbers for that. So you can go ahead and click continue

176
00:20:09.032 --> 00:20:20.179
Renata: and like, I said, we're not actually going to be submitting this form today. So this is the last screen we're going to see on this form. But please just review the claim that you just prepared, and then I'm going to ask you a couple of questions.

177
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:20.840
P5: Okay.

178
00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:32.910
P5: so it's got yep, everything I filled out. Yeah, it. It's a good thing to be able to review, just to make sure you answer the boxes. Right?

179
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:52.880
P5: And beneficiary address email, phone Umr and yeah medical provider.

180
00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:01.270
P5: And then your supporting documents and then sign pretty simple.

181
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:09.870
Renata: Oh, alright! So without clicking anything. But if you did click the submit form button down at the bottom there what would you expect to happen next.

182
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.670
P5: Well, I would expect that I would get a email confirmation.

183
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.050
P5: possibly a confirmation on this screen.

184
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:33.483
P5: maybe with a number and sometimes they'll, you know they'll give you that information. So I guess that's what I would expect next is, you know, thank you for submitting. Here's your claim number

185
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:40.290
P5: maybe even a print button. But then I would also expect an actual email confirmation.

186
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:46.820
Renata: Okay, got it, and how soon would you expect to be notified about a decision being made on your claim?

187
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.700
P5: Knowing how this works.

188
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.730
P5: 30 days.

189
00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:04.889
Renata: Okay, and I know you said that is, knowing how it works in an ideal world. Would it be faster or slower than 30 days.

190
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:15.439
P5: In an ideal world. If it's going in electronically, it should be I I wouldn't expect it to take more than 3 to 5 days.

191
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:23.679
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. And how would you expect to be notified about that decision on your claim by mail email text message?

192
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.010
P5: How do I prefer, or how.

193
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.239
Renata: Well, let's start with what you would expect, and then what you would prefer.

194
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.700
P5: What I expect is that they will mail it in the Us.

195
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.600
Renata: Alright, and is that your preference as well.

196
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.350
P5: No.

197
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.929
Renata: Okay, and what would be your preference here.

198
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:43.830
P5: Email.

199
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:52.500
Renata: Okay, got it. And if you could check the status of a claim before that decision got made, where would you want to find that claim status.

200
00:22:53.421 --> 00:22:59.388
P5: That would be wonderful to be able to go on here and do that, you know, to have

201
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:06.700
P5: you know, just a claim status button under the CHAMPVA. But right now there is none.

202
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.990
P5: I have to go through all my paper copies.

203
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:23.130
Renata: Okay. One last question here before we go on to our next task on that one to 5 scale again, one being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the Champa claim form.

204
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.630
P5: I would say easy. I I give it a 5.

205
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:38.010
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. So we are done. I keep your browser open, but I'm going to send you in the chat another link. That I'd like you to open up.

206
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:38.730
P5: Okay.

207
00:23:55.510 --> 00:24:13.929
Renata: All right. So I'm going to have you imagine that we did submit that claims form. It's been, let's say, 5 business days, and you've received this letter in the mail about your claim. Please just read through this letter, and then, when you're ready, let me know, and I'm going to ask you a few questions.

208
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:14.340
P5: Okay.

209
00:24:15.976 --> 00:24:25.480
P5: Reasons listed below. Yeah. They returned it. Resubmit submission

210
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.939
P5: questions, missing diagnosis code.

211
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:37.450
P5: Not have requested information. Require assistance. Okay?

212
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.209
Renata: All right. Have you ever received a letter like this in the mail from CHAMPVA.

213
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.490
P5: Me! No.

214
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.690
Renata: Okay?

215
00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:50.510
Renata: So in your own words, what's the purpose of this letter that you received.

216
00:24:51.378 --> 00:24:58.731
P5: The purposes is that they did not do the claim. They're saying it's missing the diagnosis code.

217
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:07.800
Renata: Okay, so what steps would you need to take to resolve your claim so that it can be processed.

218
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:14.139
P5: Probably call the provider and say, Hey, I need one that has a diagnosis code on it.

219
00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:22.519
Renata: Okay, and then, once the doctor gives you that that letter, that that bill, or whatever with the diagnosis code on it, what would you do next?

220
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.839
P5: Well, according to this, you have to physically send it, which is ridiculous.

221
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.639
P5: Do the.

222
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.320
Renata: Right.

223
00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:37.030
Renata: If there was an option to resubmit this online, would you prefer that over mail? What would be your preference.

224
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.190
P5: Absolutely.

225
00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.779
Renata: Okay, and if we could just

226
00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:49.669
Renata: change this letter right now, what instructions would you want to see? To let you know that there is an option to submit this online.

227
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.439
P5: Well where it says, you know.

228
00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:03.799
P5: you may resubmit the enclosed claim and then give both options, you know.

229
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.950
P5: online and give the ad. You know the URL,

230
00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:12.410
P5: or, you know, submitted by us. Postal.

231
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.519
P5: Got it, are you?

232
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.389
P5: In facts? I mean.

233
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.679
P5: you know that's kind of ridiculous, but you know. Maybe give the 3rd option of a fax.

234
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:36.950
Renata: Noted. Thank you for that. Just a couple more questions for you about this letter on a 1 to 5 scale, one being poorly 5 being very well. How well does this letter explain what you need to do to resolve the problem with your Champier claim?

235
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:45.250
P5: Me. Personally I understand it, but I happen to work in healthcare. It.

236
00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:46.680
Renata: Oh, okay.

237
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.583
P5: What up?

238
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.760
P5: That's kind of cheating.

239
00:26:51.902 --> 00:27:06.710
Renata: So that's that's totally fine. So on that one to 5 scale, you'd say 5. It's very. You understand it? Very well. Okay, same scale. But new question, how prepared do you feel to resolve this claim, based on the letters content.

240
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.859
P5: Me. Personally, I feel very prepared, so that'd be a 5.

241
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:40.150
Renata: Okay, got it? So you can leave this. This tab open in your browser. I'm going to add a 3rd link to the zoom chat that I'd like you to open. It's it's a link to the original form that we looked at, but we're starting the form over effectively. So on this page again, we've seen this page before. But just a few things to ask you before we click in and start working on it. Do you know, if you're in the right place to resubmit a claim based on what you're seeing here.

242
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.870
P5: No.

243
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.410
Renata: Because it looks like we're starting over

244
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:52.480
Renata: all right. And what would you need to see here, in order to know? Like I'm in the right place to resubmit a claim online to Champ, Va.

245
00:27:53.081 --> 00:28:01.020
P5: Where where it says, file a champion va claim, you can say, file a champion claim or resubmit.

246
00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.720
Renata: Okay?

247
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.840
Renata: And what information do you think you're going to need to resubmit your claim online?

248
00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.490
P5: Think you should have the. You know the original claim number.

249
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.310
P5: So was there something on this sheet.

250
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:30.609
P5: so they didn't give you any kind of a on that letter. They didn't give you

251
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:36.660
P5: a claim number. So that's not very helpful.

252
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.830
Renata: Okay, so we're thinking, number.

253
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:43.420
P5: Again. So basically to me, you're starting over.

254
00:28:43.610 --> 00:29:02.829
Renata: Okay. So in an ideal world, you'd wanna see a claim number on that form so that you could just pop that in and go. But alright. But at least what you're seeing here, it looks like you're gonna have to just do the whole process over again. Okay, got it? So go ahead and and scroll down again and click that link that says, start your form without signing in.

255
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:03.580
P5: Okay.

256
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:14.350
Renata: So at this point, we're going to resubmit the claim that you received a letter about from Champ again, we're not submitting this for real. You can use fake information and just think out loud as you go. Please.

257
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.739
P5: Do you want me to share again or no?

258
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.460
Renata: Share? What?

259
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.530
P5: You want me to share my screen again.

260
00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.869
Renata: Oh, no! We can see it.

261
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:30.819
P5: Oh, okay, alright. So alright beneficiary. Do I receive benefits? Yes.

262
00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.869
P5: All right, new claim or resubmission. So this would be a resubmission

263
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:47.839
P5: and claim number. Oh, okay, so they're calling in a Pdi number. So there is one on there.

264
00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.089
Renata: Okay? And you recognize Pdi from the letter.

265
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.139
Renata: Yeah. Okay.

266
00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.880
P5: Yeah, I did.

267
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:14.520
P5: Alright. Oh, so well, that's interesting. Copying and pasting is great. But then you gotta turn around and take out all the

268
00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:17.780
P5: characters.

269
00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.190
Renata: All right.

270
00:30:20.918 --> 00:30:30.170
P5: Oh, you don't need to include the date at the beginning 2 letters and all. Okay.

271
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:37.140
P5: Alright. And they did tell you where to find it. So that's good.

272
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:46.399
Renata: Alright. But at least when we were looking at the letter initially, that Pdi number didn't like jump out to you as like. This is the number I'm gonna need that clinic.

273
00:30:47.003 --> 00:30:48.209
P5: Yeah, yeah.

274
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.668
Renata: Got it. Thank you.

275
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.920
P5: Alright. So that's the claim number.

276
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.260
P5: And it was a medical claim.

277
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.520
P5: Yeah.

278
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.819
Renata: And we can just make up information here.

279
00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:07.039
P5: Okay, I'll just say, [Provider], that's what we use.

280
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:08.820
P5: Or I use.

281
00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.430
P5: Okay?

282
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:16.459
P5: Oh, I don't remember. We'll just call it January one

283
00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.880
P5: and end data service. January one.

284
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:27.890
P5: Alright.

285
00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:34.379
Renata: So on this page again, just review what the what it's asking you to upload. And I'm gonna ask you some questions again.

286
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:43.669
P5: Copies of documents with the missing information that they requested, and all documents you submitted with your claim.

287
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:52.289
P5: They want you to resubmit your original stuff, plus the new, with the codes on it.

288
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:53.570
Renata: Got it?

289
00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.219
Renata: How does? How? What's going through your mind right now, as you read that.

290
00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.889
P5: They're they're they're getting burdensome.

291
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:11.950
P5: You've already submitted the documents. You shouldn't have to resubmit them again. Just submit the new stuff.

292
00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:23.130
Renata: Alright. So in an ideal world. If we could redesign this, it would just be asking you for that document with the missing Dx codes, not the whole kitchen sink from the prior claim. Okay, got it. Thank you.

293
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:28.709
P5: That's the new letter you've gotten from the doctor's office. That's all that you should have to do.

294
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:39.979
Renata: Alright, so go ahead and you can upload either of the documents that I provided previously that you've downloaded on your computer. It doesn't really matter at this point which one you choose.

295
00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:42.840
P5: And.

296
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.350
Renata: And.

297
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:44.770
P5: Too big.

298
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.169
Renata: Yeah, this is our test system. So we might see that error message a little bit.

299
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:49.810
P5: Right.

300
00:32:49.810 --> 00:33:02.980
Renata: More frequently than you would in real life. One last question for you on this page, on that one to 5 scale again, one being very hard. 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to find and provide that information related to your previous CHAMPVA. Claim.

301
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:15.590
P5: The I guess I would give it a 5, because in theory I would already have the stuff to be able to. You know I'm not gonna resubmit until I have it. So.

302
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:24.269
Renata: Okay. Alright. But I think what I heard you say was like burdensome. There's there's effort to go collect the information from your medical provider. It's you know. You've got to then like.

303
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.940
P5: Well, yeah, that. Well,

304
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:44.810
P5: I would still say a 5 because they the doctor's office. I I have done that before. Where? I said, you guys need to have this information on the claim, you know, on the bill.

305
00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.900
P5: cause I've seen it where they didn't.

306
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:53.420
Renata: Okay. Got it. You can go ahead and click the continue button. Excuse me.

307
00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:04.500
P5: All right, and see you have to do this all over again. That's kind of silly.

308
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:08.310
Renata: Yeah, yeah. Why do you think you're being asked to provide this information at this point.

309
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:12.920
P5: I guess you're just verifying that it's you. And then the sponsor. But

310
00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:19.499
P5: you know you already have all the other information. They should already be able to match this up in theory.

311
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:20.460
Renata: Okay.

312
00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:28.950
P5: As a former programmer. You know, I'm just like some of the information is too much.

313
00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:30.499
Renata: Right, right.

314
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.309
P5: Is not changed.

315
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.620
P5: Alright!

316
00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.470
Renata: Oh, right!

317
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.020
P5: You ever.

318
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:16.020
Renata: So like, I, yeah, go ahead and review, and then I'll ask you some questions. But we're not gonna hit the submit button again.

319
00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:16.800
P5: Okay?

320
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:27.159
P5: Alright. So it's got the got the claim number in there. You get your medical claim, got everything in.

321
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.080
P5: and then you sign and submit.

322
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:32.510
Renata: Okay.

323
00:35:32.963 --> 00:35:39.039
Renata: so would you do anything differently on this page, knowing that this is a resubmission instead of an initial claim.

324
00:35:40.644 --> 00:35:47.429
P5: I would probably try to. Del, you know. Verify that that you know that claim number.

325
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.380
P5: Make sure that that is correct, that it's typed in correctly.

326
00:35:51.868 --> 00:35:59.539
P5: Other than that everything else should be, you know. Make sure the date is the same as the you know everything, but

327
00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.000
P5: other than that it should be okay.

328
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:10.789
Renata: Okay? And again, without clicking anything. If you did submit this form, what would you expect to happen next? Anything different from the initial claim? Same.

329
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:16.199
P5: And I would get an acknowledgement on the screen. And then again, an email acknowledgement

330
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.470
P5: that that has been resubmitted.

331
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:27.569
Renata: Okay, got it? And would you expect any difference in processing or response time with a resubmitted claim versus an initial claim.

332
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:37.580
P5: To me it should be faster. But knowing the government, I would say another 30 days.

333
00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:47.630
Renata: Okay? And again, that's sort of what you think is realistic. In an ideal world. What would that processing time be for a resubmitted claim.

334
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:52.979
P5: Again, I would say 5 to 7 days should be all that's necessary.

335
00:36:53.170 --> 00:37:05.429
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. So we're not gonna be submitting these claims. You can go ahead and stop screen sharing and close your browser out now and just. I have just a few more questions for you to wrap up before we finish the call.

336
00:37:06.137 --> 00:37:15.580
Renata: So that one to 5 scale again, one more time, one being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the resubmission.

337
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.750
P5: Say 5. Easy.

338
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:19.440
Renata: Okay.

339
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:26.499
Renata: And how would you compare your experience with the 1st claim you submitted today? Versus that second claim, the resubmission.

340
00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.439
P5: I would say the same. It wasn't hard.

341
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:37.420
Renata: Okay, got it? So overall. Was there anything you saw in the session today that worked well for you?

342
00:37:38.878 --> 00:37:41.660
P5: The fact that it was online and not a Pdf.

343
00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:43.850
P5: That you had to mail in.

344
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:51.180
Renata: Okay, got it. Was there anything that was unclear or that didn't work well for you that you saw in the session today?

345
00:37:52.020 --> 00:38:01.799
P5: Well, so based on the letter that I received back right saying it was missing. The letter said I had to mail in

346
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.350
P5: all this information. But yet

347
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:15.649
P5: I was able to do that online. So if I saw that letter I'd be gone. This is a pain in the butt. But yet here we were able to actually resubmit.

348
00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:25.389
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you for sharing. What are your thoughts about? The amount of information provided in the form? Not enough too much, just right.

349
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.920
P5: In the online form, you mean.

350
00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.590
Renata: Yeah.

351
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.140
P5: I think it's just right.

352
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:41.540
Renata: Okay, got it? And how would you compare the claims form that you just saw to like other experiences you've had with filing claims.

353
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:44.569
P5: Probably about the same.

354
00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:51.170
Renata: Okay, got it? Just before we wrap up any questions for me.

355
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:54.810
P5: No, I don't think so.

356
00:38:54.810 --> 00:39:06.559
Renata: Okay, if you do have any questions you can reach out to para G, and the folks who emailed you. But I just wanted to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of our session today with our Va partners.

357
00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.370
P5: Yes.

358
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:12.010
Renata: Alright. Is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?

359
00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:27.709
Renata: All right. Well, with that, P5, we really appreciate you taking time out of your day to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is super helpful as we continue to work on the site, and making sure that it really works for veterans and their family members so truly. Thank you.

360
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:43.790
Renata: Lastly, Perigean is going to be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, you can pass along to any other veterans or family members of veterans, you know, to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies like this one. But with that, thank you so much. Again, have a great rest of your day and your week.

361
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:45.610
P5: Alright. Thank you, you, too.

362
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:46.810
Renata: Yeah. Take care.

363
00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:47.897
P5: Alright! You too.

364
00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:48.850
Renata: Bye.

365
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:49.650
P5: Bye.
