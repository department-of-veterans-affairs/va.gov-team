00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.080
Jamie: Great, so it looks like we're ready.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.320
Participant 16: your sound of Zoom.

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.650
Jamie: Yes, so you're familiar, I could just hit that OK button to get rid of that bar at the top. You have it.

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.210
Participant 16: Boom.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.070
Jamie: Okay.

6
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.690
Participant 16: We use Zoom all the time, so….

7
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:27.740
Jamie: Oh, great, awesome. So you're a pro at this. So, just to answer, just to ask those two questions again, no, shoot, where did those two questions go? Hold on, you said it is…

8
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:39.710
Jamie: Having a problem talking today, so bear with me, please. So, I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

9
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.510
Participant 16: Yes.

10
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:50.060
Jamie: Okay, great! And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our session today to share with our VA partners if we've removed any information that could be used to identify you?

11
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.010
Participant 16: Yes.

12
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.429
Jamie: Okay, awesome. Alright, all that stuff's out of the way now, now we can jump in to this.

13
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:04.160
Jamie: … So, are you or anybody else in your household currently enrolled in CHAMPVA?

14
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.800
Participant 16: Yeah, my whole family.

15
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.160
Jamie: Okay, so, you would be the veteran, right?

16
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.160
Participant 16: Yes.

17
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.060
Jamie: Great. …

18
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.260
Jamie: Yeah, so, do you remember, how long ago you enrolled, or they enrolled in CHAMPVA?

19
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.299
Participant 16: I think a year and a half ago.

20
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.310
Jamie: Okay?

21
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.329
Jamie: Year and a half? Yeah. Do you remember what the experience is like for enrolling?

22
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.690
Participant 16: miserable.

23
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.490
Participant 16: It was just really long. I remember trying to…

24
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:43.250
Participant 16: my biggest issue with CHAMPVA was more even figuring out how to start, right? Like, I'd heard about this mythical thing called CHAMPVA once I got 100% P&T,

25
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.349
Participant 16: And… Just trying to figure out, like, what does it take? How do you get them enrolled?

26
00:01:48.540 --> 00:02:02.720
Participant 16: Like, I had to go on base first to, like, even get their ID cards, you know, to get them into Deers, which, that took a while to figure out that process, and then trying to find the form, download a form, like, handwrite each one, or try to type it in.

27
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.870
Participant 16: Just… it wasn't clear…

28
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:15.610
Participant 16: to really know how to do it, and it seemed to ask for a ton of information, and because I have other employment insurance, then to get each of those cards and all the info… like, it just… it was…

29
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.940
Participant 16: Difficult.

30
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.800
Participant 16: Because of that.

31
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.190
Participant 16: … Without really a…

32
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.249
Participant 16: simple place to go, and then every family member has to have, like, a different form on their own to submit it in, which in some ways I understand, because then each of them have their own

33
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.080
Participant 16: insurance card.

34
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.840
Participant 16: Which then also gets confusing, because most insurance is a family, you have one card to cover the family. So, it's…

35
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.170
Participant 16: it just seems overburdensome in some ways. I mean, I'm grateful for it, so don't get me wrong that I'm glad we have CHAPVA, but treating all my kids

36
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.069
Participant 16: As independent, like, individuals, just was awkward, because now my wife has to carry, you know, 4 different insurance cards around.

37
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.760
Jamie: If you're.

38
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.030
Participant 16: which one I have to use, and which one to submit. …

39
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.590
Participant 16: Whereas, when we turn in our other insurance, it's…

40
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.220
Participant 16: My insurance card that gets submitted.

41
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.560
Participant 16: And then I gotta submit an individual, separate insurance number for each kid, depending on which appointment.

42
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.490
Jamie: So… Yeah.

43
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.450
Jamie: That's….

44
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.440
Participant 16: Yeah, so just long. It just seemed very, very long, and it wasn't very clear.

45
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.980
Jamie: Okay. Well, thanks for sharing. Have you submitted any, Champier claims?

46
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.890
Participant 16: …

47
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:42.650
Participant 16: I have not submitted the wasn't covered, have to submit separately claims, honestly, because it was too hard to figure out.

48
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.270
Participant 16: I've tried to look in that process, like, I had a daughter who had to have, imagery done.

49
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:56.069
Participant 16: you know, ultrasound or something, and it wasn't covered because the hospital didn't know how to actually run CHEPVA insurance, so they couldn't find it.

50
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:06.859
Participant 16: because we're not TRICARE? They're like, oh, you're military, I'll link you up under TRICARE. Like, no, it's CHAMPVA. And they're like, well, you don't have TRICARE. I'm like, I know I don't have TRICARE, I have CHAMPVA. So, the biggest issue we've had is that

51
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.600
Participant 16: Medical providers don't know what it is.

52
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.380
Participant 16: They think it's TRICARE, or they think it's regular military insurance.

53
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:31.729
Participant 16: And then when they can't validate that I have that because they're looking in the wrong place, then it forces them to have to call the 1-800 number that's on the insurance card and hope to connect to somebody, to then maybe say, yes, this is actually valid, and then try to figure out what the insurance actually covers. So, most of the providers that we've tried to use it on

54
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.460
Participant 16: quit. They don't….

55
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.890
Jamie: Hmm.

56
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.560
Participant 16: I actually go all the way through.

57
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:44.529
Participant 16: Because I have some coverage, you know, from one insurance, and they don't then follow through running both, because they can't… they can't navigate to…

58
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.700
Participant 16: Like, does there… Company even take that insurance?

59
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.770
Participant 16: So…

60
00:04:50.690 --> 00:05:06.430
Participant 16: And that's been very problematic, because CHAMPVA is not actually the insurance provider, where Tracker is actually, like, through Humana, or whoever else, so they can go look that up. Like, who covers CHAMPVA? I'm like, I don't know. Like, I don't know what the insurance is, I don't know who the actual provider is, and other than call the 1-800 number and hope to talk to somebody.

61
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.520
Participant 16: …

62
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.819
Participant 16: I have no recourse. I have no information to give them. I don't have a website I can direct them to.

63
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.910
Participant 16: … So….

64
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.610
Jamie: That's what.

65
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.060
Participant 16: Sorry to hear that, yeah.

66
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.760
Jamie: I'm like….

67
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.179
Participant 16: it's very nice when I come in, they go, oh, I know what Champier is. It's like, yes, you actually know what we have, you can help out with this.

68
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:37.400
Participant 16: So I've never gone beyond that to then try to run the, they didn't cover it, take a receipt, take a proof of denied insurance, and then have to capture

69
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.609
Participant 16: all of the other forms that are needed to then go submit it. I had to pay out-of-pocket claim.

70
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.820
Participant 16: to then try to get the VA to cover it back. I mean, thankfully, I have a job, so it's not…

71
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.359
Participant 16: like, I'm… going and, you know, putting it on a credit card, and I can't afford it.

72
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.580
Participant 16: Which would be much worse, and I'd probably fight a lot harder if I had to, but…

73
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.000
Participant 16: It's just… that part has not been a…

74
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:13.840
Participant 16: a good or easy experience, and then I know by the pamphlet of, like, what is actually covered. The booklet's great, it covers a lot of things, but then it's like, this is a copay for an imagery, well, did I get the right referral? Because it's then different than other insurance, and even that's not an easy…

75
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:22.979
Participant 16: like, click here and see what's covered. It's the take-home book you have to open up and then try to navigate to the right section to see if it applies or doesn't apply.

76
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.680
Jamie: Yeah.

77
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.510
Participant 16: Zone.

78
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:35.240
Jamie: Yeah, insurance just in general is complicated. Just adding another layer of complication with CHAMPVA, unfortunately, but….

79
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:46.539
Participant 16: Let's just a secondary. Like, if it ended up being a primary, maybe one thing, but again, it's nice as a secondary, but then it's… does it cover… was this a copay? Was it not a copay? Yeah. Well, I haven't met that deductible, so does CHAMPVA cover?

80
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.710
Participant 16: the out-of-pocket deductible costs are not… like, it's just not… Very easy to understand.

81
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.590
Jamie: Yeah.

82
00:06:52.740 --> 00:07:06.960
Jamie: So, yeah, so that's one of the things we do want to help, kind of, you know, veterans and their families get through these forms a little bit easier, hopefully. So that's what we're, we're doing today.

83
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.859
Participant 16: So I was excited when I saw it. I was like, yes, like, I've done one of these studies before, about, you know, getting your benefits.

84
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.010
Participant 16: Or getting your disability claims done and processed.

85
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:17.190
Jamie: them.

86
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:35.060
Jamie: So, I guess we'll take a look at the Chant VA one, today. So, I'm gonna drop a link in the chat, and that's the link to our demo tool. So, I'd like you to open it into a browser, and then share your Zoom. Let me know if you need any help sharing, it sounds like you're a Zoom pro, though, so….

87
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.640
Participant 16: with it.

88
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:46.980
Jamie: Yeah, we'll, we'll get that working. But before I send that over, I just want to give you, like, a moment to close any browser windows, or tabs, or notifications, or anything that you might have. So just let me know when you're ready.

89
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:54.569
Participant 16: I mean, you can say I have… I'm a tab, like, multi-tab guy, so I will have it open, I know how to share it, I'm okay.

90
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.400
Jamie: Okay.

91
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.439
Participant 16: You can send it.

92
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.609
Jamie: Alright, sending it over, and it should be in the Zoom chat.

93
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.230
Participant 16: Yeah.

94
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.110
Participant 16: Okay.

95
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.190
Jamie: Okay, got it, got it open?

96
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.980
Participant 16: share with you. I do, yeah.

97
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.220
Jamie: Okay, yeah, if you go ahead and share your screen…

98
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.890
Jamie: Okay, great. Alright, I can see it.

99
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.550
Jamie: … Yeah, so…

100
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:38.010
Jamie: Before we start going through and filling up this form, just a reminder, this is our testing site. You won't actually be submitting the form today, and nothing you click on this form will have any bearing on your benefits.

101
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:52.680
Jamie: So, as we go through today, feel free to use any fake information for sensitive questions, especially those, like, your social security number or your birthdates. Got it. Yeah. We don't want to see those on screen. It's just a safety measure.

102
00:08:52.730 --> 00:09:10.890
Jamie: And you'll be asked to upload some documents, at some point, but, being that we're not submitting the form today, they're not really going anywhere. They wouldn't go anywhere anyway, because, like I said, it's a siloed, server, separate from VA.gov.

103
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.440
Jamie: So, did you receive any documents from Perigian in an email?

104
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.970
Participant 16: I did, you want me to go download those now?

105
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:24.079
Jamie: You don't have to, not at the moment, like, when we get to it in the form,

106
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.440
Participant 16: Okay.

107
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:31.210
Jamie: are easy to access, you go ahead, but if not, I have them ready to go. I could have put them in the Zoom chat as well, if that's easier.

108
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.609
Participant 16: If you want to drop in the chat, I'll download it from there, and that way I.

109
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:33.970
Jamie: Okay.

110
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.490
Participant 16: close out this screen, open email, find email. I mean, I could do.

111
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:36.890
Jamie: Yeah.

112
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.819
Participant 16: Probably, but it'd be faster to put it in chat.

113
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.380
Jamie: Sounds good.

114
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:39.760
Participant 16: Cool.

115
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.419
Jamie: I'll do it that way. …

116
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:55.490
Jamie: So, back to this page without clicking anything, I'd like you to take a look at the information, and just tell us your initial thoughts, like, in your own words, what type of form is this page describing, and, you know, anything else that you notice.

117
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:05.940
Participant 16: Well, first question is, how would I get even to this form, right? So, just navigating to the VA website often becomes problematic. I do a lot of stuff with the GI Bill, and our

118
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.870
Participant 16: The training we do.

119
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:18.709
Participant 16: you couldn't even find in the VA system, even though it's authorized for a long time. So I complained to the VA for about a year, and they finally updated the website. So, how do you navigate to this form?

120
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.250
Participant 16: Like, Google search CHAMPVA Claim, and it…

121
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.530
Participant 16: Comes up as a link, or….

122
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.359
Jamie: Is that what you normally would do? Just jumping in Google search? Yeah.

123
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:34.320
Participant 16: Yep. Or chat GPT, and say, like, file chat VA claim. So, is it findable that way?

124
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:46.469
Jamie: Yeah, it absolutely is. Yeah, and there's some, you know, links to navigate through on VA.gov as well, to get to the CHAMPVA area, but….

125
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.549
Participant 16: With some new eights from their own form.

126
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.070
Participant 16: So…

127
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.399
Participant 16: You asked what kind of form is this? Obviously, it's very clear that it's a form to file for a CHAMPVA claim.

128
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.620
Participant 16: One thing I would say is.

129
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:15.110
Participant 16: just describing some of this, what constitutes a claim, or if I had some coverage covered and it wasn't covered, or if it's a supplemental, or…

130
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:22.979
Participant 16: like… sometimes… You know, is this the only one type of claim to submit, or when does this…

131
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.549
Participant 16: Like, when am I supposed to use this form?

132
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.340
Participant 16: ….

133
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:26.920
Jamie: Okay.

134
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.489
Participant 16: may help. I mean, I'm not trying to nitpick, but you guys want honest feedback, and….

135
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.520
Jamie: Yes.

136
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:36.509
Participant 16: sometimes, you know, again, I'm familiar with online stuff, but if I'm an older type person, or…

137
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.219
Participant 16: okay, what does this mean? You know, like, for my spouse who needed it, and …

138
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.000
Participant 16: You know, is this their only one form?

139
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.770
Participant 16: Or is there, like, some other supplemental form? Or, you know, so just to be clear, hey, this is…

140
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.870
Participant 16: the only form for any CHAMPVA claim.

141
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.960
Participant 16: ….

142
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.180
Jamie: Okay, great.

143
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.170
Participant 16: Would be clear to just state that.

144
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.670
Participant 16: There's no other one to look for.

145
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:04.959
Jamie: Yeah, that makes sense. What kind of information do you think you would need in order to fill out this form?

146
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:13.179
Participant 16: … I mean, just on here, itemized billing.

147
00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.450
Participant 16: statement.

148
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.190
Participant 16: Explanation of benefits from another insurance provider or pharmacy receipt.

149
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:27.740
Jamie: Okay, would you need to take a pause at this point if you're filling it out for real life, to go find those things, or would you have them prepared?

150
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.440
Participant 16: No, I'd probably have to go… Search for them, or…

151
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:44.360
Participant 16: I mean, even this information could be great on, like, the back of your insurance card, like, from CHAMPVA, like, hey, to file a claim, please make sure you keep this information, so if you can tie this stuff onto the cards, and I don't have the card with me to know if it's even there.

152
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:57.870
Participant 16: Or not, but I think even having a QR code, possibly to this form, or something, like, on the insurance cards, like you to file a claim, like, here's a QR code, scan this, please make sure you have this information, and just have that be…

153
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.010
Participant 16: a part of… Like, insurance card, or….

154
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:20.500
Participant 16: Something like that that they could have, like, easily on hand. So, like, when you get your packet document, hey, filing a claim, you can scan this form here, always make sure you keep this and this and this. So… or ask, you know, while you're at a provider's office, please make sure you ask them to make sure they send you this information. So sometimes you can go home with it.

155
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:27.230
Participant 16: like, if it didn't cover it, and I'm paying on-site for, like, $200 for a thing, That wasn't covered.

156
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.159
Participant 16: You know, that I have that readily available when I leave the appointment.

157
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:38.929
Jamie: Yeah, that's great. You know, good feedback on that. I think those are great ideas, honestly.

158
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:44.069
Participant 16: Yeah, but itemized savings, explanation of benefits from another insurance provider, that would be, like, if

159
00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:50.549
Participant 16: you know, even then put an if available, or if provided, because if I don't have other insurance, then….

160
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.230
Jamie: Hmm.

161
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:57.579
Participant 16: that's not needed. Yeah. So I can see somebody saying, hey, like, I need to go find this EOB, but, like, I don't have other insurance, I guess I can't submit. Yeah.

162
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:57.970
Jamie: Yeah.

163
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.870
Participant 16: You know, just make it clear on… Anyways….

164
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:13.859
Jamie: Okay, so yeah, I mean, so basically what he's saying is you prefer to see this even before you get to this point, possibly at the time of service on your card, this way you.

165
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.759
Participant 16: Or even put that at the top, right? Like, I get the hole within one year.

166
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.680
Jamie: Yeah. But….

167
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:24.919
Participant 16: Like, what you need to know before you fill out this form. I feel like this form requires these documents, go get it now. Then I would put…

168
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:31.989
Participant 16: Like, you know, claims must be filed within one year, each one's its own. Like, to me, that's the start point, is….

169
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.600
Jamie: Great.

170
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:37.549
Participant 16: You know, go get these documents, and then make sure it's within one year of care.

171
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.470
Jamie: Okay.

172
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:54.680
Jamie: Yeah, makes sense. On a scale of 1 to 5, I apologize, there's gonna be a lot of these rating questions popping up. Oh, you're good. So, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel to file a claim based on this page's content?

173
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:05.260
Participant 16: I guess, I'd say maybe a one… oh, let me read through the rest of the page, because from the start of the page….

174
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.770
Jamie: Sorry, I apologize.

175
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:12.589
Participant 16: I don't wanna… take a dump on the VA, explains that a little further down.

176
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:19.960
Participant 16: … So it should take you 10 minutes, Simon, to start the form. Okay.

177
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.879
Participant 16: I'd say about a 2.

178
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:32.180
Jamie: Okay.

179
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.539
Jamie: Any, particular reasons?

180
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.180
Jamie: Like, what, what would, ….

181
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.820
Participant 16: I need to have one, apparently, filled out for each.

182
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:40.520
Jamie: Hmm.

183
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:47.180
Participant 16: Person, one for each… claim, I guess, for each… Payment that was made.

184
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.729
Participant 16: But then… just says, go sign in. Okay, so…

185
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.150
Participant 16: There's not really any instructions on how to fill it out, or…

186
00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:01.559
Participant 16: like, what to do until you actually open the form up, I guess. Maybe I'll have more information later.

187
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:02.540
Jamie: Okay.

188
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.089
Participant 16: But, from what I can tell, I need to have documents that I gotta go find.

189
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.469
Participant 16: And make sure it's within a year. But if you're asking how comfortable am I filling it out, like, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do to fill it out.

190
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.700
Jamie: Okay.

191
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.400
Participant 16: It doesn't say if I need, like, an address, like, do I need the addresses of where it was?

192
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.989
Participant 16: which I'll find out, I'm guessing, when I open the form. …

193
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:37.049
Participant 16: But again, I think a variety of users, some people will be older, if you can't even put out a, like, how to fill out a CHAMPVA claim, click here, watch video, type deal, if they could make that as, like, like, hey, we understand it's confusing, even starting with, how do you talk to your provider?

194
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:46.070
Participant 16: Right. Because, like I said, most providers don't know what CHAMPVA is, and if they can't find me, if they can't understand what my insurance is, I'm probably getting charged as if I have no insurance.

195
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.210
Participant 16: And then I have to go back and submit a larger claim.

196
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.869
Participant 16: to hopefully get some coverage, which then may be more burdensome. So I think there could be a series of…

197
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.580
Participant 16: like, understanding CHAMPVA.

198
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.660
Participant 16: you know, In different capacities.

199
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.930
Participant 16: Because…

200
00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:12.040
Participant 16: it's not simple. It's not just, like, TRICARE, where I walk in and give you an ID card, and then it's like, oh, they just take care of it. Which, for many veterans, that's all I did, and I never paid anything. It was just…

201
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.710
Participant 16: Insurance was there.

202
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.910
Participant 16: Yeah, sure.

203
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.859
Jamie: Great, …

204
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:32.150
Jamie: No, I appreciate your thoughts on that. Yeah, that's one way, you know, we can help to improve these forms, make it easier for everybody who's thinking about that. You know, what your experiences are prior to, getting to this point of filing a claim, like…

205
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.760
Jamie: That's great.

206
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:44.670
Jamie: So, you can go ahead and jump into the form. There should be a link in that blue box on the bottom that we're gonna sign in without, or sorry, start your form without signing in. My apologies.

207
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.320
Participant 16: to click on ID Me? I have an ID.me account, but….

208
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.780
Jamie: No, I won't work here, …

209
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.430
Jamie: So, if you want to just click the X in the corner to get out of that. There's a link under it that you can enter in without signing in.

210
00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.160
Participant 16: Got it.

211
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.599
Jamie: Yep, there you go.

212
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:21.089
Jamie: So I'd like you to start this form as if you're submitting a medical claim for your spouse or dependent. So, I'll let you know when we need to pause so I can ask some questions, but just, you know, a reminder, again, this is our testing site, you don't have to worry about information going anywhere, but, you know, feel free to use that fake information.

213
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.729
Jamie: So just remember to talk out loud as you're going through this, and let us know your thoughts.

214
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.270
Participant 16: True.

215
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:37.380
Participant 16: So I'm an agileist, I actually work with a team of project managers as well, so I'll try to use persona language or things if you guys want to look at that for requirements development.

216
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.670
Jamie: Great, I mean, however you're comfortable doing it, that'd be….

217
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.349
Participant 16: I'm assuming you guys are coders as well, or developers, or various companies?

218
00:18:45.610 --> 00:19:00.580
Jamie: Not on this call. We're all… yeah, we're all, researchers and designers, or developers, might be looking at this as well. So we, yeah, we're a whole team of, you know, just UX and developers.

219
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:16.179
Participant 16: Okay. But… so, on the persona thing, I think you have a persona of, like, an old person who's now getting this, because they finally got up to 100%, and they actually went to the VA after being in Vietnam, and, like, now they finally are willing to go get benefits. You're gonna have the…

220
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:23.869
Participant 16: you know, younger people who might be there, you know, with families or just individuals, something you have different technological levels.

221
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:24.260
Jamie: understand.

222
00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:42.780
Participant 16: If they're newer, out of the military, and maybe you're, like, medically retired, you know, 100%, another family gets it, but they've had TRICARE their whole life, they don't even know what an HMO is, or a PPO, they've never had insurance ever, and they're going to think this is supposed to work like TRICARE, and just walk in and say, here's my ID card. Yeah. So, I think you have different…

223
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:47.669
Participant 16: different personas to look at and walk around, or work around. ….

224
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:57.200
Jamie: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, even, with these calls, we've encountered that and gotten so many, like, so much feedback required, like, you know, based on,

225
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:06.259
Jamie: what each individual's, basically their persona is, and how they, how they perceive these questions, so that's super helpful.

226
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.120
Participant 16: Sponsor, no. Country.

227
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.030
Participant 16: United States action on top, that's nice.

228
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.930
Participant 16: Street address, …

229
00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.099
Participant 16: When I went back, I thought it was asking me beneficiary the first time.

230
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:07.680
Participant 16: Sorry.

231
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.139
Jamie: That's good to note, yeah.

232
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:15.810
Participant 16: mailing address… Oh, my name, nevermind.

233
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:27.069
Participant 16: So you're the veteran fellow, spouse dependent means you're their sponsor. Okay, your name. Got it. So I click, like, for my spouse, and it's, like, information. I was thinking, like, oh, I'm putting their information on here, not my.

234
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.490
Jamie: Mmm.

235
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:31.849
Participant 16: information on here. Yeah, so it's potentially confusion, confusion on….

236
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:32.980
Jamie: If I log in with….

237
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.100
Participant 16: like…

238
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.809
Participant 16: real ID, does it auto-populate because it's my account, or do I still have to type in my information?

239
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.210
Jamie: Is that something that you would prefer, like an autofill? Yes.

240
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:43.930
Jamie: Okay.

241
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.500
Participant 16: Or just skip to the…

242
00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:56.990
Participant 16: like, you already know me, I'm already in the system. Ken, is there a way to just skip to your dependent? Like, if you're filling it out, and you log in to the account under your VA account, and you click For My Spouse, it just automatically jumps to…

243
00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.620
Participant 16: This is a spouse's form, because….

244
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.190
Participant 16: Why do I have to fill out my information when I already logged into the VA system?

245
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.590
Jamie: You have it all.

246
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.640
Participant 16: Logged in, this makes sense, because they.

247
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:07.990
Jamie: Yeah.

248
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:08.970
Jamie: Clip.

249
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:22.020
Jamie: Yeah, I know some VA forms, they either skip or they do the pre-fill as well, so there is some kind of functionality with this, with the, you know, some kind of benefit to signing in,

250
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.660
Jamie: Rather than just going in as a guest.

251
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.639
Participant 16: Yep, the beneficiary.

252
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:30.080
Participant 16: Yes.

253
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:33.570
Participant 16: Oops.

254
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:59.400
Participant 16: Okay, I'll put here, this is also annoying, because I already had to put that when I had to ask for CHAMPVA, so if you could just put, has there been a change to?

255
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.490
Participant 16: information, because…

256
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:09.940
Participant 16: you already had to document that just to get CHAMPVA, and I had to list all the information for that anyway. So…

257
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.049
Participant 16: I don't know…

258
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.550
Participant 16: to have to go back and then find that, which I would also then put on the front. You're also gonna need other insurance cards, OCIP, you know, or whatever.

259
00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:24.779
Participant 16: before you start this process, right? Okay. So, I would put…

260
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:30.390
Participant 16: Give me the list of… before you start this, you're gonna need this, this, this, this, this, and this, like, a checkbox, even.

261
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.000
Participant 16: And then say, if you don't have that, please go get that information and come back.

262
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.430
Jamie: Okay, so just another way to help you feel a little bit more prepared, list that up front, is that what you're saying?

263
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.059
Participant 16: Correct. And if it hasn't changed, just like my login, if I'm logging in.

264
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:44.460
Jamie: Yeah.

265
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:49.309
Participant 16: And you have it, and I already had to submit that when I got it in the first place.

266
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.680
Jamie: insurance.

267
00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.810
Participant 16: hasn't changed.

268
00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:58.159
Participant 16: why do I have to go put all of that information again back on a form that you already have the information for? It just seems inefficient.

269
00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.230
Jamie: Yeah. And….

270
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.419
Participant 16: Kind of that…

271
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:14.629
Participant 16: that feeling of, like, I already did it once, like, do you, like, why can't one department share it with another department? But if it's changed, and say, has your insurance been changed, or is it a new provider since you filled this out? And whatever those requirements are.

272
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.590
Participant 16: just…

273
00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:29.209
Participant 16: Explain that, because insurance policies do change sometimes every year, so if it's the same number, though, like, you know, please validate your number is the same, or even pull it up for you, and say, here's what you put on your form, is this still your current other provider information?

274
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.610
Participant 16: and validate.

275
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.740
Participant 16: what I had to submit when I submitted my claim in the first place.

276
00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.869
Participant 16: Of course, when you submit for CHAMPVA, it's a paper form.

277
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:45.949
Participant 16: As you mail in, not digital, unless that's changing too, hopefully, which means somebody would have had to have manually entered that information in versus just validating that you had something.

278
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.930
Participant 16: …

279
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:53.389
Participant 16: So if that's a digital request, then just pull it over and say, this is the current listed other insurance provider.

280
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:54.630
Participant 16: ….

281
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.089
Jamie: Great, thank you for sharing. Yeah, that's super helpful.

282
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.940
Jamie: Yeah.

283
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.549
Participant 16: Continue. New insurance.

284
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.000
Participant 16: Great C… Fair enough.

285
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:12.580
Participant 16: Damn.

286
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.359
Participant 16: I didn't intention anymore.

287
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.810
Jamie: Looks like it's on the, phone number down there.

288
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.670
Participant 16: Oh, best policy number, sorry, but it's….

289
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.449
Participant 16: I thought it was a pop-up, my bad.

290
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:45.710
Jamie: Oh, no worries.

291
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.180
Participant 16: ….

292
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.570
Jamie: That also helps us.

293
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.889
Participant 16: I thought it was, like, popping up and, like, wanting me to go to, like, the one on the top, like, it was highlighting the error.

294
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.760
Jamie: So it was looking like it was in the wrong spot.

295
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.690
Participant 16: Yeah. Basically.

296
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.889
Participant 16: That's why I was typing in the box, I was like, oh, okay.

297
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:06.760
Jamie: No worries.

298
00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.110
Participant 16: … Inspire sponsored.

299
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.270
Participant 16: She and all of this, so this could be a part of a…

300
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.280
Participant 16: Fill out for your spouse's profile.

301
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:26.440
Participant 16: you know, or create a spouse profile or dependent profile in the VA system, then I could just click as them, or even log in as them.

302
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:27.730
Participant 16: ….

303
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.880
Jamie: Yeah.

304
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.070
Participant 16: Other health insurance covers? No.

305
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.229
Jamie: Yeah, you don't have to put anything else in that.

306
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.359
Jamie: So we're gonna do a medical claim today.

307
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:40.870
Participant 16: Fair.

308
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.610
Participant 16: My wife's a stay-at-home mom, so it's like, is this workman's comp?

309
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:00.750
Participant 16: …

310
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:21.429
Participant 16: And I'll just give you perspective when I see these questions, is the VA wants to do as little as possible to take care of you, so we're gonna find how to get somebody else to pay for all this for you as much as possible, rather than…

311
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:32.760
Participant 16: actually giving you care. So, I know that's what they are trying to do, but then that feeling is, like, we want to only cover you if you absolutely have to come to us, but otherwise, I don't… I don't want to try.

312
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:37.889
Participant 16: … So I think maybe even asking these questions at the end?

313
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:47.410
Participant 16: you know, it'd be, like, the last questions. They probably are, because it's 506. Like, fill all of it out, and then at the end, be like, hey, is this claim a part of this, kind of at the very end, not….

314
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:48.620
Jamie: Hmm.

315
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.529
Jamie: I'm just kidding.

316
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:57.400
Participant 16: Does that make sense? Be like, fill it out, claim information, put it on there, and be like, last two questions. Is this claim related to workman's compensation?

317
00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.610
Participant 16: Click here, yes or no. Is this claim related to a car accident?

318
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:06.570
Participant 16: You know, where you know… where you may know the other, you know, offendee's insurance information, yes or no.

319
00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:12.050
Participant 16: like, get that information, but make that the last two boxes, not before I even fill it out.

320
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.070
Jamie: Okay.

321
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.080
Participant 16: So….

322
00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:14.609
Jamie: Thank you.

323
00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:27.529
Participant 16: Again, just to build the trust of the VA, because many veterans don't trust the VA, or they feel like the VA doesn't really care, or like, you don't really want to help me. And so, yep, proven it. See, if this is a car accident, you're just gonna do whatever you can to not help me. Thanks.

324
00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.570
Jamie: Yeah, yeah.

325
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.549
Jamie: Yeah, we are aware of that, unfortunately.

326
00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.949
Participant 16: I know, that's why I just… having those

327
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:47.090
Participant 16: questions later, but please fill all that out, we'll do all that we can. Last two questions, you know, is this due to another car accident? Is there any other information you can provide so we can try to… so we can contact that other insurance provider on your behalf?

328
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:56.039
Participant 16: Or is this part of workman's comp, or a work-related injury? You know, if yes, please give us the information so we can contact them on your behalf, not…

329
00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:08.810
Participant 16: You know, so you can go do more work, and we can just deny your claim, saying, this wasn't my fault, you know, like… Yeah. Or if it is, be like, if yes, this is part of a workman's compensation claim, you no longer qualify, and just be very clear that

330
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:14.660
Participant 16: CHAMPVA doesn't cover CHAMPVA does not apply in these circumstances.

331
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:21.599
Participant 16: So, you know, going in, oh, this is working time, I'm not even gonna fill it out, because I'm going to be denied anyway. Or, if it is covered, then…

332
00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:23.769
Participant 16: You know, what do you.

333
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:30.240
Jamie: Yeah. They're looking for a little bit more details on how and why they're using… they're asking those questions.

334
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.010
Participant 16: just to kind of gate.

335
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.630
Jamie: I mean, that trust of, we're not going to deny your claim.

336
00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:44.779
Participant 16: Correct, or just be clear on when does CHAMPVA apply or not apply, and if it is these circumstances, and it does not provide coverage in these other circumstances, then just…

337
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:53.720
Participant 16: be clear about that up front. I don't remember reading anything about doesn't cover workman's comp-related issues, or doesn't cover if it was a car accident, and the other insurance is known.

338
00:30:54.280 --> 00:31:01.129
Participant 16: You know, so if it doesn't grit, then make those be secondary or final questions, just as a…

339
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:06.599
Participant 16: Work around, or to help you, or make it feel like you're helping me, not finding a way to deny me.

340
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:22.470
Jamie: Okay, great. So, on this page, yeah, and I thank you for all that. That's, like, super valuable information, like I said, it's one of the things that we took a look at, too, is how to phrase up those questions, so much appreciated.

341
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:26.079
Participant 16: you will not be denied if this is checked, yes. Or, like, just a…

342
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:39.110
Participant 16: Or if you will be, be open up front. If you check yes, this claim will be denied. But then you're also gonna get people that are gonna lie about it and say, no, it wasn't, because I want coverage, and I'm paying out of pocket. So, if they're gonna deny it anyway, or, you know what I mean? Like, at some point…

343
00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:47.090
Participant 16: Like, do you even need to ask that question, or put not, you know, you can put not applicable, or I don't want to answer this?

344
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:47.880
Participant 16: I mean….

345
00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.250
Participant 16: Could there possibly be a third option?

346
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.370
Jamie: Yeah.

347
00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:52.650
Participant 16: Or…

348
00:31:53.110 --> 00:32:02.090
Participant 16: like, yeah, it was workman's comp, but I… or happened at work, but I was already denied workman's comp, so they've said, no, it isn't, so do I check yes or no on that one?

349
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:03.240
Jamie: Yeah.

350
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:08.329
Participant 16: It was work-related, but I'm not getting workman's comp for it, and they've said that doesn't apply.

351
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:13.259
Participant 16: So now I'm going to you, because it's the last… the last ditch I can get to get this covered.

352
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:23.840
Participant 16: So, I mean, I think you're gonna get a lot of people either checking no on both of those, just because they don't trust the VA anyway, so if they're gonna check no and you're gonna get falsities in the information, why even ask the damn question?

353
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:40.370
Jamie: Yeah. Yeah, definitely stuff that we have thought about before, too. Yeah, so it's good to get these, like, ideas notated on this, it's awesome, thank you. So on this, this page, just give it a look over, and,

354
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:46.859
Jamie: If you, … you know, just tell me what you think it's asking for, and what you need to do on this page.

355
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.720
Participant 16: I mean, it… So, one, redundancy.

356
00:32:54.980 --> 00:33:03.730
Participant 16: Statement must include So, uploading supporting documents, it must include all of this information, provider's name.

357
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:07.009
Participant 16: Like, most of that should be on there anyway, like, from…

358
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.409
Participant 16: But not all documents have their full tax ID.

359
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.969
Participant 16: So, my issue with this would be, if it's not there.

360
00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:25.180
Participant 16: then now I gotta go find another form and call them to go find a form to get this information up front. So again, these are things that every form has to have.

361
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.650
Participant 16: I would put…

362
00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:42.470
Participant 16: this information on the… before you get started, please make sure that all forms have this stuff, because now I've gotten through the process. I look at the form and go, well, shit, now the form doesn't have that. I can't even submit, and I gotta stop, cancel out, go back, and even, like, start again, and then come, like.

363
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.290
Participant 16: Again, just from a lean efficiency standpoint.

364
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.559
Participant 16: Give me everything I need to get started before I start.

365
00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:56.319
Participant 16: List of charges, so that's on the form, but, you know, date of service, diagnosis codes.

366
00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.040
Participant 16: I may not even know what a diagnosis code is.

367
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.150
Jamie: Hmm.

368
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.190
Participant 16: So…

369
00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:09.069
Participant 16: And are the diagnosis codes the same for my other insurance, or from this medical, or for CHAMPVA? And…

370
00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:12.760
Participant 16: you know…

371
00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:19.940
Participant 16: I mean, I know, because I've looked at insurance, my daughter has a lot of medical stuff, but, like, what… I don't know what a diagnosis code or a procedure code are.

372
00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:20.369
Jamie: Hmm.

373
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:24.229
Participant 16: So… How do I know if the form has that, or not?

374
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:37.710
Participant 16: And if I need to go look those up, be like, click here to go find a list of diagnosis codes, or procedure codes, and if you have questions, please contact your doctor. They should know what these are, and please make sure they fall into these categories.

375
00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:56.530
Participant 16: Of course, then at the same time, if there's codes that are covered or not covered, which would be great to actually know, because then I can go back to my doctor and say, can you please write this code as this to make sure that I can get insurance coverage, because sometimes doctors can pick one code or another code that are very, very, very similar, and one's covered and one's not covered, right? So I think even having a downloadable list of

376
00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.359
Participant 16: covered or not covered diagnosis codes. ….

377
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:02.070
Jamie: Hmm.

378
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:08.569
Participant 16: Or procedure codes would be very, very helpful, because a lot of doctors really do want to help veterans, but they don't know

379
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.780
Participant 16: How to help you with your own insurance.

380
00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.430
Jamie: Yes.

381
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:12.890
Participant 16: Using other insurances.

382
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:15.230
Jamie: That's good, that's great, …

383
00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:31.240
Jamie: And it's good to get this point of view, too, you know, from the… basically, how to help the doctors, get your claim, approved here. So, if you could scroll a little bit further down on this page.

384
00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.479
Participant 16: JPEG, PDF.

385
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.570
Jamie: Yeah.

386
00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:34.100
Participant 16: Fair.

387
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:40.140
Jamie: Yeah, there is a blue box there, and I just wanted to get your thoughts on that before we hop in the startup.

388
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:46.649
Participant 16: Now, scan your uploads to verify they meet document requirements. May a cause 1-2 minute delay during the process. Please open.

389
00:35:47.170 --> 00:36:00.110
Participant 16: I think that's great if you're gonna look at it to make sure that the information needed is provided. I think you could even put this up top and say, hey, like, at the end, you know, forms will be submitted, we're gonna scan your forms to make sure they meet all the requirements.

390
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:05.169
Participant 16: … But is there a way to override that?

391
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.160
Participant 16: Or is it only gonna be if it sees it? Because I can look at it and be like, here's the claim code.

392
00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:10.810
Jamie: Hmm.

393
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:24.530
Participant 16: I know what it is, and again, sometimes, like, oh, you're not seeing it right, or the picture wasn't clear enough, or you couldn't scan it the right way because of how it was uploaded, and it's like, please go find a proper form. And you're like, I know the information, it's here, so is there a manual override?

394
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:25.320
Participant 16: Ability?

395
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.599
Jamie: Is that what you're… what you would want to see on here?

396
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:37.830
Participant 16: after it's uploaded, like, if I upload a form and it says, does this information exist? And I go through and say it has name, address, 10-digit codes.

397
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:47.160
Participant 16: or whatever, and I can see that it has all these things on there. And I upload it, and your software doesn't scan it right, and says, please upload a proper form.

398
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.859
Participant 16: Like, it is proper form, and I have to retake a picture and do it again. Like, please upload proper form, like…

399
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.749
Participant 16: You know, at some point, is there a way to manually.

400
00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:00.800
Jamie: A variety, yeah.

401
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.160
Participant 16: Friday.

402
00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.150
Jamie: Well, I just.

403
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.980
Participant 16: But the….

404
00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:08.539
Jamie: The document in here, so we could give it a shot and see what happens, …

405
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:15.499
Jamie: So, I just… if you want to download that, just put it in the chat. It's called Sample Billing Statement.

406
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.649
Jamie: And then we can see what happens with the file verification.

407
00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:20.440
Participant 16: That's fine.

408
00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:26.100
Participant 16: But I'm just… I haven't seen it fail, but just kind of in the if….

409
00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:36.330
Jamie: Yeah, no, I get it. I figured that was a perfect segue to, like, okay, let's see what happens. Okay, so we did upload it, and you got that message on here, so what do you think about it?

410
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.149
Participant 16: Not complete.

411
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.650
Participant 16: Yeah, … like, F you. You know what I mean? Like, one of those…

412
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:49.439
Participant 16: Like, great! Another way you're making it harder to get help. Like, do you really want to help me, or do you want to make this…

413
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.580
Participant 16: Harder.

414
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:51.590
Participant 16: ….

415
00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:56.569
Jamie: So what would you do, like, what would your next steps be after seeing this?

416
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.179
Jamie: Message pop up.

417
00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.689
Participant 16: I'd go back and double-check the form.

418
00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:08.630
Participant 16: And open it up, but I probably would have looked at it anyway to make sure that it was there. So if I've already gone through and checked all of this, and I took a picture of it.

419
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:15.810
Participant 16: and I know it's in the right format, so in this case it is a PDF, you know, or a JPEG or a f- you know, picture, and it's working. …

420
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:19.290
Participant 16: then I would possibly try it again.

421
00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:26.290
Participant 16: But at some point, it's just gonna be the, you know what, screw it, I'll just eat the cost. Like, you don't really care. And I would just stop, and be like.

422
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:28.359
Participant 16: Yep, another income.

423
00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.089
Jamie: Or, would you….

424
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:37.260
Participant 16: If I upload it once, I would maybe delete it and upload it again, and if it still doesn't work at that point, I'm going to…

425
00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.030
Participant 16: just say, like, screw it. Like, you know…

426
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.119
Participant 16: I don't know what to do next, right? I've uploaded it, you've already denied it, you've said it doesn't have the right information. If I can tell you it is on there, and I can go look at it and find it.

427
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.009
Participant 16: I now have no way to…

428
00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.650
Participant 16: Alright, or it says you can continue without verifying, but even then, like.

429
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:09.999
Participant 16: That's just… that's, like, just frustrating, or it seems like… upload this, must have this information, sorry, can't verify it.

430
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.240
Participant 16: Bye.

431
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:17.799
Jamie: Yeah, yeah, it is… it would be frustrating. Yeah, so….

432
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.400
Participant 16: I can continue without verification, and why…

433
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:27.940
Participant 16: Why does it matter? Like, does the functionality change if it's verified? Does it, like, auto-populate that information on the next screen?

434
00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:28.980
Participant 16: Right.

435
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.719
Participant 16: And if it does, then just say.

436
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:38.080
Participant 16: You know, we will scan uploads may cause a delay. If we cannot upload, you can manually enter information later.

437
00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:46.380
Participant 16: Right? Or put that on here, and be like, hey, we cannot upload verification, please click to the next page to manually input the information we need.

438
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:51.120
Participant 16: Okay, I tried it, you need it anyway to have it as a form, that's not so bad.

439
00:39:52.590 --> 00:40:01.410
Jamie: Yeah, so, no, that's great information. So this is a demo tool, so we hope that that message doesn't show up on the real thing.

440
00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:15.099
Participant 16: I fully expect that to show up. I'm sorry, like, I fully expect that that will show up. Again, sometimes people take a picture, and it's a little blurry, or, like, it wasn't a clear image, or, like, the fold in the paper when they got… I mean, if it's off of a JPEG, especially, not, like, a paper scanned PDF,

441
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.200
Participant 16: and people aren't used to actually doing, like, picture-to-PDF conversion, or, like, don't know

442
00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:33.019
Participant 16: like, I've dealt with this in construction and other stuff, where you have to put the lighting just right, and hold the phone the right way, and, like, make sure that all the numbers are on there, or it's a blurry… you get a blurry number on the top, but a clear image in the middle. Like, cameras are all different, users are all different. So if it's a camera picture upload.

443
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:39.399
Participant 16: I expect this will be common. I expect that there will be errors in the scan because of fuzziness in the picture.

444
00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:42.520
Participant 16: So, if I expect error to be the norm.

445
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.550
Participant 16: Communicate it in a way that doesn't make somebody go, your stupid system, right?

446
00:40:48.300 --> 00:41:00.540
Participant 16: You know, and that's what I put here. Help reduce errors that might result in a claim. We will scan your uploads to help input the information required. This may cause a delay. If this does not work, you can manually input the information on the next page.

447
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:09.989
Participant 16: please upload now, right? Upload. And it's like, okay, we could not complete verification, please upload information on… by clicking next, right? And it…

448
00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:17.500
Participant 16: You know, yep, I got that, fine, I can continue. So you've already put me at ease that I have a recourse if this doesn't work.

449
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:21.830
Participant 16: You know, and you can even put common causes for error.

450
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:35.489
Participant 16: Right? If you're, you know, and down here, we cannot complete verification on the file, you can manually go to the next page. Common errors for, you know, common things that cause this error are fuzziness, you know, picture, lack of clarity, or.

451
00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:36.000
Jamie: Yeah.

452
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:44.800
Participant 16: whatever, just to help go, do I want to then try again? And go, I can go back and look at the document and see that… did I cause one of these errors, or…

453
00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:48.239
Participant 16: I knew it was clear enough, and it's just causing issues, I'll just move on to the next page.

454
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.290
Jamie: Okay.

455
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:57.259
Jamie: Awesome. So for the sake of this, we're just gonna hit continue, and you are giving awesome feedback on this stuff, and I do want to get.

456
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.850
Participant 16: Awesome.

457
00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:01.399
Jamie: point in this demo, because I would love to get your eyes on these.

458
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:07.909
Participant 16: That's fine, and I'm okay on time to keep going, so, like, if we go long past the hour, I'm not worried about it, if you have another one to get to.

459
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.640
Jamie: I don't want to keep you too long, so this….

460
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:17.450
Participant 16: I want to help this be as good as possible, because I want people to, like, I like what the VA is doing, and I want to make it better, so that's why I volunteer.

461
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:26.919
Jamie: And we love people like you, so… So, just explain, to me what you think this page is telling you, and, yeah, then we should.

462
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.379
Participant 16: So that's this client from here, so you can send a copy of…

463
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:36.909
Participant 16: So again, feedback is…

464
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:45.029
Participant 16: I'm finding ways to deny you, is the first feeling. Please make sure they match. Like, okay, I get that, like, please make sure that the claims submitted

465
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:58.020
Participant 16: matches… the receipts match the claim, right? Or just, please make sure that documents submitted match your claim, you know, including, you know, dates, provider, and other information, right? But in some ways, you know, it's like, well, yeah, it's the same…

466
00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:02.200
Participant 16: Like, you're asking me again to make sure that I have documents for the same claim.

467
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.350
Participant 16: You know, if it's…

468
00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:21.130
Participant 16: you know, up top, a… you know, sometimes people submit documents that are not related to the same claim. In order to make sure that we can process your claim, please ensure that all documents reference the same date, time, provider, and ailments for the same patient, right? Information should include, you know, just a better

469
00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:28.830
Participant 16: Like, I want to make sure I can help you. Sometimes people submit, like, just a better, less robotic.

470
00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.800
Participant 16: feeling, and then one that doesn't say, I want to find every reason to not cover you.

471
00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:41.750
Participant 16: Right? Like, if you go in with the assumption that people don't trust the VA, and they assume that you're trying to find every way possible to not cover this.

472
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:47.839
Participant 16: how do I mitigate that feeling that says, I'm trying to find every way possible to make sure you get the coverage you need?

473
00:43:47.970 --> 00:44:03.189
Participant 16: Right? In order to make sure that we can provide all the coverage you want for this, and ensure that we can pay you in a timely manner, please make sure the documents you upload, right, have consistent matching dates, providers, and information. Information could include this, you know, versus….

474
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.800
Jamie: Check.

475
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:07.860
Participant 16: So, just change the tone, change….

476
00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:13.130
Jamie: I love it, by the way. I totally get what you're saying.

477
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.230
Jamie: So this is….

478
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.750
Participant 16: I paid for, they have 5-digit.

479
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:26.440
Participant 16: current procedural terminology, or healthcare common procedural coding system. Okay, again, you're using words that nobody's probably ever heard of before until I started dealing with insurance, because I used to use TRICARE, and I never got a bill for anything.

480
00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:37.489
Participant 16: So, right, if you have questions about this, click here to learn about what a healthcare common procedure coding system is, or what codes we're looking for, which I talked about earlier on various codes and procedural terms, like, just…

481
00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:43.210
Participant 16: I didn't even know what a freaking healthcare insurance was, and I left the Marine Corps getting a job, and you're like.

482
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:48.789
Participant 16: I don't know what these are. Like, do you want a PPO, HMO, HSA? And I was like.

483
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.330
Participant 16: I have no idea what you're talking about. You know, so…

484
00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:56.179
Participant 16: You know, for most vets, I've never dealt with insurance. Ever.

485
00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:00.549
Participant 16: So, I don't know what these things are, other than I got denied and had to pay something.

486
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:01.580
Participant 16: So…

487
00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:06.680
Participant 16: You know, getting back to the lowest denominator, have a way to click on and learn what these things are.

488
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.040
Jamie: Yeah.

489
00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.990
Participant 16: Or, look for specific codes and what they might be.

490
00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:27.479
Jamie: Thank you for sharing your experience on that, too. Like I said, this is super helpful, especially when you drill down to the personas and trying to understand, how veterans are viewing this, now that you kind of pointed out that most of them never dealt with insurance before, because it's all on childcare.

491
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:36.729
Participant 16: And, like, one of my colleagues is now leaving, he was active duty, he was in the National Guard, he's not retiring, and now he just got CHAMPVA. He's never had insurance before.

492
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:42.809
Participant 16: Right, even though he has a family and kids, and he's actually been in the reserves now for the last, I think, 4 years?

493
00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:43.699
Jamie: I love it.

494
00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.919
Participant 16: I have two little girls, too.

495
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:55.299
Jamie: One second, okay, I'm sorry. I have to take a call, thank you so much. Oh, sorry, she's homesick, so….

496
00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:59.900
Participant 16: Hey, it's okay, I have two little girls, I work from home, and we homeschool, so it's not uncommon.

497
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:01.160
Participant 16: ….

498
00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:06.799
Jamie: I apologize, I'm sorry.

499
00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:09.740
Participant 16: You're a mom. It's okay.

500
00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:16.090
Jamie: She likes to crash parties sometimes, but, apologize if I'm.

501
00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:22.210
Participant 16: I'm more embarrassed than I think you should be. It's completely fine. Expansion benefits sent by mail, or…

502
00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.030
Participant 16: Email…

503
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.980
Participant 16: Okay.

504
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:36.520
Participant 16: Upload. Okay, got it. Alright.

505
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:37.270
Participant 16: I guess.

506
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.710
Jamie: So where are you?

507
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.470
Participant 16: errors, clean it out.

508
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.850
Jamie: We're gonna show That's fine.

509
00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:47.320
Participant 16: I would still change it every time to say, if this doesn't work, you can input information manually.

510
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:48.840
Participant 16: Okay.

511
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.200
Jamie: So you go ahead.

512
00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:50.900
Participant 16: road.

513
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:55.630
Jamie: Yeah, I'm gonna send the second one, over, so it's just a sample EOB.

514
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:56.530
Participant 16: Yep, got it.

515
00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:58.669
Jamie: So you go ahead and upload that.

516
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:01.410
Participant 16: Same.

517
00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:03.900
Participant 16: area.

518
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:15.930
Participant 16: Denied before even finished uploading. I hope that doesn't actually happen.

519
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:17.080
Jamie: I think….

520
00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:17.940
Participant 16: On the real side.

521
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.440
Jamie: demo.

522
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.060
Participant 16: Yeah. I know, but it's like, click, automatic, denied, you know?

523
00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:22.660
Jamie: Yeah.

524
00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.230
Participant 16: Great.

525
00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:34.329
Jamie: Almost fully expect that to be what happens on the real site. Oh, yeah. So, yeah, we don't… unless you have anything to add, you go ahead and… No, same thing. Yeah.

526
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:35.600
Participant 16: To continue.

527
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:37.149
Participant 16: Yep. Yeah.

528
00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:39.370
Participant 16: Review, signer.

529
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.659
Jamie: So we're not gonna submit the form.

530
00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:47.460
Participant 16: Okay.

531
00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:56.590
Jamie: So we're gonna stop you right here on this, and then I'm gonna send over the last attachment for you to look at.

532
00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:15.350
Participant 16: Okay, but on this, again, there's no place for me to input any of that information other than we scanned it and it wasn't there. Yeah. So, my comfort at this point that this is actually going to go through is probably about zero, because you said you couldn't verify the information, but you still want me to continue and send it to you, so how do I know if it's there? And I have no way to manually check it.

533
00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:20.509
Participant 16: Right? So, I think having a manual input to confirm, it says.

534
00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:34.840
Participant 16: This is the information I wanted. If I can't scan it, and you need price verification and everything else, and it's not validated, I'm gonna hit submit, and you're gonna get it, and I expect that you're gonna say, information not provided, right? Or you're gonna use some AI on the other end that's gonna say the same thing.

535
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:37.019
Participant 16: And then what?

536
00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.150
Participant 16: Like, so I would add a manual input option.

537
00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:41.979
Jamie: Okay. Yeah.

538
00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:46.010
Jamie: Sounds great, thank you. …

539
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:55.400
Jamie: So, we're gonna pretend like we submitted this form, and I'm gonna send that attachment over that says, example, CHAMPVA, then back letter, yeah.

540
00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:08.339
Jamie: So, imagine that you did submit this form, and you waited a certain amount of time, and then you received this letter in the mail. So if you could open that up and take a look at it, and let me know your thoughts on it.

541
00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.760
Jamie: That'd be awesome.

542
00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:20.799
Participant 16: You want me to log out of that webpage then, or do you want me to still stay there?

543
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:23.060
Participant 16: The browser.

544
00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:34.620
Jamie: You, you can get out, like, leave this, that's fine. I'll send you through a new link, when we're ready to hop back in the form, if you do have a few extra minutes, after we get through this next part.

545
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:43.589
Participant 16: Okay, here we go. Two non-special China claims, so…

546
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:31.919
Participant 16: So again, back to the diagnosis code, you're missing this, and be like, which one should I have been looking for? Or, you know, back to that first education on these are what the codes are, this is what it looks for, make sure it's here, it will look like this, right?

547
00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:37.300
Participant 16: then… This statement, it's your responsibility to provide this?

548
00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:44.100
Participant 16: Like… sorry, go F yourself, right? Like, no shit, like, I'm trying, you know, like, just….

549
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:44.890
Jamie: Yeah.

550
00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:48.330
Participant 16: This reads like a, it's your fault, this got denied.

551
00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.420
Participant 16: Like…

552
00:50:50.110 --> 00:51:01.269
Participant 16: Like, okay, you could say, we need this information in order to process your claim, not you have to go get it, because then it says, if you don't know how to have it and need help, click here, right? So I think you just change the language of…

553
00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:18.249
Participant 16: like, I get it, you're denying it because I didn't… you don't have all the information to process the claim, so use it as a, I care about you and I want to help, right? Return the letter because, you know, of reasons listed below. If there are claims, da-da-da-da, you may resubmit within one year of the attached, so you could put that language down here.

554
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:25.090
Participant 16: Of the one-year timeline, up in the top, and say, you may resubmit enclosed claims within one year of initial attached paperwork.

555
00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:44.699
Participant 16: Right? You know, either please send this claim to here, or go back into… if I can do it back online, right, can I go back into the claim in the start point and say, this is attached to a claim that was already submitted? So do I have to do this by mail, or do I actually have the ability to go log back in and say, if you know the diagnosis codes, you can call, or please go log back in and…

556
00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:49.990
Participant 16: And manually felt, again, manually felt the information. Because if it wasn't there, or it couldn't be read.

557
00:51:50.400 --> 00:52:08.919
Participant 16: So, I know I'd be super pissed if I know it was on the form, and you show me that you couldn't read it, and I couldn't manually put it in, and I uploaded it, and you go, yep, it's not there. Like, yeah, dipshit. I know you couldn't read it, and I could have given it to you on the computer, so now I gotta go wait even longer to get back to something I could have fixed at step one, if you would have let me

558
00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:13.080
Participant 16: identify the codes or manually put them in. You know, kind of a deal.

559
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:14.140
Participant 16: So….

560
00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.160
Jamie: Gotcha, yeah.

561
00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:23.069
Participant 16: And this one, like, we are not able to process a claim until we understand the diagnosis codes to match to other insurance. If you have any questions, please call us.

562
00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:23.690
Jamie: Hmm.

563
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.999
Participant 16: Versus, it's your responsibility to provide this. Like, shame on you.

564
00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:30.500
Participant 16: like… Just the tone sucks.

565
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.760
Jamie: Okay.

566
00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.440
Participant 16: Sorry, I mean, what about it.

567
00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.539
Jamie: No, we like people being blunt about this, this is why we do this.

568
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:50.680
Participant 16: like, again, brand persona. Who's your brand persona? If the VA wants the brand persona of caretaker, right, take a caretaker tone and, you know, put this into chat GPT. Please take a caretaker tone and rewrite this form as if we actually care about you. Okay.

569
00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:53.799
Participant 16: Like, I want to help, right?

570
00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:54.889
Jamie: Yeah. You know.

571
00:52:55.310 --> 00:53:04.970
Participant 16: Got it, yeah, no, no, that's… Not process this claim without accurate information. If you have any questions or want assistance, please call us, we'd love to help you. Information might be listed here. You know, just….

572
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:16.220
Jamie: So, what, yeah, that was, like, I love the, you know, people vending about this. This is what we want to hear.

573
00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:22.350
Participant 16: I don't think that's the intent. I don't think the intent is to deny you… the way you talk about it makes it seem like you don't really care.

574
00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:26.910
Jamie: Yeah, it's all… it's all about people's perceptions, on this, too.

575
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:31.320
Participant 16: And it's like, we call them no-shitters. Like, well, no shit, I have to give it to you. It's my responsibility, like…

576
00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:39.639
Participant 16: I've got that, you don't need to hit me in the face with it. I tried my best. Either your system didn't work, or I don't know what to do about it, so…

577
00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:40.580
Participant 16: like…

578
00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:49.700
Participant 16: It's like legal ease to cover their butt that they're not gonna pay for it, right? Yep, see, checkbox, don't have to pay a claim, you failed. Like…

579
00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.610
Participant 16: Anyways….

580
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:58.479
Jamie: So, at this point, if you receive this in the mail, what would your next steps be?

581
00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:05.900
Participant 16: If I knew that I provided it the first time, and I knew I did my due diligence when I submitted it, I'm just gonna leave it alone and have to eat the cost.

582
00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.360
Jamie: Okay. Interesting.

583
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:12.760
Jamie: Yeah, so you wouldn't… you would just not even bother to resolve it at this point?

584
00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:24.359
Participant 16: No, it would depend on the cost of the claim. Like, if it's, like, a $1,000 claim, and I really, really need it, like, I'm gonna try to keep working, but I'm gonna be very frustrated, and then I have to wait even longer if it was, like, a $40 or $50 claim on something.

585
00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:28.139
Participant 16: Like, I may not, depending on my financial status.

586
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:28.460
Jamie: Okay.

587
00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.239
Participant 16: the time value of money, right? That…

588
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.819
Participant 16: Like, is it even worth my time to try?

589
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:43.289
Participant 16: And if it's not, then I'm not gonna do it. But if I felt like I knew the diagnosis code was on the picture of what I sent you, and now you're telling me it's not there.

590
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:50.410
Participant 16: like, I may call, and hope I get through somebody, and then, depending on how long that wait's gonna be, like, hey, I'm calling about this, and…

591
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:59.530
Participant 16: What it doesn't say is, for questions called here, please have this claim number down below, or when you log in, please reference this claim number, and we'll be able to help you.

592
00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:06.459
Participant 16: You know, in that way, it seems like I can get to somebody specifically, and say, hey, I have the picture in front of me, the DX code was…

593
00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:09.840
Participant 16: this, right? And if I… again, if I knew…

594
00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:19.959
Participant 16: I had to start what I was looking for, what those codes look like, and I knew I was able to see that it was on the form. Great, but if I still don't know what a diagnosis code is, I don't even know what you're looking for to know how to go find it.

595
00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:23.990
Participant 16: Like, you're asking me to go find something, I don't know what it is or where to even begin.

596
00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:26.160
Participant 16: So, you have to educate them on

597
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:37.500
Participant 16: you know, what is a diagnosis code, what is a procedure code, what are these things? And if needed, please call your doctor and ask them to clarify, or, you know, drive back in and get this information from them on another form.

598
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:45.229
Participant 16: like, something, help me be my own advocate, because you're not gonna go to my hospital to go find that thing out. You're not gonna go to my provider to go get that stuff.

599
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:46.900
Participant 16: I may have to go do that.

600
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:48.000
Jamie: Yeah.

601
00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:51.880
Participant 16: So just… Educational awareness of just….

602
00:55:51.880 --> 00:56:05.300
Jamie: Yeah, I know, I get it. So let's say… and yeah, once again, thank you, like, much appreciated, like, getting real thoughts on these things, and how we can improve.

603
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:24.459
Jamie: Do you have an extra, like, 5 minutes to… Yep. Okay. Yeah, like I said, I know you're busy, you're at a conference, I don't want to keep you too much longer, here, but, like, you're, like, got a ton of great information here, so if we get to a certain point, that'd be great. But if anytime you gotta tuck out, just let me know.

604
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:35.489
Jamie: So, I'm gonna put that initial link, back to the form to get you back to the, first part of the form in the chat. I just put that through, so if you could….

605
00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:37.570
Participant 16: Where I was, or is it starting over again?

606
00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:52.700
Jamie: this is starting over again, so it's gonna clear everything out and have you start at the beginning. So, we're gonna say, so you got this letter in the mail, and then you decided to give it a try to upload whatever they needed you to upload online.

607
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.129
Jamie: So, yeah, if you could hop right back into that sign-in.

608
00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:03.550
Participant 16: I did, but I'm gonna go back, and it… it doesn't seem to say, if you want to, go… please go log back in.

609
00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:04.240
Jamie: Yeah.

610
00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.630
Participant 16: Right? It….

611
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:10.080
Jamie: Yeah, so yeah, definitely missing some information on here, which is.

612
00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:19.439
Participant 16: Yeah, like, if you have the information and want to go log back in to upload a new form, or manually fix this, please go back into your CHAMPVA and reference this numbered claim, or something like that.

613
00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.160
Jamie: Yeah.

614
00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.049
Participant 16: So, sorry, I was like.

615
00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:26.580
Participant 16: I didn't see anywhere on there that said, go log back in and redo it. It was, like, mail it back into here.

616
00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:31.059
Jamie: Yeah, so you're looking for that gap inform… like, that information filling that gap there.

617
00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:36.439
Participant 16: Yes. So, let's pretend that it did say that. Okay, now I'm back in again.

618
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:41.149
Jamie: Okay, scroll back down to that, Start Your Form Without Signing In link.

619
00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:45.799
Jamie: And, go through this form as if you're gonna try to resubmit it.

620
00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.279
Participant 16: Resubmission for an existing plan.

621
00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:09.659
Jamie: Okay, yeah, take a look at this, and let me know your thoughts on what you think it's asking for, and if you could find this information.

622
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:21.959
Participant 16: I mean, the number's at the bottom of the form, I can't remember what it is, a PDI or a control number, should I go back to the… the form and try to look at it. But again, if that was in the form, say, when you log back in, please reference this number, you know, and it's right in the middle of the form, or like.

623
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.660
Participant 16: You know, very easy to find.

624
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:27.180
Participant 16: So I'd go back to the example.

625
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:32.509
Participant 16: And even put claim number, this PDI number, on top.

626
00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:36.350
Participant 16: Right? Like, this claim is in reference to this.

627
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:40.919
Participant 16: You know, at the top, and then you may resubmit, or whatever.

628
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:43.840
Participant 16: You know, reason why.

629
00:58:44.110 --> 00:59:01.520
Participant 16: even though please send a submission to, that should be on the bottom, right? Like, you can move all this stuff up and say, you know, this is in reference to this claim, reasons for this letter are we're missing diagnosis codes. If you wish to resubmit online, please click here, right? Worst case, if you have to mail a claim in, please mail it to this. Like, it's, like, the last, very bottom information, not…

630
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.390
Participant 16: Please mail to Mike.

631
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:06.670
Participant 16: On top. Sorry, I'm just going back to look at it and reference.

632
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:16.300
Jamie: No, no, definitely. So, like, were you saying? You're expecting to see a different kind of, layout, like a hierarchy on this page, or on your letter?

633
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:24.520
Participant 16: of information, right? This is in reference to PDI claim number da-da-da, which you can find online or on this form. If you wish to go, you know.

634
00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:39.489
Participant 16: submit missing information, please go back online and reference this number, right? Reason for this letter is that it's being denied due to missing diagnosis codes. For questions about diagnosis codes, go here. If you wish to manually send in this information, you can mail a letter to this address. But, like.

635
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.520
Participant 16: It's a… it's backwards.

636
00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:49.280
Participant 16: Yeah. Extraneous information up front that has nothing to do with what I want to do now, or what I'm talking about, I gotta get past.

637
00:59:50.100 --> 01:00:06.259
Jamie: All right, great. So yeah, if you take a look through… just scroll through this page, yeah, let me… oh, great. Copy and paste. I was gonna… gonna ask you if you even just enter any kind of number in, but that works.

638
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:06.950
Participant 16: Right.

639
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:10.560
Participant 16: For PI numbers, you don't need to include the date at the beginning.

640
01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:14.370
Participant 16: Okay, so I guess you don't need that. Please start with this.

641
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.020
Participant 16: Fair.

642
01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:26.460
Participant 16: … Even that… info, like, where I would find it would be good.

643
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:33.580
Participant 16: Right? We'll use the program document identified number, control number, but yeah, these are found on… never mind, got it, it's on the letter.

644
01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:48.900
Participant 16: But if it came out and I put a digital submission, why isn't it already in the system? Right? Like, why is this claim not already a digital claim that I can click and see status of claim? Which would be great. If I have a status of claim report, I can log back in and go status of CHAMPVA claim is here.

645
01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:59.859
Participant 16: denied, like, why can't I log back in and see the denial, and not even have to have it mailed to me? And then I can go, okay, log back in and see status. Status was here. Got it? Denied by this.

646
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:08.799
Participant 16: We need this form, you can email me a notice that it got denied, not mail one to my house, which saved us time and money on printing, and then…

647
01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:14.989
Participant 16: You know, or pick, I want digital communication only, not manual, and save the vapor.

648
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:15.750
Participant 16: As well.

649
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:19.460
Jamie: You just answered so many questions I had in that one sentence.

650
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.520
Participant 16: So….

651
01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.160
Jamie: Yeah.

652
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:25.739
Participant 16: There you go.

653
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:26.880
Participant 16: Go ahead.

654
01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.730
Jamie: Continue.

655
01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:32.610
Jamie: And… oh!

656
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:36.869
Participant 16: It's a PDI number, sorry.

657
01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:39.939
Jamie: It was in there at one point.

658
01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:44.890
Participant 16: Yeah, I thought it was, too. … was…

659
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:47.560
Participant 16: What was the original type plan?

660
01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:54.180
Participant 16: Again, you should know that, because I just put in the number, and it's already referenced, so why am I having to click again?

661
01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:59.610
Participant 16: Provider name. You should already have this information, because I already gave it to you.

662
01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:02.200
Participant 16: …

663
01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:09.150
Participant 16: So now it's like the… oh, so this is kind of the manual form entry that could have been there on the first one.

664
01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.880
Participant 16: Yes.

665
01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:23.669
Participant 16: Getting big. This seems weird. I guess let's give you user interface.

666
01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.540
Participant 16: like, I've already submitted it, you have information, I denied it for UX code.

667
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:35.360
Participant 16: And now I'm having to go manually put in the information that you didn't ask me for the first time, that was on a form that may not be needed. Like…

668
01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:37.670
Participant 16: But why?

669
01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:38.910
Participant 16: Like, I don't…

670
01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:47.550
Participant 16: I feel like if it's a digital process and through, all this should already be found, because you already have it all, and you already denied my claim once. This is a waste of time.

671
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.490
Participant 16: This is an unnecessary waste of time.

672
01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:51.780
Jamie: Okay.

673
01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:02.669
Participant 16: No way it's gonna do it.

674
01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:08.840
Participant 16: Date of service…

675
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:15.090
Participant 16: Seconds.

676
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:20.970
Participant 16: And you even have a checkbox if this was a one-day appointment, click here, right?

677
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:21.640
Jamie: Hmm.

678
01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:23.269
Participant 16: Otherwise, that's fine.

679
01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:28.269
Jamie: Yeah, so you're looking for… to not enter so much information in, redundant information.

680
01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:42.559
Participant 16: Yeah, or beginning date of service, put, like, date of procedure, or date of appointment, not date of service, because I didn't get service, I went to the hospital. So I think just changing that language, like, please enter the date… the date of the exam, or the date of the appointment.

681
01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:50.250
Participant 16: And then, if multiple days, please enter the last date that service was provided, or if this was a… if this was a hospital stay.

682
01:03:50.560 --> 01:04:02.210
Participant 16: Right? Like, the only time you're gonna have a multi-date of service process is gonna be a hospital stay. Yeah. Because otherwise, it's individual build appointments, probably, at, or something. But help me understand why I'd have a date.

683
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:08.180
Participant 16: gap, because… like… Anyways, just looking at it of….

684
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:09.310
Jamie: Yeah.

685
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:11.699
Participant 16: I may feel like I have to put a number… a date in here.

686
01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:14.320
Participant 16: It says required. Yep.

687
01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:27.310
Participant 16: why can't I check the box, say, this was a one-day procedure? Click here. Versus, if this procedure occurred over multiple days, please enter the last date of your procedure. Or, if this is only applicable to a hospital stay.

688
01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:32.880
Participant 16: Tell me this is only applicable to a hospital stay or inpatient treatment, where you were…

689
01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:47.920
Participant 16: you know, receiving additional benefits for… because if I read this, I might say, like, hey, I had physical therapy, and I went back every week, but every week I'm being charged, so is this a one-day claim, or do you want to know the last day I went to physical therapy, and you're gonna get error? You're gonna get date error, or data error entry that's going to cause rejections.

690
01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.440
Participant 16: Because it's unclear.

691
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:56.400
Jamie: Yeah, no, I get it. Yeah, so you're looking for something to accommodate multiple kind of situations here.

692
01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:13.530
Participant 16: Yeah, but I think your common… your common situation is, I went into a doctor for one day, they had one thing happen. If that's your norm, right, I would just put, please enter date of appointment, or please enter date of service, date, I mean, service is odd, please enter the date of

693
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:18.400
Participant 16: You know, the date, the, you know, claim, or the date of the procedure.

694
01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:27.689
Participant 16: And then, please check here if procedure occurred over multiple days or was for inpatient hospital stay, and then open up a, please enter last date of service.

695
01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.560
Participant 16: Right, so it's the exception, not the normal.

696
01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:41.030
Participant 16: process, and I think all this would be great to have on the original claim submission that would have already been provided, because that way you can validate the form that didn't get seen the first time.

697
01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:46.790
Participant 16: This should not be on a supplemental thing. I'd rather have this part of the original procedure.

698
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:54.829
Participant 16: You know, and have it auto-scan the form to auto-fill it in, if possible, and if you scan the form and can't find it, then let me just go manually put it in the first time.

699
01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:55.890
Jamie: Sure.

700
01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:57.619
Jamie: Yeah, sounds fair.

701
01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:58.820
Participant 16: So…

702
01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:11.630
Participant 16: So this is the last page that I'll have you look at, here. So same thing, you don't have to upload anything on this page, just looking for your thoughts on, the content itself and what it's telling you to do.

703
01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.249
Participant 16: I mean, it's asked me to upload…

704
01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:21.740
Participant 16: documents, but back to frustrations, if I don't have any additional documents, and all I'm gonna do is upload the same thing that you denied the first time, because…

705
01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.469
Participant 16: It was complete.

706
01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:27.260
Participant 16: And I have no way to manually enter the information that was missing.

707
01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:31.139
Participant 16: This is a self-licking ice cream cone.

708
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:40.230
Jamie: Okay, so you're, you would, if I'm understanding correctly, you… for, more of a manual entry for missing items?

709
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:51.759
Participant 16: Possibly, because, I mean, I'll go back to my own VA claim procedure. I submitted a request [redacted] that I had, and the VA wrote back saying, you're denied because you don't have [redacted].

710
01:06:52.170 --> 01:07:11.619
Participant 16: I'm like, no shit, I didn't ask for that. So I asked for that request to be evaluated 3 separate times before I finally had somebody actually let me see a doctor to get that added to my medical… even though it's in my medical record while I was a Marine, on active duty, it took me 3 requests to get the VA to even analyze that as a potential for my VA disability claim. So…

711
01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:16.370
Participant 16: In this case, if I submitted the form and I knew all the information was on it.

712
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:25.359
Participant 16: and I validated a UX code that you told me to go look up, and I know it's complete, and I have no other forms to give you. You want me to re-upload the same form I already sent you that you rejected?

713
01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.530
Participant 16: So I'm gonna get denied again.

714
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:28.740
Jamie: Okay.

715
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:33.920
Participant 16: I have no recourse if… everything I had was already submitted.

716
01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:38.119
Participant 16: To put any comments, or any manual override, or any statement that says.

717
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:42.860
Participant 16: This is the information you were lacking, or a direct number to call in reference to this claim.

718
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.940
Participant 16: So….

719
01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:51.100
Jamie: Okay. Well, thank you for sharing. Any other, last thoughts about this page?

720
01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:59.229
Participant 16: No, first I want to say thank you guys for doing this, because I think it's really cool, you want to make it better, so I'm glad the VA is allowing you to take this study. I hope it was helpful, but I think.

721
01:07:59.230 --> 01:07:59.920
Jamie: Okay.

722
01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.860
Participant 16: Pure Digital.

723
01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:19.180
Participant 16: you know, if I log back in and see the information already provided the first time, I know it's the status of a claim because it's already there, like, that just goes, okay, cool, I can see where it was, and if I could track digital status of progress, even for processing, that goes, I know it was submitted on this day, I can see it was received at. So, like, using a Salesforce through tool or whatever that, like.

724
01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:30.369
Participant 16: here's the status of, it was reviewed on this date by this person, your claim was missing this information. Please provide this one block of information. So I click back in and go, UX number was X, here's the form that had it, resubmit.

725
01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:36.929
Participant 16: like, I think there's so many ways that can make this much, much faster and much, much easier on everybody, that….

726
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:57.389
Jamie: Yeah, definitely, and I… doing these interviews, too, kind of give us a little bit more insight in what everybody's looking for and what goal we ultimately want to get to. So that's… that's super helpful information, like, for people to share, like, what their idea… or ideal, experience would be, so thank you so much.

727
01:08:57.390 --> 01:09:04.089
Jamie: So, I do want to close this out, before that, do you have any questions for me?

728
01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:11.540
Participant 16: No, I think this is great. Again, I know I'm probably being a little harsh, but I just think there's a lot of ways to make it really cool.

729
01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:15.389
Jamie: You're, you are fine. We, like I said, we appreciate all this.

730
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:20.389
Jamie: And we, we like, we like to be beat up a little bit.

731
01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:30.869
Participant 16: I mean, you guys are trying, that's why I know it's not you, it's… you're trying to fix a system and make it better, so you're dealing with what was already there, and you're trying to improve it, so I appreciate that. Thank you guys for your time, sorry we went a little bit long, but….

732
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:37.200
Jamie: No worries. One last thing, I do gotta, repeat that question that I asked you in the beginning.

733
01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:43.610
Participant 16: All of my stuff on this form, again, you can answer it, and I'll just say yes if you want to, but you can use the recording, you can use all of this.

734
01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:52.310
Jamie: Okay, so, just, I guess I do gotta read this. So, you're confirming that you're comfortable if we share a video clip of this session today with our VA partners.

735
01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:52.849
Participant 16: Yes.

736
01:09:53.060 --> 01:10:07.030
Jamie: Okay, great, and once again, like, really appreciate it. Appreciate you taking extra 18 minutes of your time, just to talk to us about this. Like I said, this is… this is very helpful, and we love hearing your insights, so, …

737
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:31.990
Jamie: Just, right, one last thing before we go. Perigean will be sending you out a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans, that you may know to provide them a chance to participate in future studies with that. We all know how helpful this is, so hopefully we get this form, improved. We can get the whole entire VA experience proved one day, through, having studies like this with, you and your fellow

738
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:34.930
Jamie: veterans. So, once again, thank you so much.

739
01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:35.460
Jamie: And….

740
01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:41.710
Participant 16: You're welcome. Y'all have a great day and a weekend coming up, so… Oh, yes, you as well. Bye, y'all.

741
01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:43.580
Jamie: Thank you, bye.
