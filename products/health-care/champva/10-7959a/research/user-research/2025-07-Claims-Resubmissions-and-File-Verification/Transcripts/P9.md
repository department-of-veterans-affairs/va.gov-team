00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.000
Jamie: Alright, ready to go.

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:20.210
Jamie: And let me just ask those two questions again. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? Yep, okay. Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today? Yes. Okay.

3
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.689
Jamie: Great! So, …

4
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:33.010
Jamie: Just a couple questions before we actually dive into this. Are you or anybody in your household currently enrolled in CHAMP VA?

5
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.310
P9: Me.

6
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.380
Jamie: You? Okay. Great. How long ago did you, apply for CHAMPVA?

7
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.600
P9: Maybe 4, 3, 4, 5 years ago?

8
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.000
Jamie: Okay.

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.640
P9: It was a long process.

10
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.240
Jamie: It was a long process. Do you remember anything in particular about your experience?

11
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.079
P9: You don't want to know. I submitted my paperwork as soon as I was eligible.

12
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.900
Jamie: Yeah.

13
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.719
P9: And… Right now, it's currently a 6-month wait, if you're lucky. It can be longer.

14
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.539
P9: And I don't know how familiar you are with CHAMPVA, but

15
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:20.350
P9: It's tough. I get that they're short-staffed, I get that they don't have the ability, there's… they just came online with being able to submit an application the end of last year.

16
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.680
Jamie: Yep.

17
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:29.240
P9: And they just started this year allowing you to submit claims online. Which, unfortunately, I think bogs down the system, but when I applied.

18
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.470
P9: I applied.

19
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:48.190
P9: And I gave it a couple of months and never heard anything, so I called, and another thing with Championicus, I don't know how familiar you are, but if your… if your application isn't actually being processed and entered into the system, they can't even tell you if they've received it.

20
00:01:48.290 --> 00:02:07.979
P9: Oh, yeah. It gets there, gets put in a pile, and it sits there for 3 or 4 months before they do anything. So if someone calls 3 months after they submit and says, can you tell me if you have my application? They cannot. And what they end up doing a lot of times is saying, resubmit it, which, again, bogs down the system. But.

21
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:16.030
P9: I applied, and a couple of minutes later, I called, and they said, yep, I was active, but I needed to wait, and blah, they were finishing up.

22
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.039
P9: Call back in a week. I called back in a week.

23
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:31.119
P9: And, they said, no, there's nothing here, call back in a week, you're not even in. Call back in a week. Huh, looks like we don't have any of your paperwork. Don't know how they did two weeks ago and didn't then. I ended up

24
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:40.859
P9: having to get my congressman involved, and within 2 weeks, I had my CHAMPVA. Now, mind you, my paperwork was faxed from a VA location.

25
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:51.189
P9: I had the confirmation that it went, all the pages, but they still… nope, they had it, and then they didn't. So, it was a long process, and then…

26
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.970
P9: It put me in as a guy.

27
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.889
Jamie: Oh, are you kidding me? You're kidding.

28
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.799
P9: Nope, nope. It took another 3 or 4 months to get that straight. I couldn't do any.

29
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.710
P9: Oh….

30
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.140
P9: They asked me to complete a change of gender form.

31
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.429
P9: Hello? I've never been a guy in my life, okay?

32
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.259
Jamie: I've never even heard of that form before, that's interesting.

33
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.509
P9: They wanted me to do that, yeah. Anyway, that was my….

34
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:28.160
Jamie: sorry to hear that. I'm hoping, with all these online forms, and I know they're, they're trying to update their back-end systems as well, that it will, it'll get better, someday, but I feel for the people who are now.

35
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.020
P9: When people are trying to enroll a newborn, trust me, that's not me.

36
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.680
Jamie: Yeah.

37
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.659
P9: No. But when people are trying to enroll a newborn, and a pediatrician won't see that newborn.

38
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:57.539
P9: Until they have active CHAMP VA. Can't submit for CHAMP VA until you've got birth certificate and social, and it takes the same amount of time for that newborn to get entered as it does for any other Tom, Dick, or Harry. Six months. So, a newborn is going without doctor checks, or regular

39
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.470
P9: PEDS visits because CHAMP VA is taking so long.

40
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.789
Jamie: Completely understand. Yeah, when we've heard the same story,

41
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:23.249
P9: It's brutal. And I'm a member of many Facebook groups, Champ VA-related, and I get all the input I can, but I see so many people who are just so frustrated with the system. What they don't get is, it's a free thing. We don't pay for it. Yeah. So, you get it.

42
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:39.010
P9: You could say, no, I don't want it, fine, but why would you? It's free, it doesn't cost you anything, your co-pays aren't really co-pays, it's a cost share, but still, it's a very beneficial thing, but many people have problems that doctors won't accept it either. So, alright, I'm done.

43
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.220
Jamie: Yeah, no problem. Like I said, we want to hear it.

44
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.360
P9: But I won't.

45
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.019
Jamie: Have you, submitted any, claims

46
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.560
Jamie: For CHAMPVA?

47
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.669
P9: I am lucky, I have not had to submit a claim. Okay. Here's why. Because…

48
00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:07.830
P9: Last year, in November on my birthday, I became age 65, which means I now have to have Medicare in order to keep CHAMPVA. Not sure if you know that. Yep. When you have Medicare and CHAMPVA?

49
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.310
P9: Chances are, you're never gonna pay anything.

50
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:20.100
P9: Nothing. It's… every time I've gone to the doctor, it's zero for me. I've paid for one prescription over the counter, but that's it.

51
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:36.380
P9: Otherwise, it's a zero, so I… unless the doctor's office ever submitted the claim improperly, then it may be up to me to resubmit, but if a doctor's office or anything ever did, I would tell them, it's on them. You submit it right, or you don't get paid. Simple.

52
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.450
P9: I'm playing the game.

53
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.170
Jamie: Yeah.

54
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.699
Jamie: Very cool. Well, I'm happy you don't have, or didn't have the opportunity to, ….

55
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.380
P9: I'm sorry.

56
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:58.970
Jamie: do the… submit the claim, that everything has been pretty smooth since then. But for the people that do need to, and if you eventually do need to, we're working on trying to streamline that a little bit.

57
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:11.210
Jamie: So, I'm gonna drop a link in the chat, and I know you're familiar with these types of studies, so if you see the chat, there's a link in there, and that should be… that should go to our, demo tool.

58
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.720
Jamie: For the, the claims form.

59
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.689
Jamie: And yeah, before you open that, just make sure that you close down anything you don't want us to see, or any notifications.

60
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.280
P9: What?

61
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.900
P9: What are we talking about?

62
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.399
Jamie: Oh, did you not see the link in the chat?

63
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.719
P9: No, I got it.

64
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.029
Jamie: You got it? Okay.

65
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.060
P9: Hitting it now.

66
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.010
Jamie: Okay, great.

67
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.360
Jamie: Let me know when it's up and you're ready to go.

68
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.630
P9: It's here, file a Champ BA claim.

69
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:45.490
Jamie: Yeah, that might be on my side. I know, like, the Zoom on my server is not exactly speedy.

70
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:53.209
Jamie: So if you could go ahead, if you don't mind sharing your screen, so we could take a look at the form together.

71
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.119
P9: Tell me how I do that.

72
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.579
P9: Okay, are you on a desktop, or are you on mobile? On an iPad.

73
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:10.199
Jamie: My bad. Alright, hold on, let me just get my instructions. So, you should be able to tap the screen, and that will display the medium… the… the meeting controls. Apologize, it's a Monday, I can't talk.

74
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.670
P9: No, it might… it… Nope.

75
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.520
P9: It might if I was still in the Zoom, but because I'm not really.

76
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.929
Jamie: Oh, okay. Is there any way to get back to the Zoom?

77
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.050
P9: How do I get back there?

78
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.180
Jamie: ….

79
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.639
P9: I don't want to disconnect.

80
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.730
Jamie: Yep, we'll try not to get you disconnected. ….

81
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.129
P9: I'll come right back, but I don't want to.

82
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.040
Jamie: Yeah, I'm trying to think, because I don't have an iPad in front of me, I should have grabbed the one.

83
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.739
P9: But I don't see… all I see is your picture, and if I hit that picture, what's gonna happen?

84
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.150
Jamie: … I'm…

85
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.820
Jamie: Give it a shot. It might… it might bring you back. I don't think it is gonna disconnect.

86
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.890
P9: Hold on.

87
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.539
P9: Here I am.

88
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.600
Jamie: Alright, great.

89
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.680
P9: share.

90
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.159
P9: I think I saw a share button down the bottom.

91
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.489
Jamie: Yeah, it should be, on the bottom.

92
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.189
P9: Share screen. You may see notifications, but hey.

93
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.040
Jamie: That's… okay, only if you're comfortable with it.

94
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.320
P9: Well, I have cameras, so if my dog moves, you may see a notification.

95
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.370
Jamie: Okay.

96
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.880
P9: It's taken a minute.

97
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.019
Jamie: Yeah, it might take a minute.

98
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.350
Jamie: It's good old Zoom.

99
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.690
Jamie: I do see that it's working, something's loading.

100
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:34.190
P9: Yeah, everything on my screen will be recorded, including notifications. Shh!

101
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:41.029
P9: You'll see notifications, my dog moving around, because I have cameras, because I have to watch my husband.

102
00:08:41.629 --> 00:08:42.599
Jamie: No worries.

103
00:08:43.449 --> 00:08:46.009
Jamie: We are okay with that, if you're okay with it.

104
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.680
P9: [NAME] says it's doing something, but I don't know what.

105
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.430
Jamie: Yeah.

106
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.089
P9: I'm gonna hit that link.

107
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.170
P9: Are we sharing?

108
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.920
Jamie: Yes, perfect. Okay. We got it. Yeah.

109
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.899
Jamie: Okay. …

110
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:20.329
Jamie: Yeah, hold on, let me just scroll down to where I need to be on my list of questions here. So, before you start filling out the form, just a reminder, it's a testing site, so we won't actually be submitting the form today, so nothing you click on the site, as I said before, has any bearing on your benefits.

111
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:30.129
Jamie: As we go through the form, feel free to just use some fake information. Yep. Just make up things, especially when it comes to social security numbers and birthdates, we don't want you entering.

112
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.459
P9: Don't worry, you're not getting nuts from me.

113
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:46.659
Jamie: Sorry, I didn't think so. And then, as we talked before, we may ask you to upload, or we are going to ask you to upload some documents, and you did say that you got them from Perigine, so when we get there, we'll, we'll work through that and.

114
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.240
P9: Oh, yeah, but I didn't save them over here. Oh, boy.

115
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.319
Jamie: Oh, okay.

116
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.969
Jamie: I have them, also on my desktop then.

117
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.920
P9: on my phone, but I didn't save them on my iPad, because I wasn't aware that I was going to need them.

118
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.839
Jamie: Okay, that's no problem. I have them, I could drop them in the Zoom chat, and we could…

119
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:13.910
Jamie: see if we could figure out how to upload them. If not, it's fine, but we'll work around it, when we get there. I've dealt with all kinds of things before.

120
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:23.849
Jamie: Yeah. So, yeah, without clicking on anything on this page, I just wanted you to take a look through the information and just tell us your initial thoughts, like, what do you think.

121
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.720
P9: It's all very familiar to me.

122
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:31.660
Jamie: Okay. So, in your own words, what do you think, this page is describing to you?

123
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.689
P9: Telling me to file my CHAMPVA claim here.

124
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.310
Jamie: Okay, and ….

125
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:41.779
P9: Again, it's all very familiar, because I access all kinds of VA websites, My HealthyVet and all of that.

126
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.170
Jamie: Okay.

127
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:47.040
P9: multiple times, I've done it a million. So, it all looks exactly the same.

128
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:54.660
Jamie: Great. Yeah, so, taking a look at this page, what information do you think you'll need to fill out this form?

129
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.690
P9: What do I think I'll need?

130
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.380
Jamie: Yeah.

131
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.420
P9: Well, it's gonna be within a year of when I got care.

132
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:11.139
P9: And I'll need separate claims for each beneficiary, and I'll need all kinds of stuff. I'll need my EOBs from any other health insurance, my itemized billing.

133
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:18.619
P9: statement, which I believe I can ask for a super bill from a provider, and they'll give me… and it will have everything on it that I need.

134
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.500
Jamie: Great

135
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:29.449
Jamie: Would this… so, if you were filling this out in real life, would these be something that you have on hand before you go into the form, or would you need to pause.

136
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.940
P9: Oh, I would make sure I had everything already saved and ready to go.

137
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.800
Jamie: Okay, great.

138
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:39.850
P9: I would never do anything without that. But again, I wasn't aware that I was gonna need those documents that I got from you guys, so…

139
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.010
P9: I apologize.

140
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.550
Jamie: No, that's fine. Like I said, it's, it's a different kind of study that we're doing,

141
00:11:46.890 --> 00:12:06.109
Jamie: sometimes we… we do some, uploads that we hand out to people, other times we usually just do it, you know, on the fly, or ask you to just upload whatever you have on your thing. So, no worries there. But yeah, awesome. It sounds like you're… you're very prepared if you do need to submit a claim,

142
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:25.009
Jamie: So, on a scale of 1 to 5, and there's gonna be several of these rating questions in this study, but here's the first one. On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being poorly, 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel to file a claim based on this page's content?

143
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.219
P9: I feel very good about it, is that what I'm supposed to say?

144
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.650
Jamie: You're… there is no right or wrong or.

145
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:40.809
P9: Whatever's the top, because I… it tells me here everything I need. I know how to log in to the VA or Gov website, I know how to have all my paperwork.

146
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.299
Jamie: Great! So yeah, that would be a 5.

147
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:43.660
P9: Yep.

148
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:51.820
Jamie: super prepared for it. So, at this point, I'm going to have you scroll down through that link that says, start your form without signing in.

149
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.509
P9: I was already waiting for that.

150
00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.750
Jamie: Yeah, you already know the deal.

151
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:56.700
P9: signing in.

152
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.119
P9: So you want me to click sign, start without signing in?

153
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.559
Jamie: Yeah, so we're gonna do this as a guest, user.

154
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:15.270
Jamie: So, just a reminder, it's your testing… this is the testing site, so none of this information is going anywhere. So, you know, again, just use that fake information in here.

155
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:26.030
Jamie: And as you go through the form, just remember to think out loud. I know you're already prepped for this, we do want to hear any reactions you're having as experiencing this form, so we love them.

156
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.450
P9: I'm doing this as if it was myself, right?

157
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.100
Jamie: You could do it either way. If you want to do it as yourself, go ahead.

158
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.359
P9: I'm the beneficiary submitting a claim for myself, is what I'm checking. Can I go?

159
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:43.869
Jamie: Yep, you're good. I'll stop you if I have any questions, but yeah. Do I receive benefits now? Yes. Yes.

160
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:50.389
P9: Is this a new claim for resubmission? I'm gonna say it's a new claim, or did you want me to say resubmission?

161
00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.490
Jamie: Now we're gonna do a new claim right now.

162
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.160
P9: Okay.

163
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.050
P9: Okay, here we go, Susie.

164
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.690
P9: Oh, Susie Brown sounds good.

165
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.220
P9: Nope, no suffix. Continue. Oh, man, why?

166
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.240
P9: Everyone's meat.

167
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.010
Jamie: Yeah, well, I didn't think….

168
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.539
P9: I don't know.

169
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.200
Jamie: Okay.

170
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:30.369
P9: Oh, there it is, there wasn't a birthday there. [DATE].

171
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.930
P9: [YEAR].

172
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.740
P9: Okay? Hope I don't have to remember that birthdate.

173
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.809
P9: Okay, CHAMPVA number.

174
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.469
P9: Do you just want me to put in 9 digits?

175
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.260
Jamie: Yeah.

176
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:58.530
Jamie: And we'll see if it accepts it. Sometimes it has problems with consecutive numbers. Oh, awesome! It worked this time.

177
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.639
P9: I don't even know. I'm just typing whatever comes to my head.

178
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.629
P9: Oh, I don't need that. That's… that was my town.

179
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.100
P9: My town is gonna be [CITY].

180
00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.900
P9: And it's gonna be in… [STATE].

181
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.520
Jamie: Oh….

182
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.289
P9: I don't know, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

183
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.900
Jamie: That works.

184
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.630
P9: Has it changed? Can I say no?

185
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:38.840
Jamie: Sure.

186
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:50.090
P9: Oh… 1… no, I better do this. 7, 1, 2… Okay.

187
00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.280
P9: Any fake email I want.

188
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.090
Jamie: Yep.

189
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.290
Jamie: Just as long as it has that at symbol, you're good.

190
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.430
P9: Okay?

191
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.790
Jamie: Alright, yep.

192
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:08.180
Jamie: Flying through it. For this one, we're gonna click, yes, you do have a health insurance, or other health insurance.

193
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.010
P9: Do you want me to put what I have, or something fake?

194
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.480
Jamie: If something fake's fine.

195
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:25.199
P9: Name of Blue Cross. That sounds pretty good, right?

196
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.380
Jamie: Yep. Fake numbers.

197
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:36.819
Jamie: Yeah, fake numbers work just fine. Is this something that you might have on hand in real life, or would you need to take a pause to go get it?

198
00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.389
P9: I would know, because it's Medicare, and I know that.

199
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.470
Jamie: Okay.

200
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.999
P9: I know my information.

201
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:43.980
Jamie: Great!

202
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.720
P9: Is that what you're asking me?

203
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.440
Jamie: Yeah.

204
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.019
P9: Nope, I wouldn't know it.

205
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.680
Jamie: Yep, some people don't, so we just wanna… Figure that out.

206
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.839
P9: Alright, am I good?

207
00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.050
Jamie: Yeah.

208
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.500
P9: Oh, man.

209
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:07.459
P9: Do you have a… particular thing you want me to say here? Should I say employer, individual, what?

210
00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.749
Jamie: It doesn't matter. It'll move you through, no matter what you pick.

211
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.209
P9: It's not employer, but, you know.

212
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.470
Jamie: Yeah, well, for today.

213
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.250
P9: Alright, can I say no now, because I've added one?

214
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.920
Jamie: Yep, we just need you to add one. Yeah, you're good to go.

215
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.800
Jamie: And then we're gonna submit a medical claim today.

216
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:30.520
P9: No.

217
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.610
Jamie: Yeah, these ones don't matter.

218
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.450
P9: Do you want me to say yes or no?

219
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:39.910
Jamie: It doesn't matter. But if… Whatever you want to pick today.

220
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.590
P9: Ow.

221
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.559
Jamie: Alright, so this is, ….

222
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.090
P9: Yes, sir.

223
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.660
Jamie: The meat of this, that we're testing.

224
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:55.609
P9: But I'm aware of what they need. I've seen it all, and that's why I say, I think if you call a provider and ask them for a super bill.

225
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.110
P9: Yeah. It won't have every single thing on here.

226
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.100
Jamie: Okay, that's… that's great to know. …

227
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:11.710
Jamie: So you do know what… what they're asking for, and then you do… do you know what needs to be included on the document itself, on that super bill?

228
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.849
P9: Yeah, well, it needs their…

229
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:28.080
P9: tax ID number, it has to have the codes, the diagnosis codes, the procedure terminal codes, and all the medical codes. It has to have everything on that bill, or it won't… or Champier probably wouldn't even look at it.

230
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.480
Jamie: Okay.

231
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:34.160
P9: And of course, it has to have my name and my date of birth, and probably my social, as far as I know.

232
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:41.080
Jamie: Okay, so this is where we're gonna, upload those documents, so I'm gonna get that…

233
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.830
Jamie: Oh, go ahead.

234
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.860
P9: I said, sure we are.

235
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:53.789
Jamie: Yeah, we're gonna try. So, while I'm trying to get this up here, you can take a look and just read through this, and then hopefully we can…

236
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.729
Jamie: Get these uploaded. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.

237
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.899
Jamie: Let's see if my, ….

238
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:11.320
P9: I'm afraid to leave this page that we get disconnected, so I'm afraid to do anything until you tell me.

239
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:21.010
Jamie: Yeah, well, … We'll see how it goes. Mine is getting all crazy right here, too.

240
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.610
Jamie: Sign into my account, I've already signed in. Come on, Zoom. Really?

241
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.780
P9: I wish I had a document saved.

242
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:35.059
Jamie: Yeah, you don't have anything on your computer that you could… or on your iPad that.

243
00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.560
P9: Let me see what happens when I click Upload File.

244
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:38.730
Jamie: Okay.

245
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.799
P9: I'm gonna go to my photo library.

246
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.320
Jamie: Yeah, it could literally be anything for this.

247
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:56.689
P9: Hold on, I'm trying to see… how many photo uploads do I have to… how many uploads do I have to do?

248
00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:02.509
Jamie: You just have to do the one for this, and then there's gonna be another page that asks you for another one, and that's it.

249
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.199
P9: That's a… that's a… Photo, so that might not work.

250
00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:14.529
Jamie: Yeah, you could… it's just literally any document, you could upload a photo, too.

251
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:15.740
P9: Let me try this.

252
00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:16.830
Jamie: Okay.

253
00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.120
P9: I… well….

254
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:18.730
Jamie: Oh.

255
00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.410
P9: They can't accept it.

256
00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.439
Jamie: Upload your file, I can't accept this type.

257
00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.789
Jamie: Oh, I know why, ….

258
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.960
P9: that's a JPEG.

259
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.730
Jamie: Yeah.

260
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.280
P9: That's why I said I didn't think I could upload a photo.

261
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:32.380
Jamie: Hmm.

262
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:41.199
Jamie: It should have taken a JPEG, and that's weird. I'm wondering it, because we've seen, errors in the past with Apple, photos.

263
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.979
Jamie: Like, straight from the photo library, so it might be that.

264
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:50.580
P9: I wonder if it'll let me do this. It's an item I had looked up, and…

265
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.249
P9: was gonna order on Kohl's.

266
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:53.880
Jamie: Okay.

267
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.449
P9: Of course, it has my… oh, it's letting me do it.

268
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.570
Jamie: Oh, cool. Yeah, we're not… it doesn't go anywhere, we're not saving it, ….

269
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.800
P9: Okay.

270
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.490
Jamie: So… so….

271
00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.360
P9: I just think so….

272
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:17.849
Jamie: I was gonna say, just take a look at this page, let me know what you think. If you notice anything peculiar… peculiar? Unique? Let me change words that I could actually say.

273
00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.140
Jamie: ….

274
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:29.579
P9: Oh, look, you'll need to submit a copy of an itemized billing statement, often called a super bill. Ta-da!

275
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.069
Jamie: Yeah, awesome.

276
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.030
P9: I knew that.

277
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.969
Jamie: That's great. That's not really common knowledge, either.

278
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:39.730
P9: not.

279
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:40.670
Jamie: No,

280
00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:51.289
P9: Well, I knew it, and I've not ever had to submit one, but I knew it. Again, I follow many pages, and I am familiar with the whole process, but I figured it was best I get knowledgeable.

281
00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.399
Jamie: So I would know in the future.

282
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.870
P9: But I… to me, it looks fine, and my document's there, and I'm ready to roll.

283
00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.170
Jamie: Okay, what about that yellow box down there that just popped up?

284
00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.399
P9: Well, they can't complete verification

285
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.130
P9: or I can continue without verifying, and for me, I would continue without verifying, because

286
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:16.579
P9: really, I don't know what they want to verify. It doesn't say what they're trying to verify.

287
00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.050
Jamie: Alright.

288
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.590
P9: For me, personally, I would say continue without verifying.

289
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:21.760
Jamie: Okay.

290
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:27.770
P9: Because nowhere does it… nowhere does it say you need to verify a, a… Upload.

291
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.030
Jamie: Okay. That's fair enough. You could go ahead and continue.

292
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.939
P9: But you want me to say, no, I want to verify it, right?

293
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:44.360
Jamie: No, it's just however you would do it, but, like, for the purpose of the study, we'll just continue on, even though there was a… it's, you know, an error right now.

294
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.570
P9: Well, again, if it were me, and I was doing this for myself, I would continue without verifying.

295
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:50.300
Jamie: Okay.

296
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.779
P9: And hope that later it might verify it.

297
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:53.590
Jamie: Okay.

298
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.200
P9: Maybe the wrong assumption.

299
00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.999
Jamie: No wrong assumptions here.

300
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.020
P9: Oh, well….

301
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:09.029
Jamie: Alright. Same, same thing for this page, just let me know what you think, and in your own words, just kind of describe what it is asking for.

302
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.000
P9: to ask him for the EOB from Blue Cross.

303
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:12.940
Jamie: Okay.

304
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.349
P9: And I know that.

305
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.890
Jamie: Okay, and what types of information, would be on that, or would they want on that EOV?

306
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:28.279
P9: I would want to know probably all of the information, the tax ID number, all of my information would need to be on there. What they paid would probably be on there.

307
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.020
Jamie: Okay.

308
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.500
P9: And all the codes and everything have to be on there, so…

309
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:41.590
P9: Not a super bill, because that's not gonna come from Blue Cross, but if Blue Cross is paying it, it's gonna have all of my information on it.

310
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:42.920
Jamie: Okay.

311
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:54.969
Jamie: Sounds good. So, just want to draw your attention to that blue box down there. If you could take a read through that, let me know what you think it's… what it's doing, or what it… what it says.

312
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:55.980
Jamie: Here.

313
00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.139
P9: Well, it sounds like it wants me to upload something else.

314
00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.320
P9: the EOB, maybe?

315
00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:08.680
Jamie: Yep.

316
00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.910
P9: So, I have to upload another file.

317
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.849
Jamie: Yeah, you can upload the same one.

318
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:15.380
P9: Heh!

319
00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:23.239
Jamie: Nothing's… nothing's kind of hooked up in the backend, for this file verification right now, so….

320
00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.340
P9: [NAME], do you think I can find that file?

321
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.119
P9: Ready to go.

322
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.270
P9: Oh, for crying out loud.

323
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.070
P9: Thing is, I have a lot of documents here that… oh, there it is, same document.

324
00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:45.630
Jamie: Awesome.

325
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.220
P9: Again, it's not gonna complete my verification.

326
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.070
Jamie: Yep.

327
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:57.639
Jamie: So, being that it failed twice now, basically, what would then your next steps be?

328
00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:58.610
P9: Well…

329
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:07.220
P9: My guess is they're saying that the document isn't Correct.

330
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.750
Jamie: Okay. In what ways would it be incorrect?

331
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:18.119
P9: well, it maybe doesn't have the proper information, but I don't know how quick they could tell me that when I upload a document, because…

332
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.199
P9: Doesn't say anything about how to verify.

333
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.110
Jamie: Okay.

334
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.190
P9: It just says we can't verify it.

335
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.409
Jamie: Okay, so it's, it's very vague information on here as well.

336
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:34.230
P9: Absolutely. It doesn't tell me what's wrong, and it doesn't tell me how they verify it, and what I need to do to get it verified.

337
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.899
Jamie: If it's dead.

338
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:42.939
P9: double-check it, make sure it says this, this, this, then I know I would double-check it and make sure it says all of that, but because it doesn't.

339
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.699
P9: I, as the end user here on this end, would say, I don't know what you want.

340
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:48.810
Jamie: Okay.

341
00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:55.170
P9: Because I would assume… here I am assuming I've uploaded a regular EOB from Blue Cross.

342
00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:02.920
P9: So, and knowing… me, knowing what needs to be on there, I would have… I would have looked at it and said, everything's there.

343
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:08.599
P9: So they're telling me it's not verified, but it doesn't tell me why or how to verify it.

344
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.330
Jamie: Mmm.

345
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:15.759
Jamie: So you're looking for more specific details on how to fix the problem.

346
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.479
P9: Because I know it's the right document. Tell me how I get it verified.

347
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:35.909
Jamie: Okay. Yeah, so, talking about file verification, you know, based on your experience with uploading these files so far, would you prefer some sort of file verification, or prefer just not to have it?

348
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.670
P9: Well…

349
00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:47.519
P9: If they need the files verified in order to accept them and process my claim, absolutely they need to be verified. However, tell me what's wrong.

350
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:48.490
Jamie: Okay.

351
00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:49.920
P9: Tell me what's wrong.

352
00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.130
Jamie: Tell me if I continue without verifying that my claim's gonna go nowhere.

353
00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.199
Jamie: Tell me that if I continue….

354
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.719
P9: Without verifying that it's not gonna end up in the garbage somewhere.

355
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.000
Jamie: Mmm, yes.

356
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.270
P9: Sorry.

357
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:18.039
Jamie: No, no, like I said, we love it, we want to hear it all. So, one of those rating questions again, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to upload your files today?

358
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:18.680
P9: Easy.

359
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.230
Jamie: Easy? Okay. Anything you could elaborate? Anything that stood out as being particularly easy?

360
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.809
P9: No, it's self-explanatory, except for the verification part.

361
00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.180
Jamie: Okay.

362
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:34.149
Jamie: Alright, we can move on to the next page.

363
00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.450
P9: So I continue.

364
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:45.369
Jamie: Yep, you can go ahead and continue. We don't have to worry about verifying any more files. So, without clicking anything, just take a look through this.

365
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:48.639
P9: Do you want to click on all the things and open everything up?

366
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.209
Jamie: Sure, however you would do… do it normally.

367
00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:58.480
P9: Well, I certainly would open it up, because I'd want to make sure I didn't make any errors in putting information.

368
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:59.840
Jamie: Okay.

369
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:08.019
Jamie: So, what would you expect at this point to happen if you did submit the form from this page?

370
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.730
P9: What would I expect if I submitted it?

371
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:18.069
Jamie: Yeah, like, what would you expect to see, or, … I would expect to see something that says your claim has been submitted.

372
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.010
Jamie: Okay.

373
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.290
Jamie: And….

374
00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.250
P9: With a number.

375
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.800
Jamie: What was the number?

376
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.660
P9: or something.

377
00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:24.740
Jamie: Okay.

378
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.199
P9: That's what I would expect.

379
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.269
P9: So do I have to do this statement of truth?

380
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.510
Jamie: No, you don't have to do anything on this page right now.

381
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.960
P9: Alright.

382
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.449
Jamie: Just got a couple questions for you.

383
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:44.580
Jamie: So, if you, if you submitted the form, how soon do you expect to be notified about your decision?

384
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:45.999
Jamie: About the claim.

385
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.719
P9: How would I… how long would I expect to be notified about the claim and its submission and getting payment?

386
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.590
Jamie: Yeah.

387
00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.550
P9: Right now, 6 months.

388
00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:55.380
Jamie: Six months?

389
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.330
P9: Okay. Because I know what's going on at CHAMPVA.

390
00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:02.850
Jamie: Okay, that's what my next question was, if that was, because you, your.

391
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:06.809
P9: It can take anywhere from 2 to 6 months, I think, for processing claims, and…

392
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:14.040
P9: Many, many people, again, I'm in many groups, probably not the thing you want to hear, but I'm very knowledgeable because of it.

393
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.560
P9: And… Many people submit a claim.

394
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.979
P9: And they don't hear anything for months, and then you get the denial.

395
00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.970
P9: And it's usually because there was a code rung, or…

396
00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:33.679
P9: or the EOB wasn't submitted from your primary insurance, you know, there's multiple reasons why it would get denied.

397
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.520
Jamie: Okay.

398
00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:39.599
P9: I would say anywhere from 3 to 6 months, I would wait to make sure this got processed.

399
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:49.050
Jamie: Okay, yeah, sounds good. Yeah, it sounds like you did your homework on this as well, so you're very familiar. So….

400
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.840
P9: Probably not what you want to hear, right?

401
00:29:50.840 --> 00:30:10.770
Jamie: No, we do, like, we, we value anybody of all different experiences, people that, you know, are very much involved with CHAMPVA, some people that, you know, are kind of first-timers here as well. You know, we, we gather all those kind of opinions, all that information, and, you know, this is how we, we improve the products, so….

402
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:11.120
P9: Sure.

403
00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:24.979
Jamie: Like, we're hearing, yeah, and, you know, like I said, we've heard that before, too, that story where it takes 3 to 6 months to get reimbursement, which is, you know, something that we do want to help fix and help speed along.

404
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.219
P9: If people are having to pay out of pocket.

405
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:27.920
Jamie: Yeah.

406
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.419
P9: This happens a lot of times while people are waiting for their CHAMP VA to be approved.

407
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:49.330
P9: then they go and they have to see a doctor, because CHAMPVA has taken so long, they gotta do it. They gotta pay out of pocket. Now they're trying to get reimbursed, and oh, by the way, they're not getting reimbursed anything close to what they paid out of pocket, but still, when you're paying out of pocket, every little bit coming back would help.

408
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:49.950
Jamie: Yeah.

409
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:57.559
Jamie: So, let's say that you submitted this claim online. How would you go about checking the status of your claim?

410
00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:01.759
P9: By calling and waiting for 2 hours on hold.

411
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:15.559
Jamie: Yeah, I kind of figured you were gonna say that, being that you were, you're very well versed in, how the process goes. So, knowing that, how would you prefer to check the status of your claim?

412
00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.530
P9: Online.

413
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.689
Jamie: Online? Okay, would that be through VA.gov?

414
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:30.819
P9: Yeah, anywhere where you file claims, anywhere, even, you know, a CHAMPVA website. We're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting for that to happen. Again, they just started allowing people to…

415
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.430
P9: submit applications last year.

416
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:40.559
P9: It's been a long time coming. Yeah. And this year, they started allowing claims to be submitted online.

417
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:45.769
P9: who knows when we'll… and, you know, I seem… again, I'm gonna go back to my Facebook, but…

418
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:58.200
P9: I try to be very helpful, and I see many posts from people, newbies, who are saying, where can I go to check the status? Heh, call and wait for 2 hours on the phone. Where can I go to check my claims?

419
00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.680
P9: Call and wait for 2 hours on the phone.

420
00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.020
Jamie: Yeah.

421
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:11.420
P9: option, but it would be so nice, like every other doctor in the U.S. has a website. You know, every provider has a website of some sort where you can go and

422
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:21.730
P9: Sign in, and see your test results, and submit your payment, or see a bill. We should be able to do it with something that's run by the freakin' government, but no.

423
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:32.160
Jamie: Yeah, no, totally understood, like, you know, and hopefully hearing that, we'll be able to take that information back and, you know, make further improvements on….

424
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:32.920
P9: it's…

425
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:41.449
P9: It's kind of depressing to see that people have to wait for so long for any information. I get it, I get it, I get it. They're… they're…

426
00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:53.190
P9: there's so many people, I know there's thousands of new applications probably being submitted daily to Champ VA, and probably just the same of new claims being submitted, but still.

427
00:32:53.380 --> 00:33:01.140
P9: There's gotta be a way to streamline that… streamline that process so they're not going through stacks and stacks and stacks and stacks of paper.

428
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:05.850
Jamie: Yep, yeah, yeah, that's what we're here for. We're hoping. …

429
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:17.179
Jamie: So, just one of those rating questions again. 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy, how difficult was it to complete the CHAMP VA form today?

430
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.090
P9: Very easy.

431
00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.170
Jamie: Okay.

432
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:20.640
P9: Pretty self-explanatory.

433
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:31.389
Jamie: Oh, awesome. So this is the part where, we're gonna take a look at a letter. Being that

434
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:45.629
Jamie: We're afraid that we're gonna drop you. Usually, we submit the, you know, have you download the letter and take a look at it, but for the sake of time here and not worrying about dropping you from Zoom, I…

435
00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:46.829
Jamie: I think it might be.

436
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:50.970
P9: Do I do it online? Because if you could send… can you send it to my email?

437
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.150
Jamie: … I don't know if I'll be able to do that.

438
00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:55.660
P9: I was gonna….

439
00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.989
Jamie: I'll share my screen, if that's.

440
00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.930
P9: Okay, so, let me ask this, am I finished here on this?

441
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:10.019
Jamie: For now, we're… I'm gonna give you another link, and we'll hop back in afterwards, but we gotta talk about this… this letter that I gotta try to….

442
00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:14.899
P9: Okay, so should I come back to you full screen and leave this page for now?

443
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:20.590
Jamie: Yeah, if you want to do that, and I'm gonna try to share my screen, and we'll see how this goes.

444
00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:24.329
Jamie: And, oh, you're sharing….

445
00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.910
P9: Am I still gonna share my screen?

446
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:31.900
Jamie: In a minute, after we get this letter, so if you could stop share….

447
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.309
P9: You want me to stop, Cher?

448
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:40.510
Jamie: Yeah, hit stop share. There we go. And I'm gonna share mine.

449
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.449
Jamie: And you should see the letter.

450
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:50.500
Jamie: Some sort of letter on here.

451
00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:52.509
P9: Okay.

452
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:53.719
Jamie: You got it?

453
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:54.670
P9: Yep.

454
00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:57.489
Jamie: I'm gonna zoom it up a little bit, …

455
00:34:57.729 --> 00:35:09.359
Jamie: So, let's imagine you submitted the form, and then you waited, you know, that 3 to 6 months, to hear back from CHAMPVA, and all of a sudden you get this letter in the mail.

456
00:35:10.289 --> 00:35:20.659
Jamie: Can you take a look at the letter and let me know what you think about it, and what it's trying to tell you? Let me know if I need to blow this up anymore on here.

457
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:27.030
P9: Well, they're telling me my claim didn't get processed, but that would be no surprise, to be honest.

458
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:33.319
Jamie: And what would be the reason why it didn't get processed?

459
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.500
P9: You may resubmit the enclosed claims.

460
00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:40.960
P9: Alright.

461
00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.930
P9: Does it want supporting evidence?

462
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.919
P9: Oh yeah, it wants diagnosis codes.

463
00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.220
Jamie: Okay.

464
00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:03.679
P9: Which, again, if I had submitted a super bill, it would have that on there.

465
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.500
Jamie: Okay.

466
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:11.940
Jamie: Yeah, that's good to know. Anything about this bottom portion, too?

467
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.780
P9: That I have one year from my date to do it.

468
00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:29.500
P9: Nope. I see. I also know that a social security number needs to be on it, because that's our… basically our ID number for Champ VA, so….

469
00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.440
Jamie: Okay.

470
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:37.319
Jamie: What about, any of these, this information down here? Does that mean anything to you? I don't know if you see my mouse.

471
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.960
P9: Doesn't mean a thing to me.

472
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.189
Jamie: That, that PDI….

473
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.090
P9: internal stuff.

474
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:42.870
Jamie: Okay.

475
00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.640
Jamie: Great. So….

476
00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.930
P9: I'm not an employee, so that's not me, employee number.

477
00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:50.700
Jamie: Go.

478
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:59.199
Jamie: All right, great. Let me get back to my screen. You might see some things move around here.

479
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.420
Jamie: I have 3 monitors right now I'm trying to navigate.

480
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:14.700
Jamie: So, yeah, let me just make sure I got all the… my questions answered. So, so at this point, what would you do to resolve this?

481
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:23.360
P9: Well, I would have to make sure, like I said, if it were me initially, I would have had the super bill, but I would have to go back to the provider and

482
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.130
P9: Because I didn't, apparently, the first time, request a super bill and resubmit it.

483
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:29.510
Jamie: Okay.

484
00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:34.160
Jamie: And would you send this, … how would you send this back to Champion?

485
00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:41.220
P9: Well, I would send it to the office that they're telling me to send it to, because that's what it says. It doesn't give me the option to send it

486
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.750
P9: Electronically.

487
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:47.010
Jamie: Okay. Would that be, a way you prefer to send it, electronically?

488
00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:54.779
P9: electronically, again, if I can submit it and get a notification right away with a claim number or something that says, hey, that's gone through, you're good.

489
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.980
Jamie: Okay.

490
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.579
P9: Because send it in the mail, you never know.

491
00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.380
Jamie: Hmm.

492
00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:07.510
P9: when they're gonna open it, if they're ever gonna open it. You don't know unless you send it signature required, which again.

493
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:14.150
P9: Knowing CHAMPVA, it doesn't matter, because… It doesn't matter.

494
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:30.679
Jamie: Alright, so we're gonna go back to that claims form. I realize we only got 10 minutes left, but I want to at least cover… Okay, so I'm back to sharing. So you gotta stop share, right? Yeah, I'm gonna stop share, and then I'm gonna put that link back in there, just so it's fresh for you.

495
00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.900
P9: Don't care. I think my link is there.

496
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.440
Jamie: Oh, you got it? Okay.

497
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.950
P9: Hold on, I'm gonna share my screen.

498
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.450
Jamie: Yeah, sorry, I'm looking like….

499
00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:40.020
P9: minute.

500
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.580
Jamie: No problem.

501
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.950
P9: Okay, now I'm gonna try to go back. Yup, here we are!

502
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:51.380
Jamie: Perfect. Awesome.

503
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.050
P9: We're back at the beginning.

504
00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:59.049
Jamie: Alright, so, looking at this page, do you think you're in a right place to resubmit the claim?

505
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.960
P9: Say that again.

506
00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:05.879
Jamie: From looking at this page, do you think you're in the right place to resubmit the claim?

507
00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.769
P9: Resubmit the claim after I got a letter?

508
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:10.450
Jamie: Yes.

509
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:15.329
P9: I think so, but I only say that because…

510
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:31.520
P9: When we did this the first time, and I started it, it gave me the option to say filing a new claim or resubmitting an old claim. So I only know that on that next page, if I click start your form without signing, it's going to give me the option to resubmit.

511
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:37.609
Jamie: Okay. Would you prefer the… this, page to say something about resubmitting the claim?

512
00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:40.890
P9: Yeah, and again, I only know that Because….

513
00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.890
Jamie: The first time I did it.

514
00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.300
P9: It gave me those two options.

515
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:54.650
Jamie: Okay, great. You could… yeah, you could go ahead and jump back into the form, the start your form without signing in, and go through this as if you were resubmitting the claim.

516
00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.910
P9: See? Resubmission.

517
00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.630
Jamie: Great.

518
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:06.209
P9: Oh, then I'm gonna need these numbers.

519
00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:11.389
Jamie: Okay. Do you remember seeing any of this on the letter that I just showed you?

520
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:12.100
P9: do.

521
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.409
Jamie: You do? Okay, great.

522
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:20.760
P9: But I don't remember it. Okay, you don't remember. I remember the employee ID, 123412345.

523
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.419
Jamie: But, do you remember, what type of….

524
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.810
P9: but I don't remember the number.

525
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:32.759
Jamie: Okay, that's… that's perfectly fine. Do you remember anything, about the PDI number?

526
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.829
P9: Nope. I… was it a date?

527
00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.270
Jamie: Oh, it might have been a date.

528
00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:43.199
Jamie: You could go ahead and select, an option from this.

529
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.179
P9: I'm gonna go PDI.

530
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:54.620
Jamie: Yeah, okay, great. And then you could, for the purpose of this form, just fill in whatever, numbers you have here.

531
00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:01.679
P9: I have no idea, because… I know the PDI number was at the bottom of the page.

532
00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:10.600
Jamie: Okay. Well, that's great to know, that you do remember that, at least. I know it was a long string of numbers as well, so it might have been….

533
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.590
P9: And I saw the employee ID number was either 1234 or 12345.

534
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.970
Jamie: Okay.

535
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:20.119
P9: Alright, so am I clicking a medical claim here?

536
00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:21.939
Jamie: Yes.

537
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:26.360
P9: Oh, boy.

538
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.139
Jamie: What are you thinking about this?

539
00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.689
P9: It's a doctor?

540
00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.560
Jamie: Is that what you think it… it's asking for?

541
00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.060
P9: Hold on, let me double check.

542
00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:42.940
P9: Provider name.

543
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.580
P9: It could be the name of a practice.

544
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.370
Jamie: Okay.

545
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:53.749
P9: Because if I go to a practice that's, like, got several doctors in it, I could be the name of the practice, right?

546
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.660
Jamie: Hmm.

547
00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.960
P9: You want me to fake and say what I think?

548
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.650
Jamie: Yeah, go ahead.

549
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.979
Jamie: I don't know, I can't think of a name of a practice, because I want to say….

550
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.329
P9: Nope. Hold on, I gotta think of a good name.

551
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:21.730
P9: This is pretty good that I'm coming up with this on the fly.

552
00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.990
Jamie: Should be in marketing.

553
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.730
P9: Huh?

554
00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:26.620
Jamie: I say you should be in marketing.

555
00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.229
Jamie: Coming up with names for practices.

556
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:37.410
Jamie: So is this something you would have on hand, or you need to step away and kind of double-check?

557
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:39.700
P9: I don't know. If I was resubmitting.

558
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:40.550
Jamie: Yeah.

559
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:45.880
P9: If I'm resubmitting, I'm gonna have that super bill with me, so I would have all that information.

560
00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:46.760
Jamie: Okay.

561
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.910
P9: Because I know they needed the diagnosis codes.

562
00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:58.500
P9: so I would have had to gotten that, and it would be on a super bill that I would have requested. So, I think I would have all the dates

563
00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.640
P9: Right?

564
00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:01.349
P9: That's me.

565
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.370
Jamie: Okay.

566
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:03.529
Jamie: Sounds good.

567
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:06.939
P9: Can I continue?

568
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.720
Jamie: Yep.

569
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:15.040
P9: Oh, man, I gotta upload again!

570
00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:19.039
P9: That poor picture is just gonna get the life beat out of it.

571
00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:25.679
Jamie: So what do you think it's asking for you for, from you? Sorry, on this page.

572
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.860
P9: I want the missing information, which was the diagnosis codes. Would I submit just that? No.

573
00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:35.529
P9: I would submit a super bill that has all the information on it.

574
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.730
Jamie: Okay.

575
00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:41.979
P9: There's no way I'm just submitting a piece of paper that has a diagnosis code. That just would not fly.

576
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.779
Jamie: Okay, so you think they would want everything?

577
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.989
P9: I don't know what they'd want, I'm telling you what I would do.

578
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.640
Jamie: Okay.

579
00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:55.139
P9: I would assume, because this says, We just…

580
00:43:55.480 --> 00:44:03.630
P9: Copies of documents with missing information, and a copy of the letter we mailed you, which I've already scanned. Wink, wink, nod, nod.

581
00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.810
P9: But…

582
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:17.879
P9: And all documents you submitted with your claim. So, yes, they would be getting everything, not just a piece of paper with a diagnosis code, because they want everything all over again, like, starting from square one.

583
00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.190
Jamie: Okay.

584
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.969
P9: So do you want me to upload something?

585
00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.690
Jamie: Yeah, just to get past this screen and on to the next one.

586
00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:27.920
P9: It might require 2 uploads, from what I'm seeing.

587
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.950
Jamie: Oh, okay.

588
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:36.630
P9: Well, because it wants a copy of the letter uploaded as well.

589
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:37.420
Jamie: Okay.

590
00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:41.709
Jamie: Ignore that error, we've already talked about it. Okay.

591
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:43.800
Jamie: So, okay.

592
00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.089
P9: Oh, man, I gotta put all my information again.

593
00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:47.910
Jamie: Mmm.

594
00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:57.069
Jamie: So, judging from that, … Would you prefer that you could bypass all this information?

595
00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:01.959
P9: No, no, because it's… it's like submitting a new claim. They've got to know who I am.

596
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:02.920
Jamie: Okay.

597
00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.530
P9: They're not gonna know.

598
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:10.199
P9: I don't understand this.

599
00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:11.649
P9: I'm good.

600
00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:13.969
Jamie: the… What, what don't you understand?

601
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:15.840
P9: that I have to do this twice.

602
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.680
Jamie: Okay.

603
00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.099
Jamie: Why it's asking to do it twice, okay.

604
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.149
P9: I just did it.

605
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:24.440
P9: And it asked me again, but this time I had a birthday.

606
00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:24.970
Jamie: Mmm.

607
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:25.949
P9: I don't get it.

608
00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:30.280
P9: Now, I'm gonna try to remember what I said. May… Second.

609
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:30.850
Jamie: Second.

610
00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:32.720
P9: 1960.

611
00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:34.949
Jamie: I think that's right.

612
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:37.970
Jamie: That's what I remember.

613
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:40.130
P9: I don't know how I could remember that, but…

614
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:50.859
P9: Can I continue? I should be asking you this, right?

615
00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:55.230
Jamie: Oh, no, you go ahead, we're gonna fly through this next section.

616
00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:56.480
P9: So…

617
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.579
P9: What state did I say? Sorry.

618
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.580
P9: My zip code was maybe 12345.

619
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.639
P9: No, it hasn't. Am I good?

620
00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.470
Jamie: Yep.

621
00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.290
P9: Again?

622
00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:28.439
Jamie: This is all good feedback, by the way.

623
00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.030
P9: …

624
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:41.179
P9: we're gonna leave it as Sue's T instead of Suzy, I don't feel like going back.

625
00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:46.709
Jamie: That's fine. I think we're coming up at 1 minute left here, so we're gonna wrap this up right now.

626
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.210
P9: No worries.

627
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:58.220
Jamie: Okay, so, couple of those writing questions, how difficult or easy was it to complete this form?

628
00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.550
P9: It's easy enough.

629
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.300
Jamie: Easy enough.

630
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:03.630
P9: Except that I don't know why I gotta put my stuff in there twice.

631
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:07.589
Jamie: Okay, so that one little area where it asks you for your name twice, and then it.

632
00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:07.950
P9: Yeah.

633
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:08.370
Jamie: they….

634
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:13.699
P9: And the second time, it wants my birthday, why didn't I do that the first time? I don't get it, but that's alright.

635
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:19.939
Jamie: So, how was, how would you compare submitting the first claim versus the resubmission?

636
00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.070
P9: They're the same thing.

637
00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.060
Jamie: Okay.

638
00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:28.070
Jamie: And, … Overall, was there anything this session that worked well for you?

639
00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:36.150
P9: I mean, it all works fine. I mean, but for that verification error that I wish I understood and knew what they meant.

640
00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:37.160
Jamie: Mmm.

641
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:43.670
P9: That doesn't give me that information, so I gotta do with what I have, right?

642
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:49.169
Jamie: Yeah. … Was there anything that was unclear or didn't work well for you?

643
00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:51.140
P9: Just that verification thing.

644
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:51.940
Jamie: Okay.

645
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:56.019
P9: Everything else is pretty easy to understand.

646
00:47:56.370 --> 00:48:01.370
Jamie: Okay, and what were your thoughts about how much information was provided on both of these forms?

647
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:02.029
Jamie: To my….

648
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.550
P9: How much information I had to provide?

649
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:10.050
Jamie: How much, did CHAMPVA provide on these forms? Was there not enough information?

650
00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:12.340
P9: No, they told me exactly what they wanted.

651
00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:22.359
Jamie: Okay, great. We flew through that last part. So that's the end of the study. I appreciate it, like, you gave awesome feedback on it.

652
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.650
P9: I'm gonna try to unshare, but I can't.

653
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:25.540
Jamie: Yeah, go ahead.

654
00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:27.309
P9: That's alright, I'll go here.

655
00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.520
Jamie: Okay. Oh, it looks like you're good.

656
00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.719
Jamie: Okay, I stopped sharing.

657
00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:43.300
Jamie: So, just real quick, sorry, we're, like, a minute over, I apologize, but I just gotta ask you that one question again. So now that we've gone through.

658
00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.740
P9: I don't know what's happening. Screen broadcasting is on here.

659
00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:47.410
Jamie: Oh.

660
00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:53.940
P9: I can see you, you're not moving, and you probably can't see me moving, but I can hear you fine.

661
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.270
Jamie: Okay, well, just as long as you can hear me, I could see everything.

662
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:58.400
P9: I hit a new button.

663
00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:08.799
Jamie: Okay, just… we could just leave this. We're wrapping up, so we're good. So, just that one question again. Are you comfortable if we share a video clip of our sessions today?

664
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.880
P9: Absolutely.

665
00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.480
Jamie: Awesome.

666
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.080
P9: Bye.

667
00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:20.190
Jamie: Great! So I'm gonna close this out. I just want to thank you so much for taking the time and all the other studies that you've done, too. We really appreciate it.

668
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.820
P9: Appreciate it.

669
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:31.210
Jamie: Yeah, so Perigium will be sending you a thank you note, I'm sure you're aware, with a little blurb that you could pass along to other veterans. Sure. …that you may know, so just keep an eye out for that.

670
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:31.870
P9: Okay.

671
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:33.800
Jamie: Once again, thank you so much.

672
00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.500
P9: Thank you, Jamie, it was nice meeting you.

673
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.729
Jamie: Nice meeting you as well. Take care. Enjoy the rest of your day.

674
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.890
Jamie: Thanks, you too.

675
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:41.240
Jamie: Thanks.
