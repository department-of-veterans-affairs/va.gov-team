Participant 3: well, I have no problem getting into it, getting into medical problems, especially withdraw most of the time. I don't even bother if if I run problems. That's the easiest way, but it has something else to it.

14
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.939
Participant 3: They've they've improved a lot over the over the years

15
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.900
Participant 3: used to be. You had to go around, find, find the blue ball.

16
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.700
Participant 3: and so I can't see or can't find, the blue bar. I wouldn't know this building.

17
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.139
Participant 3: but it's they're changing. It's much more friendly.

26
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.610
Participant 3: Well

27
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:55.500
Participant 3: and log in, you know, just to find out when the next appointment is, or if I have a problem with the medicine, it's ordered it, and it's not coming. And there's been 2 or 3 times where the it needs to be. The doctor needs to.

28
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:06.479
Participant 3: We knew the the prescription, and it gets lost in translation somewhere. So it just doesn't happen. So when I go and log in.

29
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.737
Jamie: Okay? So you're logging in just to check up on statuses of medications.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.319
Participant 3: I probably log in maybe once before I be. I I just don't render it very often. Don't need it.

36
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:42.069
Jamie: Okay, so just that just as you need it. So are you or anybody else in your household currently enrolled in CHAMPVA.

37
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.190
Participant 3: No.

38
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.510
Jamie: No, okay,

39
00:03:47.560 --> 00:04:09.150
Jamie: So I'm sorry. I'm just like scrolling through my questions here, making sure I got them. So you mentioned you used jaws. Are you gonna be using that today to to okay? Great do you use it? You did mention that you use it when you log in. Do you use it when you're typically filling out va.gov forms, or just on you do. Okay.

40
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.220
Participant 3: It's the only way I can get around the Coronavirus, and fears.

41
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.870
Jamie: I'm sorry. What was that?

42
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.689
Participant 3: That's the only way I can use a computer with jaws. I have no screen that I can't make out.

43
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.899
Jamie: Okay? Great. So how proficient do you think you are with using jaws.

44
00:04:29.294 --> 00:04:33.630
Participant 3: It always changes, intermediate

45
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:43.059
Jamie: Average. Okay, okay, great and what operating system will you be using today? And what browser.

46
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.322
Participant 3: Windows. And so that's good.

47
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.639
Jamie: Sorry, which which browser.

48
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.120
Participant 3: I'm trying to remember which one it is. I don't. I don't know offhand.

49
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.274
Jamie: It'd be like. I'm sorry you're breaking up a little bit.

50
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.280
Participant 3: I said, I'm not sure which one it is.

51
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:25.279
Jamie: Oh, okay, all right, that's no problem figured out. We just we want to know just in case we come across any like bugs within our prototype. It helps helps us kind of like pinpoint the the problem because jaws can react differently on different browsers and different operating systems. So if we do have them we could get our engineers on there to fix it.

52
00:05:28.435 --> 00:05:33.759
Jamie: So how long have you been using jaws.

53
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.780
Participant 3: I 1st started in 94.

54
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.359

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.865
Jamie: Okay, yeah. So I think we're gonna get started here.

56
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:57.389
Jamie: and I will try to work out the tech issues as we go. I'm going to post a link in the chat.

57
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.850
Jamie: Oh, that's right. Did Perigean send you a link to click on.

58
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.620
Participant 3: Just the one that click on there is to get on there.

59
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:17.020

Participant 3: I'll type out and see what happens.

68
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.799
Jamie: Did it. It should should have opened up a browser for you.

69
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.430
Participant 3: Have to.

70
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.790

Participant 3: It could be. I had more with the idea where.

77
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.330
Jamie: Okay.

78
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:49.669
Jamie: you want. You could try to minimize zoom, are you? 1st of all, what device are you using.

79

Participant 3: Okay.

80

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:57.169
Jamie: Oh, okay, Maria. Do you know where that button may have gone?

156
00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:11.179
Maria: Yes, if you navigate to the zoom window, not in the not the zoom Mini window, but the big but the big zoom window where you initially started, there should be a share button, and then from that share button.

157
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.319
Participant 3: I can't find the zoom.

158
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.620
Maria: Oh, you can't find the zoom there's.

159
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.329
Participant 3: I've seen you. I mean, I see that. Okay, let me go back to this Zoom Phone.

160
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:32.209
Participant 3: Yeah, it. That's it. I don't have that big screen I had where I had everything before.

161
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:40.880
Maria: Okay? Oh, it's just a little screen. In that little screen. There should be an option to share your screen audio, your device audio.

162
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:47.579
Participant 3: I had hide, have chosen all active speaker Video.

163
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.660
Participant 3: Yes, this is on mute.

164
00:16:52.430 --> 00:17:00.539
Participant 3: Okay, this is show grid video. Then this is bigger and little you know, to expand.

165
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.279
Participant 3: Those are my 4 options, that's all I have.

166
00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.799
Maria: I see I see. In that case.

167
00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:14.159
Maria: Jamie, if we can't reach the screen audio, would that be too much of a hassle? I can also follow along with my own screen. Reader.

168
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.830
Jamie: Yeah, that that's fine. Yeah, we could do without hearing the screen, reader, we'll we'll manage

169
00:17:20.769 --> 00:17:41.179
Jamie: I just ask if there's anything odd that you notice that the screen reader calls out, just let us know. And you know we could take note of that like I said, we're we want to test the usability on how this interacts with assistive technology. So you know, if there's anything weird, we want to make sure to fix it. But yeah, we could just carry on without this.

170
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:41.600
Participant 3: No problem.

171
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:47.289
Jamie: Is not a big deal. So yeah, so.

172
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:48.609
Participant 3: Let me do a keyboard.

173
00:17:48.610 --> 00:18:05.580
Jamie: Yeah, once again. So this is just a testing site. We won't actually be submitting the form today. So nothing you click on this form as you go through has any bearing on your benefits. So as we go through this, you'll we'll have when you dive deeper into the form. You'll be asked a series of questions.

174
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:22.159
Jamie: So feel free to use fake information, especially for sensitive questions like your social security numbers. We don't want any real information in there. We're not going to share it out. But we still don't want you to type in any real information for those types of questions like your social.

175
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:38.809
Jamie: and then you may be asked to upload some documents, and we're not submitting the form today. So nothing that you upload in this this form will be sent to Va. Paragem. Did send you some documents

176
00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.450
Jamie: to to upload during this. Did you receive those.

177
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.730
Participant 3: Know.

178
00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:46.790
Jamie: Okay, that.

179
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.069
Participant 3: Didn't see it, and unless it came in today.

180
00:18:50.070 --> 00:19:15.940
Jamie: Okay, yeah, yeah, they might have emailed it to you if you don't have them. It's not a problem. I could either try to send them over zoom or we you could just upload like a picture or something that's on your desktop that you feel comfortable uploading. It could be like a picture of your pet or your wife, or something. But we'll we'll take care of that. When we get to the the upload space, we'll figure out what to do in that area. Just to get you by

181
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.875
Jamie: So

182
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:34.360
Jamie: so yeah, without clicking anything like I prompted you before. Just take a look at the information on this page. Tell us your initial thoughts, and let me know if you know if you can discern what type of form this page is describing.

183
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:35.025
Participant 3: Alright!

184
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:13.040
Participant 3: It's better. Va. Va. Has 72 h the file time.

185
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.230
Jamie: Okay.

186
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:19.730
Jamie: so a form to file the claim. Do you know what types of claims you can file by just reading this page.

187
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.163
Participant 3: And that's.

188
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.050
Jamie: You still with me, or your screen readers reading for you.

189
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.370
Participant 3: Say again.

190
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.015
Jamie: So you still with me

191
00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.730
Participant 3: Yeah, yeah.

192
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:16.090
Participant 3: Talking about signing into the the account when they sign in or.

193
00:21:19.531 --> 00:21:26.769
Jamie: not at the moment. I do have like some more questions about the content on this page. So

194
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:33.060
Jamie: do you. Do you think you have all the information that you would need to fill out this form?

195
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:41.879
Jamie: Oh, I'm sorry I'm getting ahead of myself. What information do you think you would need to fill out this form.

196
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.190
Participant 3: I haven't really found what they require of you now

197
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.400
Participant 3: used to fill out. Go one year to class.

198
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:57.250
Jamie: Okay, one year to follow the claim. Do you know what types of information you would need to file the claim with.

199
00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.649
Participant 3: No, I didn't see it in.

200
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.928
Participant 3: Okay, that's not a problem.

201
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:17.329
Jamie: So if they ask you for things like medical receipts or paperwork from your insurance company, would you need to pause to go get those, or do you think you have them on hand? If you need to follow a medical claim.

202
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.430
Participant 3: Well, if I was filing the claim hopefully, I'd have them on hand, because.

203
00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.520
Jamie: Okay.

204
00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.180
Participant 3: You know, I've never filed a claim online.

205
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.819
Jamie: Oh, okay, so this is kind of your 1st experience with online claims.

206
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:49.460
Jamie: Okay, that's perfect. We like you, we want, we want fresh eyes on this. So from a scale of one to 5, 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel to file a claim based on this page's content.

207
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:57.200
Participant 3: History. I really don't know where all on the page I mean. I just I know it.

208
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.700
Participant 3: and I'll assume. But.

209
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.149
Jamie: So you're feeling kind of in the middle.

210
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.169
Participant 3: Yeah, I I have no idea what it's been required.

211
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:21.590
Jamie: Okay, that that is fair. So you can go ahead and click that sign in your form, or, sorry, start your form without signing in link, and then we can get started on. The actual form

212
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.680
Jamie: should be in that blue box. There you go. Awesome.

213
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.643
Jamie: Yeah. I think there's a lag in zoom here.

214
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:50.159
Jamie: so I'd like to start you. Yeah, let me try that again. Let's try talking. No, I'd like you to start the form as if you were submitting a medical claim for your let's say your spouse.

215
00:23:50.200 --> 00:24:17.669
Jamie: and I'll let you know when to pause, so I can ask some questions. But yeah, just as a reminder as you fill this out. This is a testing site. Your information is not going anywhere, but feel free to use that fake information if you want. So as you go through this form as you're filling them out, please remember to just think out loud. We want to hear any reactions you have as you experience this form.

216
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:35.659
Jamie: Things like, you know, you like something, or you got stuck somewhere. You don't understand something we like to hear all of that. So yeah, just go ahead. Yeah, go ahead and start completing this form as you feel fit. Remember, you're you're filling this form out for your spouse

217
00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.229
Jamie: to submit a claim.

218
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:14.239
Jamie: Now for this question, we're just gonna hit. Yes, and make believe that you do have champion.

219
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.520
Jamie: Okay? And we're going to submit a new claim today.

220
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.220
Participant 3: Let me just jump into this.

221
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.230
Jamie: Sorry. What was that?

222
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:25.530
Participant 3: We've now jumped into this veteran support group.

223
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.279
Jamie: Oh, no! Did you? Did you mean to jump into that.

224
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.720
Participant 3: No, it just always went down the line.

225
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.100
Jamie: Oh!

226
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.980
Participant 3: In the veteran support groups.

227
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:40.399
Jamie: That that's interesting. Why, that jumped down there. We'll have to take note of that.

228
00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:46.589
Jamie: Yeah. Is there a way to get back up to that continue button. Oh, looks like it went backwards.

229
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.950
Jamie: Yeah, if you get down to the continue button, we can move, move forward hopefully.

230
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.670
Jamie: There we go.

231
00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.690
Participant 3: Okay, sponsor information that's needed. Right?

232
00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:05.400
Jamie: Yeah.

233
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.260
Jamie: see if it does it again.

234
00:28:26.455 --> 00:28:30.314
Jamie: There we go. Okay. I was worried for a second.

235
00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.900
Participant 3: In with.

236
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.309
Jamie: Yeah, it looks like you're missing a.

237
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:13.000
Participant 3: And we'll start clicking on you. And all of a sudden it says the wrong.

238
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.549
Participant 3: So I ended up. I don't know where I'm at now.

239
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.700
Jamie: Did the because we can't hear your screen read? Or did it announce that you had a error? There.

240
00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.060
Participant 3: Yes, it did. Now it's there in a year. Put it put things certain years.

241
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:29.830
Jamie: Yeah, that's

242
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.200
Participant 3: Back to it, and it still just jumped.

243
00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:36.249
Jamie: Yeah, it seems to be jumping all over the place. If you get back to the year.

244
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.609
Participant 3: It's right back. Button.

245
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:43.540
Jamie: Yeah, there you go. Oh, yeah.

246
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.860
Jamie: okay.

247
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.559
Jamie: Oh, it just

248
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.379
Jamie: and hopefully, it doesn't do that again.

249
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.110
Jamie: Okay, great.

250
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:45.659
Jamie: That's so, is it? Bouncing it down to the footer every time. There's an error.

251
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:55.050
Participant 3: Well, I got the year filled out, and it's it comes up again. It was the last name. Fill it out, and all of a sudden it jumps to this.

252
00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.540
Jamie: Yeah, that's that's unusual.

253
00:31:57.923 --> 00:32:02.449
Participant 3: You can see what I've got on. Now follow back.

254
00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:12.869
Jamie: Yeah, see if you get back to yeah. Keeps bouncing you back to the sponsor page. Now, this is all good, like I said, this is why we do this.

255
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:16.739
Jamie: we gotta find these little things in here.

256
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.259
Jamie: Oh, I think you skipped over the last name field again.

257
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.320
Jamie: Let's see.

258
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.899
Jamie: Yeah, there it is.

259
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.220
Participant 3: Be really good.

260
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:53.680
Jamie: Okay.

261
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:29.230
Jamie: okay? And this, you could just enter in any number. Yeah, it should work.

262
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.850
Jamie: Oh, yeah.

263
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.180
Participant 3: You something other than others.

264
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.369
Jamie: Yeah, I think it's the spaces.

265
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.070
Jamie: Enter them without the spaces that might work.

266
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.010
Participant 3: More spaces.

267
00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:53.460
Jamie: No spaces. Let's try that.

268
00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:02.340
Participant 3: Interesting.

269
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:43.770
Participant 3: Alright! You do.

270
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.889
Jamie: Sorry. What was that?

271
00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:54.009
Participant 3: Whatever I was on before. I just snucked over.

272
00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:57.620
Jamie: Oh, yeah, it looks like you got. You're stuck in the breadcrumbs like on the menu.

273
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:01.599
Jamie: Can you get back down to the form in the the main content.

274
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:10.400
Maria: If you press H. You should be able to hop to the heading that should be right.

275
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:24.940
Participant 3: I have no idea I'm on. The price is why I may call it. I don't know. It's.

276
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:25.730
Jamie: This.

277
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.529
Participant 3: That's what I'm on right now. Price one.

278
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.010
Participant 3: But.

279
00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:32.730
Maria: If it's.

280
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.690
Participant 3: You want me to go back again.

281
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.740
Maria: Oh, no, please keep pressing. Tab

282
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.030
Maria: alright should be good.

283
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:09.050
Maria: Yes, yes, that's good.

284
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:30.000
Participant 3: Post.

285
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.180
Participant 3: Sure

286
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.060
Participant 3: now, up until now it's it.

287
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:49.959
Participant 3: it says, has your address changed? No, this check?

288
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:51.730
Participant 3: Yes.

289
00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.960
Participant 3: Now, yeah. You jets.

290
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.700
Participant 3: Yes, it's good.

291
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.891
Jamie: You could select either one

292
00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.849
Participant 3: Yeah, but I mean they're already checked. So if I just.

293
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.057
Jamie: Yeah, either one will produce the same results. That's just a question of

294
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:15.219
Participant 3: The thing is, I'm saying they're all checked, and I can't uncheck.

295
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:16.790
Jamie: Oh, really, yeah.

296
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:22.889
Jamie: yeah. I think once you enter in a radio, it has to be selected. I don't, Marie. I don't know if there's any way to deselect

297
00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:24.510
Jamie: a radio button.

298
00:38:26.762 --> 00:38:33.710
Maria: Not really. Once you select a radio button, it's a bit difficult to do that. Is there a specific answer that should be

299
00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:36.569
Maria: deselected to go forward.

300
00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:40.830

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.860
Jamie: Hmm.

326
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:32.609

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.510
Jamie: Oh!

334
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:06.789

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:17.369
Jamie: Okay, I see what's happening. So you're waiting to hear that that blip. But it's not happening.

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:54.389
Jamie: Yeah, you're up at the beginning of the page.

389
00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:59.030

Participant 3: It's an upload.

393
00:52:16.598 --> 00:52:24.299
Maria: I can pop in. It might be a bug where, if you try to upload the file, it 1st up it, for whatever reason sends you back up to the top

394
00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:26.949
Maria: of the page.

400
00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:59.250
Maria: Oh, so when you hit the button it just sends you back to the top. Even if you try to upload a file again.

401
00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:02.380
Participant 3: We found that up really filed.

Participant 3: Upload supporting.

404
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:17.980

405
00:54:00.645 --> 00:54:01.150
Participant 3: Okay.

406
00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:38.449
Participant 3: which one it is. It's a word document. So

407
00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:52.560
Participant 3: want me to put a file name or.

408
00:54:54.012 --> 00:55:02.880
Jamie: Yeah, you should be able to just click on a a document right? And then open it.

409
00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:10.560
Jamie: You could. So you could try like typing in a file name and see what comes up.

410
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:22.420
Participant 3: Good.

411
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:26.780
Jamie: Nothing's happening.

412
00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:33.240
Participant 3: We gave you the file type. Select one jp.

413
00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:40.470
Jamie: So word document, so that you put Pdf.

414
00:55:42.361 --> 00:55:44.170
Maria: Yeah, it should be fine.

415
00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:46.790
Participant 3: How Jpg.

416
00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:48.560
Participant 3: With the pictures.

417
00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:54.639
Maria: A Pdf should be fine. Just any Pdf that you have in your computer.

418
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:32.639
Participant 3: Okay. So once the file name or type of value, and we're just absolutely nothing. Up the Down Arrow, we just type the name in.

419
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:36.140
Jamie: Yeah, you could try that.

420
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.470
Jamie: Give it a shot. If it doesn't happen, then that's fine.

421
00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.950
Jamie: That's been found. Okay.

422
00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.550
Participant 3: I'm totally confused.

423
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.620
Jamie: It's okay.

424
00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:13.150
Participant 3: How you would. I don't know how you would upload a file, the pivot, the one domain and

425
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:19.110
Participant 3: type in name. They didn't see the download or anything that's uploaded.

426
00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:40.460
Jamie: Okay, I mean, and that's perfectly fine. You know, like, I said, we're testing your experience here. So if we can't get it to work. Then that's something to take back to the drawing board and consider so we you can get out of this and go back to the form, and we'll I could just ask you a couple of questions related to what you're seeing on the screen. And yeah, then we can move on.

427
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:52.000
Participant 3: You know zoom room.

428
00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:58.170
Jamie: If you hit okay?

429
00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:03.420
Jamie: And then cancel should get you back there.

430
00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:17.310
Participant 3: Okay, where you want me to go.

431
00:58:17.987 --> 00:58:23.730
Jamie: Go ahead and hit cancel to get out of the the dialog box. That's open right now.

432
00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:43.829
Jamie: Okay, we're back on the floor.

433
00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:45.539
Participant 3: That was important document.

434
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:53.159
Jamie: Okay, so we could skip the the file upload. I just want to draw your attention. If you can

435
00:58:53.440 --> 00:59:00.840
Jamie: find a way to navigate to the text above that button there should be

436
00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:06.590
Jamie: something that describes helping, reducing errors.

437
00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:08.780
Participant 3: Is, what.

438
00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:16.220
Jamie: There's some text above that button that you're on right now that describes reducing errors.

439
00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:20.180
Participant 3: Okay.

440
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:23.269
Jamie: Are you? Are you on there? Is it able to read that that box.

441
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:25.160
Participant 3: Help reduce errors on the plane.

442
00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:33.100
Jamie: Yes, I just want to get your thoughts on what you think that means, and what you think that like what would happen.

443
00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:40.160
Participant 3: The fewer errors you have when you claim, the faster it gets the money.

444
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:48.239
Jamie: Okay, and it also mentions a delay. What do you think about that delay that might happen.

445
00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:56.009
Participant 3: I assume with the delay would be a delay, when, where they have confirmed symptoms.

446
00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:02.820
Jamie: Okay. And how would you feel about waiting that one to one to 2 min delay? If it's gonna reduce errors.

447
01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.110
Participant 3: That wouldn't bother me.

448
01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:06.900
Participant 3: Yeah, I'm sorry. What?

449
01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:13.330
Participant 3: What's going on? They would just stop for one to 2 min. They had nothing without it running.

450
01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:14.530
Participant 3: Then?

451
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:18.469
Participant 3: Yeah, I think it's probably.

452
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:23.039
Jamie: So, would you? Would you wait? I'm sorry you're breaking up a little bit. There.

453
01:00:24.012 --> 01:00:30.649
Participant 3: I would probably, if I had an advance notice, there would be a 1 to 3 min delay.

454
01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:32.470
Participant 3: I would wait.

455
01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.140
Jamie: Okay.

456
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.499
Participant 3: If all of a sudden it just goes silent.

457
01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:41.419
Participant 3: you know, then I would. I would start all tabbing to find trying to find that. Well, what happened.

458
01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.410
Jamie: Okay.

459
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:43.550
Participant 3: So.

460
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.890
Jamie: Yeah. So if

461
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:52.820
Jamie: yeah, if you were waiting any longer than 2 min, what would you do at that point?

462
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:57.229
Participant 3: We'll get a cup of coffee.

463
01:00:58.756 --> 01:00:59.520
Jamie: That's.

464
01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:07.359
Participant 3: You know, if I knew there was a reason why. There's a delay, you know. They knew that there was going to be a delay.

465
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:11.049
Participant 3: I wouldn't have your problem waiting 1, 2, 5 min.

466
01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.929
Participant 3: Well, when all of a sudden

467
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:16.830
Participant 3: it just goes in the way and doesn't, does not let you know.

468
01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:19.720
Participant 3: Then I think it was a problem with my computer.

469
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:21.360
Jamie: Okay.

470
01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:23.940
Participant 3: You're connecting with me, or whatever.

471
01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:32.970
Jamie: Now what happens if something? So it goes through. But you get an error message saying that it couldn't verify your file.

472
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.949
Jamie: What would you do at that point.

473
01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.899
Participant 3: Go back and try again. See where where I'm able to sit.

474
01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.745
Jamie: Okay, that's that's great.

475
01:01:46.630 --> 01:02:03.990
Jamie: So I think we're done with this page. But fortunately it won't let you move forward without uploading a a file, but I can ask you some. Follow up questions. Let me just get those up here just about the your overall form process.

476
01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:13.630
Jamie: so say you. You uploaded these files and you got to the end of the form, and you submitted the form.

477
01:02:14.207 --> 01:02:18.739
Jamie: What would you expect to happen next after you submit the form.

478
01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:29.820
Participant 3: What would I expect to happen? I would hope that I received a confirmation with the CEO, that but

479
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:41.569
Participant 3: usually, when you go to submit a prong all of a sudden pops up with that on the page

480
01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:45.949
Jamie: So some some sort of message popping up. Is that what you're saying?

481
01:02:47.205 --> 01:02:54.859
Participant 3: Normally, I don't do a whole lot of forms because I hate form, but when I do finish

482
01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.029
Participant 3: we want to submit.

483
01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:04.239
Participant 3: About half the time will come up to say you forgot such and such, or what is the middle name, or what is the

484
01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:20.680
Participant 3: the the date, or the birth, or whatever. And so I have to go back and fill that in, and then and then you submit until and that's 1 of the problem. When you do submit unless you don't never know if it's accepted or not, because you don't do it in.

485
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:25.271
Jamie: Okay, that's fair enough. So

486
01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:31.629
Jamie: yeah, you would expect something just to confirm if it was accepted.

487
01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.250
Participant 3: Yes.

488
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:39.572
Jamie: So? Once you submit the claim. How long?

489
01:03:41.022 --> 01:03:43.679
Jamie: Do you expect to be notified

490
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:49.349
Jamie: by Champva like? How long do you think it will take for this whole claim process to come.

491
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:52.759
Jamie: come through, and you receive your reimbursement.

492
01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.800
Participant 3: I have no idea how Champva worked. I mean, I've

493
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:04.020
Participant 3: you know we would hope they would have. Let's see. Few days a few.

494
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:13.209
Participant 3: Actually, it should be almost immediate with the way technology. But no, it's within week, I guess.

495
01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:15.069
Jamie: Within a week. Okay.

496
01:04:15.887 --> 01:04:23.620
Jamie: how would you expect to receive that communication from them? Would it be by mail email, text message?

497
01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:26.250
Participant 3: You know, email, okay, lost.

498
01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:35.059
Jamie: All right. If you could check your claim before decision was made, where would you expect to find that claim status.

499
01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.690
Participant 3: I agreed on them.

500
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:44.649
Jamie: I'm sorry. What was that?

501
01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:46.170
Participant 3: I do not know.

502
01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:51.215
Jamie: You don't know. Okay, that's that's fair enough. Yeah,

503
01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:52.480
Jamie: So.

504
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:58.510
Participant 3: There's some, I'm sure. You go into the site there, and there's some checkpoint status.

505
01:04:58.890 --> 01:04:59.230
Jamie: Okay?

506
01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:03.080
Jamie: So you expect to to find it somewhere on va.gov.

507
01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:04.580
Participant 3: Yeah.

508
01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.340
Jamie: Okay?

509
01:05:06.583 --> 01:05:08.050
Jamie: Yeah. So

510
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:21.050
Jamie: I'm going to ask you. So let's say that you received you submitted this claim, and you received a letter in the mail stating that your claim was missing some details.

511
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:32.830
Jamie: And that you need to send back some more information. How would you go about sending back that information. How would you prefer, I should say, to send back that information to them?

512
01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:39.359
Participant 3: I would prefer to send a form in the in the letter that they sent

513
01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:48.519
Participant 3: fill in here. They'll probably give a website or a site to go to and fill in the form.

514
01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.700
Participant 3: but I would prefer the paper form.

515
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:52.959
Jamie: You referred to.

516
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.280
Participant 3: I'm old, I'm old, and I do not like all this technology. There is.

517
01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:04.010
Jamie: That's fair enough. So you prefer to to fill everything out by paper and send it by mail.

518
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:05.130
Participant 3: Yes.

519
01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:09.569
Jamie: Okay, that that's great. Yeah. So

520
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:14.597
Jamie: hold on. I'm just skipping down here because we had some tech issues.

521
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:21.419
Jamie: so I'm just making sure that I don't have anything else to ask you. And I think I do actually

522
01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.120
Jamie: just give me one second to get my bearings here.

523
01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:38.179
Jamie: Okay? Just a couple more questions to wrap this up. Overall. Was there anything that you saw in this session that worked well for you?

524
01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:44.376
Participant 3: Going down through the through the different questions it

525
01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:47.900
Participant 3: it went fairly easy. Said it was

526
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:55.659
Participant 3: the biggest problem I ran into, and that's using jaws. And usually when

527
01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:05.889
Participant 3: when you when they require something, you kind of held down to hear that click, when you hear that click, then, you know, you can type in, or they will accept the

528
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:07.940
Participant 3: You type into his bot.

529
01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:16.879
Participant 3: Otherwise you type in, and sometimes it takes it, sometimes it doesn't. But if it goes down and hits that click, then it wouldn't work.

530
01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:31.870
Jamie: Okay, so just long as it was functioning properly, it was easy. But obviously, we have some bugs to walk, work out with jaws. To to make sure that everything's functioning properly. So

531
01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:39.960
Jamie: great was there anything unclear, or didn't work well for you? Besides the jaws? Bugs on the the blips.

532
01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.419
Participant 3: No, it was all preparatory.

533
01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.199
Jamie: That? Was it?

534
01:07:46.017 --> 01:07:54.260
Jamie: Okay? What were your thoughts on the amount of information provided in this form? Was it not enough? Was it too much or just right.

535
01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:03.190
Participant 3: Of just right. I mean there wasn't. Wasn't an excessive amount of information asked for is

536
01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:06.000
Participant 3: very simple and straightforward.

537
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:10.010
Jamie: Okay, good to hear? So

538
01:08:10.661 --> 01:08:13.169
Jamie: yeah, I actually, that is.

539
01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:27.229
Jamie: oh, I have. I have a couple more sorry I skipped past these on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very hard and one being very easy. How difficult do you think it was to complete this form? And why.

540
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:33.750
Participant 3: 4, but it wasn't that difficult.

541
01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:39.420
Participant 3: One was hard and one of the 5 was easy. What was the range again?

542
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:43.699
Jamie: Oh, one being very hard and 5 being very easy.

543
01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:44.930
Participant 3: For.

544
01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.920
Jamie: A 4. Okay, what would push it to be a 5? Is there anything that you would change on it to be a 5.

545
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:59.910
Participant 3: Well, a few of the things that that came up like I said the one of the things that

546
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:07.020
Participant 3: the little thing, or whatever with the jaws to fill them. The other one was, we want spot where we noticed, or

547
01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:12.520
Participant 3: you couldn't change your in the button.

548
01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:22.470
Participant 3: The button was already selected for. Yes, yes, maybe, and and no, and he couldn't, couldn't.

549
01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:30.220
Participant 3: so that one's already filled out. But if if it's in another situation.

550
01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:35.770
Participant 3: you want to change your mind. I don't know if you you could go back and forth or not.

551
01:09:35.979 --> 01:09:36.749
Jamie: Hmm!

552
01:09:37.999 --> 01:09:41.229
Jamie: So you would want to go back and forth if you did.

553
01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:44.469
Participant 3: Yeah, I think I think that's you may hit one by accident.

554
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.930
Jamie: Yeah.

555
01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:45.739
Participant 3: And.

556
01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:50.935
Jamie: So an easy way to go back and change questions or answers. Sorry.

557
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:54.370
Participant 3: Yeah, or the buttons just in the button for the.

558
01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:54.940
Jamie: Hmm.

559
01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.060
Participant 3: Yes. No.

560
01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.190
Participant 3: Yeah.

561
01:09:57.670 --> 01:09:58.180
Participant 3: Yeah.

562
01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:58.610
Jamie: Sit.

563
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:01.640
Participant 3: We may hit the wrong one and 48.

564
01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.479
Participant 3: Anyone change it.

565
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:15.229
Jamie: Okay, so that that error with it with jaws is telling that like announcing that everything was selected. That kind of was a big frustration point for you.

566
01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:18.359
Participant 3: Yeah, they would have been on the wheel back in the Us.

567
01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:29.269
Jamie: Yeah, yeah, I can imagine, that's definitely needs to be worked out. When we go back and revisit this form. So I appreciate that. That context there?

568
01:10:29.752 --> 01:10:33.790
Jamie: So that's all I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?

569
01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.109
Participant 3: No, no.

570
01:10:36.270 --> 01:11:02.590
Jamie: Okay, great. So I'm going to wrap this up. I just have to ask you that one question that I asked you in the beginning. So I just want to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable with sharing a video clip of this session with our Va partners just to remind you. We'll remove all the information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and we'll only share videos with Va partners for the purpose of improving va.gov, and other digital experiences.

571
01:11:02.948 --> 01:11:07.860
Jamie: Is there any part of discussion? You would not want to be shared in a video clip.

572
01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:12.230
Participant 3: No, I didn't do too much swearing or anything. So that's all.

573
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:36.969
Jamie: Okay? Great, yeah. So we really appreciate you taking the time and share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure that it really works for our veterans. So this is all great stuff that you shared with us. So thank you. And lastly, Peregium will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you could pass along to other veterans.

574
01:11:36.970 --> 01:11:47.400
Jamie: you may know and provide them a chance to participate in future studies like this. So like, I said, that's all I have for you, and thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day.

575
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.870
Participant 3: Thank you. Thank you.

576
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:52.310
Jamie: Take care bye.
