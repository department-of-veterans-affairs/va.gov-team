00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:08.719
Renata: Alright. I have started the recording I'd like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.909
P1: Yes. Should I click the okay, that just popped up.

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.913
Renata: Oh, yeah, yeah, but otherwise it just gets in the way.

4
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:25.479
Renata: second question for you. Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip of our discussion today to share with other Va partners. If we remove any information that could be used to identify you.

5
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.300
P1: Yes.

6
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:39.549
Renata: All right. Great. So let's get rocking and rolling before we look at that demo tool I mentioned before. Just a few warm up questions for you. Are you or anyone else in your household currently enrolled in the CHAMPVA program?

7
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.430
P1: Yes.

8
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.709
Renata: All right. How recently did you apply for the CHAMPVA program?

9
00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:51.830
P1: My 3 kids, and I have been on it since 2,019.

10
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.499
Renata: Oh, wow! Okay, do you remember what your experience applying and enrolling was like?

11
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:15.160
P1: It was very archaic. At that time you could not apply online. So we had to fill out the application we did we sent it via like

12
00:01:16.088 --> 00:01:18.810
P1: what's that mail that has a tracking?

13
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:35.589
P1: We had to send it via like tracked mail, because they said that sometimes they would lose the applications. Whether they're sent in or via fax. So

14
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.440
P1: it went through. I think it was like a 4 month. Wait after applying

15
00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.839
P1: and I mean, once we were in. It's been great.

16
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.129
P1: It's our primary insurance, too.

17
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:58.380
Renata: Okay, your primary got it? And have you submitted any medical or pharmacy claims to champ? Or have your medical like.

18
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.949
P1: Yeah, it's all handled by the doctor.

19
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.010
Renata: Okay. Alright. So nothing that you've actually submitted yourself through a form online.

20
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.860
P1: No.

21
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.832
Renata: Okay, got it?

22
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:24.850
Renata: those were all my questions to start. So for the next portion of the session. We're gonna be doing some stuff in that demo tool I mentioned. I'm gonna be dropping a link in the chat in a moment, which I'd like you to open in your browser and then share your screen and zoom. I can help walk you through that if we have any.

23
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.519
Renata: Okay, she is

24
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.700
Renata: but just wanted to give you a moment to close anything that you have open. You don't want, like

25
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.819
Renata: us to see on your screen silence any notifications, and let me know if you're ready for the link.

26
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.840
P1: Okay, I'm ready.

27
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.600
Renata: Alright!

28
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.770
P1: Okay.

29
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.680
P1: okay, it show it's popped up as a chat.

30
00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:53.529
Renata: Yeah. If you go into the chat.

31
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.660
P1: And click on that. Okay.

32
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.310
Renata: Yeah.

33
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.349
P1: Alrighty and.

34
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.680
Renata: Open in your browser.

35
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.820
P1: It did the Va, the va page.

36
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:16.829
Renata: Yeah, and then, in order to share it, you'll have to go back into zoom, and then at the bottom of the zoom app. There should be a green box with an up arrow that says, Share.

37
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.130
P1: Green. There we go.

38
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.689
P1: Okay, did that work for you?

39
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.227
Renata: Yeah. So now, if you can go back to your browser.

40
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.659
Renata: because now there we go. Okay, perfect.

41
00:03:39.947 --> 00:04:04.650
P1: So before you start to fill out this form, just a few things to be aware of. This is our testing site, and we won't actually be submitting this form. So nothing you click on will have any bearing on your benefits as we go through the form today, feel free to use fake information for sensitive questions like social security numbers. If you don't want to use real information, there will be some screens where you're going to be asked to upload some documents, as we're not actually going to be submitting this form. Nothing.

42
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.420
Renata: You upload here is going to be sent to Va. But you should have received an email from Perigan that provided you with some documents.

43
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.820
P1: For 2.

44
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.490
Renata: Session. Did you receive those.

45
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.929
P1: Yeah. And they were like, I believe, like 3 prototypes at the end.

46
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.290
Renata: Yes.

47
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.320
P1: The, okay.

48
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.590
Renata: Okay, are those like, do you have those on your computer, or or downloaded at all?

49
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.770
P1: I do, I do. I have them in my mail.

50
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:45.939
Renata: Okay, perfect. You don't need to do anything with them now, and I also have a backup link if we need it at all, but I just wanted to confirm that you got those so on this page you can scroll up and down, but without clicking on anything. I'd like you to just review the information and let me know your initial thoughts.

51
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.390
P1: Hey?

52
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.869
P1: The instructions are very clear.

53
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:15.909
P1: Yeah, easy to figure out.

54
00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:24.620
P1: The sign in boxes, big and identifiable. Yeah.

55
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:33.889
Renata: All right. I have a few questions for you about this page in your own words. What type of form is this page describing.

56
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.490
P1: A how to file a CHAMPVA claim.

57
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.300
Renata: Okay?

58
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.650
Renata: And do you know what types of claims you can file with this form.

59
00:05:46.403 --> 00:05:51.310
P1: Any sort of medical care, or pharmacy

60
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.270
P1: charges that you want covered by CHAMPVA.

61
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.990
Renata: Okay.

62
00:05:57.954 --> 00:06:05.849
Renata: and if you were actually filling this claims format on va.gov today, would you have the information?

63
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.929
Renata: Actually, wow, I'm sorry I haven't had enough caffeine today. What information do you think you'd need to fill out this form?

64
00:06:14.026 --> 00:06:20.589
P1: I'd probably need all of my information. Probably my sponsors. Information.

65
00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:23.909
P1: I probably have to upload

66
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:32.869
P1: billing statements. Eobs if they're Applicable Pharmacy. Information Pharmacy, Receipts.

67
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:46.390
Renata: Okay. And now that I have not gotten ahead of myself, if you were filling this out on va.gov today, would you have that sort of information on hand? Or, if would you need to pause the form here and like, go collect it before filling the form out.

68
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:52.889
P1: I'd probably have to pause, go find what I need, and then come back to the come back to the page.

69
00:06:53.250 --> 00:07:06.629
Renata: Got it. One more question for you on a scale of one to 5, with one being poorly and 5 being very well. How prepared do you feel, to file a claim based on the content on this page.

70
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.150
P1: 5.

71
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:18.760
P1: They really outline it well, the bold writing is clear and concise.

72
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:34.120
Renata: Okay, got it? I'm going to. Now. Have you scroll down a little bit further underneath that blue button where it says, sign in to start your form. There's a link that says, Start your form without signing in. If you could go ahead and click that for me.

73
00:07:36.620 --> 00:08:01.079
Renata: all right. So from this point on, I'd like you to start the form as if you're submitting a new medical claim for yourself, and I'll let you know when to pause so that we can discuss some things with the form. But just as a reminder again, this is our testing site. We're not submitting this. You can use fake information. And as you go through the form, if you could, please think out loud, we want to hear any reactions you're having, as you're experiencing them.

74
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.900
P1: Okay.

75
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:15.139
P1: see, 1st of all, love, that you don't have to sign in it. Sometimes it's so hard to sign in to Va or Dod or mill any military site. So I like that feature.

76
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.350
P1: Yes.

77
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.680
P1: okay. And then just start filling out information.

78
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.400
Renata: Yeah, just okay.

79
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:38.809
Renata: start filling it out. Let us know if you're having any thoughts or questions as they come up, and I'll let you know when to stop.

80
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.860
P1: Okay, if Champvie could do this for everything, it would be great.

81
00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.560
P1: Just have an online form.

82
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:04.999
Renata: Are there any other things that you have to fill out for CHAMPVA that currently aren't digitized on va.gov.

83
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.131
P1: Yeah, it was really hard for me to get a

84
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:17.551
P1: an account where I was able to see all of my prescriptions that I get from Meds by mail.

85
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:26.110
P1: it. Yeah, it's just it's kind of archaic. But I think they're they're starting to come into the century, which is good.

86
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.399
P1: Okay, I'm just gonna do

87
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:23.010
Renata: All right for this question. I know you mentioned at the beginning that champion is your primary insurance. We're going to imagine that you have additional health insurance.

88
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.770
P1: Got it.

89
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.709
Renata: So if you could just select yes, for this question.

90
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.390
P1: Alrighty

91
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.668
P1: just gonna make it up.

92
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:38.990
Renata: Totally fine.

93
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.319
P1: Wait, Kaiser.

94
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.719
P1: should I put a phone number, or just.

95
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.179
Renata: You don't have to. Okay, yeah, it's not required.

96
00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:00.299
P1: Okay, what time is it in this year?

97
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.710
P1: Just say, there we go.

98
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.699
P1: Would you like me to add another insurance.

99
00:11:16.137 --> 00:11:18.089
Renata: No, you don't need to. You can select no.

100
00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.710
Renata: And like I mentioned earlier, we're going to do a medical claim today.

101
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.360
P1: Okay.

102
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.080
P1: And

103
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:33.640
P1: oh.

104
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:43.380
Renata: All right. We're gonna pause here for a moment. So so far with the form. No questions. Nothing surprising.

105
00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.910
P1: No very easy.

106
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:56.599
Renata: Okay, alright, so on this page before we upload anything, just review the information that's provided here. And I'm gonna ask you a few questions.

107
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.300
P1: Okay.

108
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.040
P1: Okay.

109
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:34.279
Renata: All right. So in your own words. What needs to be included in the document that you're uploading on this page.

110
00:12:35.157 --> 00:12:36.172
P1: A lot.

111
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:47.035
P1: Obviously your name, all of your medical providers. Information. What

112
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:59.930
P1: medical care you got done, and how much they charged the date codes and then procedure codes.

113
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:10.520
Renata: Okay, and based on what you've seen on this page. Do you know what type of documentation is being asked for here? Like, if you needed to call your doctor's office to ask for it.

114
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.739
P1: Pretty much. Yeah.

115
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:23.306
Renata: Alright, so at this point, if you have access to those documents, I'm going to have you

116
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.670
Renata: upload the one the file. That's labeled Sample billing statement.

117
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.880
P1: Okay.

118
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.800
P1: Oh, here we go.

119
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.379
P1: I'm guessing it's this one right here.

120
00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:04.919
Renata: I believe so. Yeah, you may have to save it to your device before uploading it, because I don't think we have the ability to like, drag and drop.

121
00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:09.898
P1: Sorry you're seeing all of my stuff.

122
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.240
P1: Okay.

123
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.440
Renata: All good.

124
00:14:14.006 --> 00:14:15.549
P1: I'm gonna do this.

125
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.060
P1: Oh.

126
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:43.950
P1: okay, alrighty, and then go back to

127
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.789
P1: let me just find them in my files. Now.

128
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.860
Renata: Okay.

129
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.050
P1: Oh, my goodness, I'm on a computer. I don't use a lot.

130
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.970
Renata: No worries.

131
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.185
P1: Oh, my God!

132
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.420
Renata: You're fine.

133
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.780
P1: My daughter.

134
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.039
P1: Oh, my goodness, how do I get out of there?

135
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.790
P1: Just wanna get to. Okay, here we go.

136
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.982
P1: Okay. So here we go. Sample billing statement.

137
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.610
Renata: Perfect.

138
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.829
P1: Okay, what did you want me to do with the.

139
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.680
Renata: Oh, sorry if you could upload the sample billing statement on this page.

140
00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:47.668
Renata: So like, I said, we can't drag and drop

141
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.550
Renata: But if you scroll down a little bit further on the the CHAMPVA page that we were on, if you go.

142
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.890
P1: Back to the.

143
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:59.469
Renata: Browser. It should ask you to select a downloaded file.

144
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.440
P1: Gotcha. Okay, here we go.

145
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:17.900
Renata: Alright. And that error message there, that yellow error message. Do you know? What? What do you think this error message means?

146
00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:25.745
P1: That something went wrong verified in verifying the file.

147
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.490
P1: The download was not good.

148
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.585
Renata: Okay.

149
00:16:31.427 --> 00:16:35.239
Renata: What would you need to do to resolve it? Do you think.

150
00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:44.060
P1: I'd probably delete the file, redownload it and then

151
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.179
P1: try to upload again. I mean, it's not really

152
00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:52.380
P1: telling you much information on to why it didn't.

153
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.349
P1: It wasn't verified.

154
00:16:54.620 --> 00:17:05.270
Renata: Okay. If you could like, wave a magic wand and change what this alert says, would you want more information about what went wrong, or what was missing in the verification.

155
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.240
P1: Yes, absolutely.

156
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:18.559
Renata: Got it? So we can actually move on without resolving this error. We just wanted to look at it for the purposes of today's session, so you can go ahead and click that continue button.

157
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:21.740
P1: Okay.

158
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:27.419
Renata: And then once again, just review what's on this page? I'll ask you a couple of questions.

159
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.610
P1: Okay.

160
00:18:01.806 --> 00:18:06.960
Renata: All right. So once again, in your own words, what documentation is being asked for on this screen.

161
00:18:08.348 --> 00:18:21.059
P1: Pretty much the same as before. You need your doctor's information. The services that you received from the doctor. Like, based on the codes, the

162
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:26.139
P1: medical codes. What the other insurance paid?

163
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:41.440
P1: you know. Like details about the date, probably the where you got the medical attention at and then

164
00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:48.939
P1: the actual paper, so that or eob, so that you can upload it.

165
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:57.850
Renata: Okay, got it? So you can go ahead and scroll down. And I'm gonna have you upload the other document that you download. That's labeled Sample Eob.

166
00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:58.660
P1: Okay.

167
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:22.870
Renata: All right, and once again we saw that that little alert there so just gonna ask you again if you saw this. If you were filling it out on va.gov. What would you? What would you do if this alert popped up.

168
00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:25.210
P1: I

169
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:34.842
P1: again try and maybe delete the file, redownload it. See? If that worked I'd honestly be really frustrated at this point.

170
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.660
Renata: Really within

171
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:49.890
Renata: so would anything change in terms of like trying to re re download the documents? Would you call anybody at this point like, would the frustration make you quit? I I'm curious like what would happen next.

172
00:19:52.070 --> 00:20:03.810
P1: I mean, I'd want to get my, you know my medical stuff covered and paid for, so I would then go to the other avenues and maybe contact someone

173
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:10.709
P1: at Camp Va, or yeah, or Va, yeah, I'd probably call this number on the bottom.

174
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.420
Renata: Okay?

175
00:20:12.286 --> 00:20:28.760
Renata: Just a few more questions before we keep moving on in the in the form. So based on your experience with uploading, supporting files for your claim today? Do you prefer that file verification that that's letting you know about like verification for your file? Or would you prefer no file verification.

176
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:36.059
P1: Can you elaborate on file? What file verification is.

177
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:54.340
Renata: Yeah, for sure. So that little alert, that yellow alert that's popping up when you finish uploading. What it's what's happening in the background is that it's checking the file that you're uploading to see if it contains information, so would you prefer to have it checking that information when you're uploading it to see that it has like the rate

178
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.694
Renata: codes. Or would you prefer nothing?

179
00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:57.580
P1: Well, no!

180
00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.090
Renata: So verification.

181
00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:05.539
P1: I prefer verification. Just so I wouldn't have to repeat the process all over again.

182
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:08.230
P1: Yeah.

183
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:17.617
Renata: Okay, does your opinion on that change? If it's telling you we can't complete the file verification. This message. You're getting right here.

184
00:21:20.315 --> 00:21:21.400
P1: No.

185
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:32.279
Renata: Okay, got it on a scale of one to 5, with one being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to upload files to support your CHAMPVA. Claim.

186
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.429
P1: 5. Very easy.

187
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.999
Renata: Okay. Can you? Elaborate on what was very easy about it?

188
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.349
P1: I mean, like I said before, it was very to the point.

189
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:53.329
P1: They gave you instructions how to upload the files. I guess. The only thing was that little error message. Okay.

190
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.996
P1: yeah, that was not easy.

191
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.120
Renata: Got it all right. You can go ahead and click continue.

192
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:12.650
Renata: So like I said at the beginning, we're not actually going to be submitting this form today. So this is going to be the last screen we look at for this task. But I'd like you to without clicking the submit button

193
00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:16.909
Renata: at the bottom of this page. Just review your CHAMPVA. Claim that you filed.

194
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.570
P1: Okay.

195
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.010
P1: Okay.

196
00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.430
P1: okay.

197
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:58.110
P1: alright so without clicking that submit button. But if you did submit this form today, what would you expect to happen next.

198
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.059
P1: Something would probably pop up on the screen saying that

199
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.429
P1: my claim was submitted successfully, hopefully.

200
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:20.169
P1: And something about getting verification of the claim like to my email address, maybe.

201
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:20.810
Renata: Okay.

202
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:27.940
Renata: got it, and how soon would you expect to be notified by CHAMPVA about a decision being made on your claim?

203
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.789
P1: A long time.

204
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:38.599
P1: I want to say, like with my eobs, I usually get them within like a month or so

205
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.210
P1: after going to the doctors. So

206
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.210
P1: I'm wondering if that would be the same kind of timeline, I'm gonna say, like a month or 2.

207
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.429
Renata: A month or 2.

208
00:23:49.127 --> 00:23:59.239
Renata: Okay, in an ideal world? Would it be faster than a month or 2, or or like what? Where's the threshold there for you what would be the ideal experience.

209
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.600
P1: Faster!

210
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.520
Renata: Okay.

211
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.229
P1: For sure. But I think when they

212
00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:14.749
P1: because I think you've given all of your information online, there's really not much on their end to do other than to review it.

213
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:20.399
P1: So I would say, Yeah, like 2, 3 weeks would be ideal.

214
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:27.979
Renata: Okay, and how would you expect to be notified about a decision being made by mail, by email text message.

215
00:24:28.382 --> 00:24:31.209
P1: If I know CHAMPVA, it will be by mail

216
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:44.379
Renata: Got it. If you could check the status of a claim before a decision was made like before that eob gets generated, where would you expect to find a claim status.

217
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.430
P1: Probably within.

218
00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:57.230
P1: See? That's the thing. We just don't have that probably like the va.gov site. And you

219
00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.029
P1: you sign in. Give all your information, and

220
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:07.100
P1: in an ideal world every all of your CHAMPVA stuff would be there. But it's just

221
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.900
P1: A lot of it is by paper right now.

222
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:19.209
Renata: Got it. And when you say all of your champion stuff we're talking about just the claims, or what addition, what additional information would you want to see.

223
00:25:19.735 --> 00:25:27.624
P1: Claims. I'd love to be able to track my prescriptions via meds by mail.

224
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:35.530
P1: Just all of that, maybe. Oh, I I lost my id card. Can I request a new one? Kind of thing?

225
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.090
Renata: Okay.

226
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.023
P1: All that would be great.

227
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:59.079
Renata: Got it all right. So we're not going to be submitting this claims form today. So we can stop here. I just have a couple more questions for you before we move on to our next task, that one to 5 scale again, one being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the CHAMPVA claim form.

228
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.600
P1: 5. Very easy.

229
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:11.673
Renata: Okay, got it? So I'm going to drop another link in the chat. And I'm gonna have you click on it and open it. There is

230
00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:20.369
Renata: additional stuff in there that we're going to look at for the next portion of this session. It's that drive.google.com link.

231
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:37.509
Renata: All right. What I would like you to do is click on that 3rd file. Oops alright. That 3rd file that says example, CHAMPVA, send back letter.

232
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:38.200
P1: Okay.

233
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:56.919
Renata: You could go ahead and click on that. So for this task, I'm going to have you read through this letter. We're going to imagine that you received a letter like this in the mail from CHAMPVA. Regarding a claim that you previously submitted. So just review the information that you see in the letter, and then I have some questions for you when you're done reading.

234
00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.670
P1: Okay.

235
00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.520
P1: Alrighty.

236
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:31.510
Renata: All right. Have you ever received a letter like this before from Champag? Out of curiosity.

237
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.390
P1: No.

238
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:41.859
Renata: Okay? So a few questions about the the letter you just read. Do you understand the purpose of the letter? What it's asking for.

239
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:43.739
P1: I do?

240
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.889
Renata: Okay? And in your own words, what's what's going on here?

241
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:58.260
P1: Basically, you submitted for a claim. We could not process that claim because

242
00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.259
P1: there was no medical diagnosis code.

243
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:11.410
Renata: Okay? And why do you think sounds like sounds like it's the missing diagnosis code. But why in your own words, why else might you be receiving this letter.

244
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.400
P1: Oh.

245
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.909
P1: I don't know just that.

246
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.439
P1: They couldn't process it.

247
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:31.369
Renata: Okay, and what would you need to do at this point to resolve this claim that can't be processed.

248
00:28:32.908 --> 00:28:45.839
P1: You have to do everything all over again. Resubmit claim. Probably. Talk to your doctor, have your doctor add the missing code, so that everything goes through

249
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.219
P1: fine the next time.

250
00:28:48.600 --> 00:29:11.119
Renata: Okay, hearing a few things. So gonna repeat them back to make sure I I got them correctly. You you'd have to call your doctor's office, ask for that documentation again, and and make sure that it has the diagnosis code. And then I also heard resubmitting everything. When we're resubmitting everything. Are we doing that online? Are we doing it by snail mail? What? What are you expecting here.

251
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:18.329
P1: Right here based on this letter. They want you to every they want you to do everything. Snail mail.

252
00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:28.960
Renata: Okay, if there was an option to resubmit the claim online, would you prefer to do it online, or would you prefer to do it by snail mail.

253
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:30.180
P1: Online.

254
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:31.090
Renata: Okay?

255
00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:31.520
Renata: Oh, God.

256
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:42.780
Renata: okay. And if we could redesign this letter today and let you know like, Hey, you have snail mail and digital options. What would you want to see here to let you know? Like you could do this online.

257
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:54.500
P1: Probably like that second sentence. Saying, you need to resubmit

258
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.380
P1: kind of give an option of doing the snail mail or online.

259
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.400
Renata: Okay.

260
00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:04.760
P1: Yeah.

261
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:18.969
Renata: Got it. A couple more questions for you about this letter on a scale of one to 5, 1 being poorly 5 being very well, how well does this letter explain what you need to do in order to resolve the problem with your CHAMPVA. Claim?

262
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.910
P1: I'd say, like a like a 3.

263
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:35.289
Renata: Okay. And if you could redesign this letter, how would you explain these steps to resolve the problem, to bring it up to that 5 being like. Very well explained.

264
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:43.710
P1: I would probably go further into that issue of the missing diagnosis code. And what needs to be done

265
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.526
P1: in order to get that information, because

266
00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.720
P1: some people may not know how to go about getting

267
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.279
P1: that code from their doctor wherever.

268
00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:05.369
Renata: Okay. So like letting you know, you'll need to contact the the doctor's office to request like a specific document with the code is that is that.

269
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.050
P1: Yes, that would be helpful.

270
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:13.630
Renata: Okay, got it. Anything else that would help make this explain better what you need to do to resolve the problem with your claim.

271
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.259
P1: No, everything else was pretty clear. That would be the only thing.

272
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:28.809
Renata: All right. One more question here, one to 5. Scale again, one being poorly 5 being very well. How prepared do you feel to resolve this claim based on the letters content.

273
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.300
P1: 5.

274
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:40.050
Renata: 5. Okay, so why, why'd you give it a 5.

275
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.237
P1: Well, I mean, it does tell you what you need to do.

276
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.980
P1: says you need to resubmit your claims.

277
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:58.999
P1: maybe I drop it down to 3, cause it is. It is snail mail, and it's just

278
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.339
P1: waste a lot of time. In my opinion.

279
00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:10.400
Renata: Alright, and if if we could wave a magic wand, what would bring it from that? 3 to the 5, meaning like very prepared.

280
00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:20.730
P1: Yeah, adding the just adding what to do about the diagnosis code.

281
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:27.055
Renata: Okay, got it? So you're done looking at this, you can go ahead and close that tab

282
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:38.207
Renata: And I have one more link that I am dropping in the the zoom chat for you to open. It's going to look very familiar when you open it.

283
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.750
P1: Okay.

284
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:54.070
Renata: If you could go ahead and click on that. Yep. So this is the claims form that we already looked at. But we're not going to get started quite yet. Looking at this page, do you think you're in the right place to resubmit a claim.

285
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.130
P1: Resubmit.

286
00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.530
P1: That's not very clear just looking at it, but.

287
00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:02.950
Renata: Okay.

288
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:04.660
P1: A new claim for sure.

289
00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:14.100
Renata: All right. What would help, you know? Like I'm in the right place to resubmit a claim. If I've gotten that CHAMPVA letter saying there were problems.

290
00:33:15.817 --> 00:33:18.029
P1: Probably that 1st

291
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:26.049
P1: line right here. Use this form. If you're currently enrolled in CHAMPVA and want to file a claim or resubmit

292
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.020
P1: a claim that you've already submitted.

293
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.170
Renata: Got it.

294
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.500
P1: Like that in the wording.

295
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:37.000
Renata: Okay, and what information do you think you're going to need to resubmit a claim.

296
00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:46.360
P1: Probably everything you've had before for your last claim, plus the information that they said you were missing.

297
00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:51.399
Renata: Okay. So if I'm hearing you correctly, everything that's on that list there, that that bullet list.

298
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:51.740
P1: Why?

299
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.649
Renata: Whatever was in the ladder that they said miss was missing last time.

300
00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:56.480
P1: Correct.

301
00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:04.050
Renata: Got it? So if you could go ahead and click, scroll down and click on that start form without signing in link again for me, please.

302
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:25.249
Renata: So we're going to go through the form again. But this time we're going to act as though we are resubmitting the claim that you received a letter about from CHAMPVA just as a reminder. Again, you can use fake information, and please just remember to think out loud as you're going through it. We just want to hear any reactions or things that come up for you as you're experiencing them.

303
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.940
P1: Okay. So 1st off.

304
00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:36.350
P1: it says nothing about resubmitting. So I'm just gonna assume that I'd have to do the whole claim process all over again.

305
00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:37.370
Renata: Okay.

306
00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:40.520
P1: Okay.

307
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:46.110
P1: Okay.

308
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.259
Renata: And what option do you think? Okay, you're selecting resubmission.

309
00:34:53.269 --> 00:34:53.899
P1: Yes.

310
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.550
Renata: Okay.

311
00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:55.500
Renata: Awesome.

312
00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:04.870
P1: Okay.

313
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.799
Renata: And what information are you being asked for here.

314
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:18.110
P1: It's asking for the number from the original claim that was submitted.

315
00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.509
Renata: Okay? And do you know where to find that that number.

316
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.260
P1: Oh.

317
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:33.799
P1: based on this. It says you can find it on the letter that CHAMPVA sent you with saying you were missing information.

318
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:35.310
Renata: Okay.

319
00:35:35.969 --> 00:35:41.060
Renata: I can provide that letter from the bottom of the

320
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:52.021
Renata: the letter that I had you look at just a moment ago. I will drop it in the chat. I just realized I should not have had you close it.

321
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:57.180
Renata: Having a case of the Mondays on a Wednesday.

322
00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.090
P1: Okay.

323
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.450
Renata: So

324
00:36:05.245 --> 00:36:11.664
Renata: yeah, you can go ahead and either use this information to fill out that section, or you can use fake information.

325
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.100
P1: Okay.

326
00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.580
P1: Pdi. Oh, no.

327
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.270
P1: Okay.

328
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.000
Renata: All right.

329
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.360
Renata: You can go ahead and click. Continue when you're ready.

330
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.930
P1: I might just have to put in fake information.

331
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.860
P1: Is it that whole

332
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:16.809
P1: thing? Is it? 7, 1, 2,005 cm. 0, 0 1, 2, 3, 4. That's the whole Pdi.

333
00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:26.800
Renata: I'm going to be a little annoying, and answer your question with another question, which is, is that your assumption that that whole string of letters and numbers is the Pdi.

334
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.280
P1: I'm going to guess that it is.

335
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:39.049
Renata: Okay. Do you know, if there's any way to check that before you, you drop the whole alphabet soup in the in the the form.

336
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.350
P1: What do you mean? Check it.

337
00:37:41.886 --> 00:37:49.280
Renata: Like. Do you know, if there's any way that you could look up if that's the whole Pdi number, or if you can include like, if it's less than that.

338
00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.329
P1: I just refer back to that page from CHAMPVA.

339
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.080
Renata: The letter.

340
00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:54.700
P1: Yeah.

341
00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:02.250
Renata: Okay, got it. Yeah, for the purposes of today, we can just do a random string of numbers. And we don't need to include any symbols.

342
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.600
P1: Got it.

343
00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.219
Renata: And our system sometimes gets annoying with

344
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:20.773
Renata: consecutive numbers. So if you get an error message, that is, that is just our system being a little bit annoying.

345
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:24.820
P1: Okay? And then

346
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.799
P1: let's just say.

347
00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.399
P1: Okay, continue or stay on this page.

348
00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.799
Renata: You can go ahead and click the continue button.

349
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.520
P1: Okay.

350
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:07.269
Renata: All right. So we're on another screen where I'm gonna have you just look over what it's asking for, and I'll ask you a couple questions.

351
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.990
P1: Okay.

352
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:23.420
P1: All right.

353
00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:29.350
P1: Okay, so do you know what you need to upload, based on what you're seeing on this page.

354
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.119
P1: It's pretty clear. Yeah.

355
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:36.239
Renata: Okay? So in your own words. What? What do you need to upload at this point.

356
00:39:37.498 --> 00:39:44.750
P1: Well, after getting that missing information, you'd need to get a copy of that

357
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:53.049
P1: And then all the previous documents that were submitted the 1st time.

358
00:39:53.420 --> 00:40:01.879
Renata: Okay, got it? So you can upload the things that we already had you download from your email on this page.

359
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:07.650
P1: Okay, all 3 or.

360
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.060
Renata: Just the 2, the 2 originals, the the billing statement, and the Eob.

361
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:13.830
P1: Got it.

362
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.370
P1: Okay.

363
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:40.930
Renata: Oh, alright! We can continue without the other uploads for this test.

364
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.919
P1: And then just keep filling out.

365
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.240
Renata: Yeah, go ahead.

366
00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:13.829
Renata: And do you know why you're being asked to provide the sponsor information here and beneficiary information.

367
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:24.450
P1: It's I'm used to it. It's the veteran. Basically the reason that you you're receiving benefits.

368
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:25.740
Renata: Got it.

369
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.310
P1: Okay.

370
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:40.900
Renata: All right. So just a few questions for you before we close out the study, thinking back to the upload for this resubmission on a scale of one to 5, 1 being hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to find and provide that information related to your previous claim for this resubmission.

371
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:42.570
P1: 5.

372
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:55.479
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you. So on this page, the review page, would you do anything differently this time? Knowing that this is a resubmission of a previous claim versus like that initial claim.

373
00:42:56.810 --> 00:43:02.629
P1: Not really. I'd probably still look and make sure that all of my information is accurate.

374
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.070
P1: Yeah.

375
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:20.100
Renata: Got it. And I'm gonna ask you that hypothetical if we clicked that submit form button today, we're not going to do it. But if you did, what would you expect to happen next? Would it be the same, or any different from an initial claim.

376
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:32.740
P1: I think it would be the same. Maybe a pop up saying, your form was submitted successfully. Look for information regarding this in your email.

377
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:40.490
Renata: Okay? And would you expect any difference in the processing or response time with a resubmission versus an initial claim.

378
00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:49.310
P1: Maybe quicker, because they had all that information. And you're just

379
00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:54.829
P1: kind of given that one little bit of info that was missing the previous time.

380
00:43:55.180 --> 00:44:08.009
Renata: Okay. So what you said with the initial claim was one to 2 months, probably realistically but ideally 2 to 3 weeks. I for an initial claim. So what would that look like for a resubmission in terms of timeframe.

381
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:19.780
P1: I would probably hope for like 2 weeks, but in reality I it's probably it would probably be the same, probably like one to 2 months.

382
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:35.769
Renata: Okay, got it. Just a couple more questions before we close out this session. One last scale question, so one to 5, 1 being hard 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete the resubmission form.

383
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.380
P1: 5. Very easy.

384
00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:45.429
Renata: Okay. And how would you compare the 1st claim you submitted today? That new claim versus the Resubmission claim.

385
00:44:46.031 --> 00:44:51.140
P1: The same. The process was very straightforward.

386
00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:53.239
P1: I found it very easy.

387
00:44:54.090 --> 00:45:04.429
Renata: Okay, got it? So we're done with looking at the demo tool. You can go ahead and stop sharing your screen. We just have a few more questions to wrap up the session.

388
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:05.270
P1: Okay.

389
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:13.739
Renata: Alright, overall! Was there anything you saw in this session today that worked well for you?

390
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:20.970
P1: -Oh, it stop. Okay, just the whole online process. It's just

391
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.820
P1: new to me with CHAMPVA. And if they could do everything like that. It would make

392
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:31.281
P1: just so many lives, so many, so much easier.

393
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:38.190
Renata: Okay. Was there anything you saw in the session today? That was unclear or that did not work well for you.

394
00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:43.680
P1: No, not that I can think of.

395
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:44.580
Renata: Okay.

396
00:45:45.219 --> 00:45:51.659
Renata: What are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in the form? Not enough too much, just right.

397
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.280
P1: Just right.

398
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:53.940
Renata: Okay.

399
00:45:54.812 --> 00:46:15.739
Renata: and you mentioned that there's a lot of things that you do with Va that are or champion that are currently not supported online. I've heard Meds by mail mentioned a couple of times. Are there any other experiences you've had with CHAMPVA that have been frustrating or sort of taken a lot of manual process. That currently are not supported with digital options.

400
00:46:16.203 --> 00:46:28.266
P1: I have not seen. If you can apply online. I've heard that you can now but yet just that initial just applying for Champ. Va,

401
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:36.659
P1: And yeah, if we can just get a dashboard with all of our information that would be so helpful.

402
00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:46.930
Renata: Okay, got it? And I wanted to just confirm what device you're on. You mentioned. This isn't the the device you've been using today isn't what you normally use. Is it a an ipad or.

403
00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:47.959
P1: It's an ipad.

404
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.870
Renata: Okay? And what kind of device do you normally use for like computer work?

405
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.460
P1: My husband's surface. Pro.

406
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.909
P1: Okay, cool. I just curious. If

407
00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:00.980
P1: not charged. So it was good.

408
00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:02.230
Renata: Oh, okay.

409
00:47:03.006 --> 00:47:06.600
Renata: Alright got it any questions for me before we close out.

410
00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:14.449
P1: Is this something that's going to be rolling out soon? I know you probably can't share a lot of information, but.

411
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:42.790
Renata: Yeah, we're looking to support. Well, there's already a version of the claims form that's online. But that resubmission that we did that second, that last task after you looked at the the letter is not something we currently have online, but we're getting folks feedback and and trying to see if that's something that we're able to do. So. Yeah, we're we're trying to make sure that more of the the stuff that y'all have to do that interacts with CHAMPVA is easier to access online. At this point.

412
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.149
P1: Okay, that would be great.

413
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:51.640
Renata: Awesome. Just wanted to circle back and reconfirm. You're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners.

414
00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.080
P1: Sure, no problem.

415
00:47:53.486 --> 00:47:57.330
Renata: Was there any part of our discussion today you would not want shared in a video clip.

416
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.830
P1: No.

417
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:26.769
Renata: All right. Well, P1, I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is really helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for folks in the CHAMPVA program. So thank you so much. Lastly, Paragean will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans and their family members, you may know to provide them the chance to participate in studies like this. But with that, thank you so much again, and have a really great rest of your day and your week.

418
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.670
P1: Thank you. You. Do the same. Bye, bye.

419
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.070
Renata: Thank you. Bye.
