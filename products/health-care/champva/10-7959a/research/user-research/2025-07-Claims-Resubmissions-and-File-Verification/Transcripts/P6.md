00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.980
Jamie: Okay? So recording set

2
00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:18.189
Jamie: if you do see a bar at the top that says your meeting is being recorded, just hit. Okay, and it will go away. If it's bothering you, it may block some stuff going on in the screen. That you might need to see. But

3
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.340
Jamie: yeah.

4
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:32.489
Jamie: So I'm going to ask those 2 questions again. So just would like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

5
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.520
Participant 6: Yes.

6
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:44.240
Jamie: Okay, great. And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners, if we remove any information that could be used to identify you.

7
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.540
Participant 6: Yes.

8
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:59.149
Jamie: Okay, great. So we're going to jump into this. But first, st just some questions about CHAMPVA itself. Are you or anyone in your household currently enrolled in the CHAMPVA program.

9
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.640
Participant 6: Yes.

10
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.479
Jamie: Okay, is it just you, or is there any other people.

11
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.910
Participant 6: Myself and my kids.

12
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.969
Jamie: Okay. Great. How recently did you apply forCHAMPVA.

13
00:01:11.248 --> 00:01:12.890
Participant 6: It's been about 6 years.

14
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.330
Jamie: Okay, wow! Do you remember what the application experience was like at all?

15
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.670
Participant 6: I don't.

16
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.890
Jamie: You don't. Okay?

17
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:46.429
Jamie: Well, that's fine. That means that it wasn't. It wasn't as memorable which could be good or bad. Some people have terrible experiences, and it sticks with them. So you have, CHAMPVA. Have you had the opportunity to submit any medical claims or pharmacy claims through the CHAMPVA program?

18
00:01:47.699 --> 00:02:06.910
Participant 6: So a lot of the CHAMPVA that we use. It's automatic. Because I find places that take the insurance but I am. I actually did just recently find a new provider that I'm sending my kids to and they're going to be adding CHAMPVA as an accepted participant, so I will have to submit those claims.

19
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.579
Jamie: Okay? Well, you haven't done that yet, though. Have you?

20
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.119
Participant 6: Yeah, that'll be new to me.

21
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.849
Jamie: Okay? Well, great so you'll get a little insider look of what this this process looks like for you.

22
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.399
Participant 6: Good.

23
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.160
Jamie: In real life.

24
00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:29.449
Jamie: Yeah. So I'm gonna send you over a link. Let me just grab it real quick, and that's the link to the demo form here

25
00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:36.262
Jamie: Linkedin got some of these things going on here. Hold on!

26
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.440
Jamie: Try to bring up my channel. Where did it go?

27
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.915
Jamie: There's my chat.

28
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.810
Jamie: Okay?

29
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.049
Jamie: So if you could click on that link and open your browser.

30
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.550
Jamie: let me know when you have that open

31
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.679
Jamie: and let me know if you have problems, finding that link in the chat.

32
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.980
Participant 6: And it's opening now.

33
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.870
Jamie: Okay.

34
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.350
Participant 6: Okay, it's open.

35
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.339
Jamie: Great so would you be? Well.

36
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:39.969
Jamie: let me before we we jump into sharing windows. Just make sure that you just want to give you a moment to close any browser windows, tabs, or apps that you might have running, that you don't want us to see. So let me know when you're ready to do that, and then, if you can share your screen after that, that'd be awesome, and let me know if you need help. Sharing your screen.

37
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.084
Participant 6: Yes, I will. Hold on.

38
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.129
Jamie: Okay? No. Problem.

39
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.910
Jamie: Are you on? A mobile device today, or.

40
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.850
Participant 6: Yes. Yeah.

41
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.530
Jamie: Cool. Okay, just so. I know.

42
00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:50.059
Participant 6: Here we go!

43
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.930
Jamie: Direction to give you.

44
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.760
Participant 6: Share.

45
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.009
Jamie: Yeah, it should be share, content.

46
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.090
Participant 6: Screen.

47
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.260
Jamie: Yeah.

48
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.748
Participant 6: I didn't do it right, did I? Hold on? I don't see it sharing anything.

49
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.459
Jamie: Yeah. Not seen anything yet.

50
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.900
Participant 6: Okay. Start. Now.

51
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.760
Jamie: Seeing myself.

52
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.440
Participant 6: Alright! Let me just go back to this.

53
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.280
Jamie: Awesome.

54
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.330
Participant 6: That work.

55
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.340
Jamie: Yeah, we got it.

56
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.573
Participant 6: All right.

57
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.890
Jamie: Cool.

58
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.630
Jamie: Yeah, I know, like on zoom, like the mobile controls are a little wonky, that you have to share your screen. So

59
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:54.840
Jamie: I was prepared with a troubleshooting guide here for you, but glad we we got through this pretty seamlessly.

60
00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:15.510
Jamie: So just a few things. So this is the Chant Va claim form. But just, you know, reiterating again, this is our testing site. You won't be actually submitting the form. So nothing you click on this form would have any bearing on your benefits totally a Demo Portal type tool. So information is not going anywhere

61
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:33.050
Jamie: as we go through the form today. Once again, just a reminder. You can use fake information, especially with those sensitive questions like social security numbers, birth dates. We just don't want you to use any real information in there. So you just make up numbers and dates when you get to that point.

62
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:51.619
Jamie: So also you may be asked to upload some documents. We're not submitting the form today. So nothing upload you upload here would be sent to Va. So also, did you get an email from Perigan with some documents to download.

63
00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:56.350
Participant 6: I will have to check. Hold on.

64
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.510
Jamie: Okay. And if you didn't, it's not a problem. I I have them that I could send them over to you.

65
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.159
Participant 6: Sure if you could send them, that'd be easiest.

66
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.490
Jamie: Sure when we get there.

67
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.230
Participant 6: The UN.

68
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.890
Jamie: Yeah.

69
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:07.990
Participant 6: And then reshare.

70
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:23.236
Jamie: Yeah, that's what I figured. So when we get to that point, I'll pop the the link or not. The link, the the file in the the chat, and then hopefully, we can get that downloaded, but if not, we'll we'll improvise and take it from there.

71
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.970
Participant 6: Okay.

72
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:34.629
Jamie: Alright. So, without clicking anything on this page, I'd like you to take a a moment to look through all the information on here, and just tell us your initial thoughts.

73
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.280
Participant 6: And

74
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.299
Participant 6: the 1st section seems pretty straightforward and and self-explanatory.

75
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.540
Jamie: Okay, great. So in your own words, what type of form is this page describing.

76
00:07:15.772 --> 00:07:21.580
Participant 6: For, like a reimbursement form, to be able to get money back for care received.

77
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:28.440
Jamie: Okay, sounds good. And what information do you think you need in order to fill out this form.

78
00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:36.699
Participant 6: I would assume the patient's name and date of birth and where they receive the care.

79
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.790
Jamie: Okay.

80
00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:47.519
Jamie: would you have all that information on hand, or would you need to pause to find anything that you might need to submit the claim.

81
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.129
Participant 6: No, I think all information should be on hand.

82
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.000
Jamie: Okay.

83
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.329
Participant 6: I know it says you have a year to do it, but

84
00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:02.800
Participant 6: I personally, I would do it sooner rather than later for a reimbursement, so I didn't forget so it should be all pretty fresh.

85
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:14.459
Jamie: Okay, sounds great. So on a scale of one to 5, 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how prepared do you feel to file a claim based on this page's content.

86
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.100
Participant 6: 5.

87
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.615
Jamie: 5. Okay, great.

88
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.769
Jamie: So just just diving deeper into that. So what makes you give it a 5.

89
00:08:25.355 --> 00:08:34.049
Participant 6: Just because it kind of like, I said, seems self explanatory and straightforward. It lists the things that you'd need, and

90
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.350
Participant 6: and that's it.

91
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:44.850
Jamie: Okay, great so we're gonna begin submitting this form. So if you could scroll down to that blue box, there.

92
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.430
Jamie: there's a link at the bottom

93
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:54.310
Jamie: a little bit further. There you go to start your form without signing in

94
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.400
Jamie: awesome

95
00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:08.649
Jamie: so I would like you to walk through this claim as if you're submitting a sorry, this form, as you're submitting a claim for yourself.

96
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:27.669
Jamie: and I'll let you know when to pause, so I can ask some questions, but feel free to talk out loud as you're going through this. You want to know everything that's kind of going on in your head, any frustrations, any things that you you think works well or not. We want to hear it all.

97
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.480
Participant 6: Okay?

98
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.809
Participant 6: 1st one makes sense. I'm the beneficiary submitting the claim for myself.

99
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.969
Participant 6: and you receive Champier benefits. Now, yes.

100
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.790
Participant 6: Is this a new claim or resubmission for an existing claim.

101
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.889
Participant 6: It would be a new claim

102
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.339
Participant 6: enter the information. And you said just any information.

103
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:54.430
Jamie: Yeah.

104
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.250
Participant 6: Give me

105
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.409
Participant 6: and scroll down, I guess.

106
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.199
Jamie: You can enter any 9 digit number, I believe.

107
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:39.460
Jamie: Yeah.

108
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:54.610
Participant 6: It's your mailing address, so small. 3 things

109
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.390
Participant 6: I like when the United States is up top.

110
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.960
Jamie: Nice and easy, right.

111
00:11:01.735 --> 00:11:02.510
Participant 6: Yeah.

112
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.449
Participant 6: Now, just change and share the screen.

113
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:32.390
Participant 6: No.

114
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.055
Participant 6: your contact information.

115
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:12.790
Participant 6: your health insurance status. Do you have health insurance coverage? That isn't through. CHAMPVA. No.

116
00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:17.470
Jamie: So for this one we'd actually like you to click. Yes.

117
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.045
Participant 6: Sure. Yeah. So then, yes.

118
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:30.760
Participant 6: health insurance information. Next, we'll ask you to enter information about your health insurance. You can add up to 2 health insurances, but do not include CHAMPVA

119
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.780
Participant 6: name of insurance provider.

120
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.920
Jamie: You could just make up a name here.

121
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.020
Jamie: Now, do you? Do you have other health insurance other than CHAMPVA.

122
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.219
Participant 6: I do not.

123
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:53.839
Jamie: You do not. Okay. I was gonna ask you if you knew if there was a way to get your policy number and phone number easily. But that's okay.

124
00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.939
Participant 6: Oh, yeah, because if I was filling out the form, I would need to include that information as well.

125
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.545
Jamie: Yeah.

126
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.210
Jamie: But we could just move on at this point. That's not a problem.

127
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.809
Participant 6: Okay, what type of insurance does beneficiary have through this provider?

128
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.170
Participant 6: Guess it would be employer.

129
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:31.850
Participant 6: Does beneficiary have any other health insurance coverage that isn't through CHAMPVA. I already put in that one so I can click no, or should I.

130
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.389
Jamie: Yeah, you could click. No, we only need one for the purpose of this test.

131
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:36.560
Participant 6: Okay.

132
00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:42.039
Participant 6: Claim type. What type of claim are you submitting? I'm submitting a claim for medical care.

133
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.499
Jamie: Yeah, we're gonna do medical care today.

134
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.110
Participant 6: Okay.

135
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.510
Participant 6: and no.

136
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.719
Participant 6: Is this a claim for an injury or condition caused by a car accident? No.

137
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.020
Jamie: All right.

138
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:14.190
Jamie: so for this, this is where we're going to be uploading stuff. But just take a moment and read through this page, and then I have some questions for you.

139
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:29.490
Participant 6: Sure you'll need to submit a copy of an itemized billing statement often called a super bill for this claim. Ask your provider for an itemized bill as a patient copy is often missing. Critical information required by CHAMPVA process to process the claims

140
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.270
Participant 6: statement must include all of these information

141
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.030
Participant 6: to process your claim. Full name, date of birth.

142
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.560
Participant 6: provider's full name, medical title, address,

143
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:52.170
Participant 6: their Mpi number and their tax id number, a list of charges, date of service diagnosis

144
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:57.089
Participant 6: and a list of procedural codes, more information about the codes that should be included.

145
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:12.899
Participant 6: Mfa. Will not be able to process your claim. If your statement does not include all the listed information you may need to ask your provider for a statement that has all this information listed here, you can also submit any other documents you think may be relevant to this claim

146
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.409
Participant 6: and how to upload them.

147
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.780
Participant 6: So just from getting different bills in the past.

148
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:37.209
Participant 6: I know it would definitely have the my name or patient's name and date of birth. It usually has the provider's name and their title, the address and things like that. I'm not positive, though, if it automatically includes their Npi and tax id number

149
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:48.660
Participant 6: the charges are usually there. The data service is always there. The diagnosis should be there, and

150
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:54.310
Participant 6: I would assume that the procedural codes would be next to the diagnosis.

151
00:15:55.530 --> 00:16:09.790
Participant 6: So, going back, I think, to the 1st question, if I felt prepared to have everything that I needed. I think when I get to this step I may just need to look over the form to make sure that that stuff is actually on. There.

152
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:10.490
Jamie: Okay.

153
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:20.850
Jamie: Now, if there were anything missing from your your billing statement that the champion requires, how would you go about getting that

154
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.689
Jamie: next steps be.

155
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:36.690
Participant 6: Sure I would use the number on the bill from where I got the service, because usually there's like a a phone number to call for payments or questions. I would use the phone number to call them and ask for the missing information.

156
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.790
Jamie: Okay, great

157
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:46.000
Jamie: So now I'm gonna have you. Let's see if we get this upload going here

158
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:53.059
Jamie: hopefully we can. My Microsoft is not being very friendly to me.

159
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.349
Jamie: Just give me one moment. See if I could get this

160
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.310
Jamie: pushing documents is always a trick here.

161
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.243
Jamie: I think I'm making progress.

162
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.169
Jamie: Sometimes it lets me, sometimes it doesn't. I don't know.

163
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:26.660
Jamie: It's it looks like it's uploading. You should see it in a minute, and then we'll we'll

164
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:33.640
Jamie: next step is to try to download and open it, and then re upload, so hmm

165
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.139
Jamie: that that might take a minute to to try to do.

166
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.769
Participant 6: My server is slow right now.

167
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.140
Jamie: It's still saying it's uploading

168
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:54.410
Jamie: while we're waiting. If you could take a look at the content in that blue box and tell me what you think.

169
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.289
Participant 6: No sure

170
00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:09.440
Participant 6: to help reduce errors that might result in a claim denial. We'll scan your upload to verify. They meet document requirements. This may cause a 1 to 2 min delay during the upload process. Please do not refresh your screen

171
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.240
Participant 6: again. Self-explanatory.

172
00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:19.240
Jamie: Okay, so what do you think is happening when or gonna happen? Once you upload a document, there.

173
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.759
Participant 6: It's probably gonna take just a few minutes to attach.

174
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.490
Jamie: Okay.

175
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:34.850
Jamie: I'm still trying to work on it in this. I apologize. It worked just fine yesterday. I don't know why. It's

176
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.641
Jamie: because you weren't recording.

177
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:41.669
Jamie: Of course I'm on the spot now, so

178
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:49.736
Jamie: let's see if it'll make help me. Maybe I could do a link. We'll see if that works.

179
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.890
Jamie: So there's a link to the

180
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.689
Jamie: the file that I just put in the chat. And let's see if that'll allow you to open it and download.

181
00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.270
Participant 6: Okay, let me see.

182
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.280
Participant 6: Back to zoom chat.

183
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.005
Jamie: Yay!

184
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:35.151
Participant 6: Okay into a screenshot in case it doesn't work. If I can't find it.

185
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.179
Jamie: Like that. I'm gonna ask the users to do that next time.

186
00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:47.912
Participant 6: Now I just forget which screen I need to be on so.

187
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:55.665
Jamie: Yeah, that's why, like I, I always find uploading documents difficult on on mobile phone. I'm like, where did it just put it.

188
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.600
Participant 6: Yeah.

189
00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:58.559
Participant 6: Nope, that's not it.

190
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:07.280
Participant 6: Okay, upload file file.

191
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.709
Participant 6: I'm gonna have to go through all of that. So.

192
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:14.230
Jamie: Yeah.

193
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:18.339
Participant 6: Here we go, screenshot, and this one, there we go.

194
00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.489
Jamie: I thought it was gonna be.

195
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.755
Jamie: Yeah, I'm not too good with the files, but the screenshots are great.

196
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:26.510
Participant 6: Okay.

197
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.390
Jamie: That works.

198
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.429
Participant 6: We cannot complete verification for this file.

199
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:37.520
Participant 6: Can you retry verification, or you can continue without verifying?

200
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.120
Participant 6: Is that because I did the screenshot.

201
00:20:41.612 --> 00:20:57.919
Jamie: No, that shouldn't have anything to do with it, like I said, it's a prototype, so we might get some errors. So if you did get this error, because this this may happen in real life as well. If the file verification fails, what would your next steps be.

202
00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:10.099
Participant 6: I would still click, continue because it says, or you can continue without verifying. And I'm assuming at the end of the process it would let me know if something didn't go through or didn't work, or if they still need information.

203
00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:15.669
Jamie: Okay, sounds good. Yeah. You may go ahead. Yep, and click. Continue.

204
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:16.050
Participant 6: Sorry.

205
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.684
Jamie: It's okay. You're way ahead of me. That's fine.

206
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.460
Participant 6: Upload explanation of benefits for this claim from unitedhealth.

207
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:47.920
Participant 6: You'll need to submit a copy of the explanation of benefits from your insurance provider. This is not the same as a summary of benefits for the health insurance policy, the explanation of benefits, listed lists, what your other health insurance already paid for this specific claim. Okay, so this is like splitting it in to whatever the 1st insurance didn't cover, CHAMPVA would pick up.

208
00:21:48.895 --> 00:21:49.350
Jamie: Yeah.

209
00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:50.700
Participant 6: Okay.

210
00:21:50.880 --> 00:22:01.519
Participant 6: the explanation of benefits must include all this information. Date of service again, their name, their Mpi. The services.

211
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.990
Participant 6: the insurance provider paid form.

212
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.430
Participant 6: This may be a 5 digit Cpt

213
00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:17.885
Participant 6: or Hcpcs code or a description. The amount paid by the insurance

214
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:27.119
Participant 6: An explanation of benefits is usually sent by mail or email contact your insurance provider. If you have more questions about where to find this document.

215
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.629
Participant 6: you can also submit any other documents you think might be relevant to this claim

216
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:46.699
Participant 6: how to upload files. Okay, so basically, the 1st upload would have been from the original medical provider that I got my care from. And now this is asking for

217
00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:56.909
Participant 6: information from the insurance who paid the 1st portion of it. And now I'm submitting the claim for the second portion, so I'd have to have both of those documents.

218
00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:05.086
Jamie: Okay, yeah. Great yes. So same thing. I'm gonna send you that link or another link.

219
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.780
Jamie: If this doesn't work, we could always just use that same screenshot that you use. We just need something to ingest in here.

220
00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.160
Jamie: Okay, just sent that that link to the next upload. Yep, you got it.

221
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.112
Participant 6: I'm just gonna screenshot it again, because that was the easiest.

222
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.444
Jamie: and we only have to do this one more time.

223
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:38.240
Participant 6: Find my way back. Hold on. I think it was this. Nope, right?

224
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.620
Participant 6: Nope, okay.

225
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.700
Jamie: Starting to look the same. There you go!

226
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:58.370
Participant 6: There we go upload file camera

227
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:04.810
Participant 6: screenshot.

228
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.811
Participant 6: Okay, hopefully, that was the right one

229
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.200
Participant 6: and continue.

230
00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:22.920
Jamie: So it did. If you scroll down and go back for a second.

231
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.549
Jamie: we have a question on there

232
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:36.230
Jamie: scroll. I don't know if that thing's gonna pop up again. Oh, yes, so.

233
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.065
Participant 6: Yeah.

234
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:43.141
Jamie: At this moment doesn't look like it's working still. So just out of curiosity.

235
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:49.590
Jamie: if you did see this message pop up twice. Now, what would your next steps be?

236
00:24:50.921 --> 00:25:00.580
Participant 6: I would probably call like I would finish submitting everything on my end, and then I would probably call to make sure that everything was received, how it was supposed to.

237
00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:02.200
Jamie: Okay.

238
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:09.651
Jamie: sounds great. Yeah. So you can go ahead and hit that continue button again. That was my one and only question for that.

239
00:25:13.627 --> 00:25:17.019
Participant 6: File a champion claim form.

240
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.479
Participant 6: and we'll just expand all to go through it.

241
00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:27.030
Participant 6: Signer. Information. I was the beneficiary I received. CHAMPVA.

242
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:32.100
Participant 6: This is a new claim. It was a new name.

243
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:55.720
Participant 6: Oh, that's why, in the beginning I had put my name in there, which was the sponsor information, and then I had thought I messed up, and I was like, Oh, I I guess I needed to put my name in again like I missed the date of birth twice. The 1st one was the sponsor information, the second was the beneficiary information I thought, I just messed up. But okay, we're there.

244
00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:00.657
Jamie: You you like, I said. We're testing the form. You didn't mess up.

245
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.980
Jamie: The form just might have not been clear.

246
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:15.600
Participant 6: So after you've gone through all the steps with the file, verification uploads, just out of curiosity.

247
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:28.479
Jamie: Based on your experience with uploading the the supporting files in your claim today, do you? Would you prefer to use something like the file verification that you saw? Or would you prefer not to use it.

248
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.309
Participant 6: Like the box on the bottom.

249
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.059
Jamie: Yeah, on the previous page.

250
00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.079
Participant 6: I mean, I guess it's good to know if it didn't go through properly.

251
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:39.870
Jamie: Okay.

252
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.180
Participant 6: Just to make sure that it it was uploaded.

253
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.740
Participant 6: because then that would definitely send me to call to make sure that it was put through correctly.

254
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:53.520
Jamie: Sounds good

255
00:26:53.720 --> 00:27:01.010
Jamie: and on a scale one to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult was it to upload your files today.

256
00:27:03.033 --> 00:27:05.799
Participant 6: You said 5 being easy.

257
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.460
Jamie: Yeah.

258
00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.060
Participant 6: Okay, I have 5.

259
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:13.279
Jamie: Okay, great. Anything particular that jumped out at you as being easy.

260
00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:28.689
Participant 6: I mean, the screenshot definitely makes it easier. If I had already had it downloaded. Same thing, it gives you the option between the camera and the files. So you just click files and find the one that you need.

261
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.795
Jamie: Okay, sounds good. And

262
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:42.503
Jamie: So we made it to the end. Here, we're not gonna have you submit this just couple of questions about

263
00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:47.839
Jamie: like. So after you submit the form. What do you expect to happen next?

264
00:27:51.870 --> 00:28:00.413
Participant 6: Oh, hopefully, it says, Claim submitted, meaning that I did everything properly. I I would hope that maybe it would give some type of a timeframe

265
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:10.519
Participant 6: as to how long it might take, or if there's any, follow up like, if if I need to follow up with a phone number, or if they'll be contacting me.

266
00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:18.649
Jamie: Okay? And so how long do you think it would take to be notified by chant? Va about your claim?

267
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:28.269
Participant 6: I would hope in a timely manner. You know, within just a couple of weeks, you know definitely, within a month or so.

268
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.179
Jamie: Okay and how would you expect to get that notification.

269
00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.020
Participant 6: He's text.

270
00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.740
Jamie: Email, mail.

271
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:43.779
Participant 6: I do a lot of things through email, so probably either through text or email.

272
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:44.840
Jamie: Okay.

273
00:28:45.471 --> 00:28:52.859
Jamie: and if you could check the status of your claim before you receive that decision, where would you expect to find that status.

274
00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:01.810
Participant 6: Probably logging back into the Va system. Maybe there's some type of notification or something that would pop up.

275
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.830
Jamie: Okay.

276
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:28.390
Jamie: sounds good. So we can. We're going to stop this part right here. I do have a couple other questions about overall use of the form, and then we could get to the next part of this so just real quick on a scale of one to 5 more rating questions, one being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy do you think it was to complete the chant Va form.

277
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:29.620
Participant 6: Hi.

278
00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:31.940
Jamie: Sorry. What was that? 5.

279
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.570
Participant 6: Yeah. 5. Very easy.

280
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:39.420
Jamie: Okay. Great. Anything. Once again, anything that stuck out as being easy to you.

281
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:44.650
Participant 6: The whole thing was just very streamlined and and easy to go through.

282
00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.450
Jamie: Okay.

283
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:58.615
Jamie: great so for this next task, I'm going to provide you with another document. It promises the last download that you'll have to do so

284
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:04.940
Jamie: I am gonna shoot that I got that link all ready to go for you. Shoot that in the chat.

285
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:10.910
Participant 6: Okay.

286
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.190
Jamie: Alright.

287
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:18.110
Jamie: Yeah. So you could. Yeah, go ahead. Did you download it already?

288
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:19.769
Participant 6: I screenshotted it.

289
00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:25.278
Jamie: Screenshot it. Okay, great. That might make this next part a lot easier, too, with the screenshots.

290
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.509
Jamie: I'm going to keep that in mind.

291
00:30:30.362 --> 00:30:35.189
Jamie: So hold on. Let me just get back to my questions. Here.

292
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:38.510
Jamie: organize my screen a little bit better.

293
00:30:39.250 --> 00:31:06.160
Jamie: So if you can just take a moment and read through this letter. So basically, what's going to happen is imagine you submitted this claim that you just did. And then you waited some amount of time, and you received this letter in the mail. So I just want you to take a look at the letter, read it through, and just let me know what your thoughts are with the letters. And do you understand what's going on here?

294
00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:14.220
Participant 6: Okay, dear John Smith, we are returning the enclosed claims for the reason listed below.

295
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:20.440
Participant 6: If they were claims in your initial submissions that are not enclosed, those claims are still being processed.

296
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:30.530
Participant 6: You may resubmit the enclosed claims. Please include the attached paperwork and the requested information below. In a copy of this letter. With your resubmission.

297
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:59.420
Participant 6: please send your submissions to the address for questions. Please call so. It looks like it was missing the diagnostic code. It is your responsibility to provide supporting evidence for your claim. If you do not have the requested documentation and need assistance obtaining it, please check the box below and return a copy of this letter with the contact information of the person who possesses the necessary information.

298
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:22.699
Participant 6: I do not have the requested documentation, and require assistance to obtain it. Please do not check this box if you are returning the requested documentation of one year from the date of this letter, to respond, ensure that the patient's social security number is included on all claims submitted for payment. Failure to include social security will delay the process of your claim.

299
00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:25.950
Jamie: Okay, so.

300
00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.695
Jamie: Oh, I'm sorry for you.

301
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.779
Participant 6: Oh, no, no! I was just reading the last, the beneficiary there.

302
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:37.339
Jamie: Okay. So I didn't want to interrupt. I think I did so. Why do you think you're being sent this letter.

303
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.680
Participant 6: Looks like the diagnostic code was missing.

304
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:47.000
Jamie: Okay? And knowing that, how would you resolve it like what? What would be the steps that you take

305
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:48.130
Jamie: to resolve.

306
00:32:49.380 --> 00:33:01.159
Participant 6: I would have to call back to the place that I had originally gotten care and ask for another printout and have to re upload another form with the diagnostic code on it.

307
00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:07.210
Jamie: Okay? So you would submit another form online. With the missing documents. Right?

308
00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.250
Participant 6: Yes.

309
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:19.740
Jamie: Okay, great. So on a scale of one to 5, 1 being poorly 5 being very well. How well does this letter explain what you need to do in order to resolve the problem with the claim.

310
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:33.680
Participant 6: I guess 5. My only suggestion would be maybe like right above like the dot that says missing diagnostic code diagnosis code.

311
00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.699
Participant 6: Maybe just like

312
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:47.660
Participant 6: something about like what? Like things needed or things missing. Because it goes right from like, call this number to what it. You know what is missing.

313
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.000
Participant 6: But it just doesn't say like, that's what's needed.

314
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.869
Jamie: Yeah, yeah, I got you. Okay, yeah. Nice.

315
00:33:55.512 --> 00:34:08.169
Jamie: So on another scale to one to 5. Question. Oh, one being poorly 5 being very well. How prepared do you feel that you are to resolve this claim, based on a letter's content?

316
00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:09.820
Participant 6: Bye.

317
00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:11.499
Jamie: 5.

318
00:34:13.229 --> 00:34:16.739
Jamie: Okay, anything has stuck out as particularly

319
00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:21.879
Jamie: making you feel confident about submitting a claim or resubmitting the claim.

320
00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:42.200
Participant 6: It looks like it's simple and straightforward, and I like that. There's an option, I mean for myself, I will be able to call the provider and ask him resubmit this information. But for somebody who isn't able to do that, they're also able to check the box to receive assistance, to get that done. So it's not saying, you know you have to do this, or you can't

321
00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.180
Participant 6: complete the claim. Somebody will assist you so.

322
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.829
Jamie: Okay, sounds good. So

323
00:34:50.139 --> 00:35:01.009
Jamie: we're going to send you right back to the beginning of the form for this next part. So I'm going to resend that link over in the chat this way. You have it right on hand.

324
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.470
Jamie: Okay, alright. So

325
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:21.440
Jamie: hold on my thing. Just jumped around here apologize. I'm having all kinds of tech problems today.

326
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:34.670
Jamie: So there we go. So this is a form that we used before. So just looking at this page. Do you think you're in the right place to resubmit your claim.

327
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:46.520
Participant 6: Yes, because it did say something about filing a claim or updating an existing claim. So file a champion claim.

328
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.530
Participant 6: And

329
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.780
Participant 6: although it doesn't come out and say that.

330
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:06.160
Jamie: Okay.

331
00:36:07.518 --> 00:36:11.699
Participant 6: I guess maybe file a champion claim or update an existing claim.

332
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:19.179
Jamie: Okay. So you think, there needs to be a little bit more context on this page to make you feel more confident.

333
00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:21.340
Jamie: Yeah, please.

334
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:29.520
Jamie: Okay. What information do you think you'll need to submit your or resubmit your claim with.

335
00:36:31.381 --> 00:36:34.100
Participant 6: Well, I would hope that when I log back in.

336
00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:40.329
Participant 6: because all the information should be there so hopefully, you'll be able to just reaccess what you've already done, and just

337
00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:46.520
Participant 6: add to that, so just resubmit another form, but attached to like the originals.

338
00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:47.700
Jamie: Okay.

339
00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:55.649
Jamie: that's fair enough. So you could go ahead and get started. We're gonna click that link on the bottom that says, start in start your form without signing in

340
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.590
Jamie: again.

341
00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:57.140
Participant 6: Okay.

342
00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.930
Jamie: And just go through this as if you're going to resubmit the claim.

343
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:18.120
Jamie: Okay, so, Judge, based on this page, what option do you think you need to select here.

344
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.880
Jamie: now that you have received that letter in the mail.

345
00:37:23.005 --> 00:37:33.520
Participant 6: I would assume the claim. Oh, no, no, I'm off that page. The the claim identification number is probably somewhere on the top of that form.

346
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.370
Jamie: Okay.

347
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:40.019
Jamie: So you go ahead and make whatever selection you think.

348
00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:50.369
Participant 6: I was just gonna look down here because it also says like where to find them. So that's helpful. The control number is located on the champion of benefits that we mailed to you

349
00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:56.380
Participant 6: and located on the bottom of the letter we mailed to you. Okay, so both of them would be there.

350
00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.030
Jamie: Okay.

351
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.090
Participant 6: I don't really get out of that

352
00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.029
Participant 6: Oh, so that's a long one.

353
00:38:13.865 --> 00:38:15.709
Participant 6: The Pdi number.

354
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:16.380
Jamie: Yeah.

355
00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.459
Participant 6: Let's see if copy paste would work.

356
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:21.759
Participant 6: I don't know.

357
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.980
Participant 6: Took me out of the other one. Okay, hold on.

358
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.049
Participant 6: Think it said that was the Pdi number.

359
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:42.760
Jamie: Okay.

360
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.080
Participant 6: Is it the whole date?

361
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.280
Participant 6: Include the date. I don't know. I just didn't read far enough. Okay.

362
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:05.965
Jamie: Great.

363
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:12.723
Participant 6: It works

364
00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.345
Jamie: Awesome.

365
00:39:15.445 --> 00:39:18.490
Participant 6: What was the original type of claim?

366
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.370
Participant 6: Medical?

367
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.000
Participant 6: Yeah?

368
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:24.260
Participant 6: And.

369
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.150
Jamie: Yeah. Make up some stop. Here.

370
00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:28.560
Participant 6: Okay.

371
00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.959
Jamie: So where do you think you would find this information if it was a real claim.

372
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:56.090
Participant 6: Okay, most likely on the original form that I had submitted.

373
00:39:56.090 --> 00:40:00.680
Jamie: Okay? So you defer back to the the 1st claim form.

374
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:01.860
Participant 6: Yes.

375
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:02.830
Jamie: Okay.

376
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:13.170
Jamie: alright upload page again. Just take a look and just let me know in your own words what what you're being asked to do on this page.

377
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:28.389
Participant 6: Upload supporting documents for your medical claim. You need to submit these documents. Copy of the documents with missing information will be requested in the letter we emailed to you and all documents you submitted with your claim.

378
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:39.689
Participant 6: These documents could include paperwork attached to your prescription, pharmacy or cement, it says, and all documents you submitted with your claim. Does that mean you need to resubmit

379
00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.610
Participant 6: all documents.

380
00:40:42.614 --> 00:40:49.690
Jamie: Gonna be annoying and answer your question with the question, is that what you think you need to resubmit based on this content?

381
00:40:49.962 --> 00:40:57.849
Participant 6: That's okay. Well, it just says you'll need to submit these documents. And then it says all documents you submitted with your claim. So it makes me feel like

382
00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.980
Participant 6: I have to do everything over again. Not just

383
00:41:02.782 --> 00:41:05.020
Participant 6: send in what I was missing.

384
00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:06.100
Jamie: Okay.

385
00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:15.729
Participant 6: And then the 1st one copies of documents with missing information. We requested in the letter that we mailed to you. That makes sense because of what you are missing. You have to upload that.

386
00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:16.750
Jamie: Okay.

387
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:23.169
Participant 6: These documents could include paperwork attached with your prescription pharmacy, and then how to upload.

388
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.780
Jamie: Okay.

389
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:36.880
Participant 6: To help reduce errors that might result in a claim denial. We'll scan your uploads to verify. They met the requirements. This usually may take one to 2 min.

390
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.130
Participant 6: Don't refresh. Okay.

391
00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:45.240
Jamie: So you can go ahead and just upload any document that I sent you before. It doesn't matter

392
00:41:49.680 --> 00:42:08.540
Jamie: and ignore the the error. We have already been through that. So go ahead and hit. Continue and then you just go through the form again and complete it as you would, and let us know same thing. Talk out loud. Let us know any frustrations you may, having anything that you're thinking, anything that you may like. So.

393
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:17.040
Participant 6: Okay, I mean, this is where I messed up the 1st time sponsors name, and then the next one was your information.

394
00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.909
Jamie: We've seen it again. So now you realize so.

395
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:20.350
Participant 6: I know.

396
00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.769
Jamie: You're being asked to provide this information.

397
00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:32.050
Participant 6: Well, definitely the sponsors name because it has to go under insurance. But maybe if it was all on the same page it would have clicked that I was doing 2 separate ones.

398
00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:34.979
Jamie: Okay, oh, that makes sense. Yeah.

399
00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.649
Participant 6: Didn't ask for the sponsor's date of birth.

400
00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:44.670
Participant 6: I think usually when I do a lot of Va stuff they always want, like last date of birth, and last 4.

401
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:45.550
Jamie: Okay.

402
00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:49.359
Participant 6: So it just said sponsors name, so that I think that's what threw me off.

403
00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.459
Jamie: Okay, that's that's good to know.

404
00:42:52.950 --> 00:43:06.191
Jamie: Yeah, we have a lot of people that submit various Va forms, too, that they're kind of going in there with that that mental model, getting used to to submitting other forms a certain way.

405
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:07.940
Participant 6: Yeah.

406
00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:22.750
Participant 6: thing. This was pretty easy.

407
00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:23.710
Jamie: Okay.

408
00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.700
Participant 6: Has your mailing address changed?

409
00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.649
Participant 6: Okay, expand all again.

410
00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:14.040
Jamie: So, knowing that this is a resubmission this time. Would you do anything differently on this page?

411
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.866
Participant 6: No, but because it was a resubmission.

412
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:30.099
Participant 6: I guess I feel like the information would have already been in there like I if I just logged in and and clicked

413
00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.409
Participant 6: the link of my claim

414
00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:44.450
Participant 6: that rather than having to re put in you know the sponsors, information and my information. My address like that should all be there, because I've already done that portion. I'm just adding to it.

415
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.037
Jamie: Okay, good to know?

416
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:50.750
Jamie: So

417
00:44:52.220 --> 00:45:06.179
Jamie: same question as before when we're on this page, what do you think would happen next after you hit, submit? What do you expect to happen? Anything different from the resubmission, or from the original submission to the resubmission.

418
00:45:08.266 --> 00:45:17.979
Participant 6: No, just something popping up with. I guess maybe a a phone number, if I need a additional help. And you know about how long it would take.

419
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:19.740
Jamie: Okay.

420
00:45:20.455 --> 00:45:27.770
Jamie: do you think there would be any difference in processing time compared from the original submission or the resubmission.

421
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:35.829
Participant 6: I would hope that this one will go quicker because the original claim was already started. So a lot of the information should already be processed

422
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:37.455
Participant 6: hopefully.

423
00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.420
Jamie: Great.

424
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:51.929
Jamie: So that's all the questions I have on the form for, like actually sharing your screen and looking at the form. So if you want to stop sharing, you can go ahead if you don't. You know.

425
00:45:52.090 --> 00:46:11.189
Participant 6: Whatever you're comfortable with awesome. So I just have a few more questions about the form. So another rating question on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to complete this form! And why did you give it that rating

426
00:46:12.499 --> 00:46:26.739
Participant 6: I guess I would do a 4 for that one, not because it was difficult or hard, but because I felt like a lot of the information should have already been in there, because I was just updating. I wasn't really submitting a brand new form.

427
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:38.630
Jamie: All right. Sounds good. So how would you compare your experience with submitting the 1st claim? Versus the resubmission of the claim.

428
00:46:39.886 --> 00:46:41.190
Participant 6: They felt really similar.

429
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:42.210
Jamie: Okay?

430
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.190
Jamie: So they were. They were similar. Anything else that you noticed.

431
00:46:48.995 --> 00:46:57.374
Participant 6: I mean, obviously the 1st one was a little bit more entailed because there was more information needed to gather the 1st time to upload

432
00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:07.019
Participant 6: So the second one was, you know, easier, as they already mailed me a form as to what I was missing. I knew what I had to upload and put in.

433
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:13.000
Jamie: Okay. So the second time around you're like old hat kind of used to it, you know.

434
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:13.370
Participant 6: Yeah.

435
00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:15.450
Jamie: You were kind of knew what to expect.

436
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:25.420
Jamie: Awesome. Was there anything that you saw in this overall session today that worked well for you on both the initial claim and the resubmission.

437
00:47:26.863 --> 00:47:38.770
Participant 6: Yeah, I mean, they were both easy to get to and and easy to find, and it I didn't feel like it was asking too much information or things that I had to like, stop and go

438
00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:43.060
Participant 6: look for like I didn't know that it was really just straightforward stuff.

439
00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:49.380
Jamie: Okay, great. And was there anything that wasn't clear or didn't work well for you?

440
00:47:52.010 --> 00:48:14.000
Participant 6: no, I think the only suggestion would be when I had to resubmit the claim up at the top, if it said, like filing a claim and resubmitting or indicated. You know that that was the same form for both, because the Va. Has so many forms, and you never know, you know, if you're clicking on the right thing, or where you're going to, maybe just to clarify for that. But that's it.

441
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:21.509
Jamie: Okay, sounds great. So that's actually all my questions I have. Do you have any questions for me?

442
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.500
Participant 6: No, I think that's it.

443
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.530
Jamie: Okay.

444
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:40.848
Jamie: alright, so we're gonna wrap this up. I just wanna circle back with that one question that said I was going to repeat again at the end, so are you comfortable? If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va. Partners? Sorry cannot talk.

445
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:42.490
Participant 6: And he's like, Okay.

446
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:43.810
Jamie: Yeah, just to remind you.

447
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:44.260
Participant 6: Absolutely.
