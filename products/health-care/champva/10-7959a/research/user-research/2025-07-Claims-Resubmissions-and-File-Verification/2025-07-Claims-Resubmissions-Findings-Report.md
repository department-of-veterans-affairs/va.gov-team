## Research Goals
Currently, if Veterans or their family members submit form 10-7959a and the information they provide to support their claim is not sufficient, they will either receive a notification that they need to resubmit the claim to include the necessary information, or they will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) that denies the claim. In either case, the form must be resubmitted.

The digital flow for form 10-7959a processes a resubmission as a new claim, which can cause delays for the beneficiaries and contributes additional work to the CHAMPVA backlog. We have proposed improving the existing 10-7959a digital flow so that users can mark a claim as a resubmission. We have also suggested adding a Large Language Model [OCR/LLM] file verification for claims documentation reduces errors, resulting in the need for fewer resubmissions overall.

The goals of this study are to:
1. Gauge the usability of the updated initial claim submission and resubmission flows, as measured by observed task success and self-reported ease-of-use prompts.
2. Confirm users' understanding of the resubmission process as presented in the content of the 10-7959a, their expectations for what will be required and their responsibilities for providing accurate supporting documentation.
3. Understand users’ expectations for file verification when submitting documentation for a CHAMPVA claim.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- How might we make it easier for family members and beneficiaries to submit claims online with the correct information? 
- How might we improve the experience of family members and beneficiaries who must resubmit a claim to correct missing information?

## Research Questions

**Goal 1:** Gauge the usability of the updated initial claim submission and resubmission flows, as measured by observed task success and self-reported ease-of-use prompts.
1. Are users able to successfully submit an initial claim and resubmit a claim that requires additional documentation?
2. Do users know where to file a claim resubmission within the digital form?
3. Do users understand what to do when presented with a claims sendback letter or EOB indicated the claim was denied?
4. What points of confusion, if any, do users have with the claims submission and resubmission process?

**Goal 2:** Confirm users' understanding of the resubmission process as presented in the content of the 10-7959a, their expectations for what will be required and their responsibilities for providing accurate supporting documentation.
1. Do users understand the information required for an initial claim or resubmission and know where to find it?
2. Do users understand what supporting documentation they’ll need to upload for their based on the information provided before they start the application?
3. Do users understand the specific requirements for each type of document they need to submit when on the upload page?
  
**Goal 3:** Understand users’ expectations for file verification when submitting documentation for a CHAMPVA claim.
1. Do users expect any form of digital verification to happen when they upload a document?
2. Do users expect to be told if uploaded documents are incorrect or do they expect to wait until their claim is reviewed to receive feedback?
3. How do users respond to an error indicating information is missing from a document they uploaded?
4. Are users comfortable with the amount of time file verification takes?

## Methodology 
We conducted 1-hour remote moderated research sessions from August 6 to August 15, 2025. These sessions included a semi-structured interview as well as a combined usability/content comprehension test protocol to gauge users' understanding of the CHAMPVA Claims submission and resubmission processes, the supporting documentation required for each claim, and the use of file verification when uploading their supporting documentation. The test was conducted in Staging.

Each participant saw the introduction page to the 10-7959a forms, completed form 10-7959a as an initial claim, and uploaded any documentation required. For documentation, they viewed the page which listed document requirements and contained an alert about file verification, then received an error message after file verification before continuing with the form. All participants then viewed a sample sendback letter for a claim and completed form 10-7959a again, this time following the resubmission path. They discussed their expectations around the submission and response timelines after each test.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **H1:** Users will understand they need to return to the digital form to resubmit a claim.
  - **Likely False**  
  - Of the 12 participants who tested the sendback letter, all 12 commented on the fact that the letter only mentioned a mail-in option. When presented with the online form again, only 4 participants thought they were in the right place to resubmit a claim.

- **H2:** Users will understand that the information required to resubmit the claim can be found in the claim letter.
  - **Likely True**
  - 10 of 12 participants understood that the letter meant they needed to resubmit the claim and understood what the missing information was. 8 of 12 were able to find the PDI number in the letter during the resubmission task, either on their own or after reading the help text on the page.
 
- **H3:** Users will question the need to re-enter beneficiary and/or sponsor information when resubmitting the claim.
  - **Likely True**
  - 8 of 12 participants commented specifically about being asked to fill out sponsor and beneficiary information. 5 of 12 expected that information to be known or prefilled upon resubmission.

- **H4:** Users understand the types of documents needed for resubmission.
  - **Mostly True**
  - 10 of 14 participants were able to find the information on the intro page prior to entering the first claim. 9 of 14 were comfortable with the requirements listed on the upload page, though 4 of 14 said they would need to check their documentation for all the details.

- **H5:** Users will not understand the specific information needed on each document without prompting.
  - **Maybe True**
  - Participants had a mixed response when asked to read through the document upload page. 5 of 14 commented that they were unsure of what the terms meant or that they would have difficulty obtaining the information. 6 of 14 seemed confident they knew what a superbill was and how to get it.

- **H6:** Users will prefer the document verification compared to a non-OCR file upload.
  - **Likely True**
  - 9 of 14 participants said they liked the idea of file verification or thought it could be helpful, but when receiving an error, 6 of 14 would have opted to bypass it to continue.
 
- **H7:** Users will not question how we're verifying the information (what we're using to scan).
  - **Likely True**
  - No participants asked what was being used to verify their information, but 3 of 14 commented that they didn’t know how the verification worked.

- **H8:** Users may be confused about how to resolve the error messages they see or how to bypass an error.
  - **More Information Needed**
  - LLM verification was not working for this study, so all participants were presented with a generic message that said verification could not be completed. They did not receive error messaging specific to issues with the file they were uploading in the resubmission task. See Key Finding 6 for more details on users' expectations for error messages.

- **H9:** Users will understand that file verification takes time and will be willing to wait until verification is completed.
  - **Maybe True**
  - LLM verification was not working, so the error message they saw came up right away. Since participants did not experience a delay, most participants did not mention it. Of the 14 participants, only 1 stated that the 1-2 minute delay mentioned in the alert would lengthen the form time.


## Key Findings

1. Many participants (9 of 14) reported that the initial claim and resubmission claim flows were "easy" or "very easy."
2. Most participants (10 of 14) understood what supporting documents were required for a claim, either based on the information on the Introduction page or the information on the Document Upload page.
3. The majority of participants (11 of 12) wanted to resubmit their claim online, but were unsure if they could do so.
4. Most participants (8 of 12) knew to look in the sendback letter for the PDI number when resubmitting their claim, but entering it correctly proved more difficult.
5. Most participants (8 of 12) commented on having to resubmit or re-enter information from the original claim in the resubmission flow.
6. 9 of 14 participants liked the idea of file verification prior to or after attempting to upload a file to their claim, even when they received an error message.

## Additional Insights

1. Participants thought the sendback letter was clear about the issue with the initial claim, but some users were frustrated by the language.
2. Many participants expected or desired a way to check their claims status online.
3. Some participants were confused with the sponsor and beneficiary pages, entering the same information in both.

### Details of Additional Insights

**Additional Insight 1:** Participants thought the sendback letter was clear about the issue with the initial claim, but some users were frustrated by the language.

- Of the 12 participants who viewed the letter, 10 said they understood what was wrong and what they needed to do to resolve it.
  - 3 of 12 commented that obtaining the information requested in the letter (Dx code) would be difficult or burdensome.
  - 1 participant felt their doctor should submit the missing information on their behalf.
  - 1 participant said they would give up and eat the cost of the claim to avoid the hassle of resubmitting.

**Additional Insight 2:** Many participants expected or desired a way to check their claims status online.

- 8 of 14 participants mentioned that they would expect to be able to check their claims status online after submitting the form.
  - 2 of 14 participants mentioned they would expect to see a link in the confirmation email to where they could check on the status of their claim.
  - 1 participant expected status updates by email as the claim was processed.

**Additional Insight 3:** Some participants were confused with the sponsor and beneficiary pages, entering the same information in both.

- 5 of 14 participants entered either the beneficiary’s information in the sponsor section, or the sponsor’s information in the beneficiary section.

## Recommendations

1. **Clarify that resubmissions can be submitted online:** Update content within the sendback letter to specify the option to resubmit the claim online in addition to mail. Update content on the online form introduction to specify that the form is for resubmissions as well as new claims.
   - _Supporting evidence: [Insert data]_  
2. **Provide more detail to users for file verification messaging:** Improve the content in the alert message on the page to let users know what information is being verified. Update the content in the error messages to let users know specifically what is wrong and what they need to correct, or if they cannot correct it (verification is not working).
