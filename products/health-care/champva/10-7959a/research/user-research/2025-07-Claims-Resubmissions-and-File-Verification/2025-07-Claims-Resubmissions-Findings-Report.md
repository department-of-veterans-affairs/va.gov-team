## Research Goals
Currently, if Veterans or their family members submit form 10-7959a and the information they provide to support their claim is not sufficient, they will either receive a notification that they need to resubmit the claim to include the necessary information, or they will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) that denies the claim. In either case, the form must be resubmitted.

The digital flow for form 10-7959a processes a resubmission as a new claim, which can cause delays for the beneficiaries and contributes additional work to the CHAMPVA backlog. We have proposed improving the existing 10-7959a digital flow so that users can mark a claim as a resubmission. We have also suggested adding a Large Language Model [OCR/LLM] file verification for claims documentation reduces errors, resulting in the need for fewer resubmissions overall.

The goals of this study are to:
1. Gauge the usability of the updated initial claim submission and resubmission flows, as measured by observed task success and self-reported ease-of-use prompts.
2. Confirm users' understanding of the resubmission process as presented in the content of the 10-7959a, their expectations for what will be required and their responsibilities for providing accurate supporting documentation.
3. Understand users’ expectations for file verification when submitting documentation for a CHAMPVA claim.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- How might we make it easier for family members and beneficiaries to submit claims online with the correct information? 
- How might we improve the experience of family members and beneficiaries who must resubmit a claim to correct missing information?

## Research Questions

**Goal 1:** Gauge the usability of the updated initial claim submission and resubmission flows, as measured by observed task success and self-reported ease-of-use prompts.
1. Are users able to successfully submit an initial claim and resubmit a claim that requires additional documentation?
2. Do users know where to file a claim resubmission within the digital form?
3. Do users understand what to do when presented with a claims sendback letter or EOB indicated the claim was denied?
4. What points of confusion, if any, do users have with the claims submission and resubmission process?

**Goal 2:** Confirm users' understanding of the resubmission process as presented in the content of the 10-7959a, their expectations for what will be required and their responsibilities for providing accurate supporting documentation.
1. Do users understand the information required for an initial claim or resubmission and know where to find it?
2. Do users understand what supporting documentation they’ll need to upload for their based on the information provided before they start the application?
3. Do users understand the specific requirements for each type of document they need to submit when on the upload page?
  
**Goal 3:** Understand users’ expectations for file verification when submitting documentation for a CHAMPVA claim.
1. Do users expect any form of digital verification to happen when they upload a document?
2. Do users expect to be told if uploaded documents are incorrect or do they expect to wait until their claim is reviewed to receive feedback?
3. How do users respond to an error indicating information is missing from a document they uploaded?
4. Are users comfortable with the amount of time file verification takes?

## Methodology 
We conducted 1-hour remote moderated research sessions from August 6 to August 15, 2025. These sessions included a semi-structured interview as well as a combined usability/content comprehension test protocol to gauge users' understanding of the CHAMPVA Claims submission and resubmission processes, the supporting documentation required for each claim, and the use of file verification when uploading their supporting documentation. The test was conducted in Staging.

Each participant saw the introduction page to the 10-7959a forms, completed form 10-7959a as an initial claim, and uploaded any documentation required. For documentation, they viewed the page which listed document requirements and contained an alert about file verification, then received an error message after file verification before continuing with the form. All participants then viewed a sample sendback letter for a claim and completed form 10-7959a again, this time following the resubmission path. They discussed their expectations around the submission and response timelines after each test.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **H1:** Users will understand they need to return to the digital form to resubmit a claim.
  - **Likely False**  
  - Of the 12 participants who tested the sendback letter, all 12 commented on the fact that the letter only mentioned a mail-in option. When presented with the online form again, only 4 participants thought they were in the right place to resubmit a claim.

- **H2:** Users will understand that the information required to resubmit the claim can be found in the claim letter.
  - **Likely True**
  - 10 of 12 participants understood that the letter meant they needed to resubmit the claim and understood what the missing information was. 8 of 12 were able to find the PDI number in the letter during the resubmission task, either on their own or after reading the help text on the page.
 
- **H3:** Users will question the need to re-enter beneficiary and/or sponsor information when resubmitting the claim.
  - **Likely True**
  - 8 of 12 participants commented specifically about being asked to fill out sponsor and beneficiary information. 5 of 12 expected that information to be known or prefilled upon resubmission.

- **H4:** Users understand the types of documents needed for resubmission.
  - **Mostly True**
  - 10 of 14 participants were able to find the information on the intro page prior to entering the first claim. 9 of 14 were comfortable with the requirements listed on the upload page, though 4 of 14 said they would need to check their documentation for all the details.

- **H5:** Users will not understand the specific information needed on each document without prompting.
  - **Maybe True**
  - Participants had a mixed response when asked to read through the document upload page. 5 of 14 commented that they were unsure of what the terms meant or that they would have difficulty obtaining the information. 6 of 14 seemed confident they knew what a superbill was and how to get it.

- **H6:** Users will prefer the document verification compared to a non-OCR file upload.
  - **Likely True**
  - 9 of 14 participants said they liked the idea of file verification or thought it could be helpful, but when receiving an error, 6 of 14 would have opted to bypass it to continue.
 
- **H7:** Users will not question how we're verifying the information (what we're using to scan).
  - **Likely True**
  - No participants asked what was being used to verify their information, but 3 of 14 commented that they didn’t know how the verification worked.

- **H8:** Users may be confused about how to resolve the error messages they see or how to bypass an error.
  - **More Information Needed**
  - LLM verification was not working for this study, so all participants were presented with a generic message that said verification could not be completed. They did not receive error messaging specific to issues with the file they were uploading in the resubmission task. See Key Finding 6 for more details on users' expectations for error messages.

- **H9:** Users will understand that file verification takes time and will be willing to wait until verification is completed.
  - **Maybe True**
  - LLM verification was not working, so the error message they saw came up right away. Since participants did not experience a delay, most participants did not mention it. Of the 14 participants, only 1 stated that the 1-2 minute delay mentioned in the alert would lengthen the form time.


## Key Findings

1. Many participants (9 of 14) reported that the initial claim and resubmission claim flows were "easy" or "very easy."
2. Most participants (10 of 14) understood what supporting documents were required for a claim, either based on the information on the Introduction page or the information on the Document Upload page.
3. The majority of participants (11 of 12) wanted to resubmit their claim online, but were unsure if they could do so.
4. Most participants (8 of 12) knew to look in the sendback letter for the PDI number when resubmitting their claim, but entering it correctly proved more difficult.
5. Most participants (8 of 12) commented on having to resubmit or re-enter information from the original claim in the resubmission flow.
6. 9 of 14 participants liked the idea of file verification prior to or after attempting to upload a file to their claim, even when they received an error message.

## Details of Findings 


### Finding 1
The majority of participants reported that both the initial claim (9/14) and the resubmission claim (9/14) were either “easy” or “very easy.”

- In self-reported ease of use ratings:
  - 10/14 thought the upload process was easy, though 6/14 thought the file verification made it less easy (due to messaging)
  - 6/14 found the form as a whole to be “easy to complete” and “streamlined”
  - 2/14 said it was easier than other forms they have to fill out


  > "[Both flows] were both easy to get to and easy to find, and I didn't feel like it was asking too much information or things that I had to like, stop and go." P6
  
  > "Just the whole online process ... if they could do everything like that. It would make just so many lives, so many, so much easier." P1
  
  > "Super easy. Honestly, it was easier with CHAMPA than with other medical providers I've had through past employers." P10
  
  > “Well, I mean to me there's 2 parts to that question. Uploading was simple[,] hat would be a 5 [very easy]. But the fact that [the LLM verification is] rejecting it would be a 1 [very difficult].” P5


### Finding 2
Most participants understood what supporting documents were required for a claim, either based on the information on the intro page or the information on the upload page. 

- 10 of 14 were able to list the correct documents before starting the form
- 9 of 14 participants stated they were comfortable with the requirements listed on the upload page or would know where to find them
- 4 of 14 participants were unsure if the documentation they had would contain all the required information

  > "Yes [I'm familiar with it], it's the itemized billing statement, Super Bill, UB92, depending on who you talk to. It always has… it's very detailed with the diagnosis codes." P10
  
  > "Possibly difficult. I can't control what the provider, you know how they format [a billing statement]. I don't think there is a national standard that they follow." P4
  
  > "I would ask my doctor, 'hey, can I have your NPI?' I think that would be very difficult asking directly. I don't think every doctor would be comfortable with that." P8


### Finding 3  
The majority of participants (11 of 12) wanted to resubmit their claim online, but were unsure if they could do so.

- 12 participants tested the sendback letter, and all 12 noted that the letter did not provide an online option for resubmission
- When guided to the online claims form for resubmission, only 4 of 12 thought they were in the right place on the form's Introduction page.

  > "It looks like you gotta mail it in ... 100%, I'd prefer to submit it online." P14
  
  > "[I'd prefer to send it] electronically, again, if I can submit it and get a notification right away with a claim number or something that says, hey, that's gone through, you're good." P9
  
  > "I prefer to [re]submit a claim back here [online] again. Not a new claim, like there was an option for resubmitting." P4


### Finding 4  
Most participants (8 of 12) knew to look in the sendback letter for the PDI number when resubmitting their claim, but entering it correctly proved more difficult.

- 8 of 12 participants opted to copy and paste the PDI number from the letter into the resubmission form, which would not be possible with a physical letter.
  - 5 of 12 participants included the date when entering the PDI number, which was incorrect
  - 2 of 12 participants commented about the length of the PDI number
- Not all participants thought to look at the letter for the PDI number: 2 of 12 participants thought the PDI would be in a different communication, like the confirmation email, instead of the sendback letter.

  > "Was it in the letter? Is that the PDI number? Let's see ... You say, is it this whole number, this big...? Oh, no, I can't do it. I cannot. [copies and pastes number]" P2
  
  > "On the bottom of the [letter], there was this real long PDI number, and so that's what they're looking for, is the PDI number from there." P11
  
  > "The claim identification number is probably somewhere on the top of that form. I was just gonna look down here because it also says like where to find them. So that's helpful ... located on the bottom of the letter we mailed to you." P6


### Finding 5  
Most participants (8 of 12) commented on having to resubmit or re-enter information from the original claim in the resubmission flow. This is because the resubmission flow we tested asked users to fill out all the information asked for in the initial claim, plus some new information. 

- 8 of 12 participants commented on the duplicate paperwork or claim information. Those screens were removed from the flow after testing.

We asked users if they could redesign the resubmission flow, what the experience would ideally look like. 

- 5 of 12 participants stated that they would expect **sponsor** or **beneficiary information** to be prefilled or already entered for resubmitted claims, though 4 of 12 said they knew why it was being requested.
- 2 of 12 participants would have preferred to manually enter the missing information over uploading more documentation.

  > "I mean, it's just more redundancy for the review ... 'cause the PDI number here or earlier, I think it was like, step one, whatever. Yeah. Would have tied that back to [the original claim]." P4

  > "I guess I feel like the information would have already been in there, like if I just logged in and and clicked the link of my claim rather than having to put in you know the sponsors information and my information, my address. Like that should all be there, because I've already done that portion." P6

  > "I would eliminate all of this, and probably just only put a section to where I can provide that documentation. When you are on the site, you have to verify anyways. And so they would already have that information usually." P8

  > "They are using [sponsor information] to verify my eligibility for the CHAMPVA program […] I've been asked this so many times since I got enrolled in CHAMPVA, I'm just used to giving it out. It's to confirm that eligibility." P10

### Finding 6  
9 of 14 participants liked the idea of file verification prior to or after attempting to upload a file to their claim, even when they received an error message.

Because the LLM file verification was not working at the time of testing, users did not see a customized error message prompting them to provide the correct document for their claim. 

[Add screenshots of the error message we tested with vs. the error message we wanted]

- 7 of 14 participants said they would attempt to reupload the document if they received an error because they wouldn’t want the claim rejected
- 7 of 14 participants didn’t feel like the error message they received was specific enough to help them understand what to fix
- 7 of 14 participants said they would attempt to re-upload the document if they received an error
- 6 of 14 participants would bypass the error message without correcting and continue with the form
- 2 of 14 users said they would stop entering the claim if they received an error

  > "I think that's great if you're gonna look at [my supporting documents] to make sure that the information needed is provided. I think you could even put this up top and say, 'hey, like, at the end, you know, forms will be submitted, we're gonna scan your forms to make sure they meet all the requirements.'" P16
  
  > "[I'd] probably continue without verifying. Yeah, I… Yeah, I don't know, I'd try to upload it again, maybe, and then if I did the same thing, I'd just press continue and see if it takes it." P14
  
  > "Like, I have no clue what it's meaning [...] I would want to know what I need for it to verify. I mean, it just [...] it's very [...] I don't understand." P15 (screenreader)
  
  > "Well, they can't complete verification or I can continue without verifying, and for me, I would continue without verifying, because really, I don't know what they want to verify." P9

## Additional Insights

1. Participants thought the sendback letter was clear about the issue with the initial claim, but some users were frustrated by the language.
2. Many participants expected or desired a way to check their claims status online.
3. Some participants (5 of 14) were confused with the sponsor and beneficiary pages, entering the same information in both.
4. Participant expectations varied widely when considering how long it would take to process a claim, but half the participants stated they would expect a resubmission to take less time.

## Details of Additional Insights

### Additional Insight 1
Participants thought the sendback letter was clear about the issue with the initial claim, but some users were frustrated by the language.

- Of the 12 participants who viewed the letter, 10 said they understood what was wrong and what they needed to do to resolve it.
  - 3 of 12 commented that obtaining the information requested in the letter (Dx code) would be difficult or burdensome.
  - 1 participant felt their doctor should submit the missing information on their behalf.
  - 1 participant said they would give up and eat the cost of the claim to avoid the hassle of resubmitting.

  > "It looks like it's simple and straightforward, and I like that. There's an option [...] to check the box to receive assistance, to get that done. So it's not saying, you know, you have to do this, or you can't complete the claim." P6
  
  > "My only thing is, like, not many people walk around with, you know, codes. So it's like, you know, pressure, because then you have to go searching for stuff that you're not that familiar with. So a box for the option for [CHAMPVA] to request that information from the doctor, and let them provide it [directly]." P8
  
  > "Like, if it's, like, a $1,000 claim, and I really, really need it, like, I'm gonna try to keep working, but I'm gonna be very frustrated, and then I have to wait even longer. If it was, like, a $40 or $50 claim on something [...] Like, is it even worth my time to try?" P16
  
  > "Me, personally I understand it, but I happen to work in healthcare. [...] That's kind of cheating." P5


### Additional Insight 2
Many participants expected or desired a way to check their claims status online.

- 8 of 14 participants mentioned that they would expect to be able to check their claims status online after submitting the form.
  - 2 of 14 participants mentioned they would expect to see a link in the confirmation email to where they could check on the status of their claim.
  - 1 participant expected status updates by email as the claim was processed.

  > "That's the thing. We just don't have that [...] like the va.gov site. When you sign in, give all your information, and in an ideal world, all of your CHAMPVA stuff would be there. But it's just [...] a lot of it is by paper right now." P1
  
  > "That'd be nice to be in, like, the [confirmation email]. Like, 'click on this link to check the status [of a claim].' That would be the best, but right now, if I, you know, if that wasn't the case, VA.gov, then I would go to, like, claims. And, you know, hopefully it pops up there." P14
  
  > "Probably logging back into the VA system. Maybe there's some type of notification or something that would pop up." P6
  
  > "A CHAMPVA website. We're waiting [...] for that to happen. Again, they just started allowing people to submit applications last year. It's been a long time coming. And this year, they started allowing claims to be submitted online [and] I see many posts from people [online], newbies, who are saying, 'where can I go to check the status?' Heh, call and wait for 2 hours on the phone." P9
  

### Additional Insight 3
Some participants were confused with the sponsor and beneficiary pages, entering the same information in both.

- 5 of 14 participants entered either the beneficiary’s information in the sponsor section, or the sponsor’s information in the beneficiary section. This is consistent with findings from our 10-10d/10-7959c usability study. We recommend implementing the same content changes to the 10-7959a claims form to ensure proper data entry in Sponsor/Beneficiary fields.

  > On beneficiary page] "Oh, this is my information. So I'm doing this again [...] I guess I'm filling it out again." P2
  
  > [On beneficiary page] "Okay, so it's back to the original stuff, so put first name, middle initial." [Participant enters same information as sponsor] P11


### Additional Insight 4
Participant expectations varied widely when considering how long it would take to process a claim, but half the participants stated they would expect a resubmission to take less time.

- Participants’ stated expectations for processing time ranged from 3 business days to 6 months, but their ideal processing time was generally 1 month or less.
  - 6 of the 12 participants who completed the resubmission process felt that a resubmitted claim would be processed more quickly than the initial claim.
  - 4 of 12 participants stated they would prefer an email notification over a mailed one.


  > "I would hope [my claim is processed] in a timely manner. You know, within just a couple of weeks, you know definitely, within a month or so." P6
  
  > "Knowing how this works, 30 days. In an ideal world. If it's going in electronically [...] I wouldn't expect it to take more than 3 to 5 days." P5
  
  > "Maybe quicker [to process resubmission], because they had all that information. And you're just kind of giving that one little bit of info that was missing the previous time." P1
  
  > "You know, I think it could go either way [paper or email]. I mean ... I would prefer it by email. I do paperless whenever I can, because it reduces the turnaround time." P10


## Recommendations

1. **Clarify that resubmissions can be submitted online:** Update content within the sendback letter to specify the option to resubmit the claim online in addition to mail. Update content on the online form introduction to specify that the form is for resubmissions as well as new claims.
   - _Supporting evidence: Key Finding 3_
2. **Provide more detail to users for file verification messaging:** Improve the content in the alert message on the page to let users know what information is being verified. Update the content in the error messages to let users know specifically what is wrong and what they need to correct, or if they cannot correct it (verification is not working).
   - _Supporting evidence: Key Finding 6_ 
3. **Make the PDI number easier to enter:** hough participants found the PDI fairly easily once they knew it was on the letter, making it more prominent and indicating it is needed for resubmission would help users locate it when entering a resubmission online. Making the PDI number shorter would help with entry. 
   - _Supporting evidence: Key Finding 4, Additional Insight 1_
4. **Require less information for resubmissions:** Users’ mental models expect that providing a reference number like the PDI number will pull in information they’ve already provided. Participants commented specifically on having to enter the sponsor and beneficiary information again after entering the PDI number, with the feeling this information should already be known.
    - _Supporting evidence: Key Finding 5, Additional Insight 3_
5. **Clearly communicate all of the required information before the user enters the claim form:** Users should ideally understand these requirements before leaving their healthcare appointment. Content can be added to different touch points after enrollment: welcome packets, additional email communications, and the CHAMPVA application confirmation page.
   - _Supporting evidence: Key Finding 2_
6. **Update or add content to reflect current timelines:** Added transparency will help users set expectations as to when they can get reimbursed for their claim, whether it is for a new claim or a resubmission. Adding content and confirming that we have the more accurate timeline projections on the Introduction and Confirmation pages as well as in email notifications can better help reinforce communications with users.
   - _Supporting evidence: Additional Insight 4_
7. **Soften the tone of the sendback letter:** Adding more context about how users can get this information from their providers or insurance companies will show that CHAMPVA wants to help users resolve their claims.
   - _Supporting evidence: Additional Insight 1_
6. **Provide a way for users to check the status of their claims online:** Users expected to be able to check claims status online, and some expected to be able to correct errors within the claim online after submission. Providing a status and an easier way to see what information is missing would help with resubmissions. 
   - _Supporting evidence: Additional Insight 2_


### A11y Recommendations

1. **Reduce redundant name and address questions to remove friction with screen readers:** Having redundant questions can add confusion to a person only listening to the headers on the page because the assumption is that they need to fill out the same info again.
2. **Provide denial or sendback information in a digital format:** Screen readers currently cannot easily access sendback information and have to rely on a third party to understand what is required to correct their claim.


## Product User and Business Outcomes

### Desired User Outcome 

- Veterans can complete and submit a CHAMPVA claim or claim resubmission within the online form
  - This research supports this desired user outcome by demonstrating that all participants who filed an initial claim (14 of 14), and all those who saw the sendback letter and resubmission flow (12 of 14) were able to successfully file a resubmission online.

  
- Veterans spend less time and effort filling out the forms
  - This research supports this desired user outcome by identifying areas in the initial claim and claim resubmission flows that can be removed for optimal flow and reduce time and effort filling out the forms.
  - Moreover, many users (8 of 14) stated that they preferred having the file verification in the claims form, to ensure accurate and timely submission of their claims. 
  
- Veteran satisfaction increased with application experience
  - This research supports this desired outcome by showing that most users (9 of 14) found the updated CHAMPVA claims form "easy" or "very easy" (see Key Finding 1). Furthermore, users provided targeted feedback on the UI, content, file verification and user flows that can be incorporated into the MVP as well as post-MVP improvements of the user experience.
  - Most users (11 of 12) also expected to be able to file a resubmission for a claim online. Providing this online resubmission experience is in line with users' mental models and should increase satisfaction with the application experience.


 
### Desired Business Outcome

- Reduce amount of time spent processing paper forms

- Replace outdated and legacy DAPER system with PEGA for document upload and management


## Key Performance Indicators

### KPI 1: Measure number of people filing claims online through CHAMPVA
  
  - Key result: Increase number of beneficiaries who file CHAMPVA claims
  - Key result: Increase number of people who obtain approvals for claims filed
    
This research supports measurement of this KPI by....

### KPI 2: Reduce time from submission to notification

  - Key result: Measure number of application completed in single session
  - Key result: Reduce processing time for applications
    
This research supports measurement of this KPI by....


## Next Steps 

1. Identify fast-follows and post-MVP improvements for the claim resubmission process.
2. Iterate on and improve file verification messaging for post-MVP release.
3. Implement UX/UI/content changes identified in this study to other IVC forms, where applicable.

## Further research needed

- We recommend conducting further research on LLM file verification. The LLM was not working when this study was conducted, so we were unable to gauge participants' reactions to the document-specific errors they might encounter.
- The resubmissions flow was modified at the request of our stakeholders after this study concluded, removing some of the screens where redundant information was being requested. Given participants' reactions to having to fill out this information during hte study, it would be advisable to retest the shortened flow at some point in the future.
