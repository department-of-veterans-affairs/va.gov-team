# Research Plan for [IVC Forms Modernization Team, 10-7959a, August 5th, 2024]


## Background

This study will support the unauthenticated digital flow for form 10-7959a claims form for the CHAMPVA program. We will be building this as a new digital form, so there will be no familiarity from the perspective of the Veterans and dependents interacting with the digital version. However, we will specifically attempt to recruit participants who are familiar with the paper form and program. 


[Product Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/10-7959a/product-outline-10-7959a.md)


### OCTO Priorities



* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
* Fast-track disability claims
* Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy


### Veteran Journey

This product fits into the Veteran Journey at three primary moments. \
 \
Starting up



* Depending on their disability status and eligibility for Tricare, the Veteran’s family may qualify for benefits through CHAMPVA at this point in their journey.

Putting down roots



* As a Veteran puts down roots, their dependents may need to submit medical claims through CHAMPVA. 

Aging



* Disability status can change as Veterans age. Veterans or their dependents may become eligible for benefits through CHAMPVA as Veterans’ disability statuses change. There are moments in these scenarios where caregivers, dependents, adopted children, or step-children may be more likely to fill out CHAMPVA claims if they cannot find a provider to do it on their behalf.


## Research Goals



* Test the usability of the current iteration of the 10-7959a prototype.
* Test high-level accessibility for the current iteration of the 10-7959a prototype.
* Extract insights about the participants’ experience with the current CHAMPVA and the current CHAMPVA claims (10-7959a) process. This will inform artifacts and build evidence to address pain points discovered during stakeholder interviews and support continued service design efforts.


### Outcome

This research will advance our product to the next phase of the process by allowing us to identify potential usability and accessibility issues. This will enable us to assess our design's efficacy and promptly make appropriate adjustments to avoid rework in the future. We will also gain further insight into the current state of the customer experience, which we will use to explore ways the digital form can alleviate some of the pain points discovered. In addition, this will also allow us to make recommendations to the appropriate stakeholders about how to best integrate the digital form into their processes to maximize efficiency and benefit for the Veterans and their families.


### Research questions

Usability & Content



* Will users understand and navigate the digital form experience without significant issues when interacting with the prototype through a think-out-loud protocol?
* Will users have difficulty understanding what type of claim they are submitting?
* Will users have difficulty understanding the insurance uploads?
* Will users understand what information and documents they need to submit with their claim for speedy processing and reimbursement?

Accessibility



* Can any major accessibility issues be identified at this point in the development process through questions and observations?
* Is the form’s plain language effective and accessible?

Service Design



* With interview questions, can we gather further information to inform our service-related artifacts or our understanding of the customer experience?


### Hypothesis



* Based on our understanding of current patterns and best practices for forms, the digital prototype 10-7959a will be easy to understand and navigate.
* Based on our understanding of accessibility best practices, we believe the 10-7959a prototype will be free of significant accessibility issues.
* Users may experience confusion due to inconsistent, mistimed, or absent feedback when using the new list-and-loop pattern.
* Users could experience issues with the new upload pattern that has yet to be thoroughly tested.
* Users may experience confusion in understanding the information and documents they need to submit with their claims.
* Our understanding of stakeholder research about the process leads us to believe that users who have filed a claim for CHAMPVA benefits through the existing process will highlight similar pain points (e.g., visibility of claim status, lengthy processing time, frustration with the lack of available options to submit supporting documents digitally).


## Methodology

This methodology will be a mixed-method approach, combining a usability study with a user interview. There will be 30-45 minutes of usability testing, utilizing the think-out-loud protocol while interacting with the prototype to identify significant issues with the digital form. \
 \
The exit interview questions will be asked in the remaining 15-30 minutes, less any time it takes to prepare or troubleshoot for the participant. We want to ask these questions at the end to avoid any bias that may impact interactions with the prototype, as well as comments gathered through the execution of the think-out-loud protocol. This method is appropriate for the research goals because it addresses them directly. The maturity of the design should be appropriate to accommodate all of the aforementioned research.


### Location

Zoom will be the desired location for the research.
