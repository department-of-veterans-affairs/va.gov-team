|1|No|Patient Info|What happens when the beneficiary checks the “new address” box?|Yes|Yes||
|2|Yes|OHI|If beneficiaries need to provide all their OHI information in order to be accepted into CHAMPVA, what are the benefits of gathering this information on the during the claims process? Is it just to check for updates in their OHI?  Do they need to enter it again if they’re logged into their account?|Yes|Yes|They are checking to make sure that they still have the same OHI or if they dropped it. (basically the same as the 7959c for updates). They will immediately update the insurance with the correct info on the CHAMPVA side. If CHAMPVA notices a difference in the billing/OHI the voucher examiners will investigate or update. They can send out an OHI cert for the patient to fill out so they can update it. Cannot pull any CHAMPVA info in to the form. If the valid info is there, they will manually update the OHI on their end.<br> As part of modernization, they’d like to see VES link to insurance warehouse to pull the data instead of beneficiary changing it all the time but that will take place in the future.||
|3|Yes|OHI|What are the differences and goals for each of these two questions?: <br>“Was treatment for a work-related injury/condition?” Y/N<br>“Was treatment for an injury or accident outside of work?” Y/N|Yes|Yes|1 is covering workmen's comp and 2 is for auto accident or is someone else is liable (if it was a car accident) vs personal injuries. CHAMPVA wants the workman’s comp group to pay for the thing instead of CHAMPVA paying for it. If they have other health or car insurance insurance they’d want them to pay for it instead of CHAMPVA. In either circumstance, it probably needs to go to TPL (third party liability), we still process and pay, but down the road someone else is responsible to pay eventually. The question is phrased this way to prevent applicants from submitting specific documents related to insurance coverage, etc.Either way, the form shouldn’t change, cus they’ll continue to pay it and then get reimbursed by the other people <br> Design team will determine the best rephrasing of these questions to make them more understandable by the beneficaries<br/>If The injury happened during a car accident and beneficiary has CHAMPVA the ER will submit a Claim to CHAMPVA and then submit the claim to the car insurance as well. When the claim comes to CHAMPVA they should already have a EOB from the Car Insurance Co. CHAMPVA processes the claim so it goes to third party provider (Car Insurance Co)<br/>CHAMPVA needs a UB04 as an option for the beneficiary to select on the from. Any facility that is designated as a hospital would create UB04 to submit to CHAMPVA.On the EOB it will indicate if the injury happened at work or due to a car accident. The beneficiary have to submit the EOB and UB04 for car accidents and workmans comp beneficiary won't have to submit a billing statement in this case<br/>CHAMPVA needs a UB04 as an option for the beneficiary to select on the from.

|4|Yes|OHI|What are the implications of the treatment being work-related or not? Does military service count as work in this scenario? What if it was military-service related, does that change anything?|Yes|Yes|If they’re in the military service they’d qualify for TRICARE, not CHAMPVA||
|5|Yes|Submission|If beneficiaries decide to submit this PDF online and then mail in their other documents, would they need to print out the PDF as the cover sheet anyways then? Or what type of additional information would they need to provide when mailing in their claims if they submit the PDF online?|Yes|Yes|If they mail a doc – in current state- it'll go to them in mailing then they’ll tie it to the applicant's claims/enrollment but they in the Sponsor's SSN on the mailed document somewhere. It's a manual on their end to recieve the mail and place it in their account. No cover sheet needed. <br>  We need to watch out for fraud so claims forms need to be linked to documents. We have to have a signed document. Not allowed to just use a claim form and attach to their info so we need to have the paper docs. Cannot process docs without a signed claim form either. <br>Claim form has to be linked with document. Beneficaries would have to print out this form and send it in with the documents. Can’t use one claim form and attach to multiple. Beneficiary may forget to sign new claim form this way and they need the signature to process.<br>Regardless of number of dates of service, as long as there’s one claim form they’ll use it for all of those claims. We can possibly have people sign online – call them to say hey this document doesn’t have a claims form, go online to do this. This is possible, but definitely not he process we’d like to do. We can also instantly marry up claim form with docs that are physically in the building but don't rely on that either. Have to do individual submissions – each person needs their own claim form. ||

## Additional questions

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Yes|Patient Info|Are the CHAMPVA Member Numbers always the same as the patient’s SSN? If so, then what’s the reason they are viewed separately|Yes|Yes|It's the same as SSN but in the future it may change. Maybe able to have hint text explain it may be the same as SSN ||
|2|Yes|General|Are there any requirements around the EOB? (e.g. certain pieces of information that need to be included)<br>Is there a way we could store this information so the users don’t have to re-upload it every time?|Yes|Yes|We require the Explanation of benefits from OHI to match the claim submitted. They would need to submit to their OHI and have an EOB before CHAMPVA would process the claim||
|3|No|Patient Info|Are we allowed to add an additional field to collect the beneficiary’s email address?<br>A stakeholder said they look it up manually if they need to contact the person, so if we can include this to further streamline the the process. There is not currently an email field on the PDF<br>|No|No|A stakeholder said they look it up manually if they need to contact the person, so if we can include this that will hopefully make their lives easier. There is not currently an email field on the PDF||
|4|Yes|General|Can we allow one cover sheet for multiple claims? (implement a list and loop or something so user only has to fill out the PDF info once)|Yes|Yes| Correct, all of the documents that will turn into a claim in the future are under that one claim form so we can accept one cover sheet for multiple claims for one beneficiary. Each beneficiary must submit their claims seperately from other beneficaries. For example a parent would submit their claims under one cover sheet and a child must have their claims submitted under a seperate cover sheet. When the claims come in, that form is for one beneficiary and all the docs that turn into a claim all use that claim form||
|5|No|General|Do most people who submit these claims have an authorized account they can log into and we can pull their information?|No|No||
|6|No|General|What’s the rough percentage of people who have a login vs those who do not?|No|No||
|7|Yes|General|Does each different beneficiary need to complete their own PDF/ online form submission?|Yes|Yes| Yes, each beneficiary must submit their claims seperately from other beneficaries. For example a parent would submit their claims under one cover sheet and a child must have their claims submitted under a seperate cover sheet.||
|8|No|General|Is it possible that something someone enters here would make them no longer eligible for CHAMPVA? Specifically regarding the OHI|No|No||
|9|No|General|Generally speaking, how does the person know whether they need to submit the claim or whether their provider will do it? |Yes|Yes||
|10|No|General|What kind of connection does this have with pre-authorized claims? Is there any info we can pull from that to be helpful? |No|No||
|11|No|General|How does resubmission affect this flow? Do we need to ask if it is a resubmission or does it not matter?|Yes|Yes||
|12|No|General|What is the optical scanner like? Is that a machine that’s used on the VA side or is it a software that could be used immediately upon document upload?|Yes|Yes||
|13|Yes|General|How do you match up the condition the patient is being treated for and the documents they upload? Because you do need to know what’s being treated in order to approve it, right?|Yes|Yes| All the information matches up with what is on the medical claims itself. Don’t actually need to connect claims with conditions. If their name/info matches the cover sheet and doc – then they look it up on the backend. Conditions come in through HCFA form and UBV provided by doctor. Once they get the claims someone keys in the claim. Once the claim is processed in the system the rest is then driven all through AI.<br> Don’t know where they’re trying to go with the claim form in the future: Veteran-centric first, then employee-centric||
|14|Yes|General| WHow do you go about linking those diagnosis codes with the conditions that they’re covered for under CHAMPVA?|Yes|Yes| The diagnosis code would not be relevant to the claim form itself. May not need it on the form. Just need the document that they submit be relevant to them and match to their personal info. Can connect that code and conditions on the backend primarily through AI once in the system (will be on the forms provided by the doctor: HCFA and UB)||
|15|No|General| If they don’t have OHI are they even eligible? Because it says CHAMPVA is always secondary, so what happens if they don’t have a primary?|No|Yes|
|16|No|General| Does there need to be an EOB submitted with each document? Or one EOB can be used for multiple documents?|Yes|Yes|
|17|No|General| Does the “type of coverage” need to be specified for each OHI? (Can they select one type and then enter both pieces of OHI info, or should they be asked what type of coverage it is for each OHI?)|Yes|Yes|
|18|No|General| When users upload documents, would it be needed or useful for them to select which type of document it is? (EOB vs pharmacy claim vs itemized statement) Or does it not really matter because you’re going to take a look at the document anyways?|Yes|Yes|
|19|No|General| If there are multiple OHIs, do they need to specify which one was used for each treatment?|Yes|Yes|Its depends, sometimes that have OHI for specific coverage (ex an indemnity plan for Cancer) But mostly don't have to specify what is primary vs secondary.|
|20|Yes|Supporting docs|When submitting documents, can you please explain the relationship between itemized billing statements and EOBs?|Yes|Yes|I would change itemized billing statement to billing statement. The billing statement should match the EOB and show patient responsibility for line items <br/>Doctor’s offices may create a “super bill” which has the provider name, address, tax id, the DX for what the visit was for and CPT codes. Doctor’s offices may give that to the patient as well; it’s really messy. The super bill will go to the insurance company as well. The itemized bill is for an in-patient bill. Everything they gave the patient doing the visit (office visit, xrays, arm braces, ect.) Usually CHAMPVA wants superbill or billing statement. <br/>  CHAMPVA needs an EOB along with the super bill as well. CHAMPVA needs the EOB no matter what. EOB and Billing statement tell CHAMPVA how much to reimburse the beneficiary|
|21|Yes|Supporting docs|What are the required pieces of information that need to be on an EOB?|Yes|Yes|DOS, provider name, NPI, DX code (sometimes), CPT codes. Providers (Doctor’s) usually put the co-pay on the billing. There may be additional copays for each line item though which will show on the EOB. Example: if a visit has a $40 copay and if they do an Xray in the same office at the same visit the Xray may be an additional $100 billing and have its own copay. This will all be on the same bill if all procedures are all taken care of in the same office. If they have to visits an another office or specialist for the xray that copay and costs will be on a separate bill|
|22|No|Supporting docs|How do people normally go about getting the specialized receipts for their pharmacy claims? Do they have to do anything extra?|Yes|Yes| |
|23|Yes|Supporting docs|If an EOB needed for a statement, how helpful would it be if the user specified which EOB goes with each document?|Yes|Yes|The EOB should be paired with each billing statement. In most cases, CHAMPVA prefers the patient to submit the billing statement and then the matching EOB. If it is not matched up they will still be able to process but would make it easier if they did match. FMP would prefer that the patient couples the two together to make it easier on their end. If they aren't matched FMP would need to match the billing and EOB manually which can be difficult if they have to look through multiple claims|
|24|Yes|Supporting docs|Would it be helpful for the user to specify which type of document they are uploading?|Yes|Yes|Yes, if it is specified what type of doc iit would make it easier.|
|25|Yes|Supporting docs|What are the tpyes of supporting doc a user can/should upload?|Yes|Yes|Itemized billing statement, EOB, pharmacy claims and UBO4s. For pharmacy claims no EOB is required|
|26|No|Supporting docs|Are there any other types of documents that would be needed for any special circumstances?|Yes|Yes| |
|26|No|Beneficiary info|How will the patient’s address be used? (So we can specify for mailing purposes, physical location, etc)|Yes|Yes|Patients address is used to send reimbursement check to|
|27|No|Insurance info|Is it possible/common to find people with 3 OHIs? If so, how do you handle that differently?|Yes|Yes|Usually, we are tertiary payer if the patient/beneficiary has 2 OHI. I have never seen a patient/beneficiary with 3 different OHI(s)|
|28|Yes|General|What kind of language do you usually use to refer to people submitting this form? (I’ve seen patient/beneficiary, but not sure which one is more common)|Yes|Yes|Beneficiaries. CHAMPVA only covers the dependents, each of the children is a separate beneficiary. CHAMPVA needs a separate claim for each beneficiary. CHAMPVA always uses the term “beneficiary”|
|29|Yes|Insurance info|When it says “Name of other health insurance” what does that mean?|Yes|Yes|The name of the insurance company|
|30|Yes|Insurance info|What is your process when there is missing information or something getting in the way of processes a claim?|Yes|Yes|We will usually send a letter to the patient/beneficiary advising of what we require to process the claim specifically.|
|31|Yes|Supporting docs|How common is the occurrence of missing information where they will need to send in more documents?|Yes|Yes|All the time. Beneficiaries need to upload the letter that CHAMPVA sends them asking for the missing docs. The letter includes a PDI# which is assigned to that initial submission. CHAMPVA would like it to be indicated if it’s a resubmission as well. The letter is required for every resubmission because CHAMPVA has no other way to reference the original claim and there may be too many claims per beneficiary to look through to match it up. beneficiary’s need to make sure the picture of a the doc is clear when uploading/submitting it. This is how they can avoid resubmissions|
|32|Yes|Supporting docs|Would just providing the PDI# would work rather than uploading the resubmission letter?|Yes|Yes|It would but sometimes (when dealing with the older population or vision impaired people it would be difficult to enter. The PDI# is a 15 digital long number.|
|33|Yes|Supporting docs|What are some of the most common reasons claims are rejected?|Yes|Yes|Missing NDC code on pharmacy claims, missing DX/PX, HCPC codes on a billing statement, Missing EOB if the patient/beneficiary did not submit|
|34|No|Supporting docs|Can you explain what the DX/PX codes are and where they are usually found? |Yes|Yes||
|35|No|Payments|How are payments provided? Is it a check in the mail?/What are the status of EFTs|Yes|Yes||
|36|No|Payments|Generally speaking, how does the person know whether they need to submit the claim or whether their provider will do it?|Yes|Yes||
|37|Yes|Payments|Can you explain how a pre-authorized claim might affect the claims process?|Yes|Yes|Usually the provider requests Pre-auth and the provider sends it to CHAMPVA. CHAMPVA uploads it to one of VA’s systems. Usually the beneficiary doesn't have to do anything with the pre-auth. Pre-auths are between CHAMPVA and the provider. It won’t matter if the beneficiary specifies if there is a Pre-auth or not. Usually the beneficiary is not involved in the Pre-auth even if the claim is rejected. Provider will deal with the rejected claim and work with the VA to resolve it.|
|38|No|Beneficary Info|Is it true that if the beneficiary’s address that they enter on this form is different from their information on file that the VA side will manually update this address? (so the user doesn’t need to check the “new address” box)|Yes|Yes||
|39|No|Claims|What’s the estimated volume or percentage of claims that get rejected? (i.e. how important is it to have the resubmission flow)|Yes|Yes||
|40|No|Claims|If someone is resubmitting for a billing statement that got rejected, when they resubmit and upload the letter, do they only need to re-upload the part that was missing|Yes|Yes||
|41|No|Claims|Would handling the resubmissions online actually save them a whole lot of time? Or the same amount of time? What are the repercussions are if someone just files a whole new claim instead of resubmitting? |Yes|Yes||
|42|No|Suporting docs|Should the UBO4 be its own option alongside billing statement and pharmacy claim, or can that fall under the billing statement?If so, any other forms we should add to the list?|Yes|Yes||
|42|No|Suporting docs|Is there a technical document limitation that we need to deal with (we don’t think so bc docs get sent to X immediately, according to Michael)|Yes|Yes||
|42|No|Suporting docs|How common is it to see Medicare Part D? (Wondering if we should add it to the list, or if few enough people have it that it’s okay it lives under “Other”)|Yes|Yes||
