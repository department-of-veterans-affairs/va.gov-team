**Attendees**: Dawn E., Tammy T., Amanda K., Scott U, Premal S., Hieu V., Renata K., Andrea M., Mike M., Jessica S.

**Notes**

**Adding MBI to online OHI (subform and standalone)**
- Renata notes that we’re updating the OHI form and noted that MBI (Medical Benefit Identifier) is required and wants to know how we connect that information.
  - Current state: For MBI, we don’t collect as a separate field but the card upload it is a part of the card. Is the medical card upload substitute okay?
  - **Decision:** Scott U. confirm that's it is okay.
  - Dawn E. and Tammy T. note that OHI currently manually inputs that number via VES right now
- Scott notes that for eligibility, they don’t need the MBI number and don’t need to use the back of the Medicare card scanned and uploaded in
- Tammy notes that they do need the MBI number since it is the first thing they check if they need to check. Scott notes that MBI number is on the front of the card.

**Future Effective Date**
- The form currently does not allow the entry of a future effective date. Is the team interested in allowing beneficiaries to update that as soon as they receive their card?
- Tammy T notes that they need to be back to submit that early because the staff would terminate their eligibility as soon as they turn 65
- Scott U says they need to be to be able to input a future effective date
- Scott confirmed that the medicare coverage is retroactive if they completed the application afterwards, but only if they pre-enrolled in Medicare before the turned 65. If they register for Medicare after turning 65, it will not retroactively be applied.
- Tammy T. notes that it is more work for the staff and beneficiary if they can’t do future effective date.
  - **Action Item:** for HE is to confirm if it is a 6-12 months reachout
- Is MBI number unique for each part of Medicare (Part A vs Part B)?
  - Tammy states that each card has its own number.
  - **Action Item:** Confirm how MBI unique number works vs. older numbers
  > Your MBI is your 11-character Medicare Beneficiary Identifier - or new Medicare Number (starting April 2018). From April 2018 through January 2019, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) sent new Medicare cards with new MBIs to all of  the 57.7 million Medicare beneficiaries. CMS noted that these new Medicare cards "will use a unique, randomly-assigned [11-character] number called

- Premal S asks if the Card is required if all the information is provided?
- Scott says they do, while Tammy T. notes that it is common for folks to put the split date. In short, the Medicare Card is helpful for the staff to work through any issues.
