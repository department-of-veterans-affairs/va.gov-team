# Questions to CHAMPVA OHI Partner 5-12-25

- What is the rate of online OHI cert that you have seen come in that were not able to be processed?
    - Depending on the amount of OHI Certs a Claims Examiner completes per day, the range that cannot be processed can be between 34 – 85 per day. That is on the high end. This is due to a specific reason, which is detailed in the next question.

 

- What are the common reasons for not being able to process an OHI cert?
    - The most common reason we cannot process an OHI Cert is due to a term called Not In System (NIS). This is due to the OHI Unit receiving the beneficiary’s OHI Cert before EEV had processed the application. This has been reduced as EEV backlog has decreased significantly.

 

- Have you noticed any anomalies with Medicare or insurance card uploads such as missing front or backs, duplicate front and backs, or mismatched cards (i.e. a Part D getting uploaded as a Part A and B card)?
    - I have asked my team about this, and they did not confirm any of these scenarios have been an issue.

- Have you seen any mismatches of effective dates from what it entered on the from field to what is on the card?
    - If there are errors on the effective date, they will come from the Claims Examiner. It is rare to have this issue on the card, or beneficiary (from the OHI Cert)
