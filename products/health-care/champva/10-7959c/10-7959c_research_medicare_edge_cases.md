#1 0-7959c | Research Medicare Edge Cases#84610

After researching different types and combinations of Medicare plans we want to provide a way for beneficiaries to communicate any additional info that may help the CHAMPVA process these types of claims that form questions itself may not capture. This will hopefully be able to accommodate for any edge cases when it comes to insurance and Medicare alleviating delays in the process for that group of people.

## Questions:
- Do you ever see beneficiaries sending in any other documentation than just the copies of the Medicare or health insurance cards?
- Do you ever see any other write-ins on the form besides what is already being asked?
- Was there ever a time that you had to send or call back a beneficiary for more details about their Medicare or insurance plan? What extra information did you need?
- What sort of comments have you seen get entered in the health insurance comments box on the 10-7959c paper form?
- How often do you see the health insurance comments box filled out on the paper form and how would you enter that into your systems? Is there a character limit in your backend system for this field?
