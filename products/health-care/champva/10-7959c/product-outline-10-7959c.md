# Product Outline - 10-7959c CHAMPVA Other Health Insurance (OHI) Certification
---

## Overview
This effort will follow digitization of form 10-10d for CHAMPVA enrollment so that applicants also have a digital service for providing their Other Health Insurance certification.

## Problem Statement
Currently, but burden around form 10-7959c lies with applicants who often have to fill out the paper form multiple times, and as well as with thoee who receive the paper forms and then scan them for entry into other systems. Our goal is to reduce the load in the mailroom and subsequently improve the experience and processing time for the applicant.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Digital form submission so that applicants no longer have to mail in multiple copies of the paper form.
- Bypassing the mailroom to reduce the processing backlog and intake burden.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- We should not increase processing time by undertaking this effort.

## Desired Business Outcomes

- This effort should reduce overall processing time by expediting intake
- This effort should reduce error rates by removing the dependence on handwritten forms

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- This effort should not increase the processing burden in the mailroom or downstream
