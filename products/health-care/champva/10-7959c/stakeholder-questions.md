## 10-7959c Questions 

|Number|Complete?|Form Section|Question|Blocking Testing?|Blocking for Production (1=must)|Answer|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Completed|General|If a third party (or anyone other than an applicant on the form) is filling this form out do we need to collect their contact info?|yes|yes|Requires whoever is filling it out, to sign/date/phone number/city/state and zip - contact info, so yes||
|2|Completed|Patient Info/|Will Name DOB and SSN be enough info to identify a person so PA can add info to their “file”?|no|yes|yes|
|3|Completed|General|What is the current process for 10-7959c? The new launch of the digital 1010D form ChampVA enrollment and OHI form are going to come in within the same workflow (unless applicants choose to mail in their cards/ 7959c form). If we plan to pull out the 7959c info from the 1010d to keep it separate, is there an impact to having info coming in at two separate times?|yes|yes|If they don't have any OHI and mark no, we don't require them to fill out 7959. If we take that out, we'd have to take them to the OHI form. Thinking about long term - want to remove OHI form from application process - that has nothing to do w/eligibility - more about payment. Can delay current process. Would like to remove OHI from process and move it to claims payment process part of house - when they go to collect payment. Do need it for current state. Trying to move to future state. Medicare - does affect eligibility. We need them to send their Medicare info to us - either card or something saying they don't qualify. For OHI - need something saying no they don't have it, but if they do, need to provide OHI form (can be on its own). If they get it, they send it separately (misc doc process - goes to review team). OHI is very convoluted - want to get rid of in the eligibility process (Interested to see the proposed flow)||
|4|Completed|General|Would this form be used for any non-ChampVA purposes for example, would this be used to enroll or update applicant OHI info for other family members or Veteran programs|yes|yes|No|No,the 1010d has it's own version of this version (1010EZR)|
|5|Yes|Patient Info/ OHI|Do you store the current addresses and OHI info from the CHAMPVA enrollment or other OHI form submissions? If so we need to ask the engineers if there a way for applicants to view what current addresses or medicare info they have on file before choosing to update it|yes|yes|Yes, if they have already filled out the 1010d… but that should be an option… so being able to update is important (should they have moved, etc.). Maybe be able to create a mechanism for skipping it. Possibly through confirming the address after signing in|
|5|Yes|Patient Info|If someone is using this form when they first apply for CHAMPVA benefits, will they need to provide their address again in this form?|yes|yes|Need to double check in with Elizabeth Sauer or Erick Maes. Sometimes the claimants move from apt. To apt. so would prefer it would autofill. (and give the prompt to change if necessary/needed). We might be able to show the address and ask if it’s correct but would not omit because addresses can change so often. We maybe able to do this via tech (unknown). Need to dicuss it with our engineers |
|6|Completed|Medicare|Is medicare advantage a whole separate card then standard Part A and B Card|yes|yes|Yes, they are separate cards. [Found the answer here](https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-basics/medicare-coverage-overview/medicare-cards)|
|7|Completed|Medicare| We are looking for better ways to explain what these are<br/>a.What is CHAMPVA supplemental?<br/>b.What is specialty or limited coverage?|yes|yes||
|8|Completed|Medicare|Are "pharmacy benefits" the same as "prescription" drug benefits? The Medicare website calls them  "prescription" drug benefits so we are wondering if we could change the terms to mirror what is on the Medicare site.|yes|yes|Pharmacy benefits are the same across the board. It is the same as "prescription drug" benefits|
|9|Completed|Health Insurance|For the other Health insurance screens are you looking for Primary and Secondary insurance only? Can they submit supplemental insurance info?<br/>Is there a limit to how many other insurances they can add? |yes|yes|We do not cover vision or dental so providing that information is not required. We would cover those if the issue were tied directly to a medical condition ie, cateract surgery. |
|10|Completed|Health Insurance|Is there a limit to how many other insurances they can add? |yes|yes|We must only have primary nad secondary coverage. Note: CHAMPVA always pays after Medicare and the OHI's so its wouldn't matter much which insurance is the primary. Just as long as they have the insurance info |
|11|Completed|Health Insurance|What information are you intending to collect with the comments field on the other health insurance questions.<br/>Is there is specific information they'd like to collect? |yes|yes|If the beneficary has completed an OHI cert. We upload into our system and we are good as long as the beneficiary updates if the insurance has changed. See question 15,16 and 18 for more details and other info that appears on the comments box. |
|12|Completed|File Upload|If a person chooses to mail or fax their supporting docs in what is the best address and fax number to do so?|yes|yes|Department of Veterans Affairs of Intergrated Veteren Care. P.O. Box 469063, Denver CO 80246 (revised Oct, 2021|
|13|Completed|Health insurance|We noticed that the the VA 1010EZ doesn't ask for a copy of the health insurance card. Is it absolutely neccessary to include one for the OHI cert or would providing an insurance name, effective date, policy holder name and the policy number (as it does on the 1010ez) suffice? |yes|yes|Yes, they do need the card, both front and back|
|14|Completed|File Uploads|Do you ever see beneficiaries sending in any other documentation than just the copies of the Medicare or health insurance cards? |yes|yes|Yes, for Medicare sometimes beneficiaries might send in SSA letters or other eligibility documentation. These types of documents are useful. Sometimes we see school certs or marriage docs that a beneficiary might send in accidentally.<br> For health insurance, beneficiaries might send eligibility letters or other official docs for their insurance company. We also have seen handwritten letters from beneficiaries signed and dated with insurance info on it.   |
|15|Completed|Comments| Do you ever see any other write-ins on the form besides what is already being asked? |yes|yes|For Medicare they have seen beneficiaries write that they are ending their Medicare plan on a specific date or opting out but that is not common. If CHAMPVA gets this info they will send it to the eligibility dept. |
|16|Completed|Comments|  What sort of comments have you seen get entered in the health insurance comments box on the 10-7959c paper form? |yes|yes|They do see this from time to time. There’s an example of a child with different coverage from another parent where they would mention this on the form. They also have seen “Termination due to retirement” or “Will terminate Health Insurance when CHAMPVA eligible” |
|17|Completed|Form Signature| Can a spouse or legal guardian sign on the OHI form without a PoA? What defines a Legal Guardian. |yes|yes|If they are a PoA the beneficiaries will need to send in the correct docs for it. A legal guardian will need a [FOI](https://foi.gov.ie/can-a-parent-or-guardian-have-access-to-their-childs-medical-records/) to send to the legal dept so CHAMPVA can have info released to that person signing for the beneficiary. Eligibility makes that determination. Legal guardians can be a parent or step parent and don’t need additional documents in that case. Parents or step parents sign for all of their children all of the time if they are the legal guardian. A spouse can sign without issue. Typically the sponsor that is signing for the spouse or children.|
|18|Completed|Comments| How often do you see the health insurance comments box filled out on the paper form and how would you enter that into your systems? Is there a character limit in your backend system for this field? |yes|yes|We see comments often. I would limit the characters to 200. Usually the comments are "[insurance carrier] termed on MM/DD/YYYY" or something like that|
|18|Completed|General| Was there ever a time that you had to send or call back a beneficiary for more details about their Medicare or insurance plan? What extra information did you need? |yes|yes|Yes, we send letters to beneficiaries daily or for emergencies. We will call the beneficaries or their providers (and in some cases) their insurance carriers to get clarification of their coverage|
|19|Completed|General| Is there any communication to the beneficiary after a form is submitted when they are just updating their insurance/address info? |yes|yes|Currently there is no communciation to the bene after the form is submitted. Perhaps in the future when they are on VES they would like to have an email go out to the bene. Usaully the form is sent to the bene after it is discovered that there is a change in OHI during the claims process or included as a part of the intial CHAMPVA registration |
|20|Completed|Medicare|How common is it to have different Part A and B and carriers?|yes|yes|Usually only have different Carriers for Parts A and B if they have different HMOs or supplemental Medicare insurance. If the beneficiary moves might get a new NBI Number# (Each Medicare Plan is issued by state) Usually a person does not qualify for B unless disabled or they over 65. If a person no longer disabled then they lose part B. It can vary from time to time so we should leave the ability to enter Parts A and B separately.|
|21|Completed|Confirmation|If a person mailed in there HI Cards, besides the benificary's name would there be any other info that would be helpful for the bene to include on the documents when they send them back?|yes|yes||
|22|Completed|Medicare|What information do we need to capture from Part C Bene's |yes|yes|We need their effective date, carrier's name and if they have pharmacy benefits. As of now there is no field for this on the PDF. Applicants will list it in another carrier name field which causes confusion during the form processing|
|23|Completed|Medicare|Do we need to capture carriers names for Part A and B, the majority (for the expection of Part C will be listed as Medicare Health Insurance |yes|yes|No we would just need to capture the effective dates for each (a date for Part A and a date for Part B. The two dates can vary depending onwhen they sign up for Part B/turn 65.|
|24|Completed|OHI|Do we need to collect the Schedule of Benefits or ask if there's an EOB for Pharamacy claims|yes|yes|We do not need a schedule of benefits. the info that they would need will be submitted during the claims process which will be the document that lists the date of service, dosage, providers and NDC codes (already asked for in the claims form) If someone has OHI they would also have pharmacy benefits so we won't need to ask that seperately on the form.|
|25|Completed|Medicare|WHich cards do we need to collect for Medicare|yes|yes|We need the orignal "red white and blue" card in any case, regardless of plan type. For Part C we need the Advantage card so we match up the effective date and see if the plan has pharmacy benefits|
|26|Completed|Medicare|Do you need to know if an Advantage plan has pharmacy benefits|yes|yes|Yes, it will show on the Advantage Card but we will also need that check box on the form. Sometimes an advantage won't have pharmacy benefits|
|27|Completed|Medicare|In order to be eligible for Part C a person must have Part A and B. Would you still need the Red White and Blue card in this case?|yes|yes|Yes, some PA's will think that a bene may not have A and B if they only see a Part C and don't see the Red White and Blue card seperately. This can cause major delays in or inelgibility for applicants so right now it's better to collect both to be safe. Premal looking into to this to see if we can fix this issue internal with IVC for now we need to keep both card required for upload|
|28|New|Medicare|Can you buy part D if you have Part C?|yes|yes|Research done from Jamie F.: This [resource](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/medicare/coverage/can-i-get-medicare-advantage-plan-medicare-prescription-drug-plan-at-same-time/) says that it may be possible but [healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health/medicare/medicare-part-c-vs-part-d) says it is not. My suggestion is to keep the Part D questions there to catch any edge cases.|
