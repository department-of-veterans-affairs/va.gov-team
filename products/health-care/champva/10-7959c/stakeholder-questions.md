|Number|Complete?|Form Section|Question|Blocking Testing?|Blocking for Production (1=must)|Answer|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Completed|General|If a third party (or anyone other than an applicant on the form) is filling this form out do we need to collect their contact info?||||Requires whoever is filling it out, to sign/date/phone number/city/state and zip - contact info, so yes|
|2|Completed|Patient Info/|Will Name DOB and SSN be enough info to identify a person so PA can add info to their “file”?||||yes|
|3|Completed|General|What is the current process for 10-7959c? The new launch of the digital 1010D form ChampVA enrollment and OHI form are going to come in within the same workflow (unless applicants choose to mail in their cards/ 7959c form). If we plan to pull out the 7959c info from the 1010d to keep it separate, is there an impact to having info coming in at two separate times?||||If they don't have any OHI and mark no, we don't require them to fill out 7959. If we take that out, we'd have to take them to the OHI form. Thinking about long term - want to remove OHI form from application process - that has nothing to do w/eligibility - more about payment. Can delay current process. Would like to remove OHI from process and move it to claims payment process part of house - when they go to collect payment. Do need it for current state. Trying to move to future state. Medicare - does affect eligibility. We need them to send their Medicare info to us - either card or something saying they don't qualify. For OHI - need something saying no they don't have it, but if they do, need to provide OHI form (can be on its own). If they get it, they send it separately (misc doc process - goes to review team). OHI is very convoluted - want to get rid of in the eligibility process. (Interested to see the proposed flow)|
|4|NEW|General|Would this form be used for any non-ChampVA purposes for example, would this be used to enroll or update applicant OHI inof for other family memebers or Veteran programs|yes|yes|
|5|NEW|Patient Info/ OHI|Do you store the current addresses and OHI info from the CHAMPVA enrollment or other OHI form submissions? If so we need to ask the engineers if there a way for applicants to view what current addresses or medicare info they have on file before choosing to update it|yes|yes||
