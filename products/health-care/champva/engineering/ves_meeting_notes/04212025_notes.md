# VES meeting notes - April 21st, 2025 @ 3pm ET

1. DEV 02 Environment
    * DEV 02 environment will be ready for testing by next week (possibly by Wednesday).
    * VES team will work to set up DEV 02 for testing.
2. Phone Number Requirements
    * The functionality to not require a sponsor phone is implemented, but Swagger schema is not yet updated to reflect this (update is coming soon).
    * International phone numbers: Only domestic phone numbers are accepted; no changes have been made to accept foreign numbers.
3. Test Cases
    * Test Cases Agreement: IVC team has a document with 10–11 scenarios, which could be shared with the VES team.
    * VES team will look over IVC test cases and send back any specific scenarios they’d like IVC team to test.
4. VES Application Access
    * The data submitted will seemingly not persist in VES after being processed(?). The application data is handed off to another team for further processing.
    * No real need for VES database access for the IVC team, per VES team
5. VES Demo Request
    * A demo will be scheduled after DEV 02 is set up, focusing on the relationship between sponsor and beneficiary.
    * Note: The demo won’t cover the entire CHAMPVA application creation, as VES onlyl automates creating the relationship
6. PEGA and VES
    * PEGA’s Role: VES team unclear on the role Pega will play in future
    * Manual Entry: Although the sponsor and beneficiary relationship will be established automatically, the full application will still require manual entry on the VES side.
7. Testing Timeline
    * SQA testing should happen on SQA-B environment; pre-prod environment is expected to be live around the end of May.
    * VES team aiming to complete everything by the end of May to allow testing before the contract ends in July.
8. Error Handling Discussion
    * Current flow: submissions are sent to PEGA first, followed by VES. If VES submission fails, no error will be sent to the user as PEGA can still process the application.
    * From the VES perspective, manual intervention will be possible to correct failed submissions. No change is required in the current IVC submission process.
9. Missing File Discussion
    * A thread will be created with the existing write-up and support chat thread so that others can review current status.
