# VES meeting notes - April 7th, 2025 @ 3pm ET

## Our questions/VES team answers:
- Question: _For upcoming changes to validation, can we get a heads up before they are implemented?_
  - Answer: They will update us. The recent changes were made unannounced because they thought we weren't testing yet.
- Question: _Is there an estimated delivery date when the `sponsor_phone` requirement will be dropped?_
  - Answer: No
- Question: _Submissions for applicants that are the sponsor's spouse are failing - are there any error messages we can see on the VES side to diagnose the issue?_
  - Answer: Turns out we were formatting the `date_of_marriage` property incorrectly.
- Question: _Applicant relationship to sponsor is freeform text - is there any way to support that on the VES side? Do we need to go back to the stakeholders?_
  - Answer: This will have to go back to the stakeholders for review before VES makes any changes
