# Product Outline: Integrating CHAMPVA Applications into the Claim and Appeal Status Tool (CST)

## Overview
We will integrate CHAMPVA applications into the existing Claim and Appeal Status Tool (CST) to enhance transparency, reduce delays, and improve the overall user experience for veterans and their families. This solution aims to provide real-time access to application statuses, streamline documentation workflows, and reduce call center volume.

## Problem Statement
Veterans and their families enrolled in CHAMPVA currently lack digital infrastructure to manage their application status, relying heavily on paper mail and manual processes. This results in delays, backlogs, and a high volume of status inquiries. Approximately 80% of calls to the CHAMPVA helpdesk are status inquiries, leading to significant wait times.

**How might we** provide a seamless digital interface for CHAMPVA applications that enhances transparency, reduces delays, and decreases call center volume through efficient and automated processes without compromising user trust?

## Desired User Outcomes
- **Real-Time Access:** Users can view real-time CHAMPVA application statuses. 
- **Seamless Document Handling:** Users can upload documents digitally, and it is routed directly to the applicants file for review by the VA.
- **Centralized Tracking:** Users can track the entire lifecycle of their application in one place.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- **Process Inefficiencies:** Continued reliance on traditional mail causing delays.
- **User Confusion:** Complicated or unclear digital interfaces leading to errors.
- **Duplicate Submissions:** Lack of feedback leading to multiple unnecessary submissions.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- **Efficiency Increase:** Reduced manual processing and paper mail handling.
- **Improve the call center experience:** Lowered call center volume for claims status, allowing for reduced wait times.
- **Improved Metrics:** Faster application resolution times and reduced backlog.
- **Enhanced User Trust:** Increased satisfaction and trust in VA systems.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- **Increase in Errors:** Poor system integration might lead to processing errors.
- **Resource Overload:** Initial system integration might temporarily increase workload.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
