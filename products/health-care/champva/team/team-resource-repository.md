# Team Resource Repository
## Overview
This document will serve as a repository for useful information that supports the objective and work of the team. Please adhere to the loose guidelines below so that we can keep this organized and relevant. Also, feel free to suggest changes or improvements to make this document easier to use and extend its lifespan!

Include a new heading (Heading 2) when adding a new category. Also, add a link to the new category in the Glossary for quick reference and to help avoid duplication. Feel free to break out a category into multiple categories if you feel it makes sense.

Include contextual information and notes with each link posted (E.g., is the information time-sensitive?  Is any special access required? Is any additional context needed for clarification?).

### Follow the example below for guidance:
Category Title

Here is a link to something interesting

Context and additional information are needed to understand and maintain the information that is part of the link.
