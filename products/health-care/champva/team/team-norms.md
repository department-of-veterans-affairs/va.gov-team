- Camera off is okay, no explanation is needed
- Include agendas in all meeting invites
- Remember we’re all in different time zones
- No expectation of someone responding outside of their working hours or if they’re on vacation.
- Feedback is personal, please check the team member’’s README on how they would prefer feedback
- Bring up blockers early and often in Daily stand-up or Slack
- Use email minimally
