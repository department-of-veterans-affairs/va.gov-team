# Running Agenda for IVC Forms Production Readiness Sync

# 2024-07-23
## Agenda
- Test email changes
- Overall form testing
- Add User Identity tracking to other forms like 10-10D for DD

## Notes

# 2024-07-09
## Agenda
- Extensions that aren't .PDF are missing from file_names in the IvcChampvaForm data table.
   - Might not be an issue with what Cindy said in her email but worth noting.
- I [Bryan] placed an elaborate 10-10D submission with PNG, JPEG and PDF supporting docs
   - Cindy is likely still looking into this as I write this.
   - We need to make sure that they get these documents and know how they are grouped. Right now they all have their own form_UUID, I wonder if we need to group them but we'll know when Cindy gets back to us.
- Form Status Email Verbiage
  - Is anyone working on this yet? The emails are still generic with Lorem ipsum.
- Form resubmission
   - Now that we have a bunch of forms without a PEGA response waiting in staging, can we get them through the process to see how that works?
   - If we need something to be able to do this, what do we need?
- Cypress tests
   - What's the best way to see what test cases are already in place?
   - What's the best way to add new ones?
   - Maybe we can write up a guide for this?
- TestRail
   - Working session to see what capabilities we have here?
- Load Testing for S3 bucket
- Documentation for reading and creating monitors in Datadog
- Double check numbers in the Datadog dashboard. Audit the form.s

## Notes
- Action items
   - Ticket to look into extensions for non-PDF files
   - Confirm that a form and its supporting docs use the same UUID (Don already looking into this)
   - Ticket to monitor how many users are giving email
   - Check in with PEGA team about their load testing
   - Backlog items for duplicating monitoring into prod
      - Update slack alerts so that prod alerts rather than staging
   - Check with Premal on ATO
   - Meeting to review eng recommendations

   - Two dashboards, ChampVA IVC Forms and 1010d IVC
   - What's the data source, are numbers correct?
## Notes

#### Attendees
* Michael

* Don
* Mary
* Bo

#### Discussion
- Overall Finding of IVC code by VA OCTO Engineering
  * Vets-website
    * Unit test coverage was called out, but 
    * Ticket would be good to add missing PropTypes and linting errors (one per form)
  * Vets-api
    * Testing for data dog to validate numbers
    * Ticket to set up data dog dashboard
    * Need business rules for communicating errors to users
    * Create ticket for communicating errors combined for FE & BE
    * Errors on submit: 
      * 200 all uploads successful
      * 400 all failed
      * 206 some failed
        * Think through error message and instructions to user
    * s3 could return more granular statuses—send to data dog, logging
    * Add ticket to ensure back end test coverage
      * IVC forms files in vets-api
    * Get clarification on question about tests validating PDF format
    * If PDF version expires, it will be a manual process to replace the old with new in the repository so low risk of this happening silently
    * Add ticket for updating README
      * Link to ADR, implementation, and PEGA details
  * Some suggestions…
    * Watchtower - need more info
    * Cypress tests are good for 10-10d and 79c
- Product to understand who needs to own which aspects of testing
- Ticket to add date and timestamp watermark for signature/statement of truth

```
current_time = "#{Time.current.in_time_zone('America/Chicago').strftime('%H:%M:%S')} "
      auth_text = case current_loa
                  when 3
                    'Signee signed with an identity-verified account.'
                  when 2
                    'Signee signed in but hasn’t verified their identity.'
                  else
                    'Signee not signed in.'
                  end
      stamp_text = SUBMISSION_TEXT + current_time
```
