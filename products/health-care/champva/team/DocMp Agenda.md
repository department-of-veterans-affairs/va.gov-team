<h6>Agenda</h6>

- Refactoring on IVC Forms for FMP Claims to send a single doc

- Champva Claims will be the next app to be released to production

- PrimaryContactEmail is now being sent in Metadata, can it be displayed to user?

- Do we want to keep the meeting at 3:15 or move back to 3:00 ET

<h6>Notes</h6>
-FMP Claims work on IVC Forms side to send as a single doc

  - Cindy had no issues, we should be good to go on this
    
- CHAMPVA Claims
  
  - We gave Cindy a heads up that we're going to staging review,  but need to clarify timeline.
    
  - I estimated that we may be ready to start staged release in Sprint 14 (Mar 26-Apr 8 ), but I think she had heard UAT.  We can follow up after staging review when we have a better idea
    
  - Cindy sent all the doc types for CHAMPVA Claims
    
  - Michael will send our doc types to Cindy.
    
  - Cindy will handle all the mapping on her side.
    
- The PrimaryContactEmail for 1010d is available in the database, but is prioritized below quite a few items on the Pega side
  
  - The earliest Cindy predicted was May or June, which is also not set
    
  - Until then, Cindy would be able to retrieve it for anyone from the database
    
- We're going to move the meeting back to the original 3pm ET time slot (it had been rescheduled for service blue print workshops)
