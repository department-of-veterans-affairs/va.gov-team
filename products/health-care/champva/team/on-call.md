# On-Call Rotation Guidelines for IVC Forms

# DRAFT
*Updated 10/2/2024*
### Overview
This document outlines the expectations and responsibilities for team members during their on-call rotation for production support. The goal is to ensure smooth handling of production incidents during business hours while minimizing the impact on sprint deliverables.
### On-Call Schedule
* **Rotation**: On-call duty will rotate with each sprint among team members, starting on the first day of the sprint at 9 AM ET and ending the last day of the sprint at 5 PM ET.
* **Coverage**: The team member on call is responsible for production support during regular business hours (Monday to Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM ET). If you are unavailable (vacation, illness), you must arrange a swap with another team member and notify the team.
### Responsibilities During On-Call
The person on call is primarily responsible for following the team's [monitoring playbook](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/team/ivc-forms-monitoring-playbook.md) and ensuring it is followed by ticket assignees.

While on call, you are expected to:
- Monitor: Actively monitor production alerts and notifications during your assigned sprint.
- Respond: 
  - Acknowledge any alert within 1 hour during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM ET).
  - Create incident issues as needed in Zenhub
  - Notify PM (Bo) and/or DM (Andrea)
- Resolve: Resolve if you can. If you can’t, hand off to another team member and confirm they’ve taken ownership.
- Communicate: Provide regular updates on the status of incidents in the designated PUBLIC channels. Keep DMs in Slack or Teams to a minimum so that communication is open and transparent
- Document: Log any incidents, the steps taken to resolve them, and lessons learned in the ticket that was created above
- Handoff: At the end of your on-call rotation, ensure the next team member in the rotation is fully briefed on any ongoing issues.

### Escalation Policy
* As needed, escalate to
  * PM (Bo)
  * DM (Andrea)
  * PO (Premal)

### Incident Response Principles
To ensure a consistent and effective approach to handling incidents, the following principles and best practices should be followed:
- Prompt Acknowledgment: Acknowledge any incident promptly (within 15 minutes) during business hours. Swift acknowledgment builds trust and helps minimize uncertainty.
- Clear and Timely Communication: Communicate incident status regularly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Provide updates on timelines, resolution progress, and any workarounds.
- Collaboration and Escalation: If you are unable to resolve the issue within the designated time, escalate it to the relevant lead and ask for help when needed. Collaboration ensures faster resolution.
- Avoid Finger-Pointing: Focus on resolving the issue, not assigning blame. A blameless culture helps promote learning and improvement.
- Continuous Monitoring: Utilize monitoring tools to detect potential issues early. Proactive monitoring allows incidents to be addressed before they escalate.
- Respect Non-Working Hours: Ensure that incidents during business hours are handled promptly, and non-critical issues that arise outside of business hours can be deferred to the next working day.

### Tools and Access
You must ensure you have:
* Access to all necessary monitoring tools and dashboards.
  * Datadog dashboard
  * Monitoring slack channel⠀

### Support From the Team
* The entire team supports the on-call member. If an issue exceeds your expertise or the workload becomes too heavy, don’t hesitate to ask for help.

### Additional Expectations
* During your on-call week, remain available for incident response during business hours and adjust priorities if critical incidents arise.
