# Durham VAMC field visit

### Tuesday June 16 @ 7:00 am

## Observations from the employee entrance from 7-8 am

- New posters in place but text number does not appear
- Screener telling employees to update to the new screener: "We don't use the green one anymore"

### Some tech issues continue 

- Some employees still struggling with QR code being recognized
- Text number not displayed on the posters and URL sized down very small so didn't know they could get to it another way
- On iPhones there's a small notification at the top, easy to miss and not realize it the QR code was read successfully
- Some employees saw a spinning logo waiting for the page content to download (header and footer displayed)

### Some employees don't use the app

- "I don't want to be tracked by the VA"
- "I don't want to install another app"
- "I don't want to download another thing"
- "I find it annoying every morning"
- One employee was mad about the change from the old to new app

Patients are generally not using the app yet

## Conversation with screening coordinator

- 32 screeners on the team with 4 runners
- 24/7 staffing of the screening stations
- A few nurses and one doctor also servng as screeners (a dentist: since they are only doing emergency dental procedures, he's a screener instead of being furloughed)
- This team never existed until they had to start screening for Covid in March 

### Story told to my by the screening coordinator re: "sore throat"

- Good catch by a employee who answers every day. 
- He has a chronic sore throat and answers honestly every day. Which means he never passes.
- Could we change to a question with “changed or worsening”? That would cover his chronic sore throat.
- Also we have two questions about sore throat. One for 3 days. One “currently”.

## Observations from the front entrance from 10-11:30 am

### Stressful situation for screeners, patients, and caregivers

- It's stressful being a screener since there are new rules in NC: no spouses/visitors allowed to accompany Vets on their appointments
- Screeners have to tell them to go wait in the car
- Folks are used to being able to hang out and wait or accomapany their Vet
- This stresses the patient out too--tempers were flaring
