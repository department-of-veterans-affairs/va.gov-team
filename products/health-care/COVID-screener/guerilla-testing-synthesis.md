# Guerilla Testing Synthesis

## Key Findings

- All participants successfully completed the screener, several described it as "easy", "simple", "clean"
- Some participants indicated that visiting the VAMC would be a stressful event
  - "You would probably a little stressed out, mask on your face, stressed out"
  - "I would probably feel a little aprehensive, i would be more comfortable doing telehealth or going to a small, less popluated clinic."
- Some participants made errors and needed to go back to a previous question, which they were able to do with the browswer back button
  - "It looks like the page requires you to scroll"
- Question 4 provided a long list of symptoms, which 2 participants noted was distracting
  - "Only feedback is the one about symptoms, I thought it was a little crowded, I would like it to be bulleted and cleaner, if you are in a car and stressed out."
- Generally like the simplicity of Yes/No response options
- A few participants were confused by the meaning of the "Start new screening" button, assuming they needed to complete additional questions
  - "I thought the (start a new screening) was to take me to the next set of questions, like now that I passed I have another set of questions to answer."
  - "I would think that I would go through a whole new screening, I am getting screened again for some reason."
- Participants had inconsistent interpretations of the final PASS/SCREEN result
  - "So i would say, that this means, I go in and they are proably going to screen me, I'm giong to see a physician, they will give you like a legit test."
  - "It says PASS great, thats good. I would expect that somebody out there, would say if you have a green come to the right side. They go straight in. They dont need extra system."
  - When I went through and said I had all the symptoms, the fact that its red tells me probably not good, I'm proabably going to get tested, as a user I have a little bit of angst, what should I expect when I get to the door? What happens next?"
  - "Show this to a person to show them that i passed, right, then they would let me in?"
  - "So my guess is that the initial pass that they dont think I have COVID."
- Participants liked the large button size and were able to navigate the app with one hand
  - "Holding in left hand, scrolling down and tapping. Easy enough to press and move to the next one. Same hand (thumb to navigate)."
  - "Just used my thumb one hand"

## Recommendations
- Provide a clear scrolling/previous question option to participants who make mistakes or want to review an answer
- Change the wording on the start new screening button to indicate it begins the same questionnaire again and is not a follow-on
- Use less emotionally-charged colors on the results screens
- Indicate clear next steps on the results screen
- For any questions with long lists, change the format from paragraph to scannable bullets
- Keep the large buttons and large text
