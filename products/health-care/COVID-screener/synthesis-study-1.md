# COVID Screener Study 1 Synthesis

## Demographics
Partcipants: 7

M/F: 4 male, 3 female

Role: 5 Veterans, 2 Caregivers

## Findings

Most Veterans feel "safe" or "confident" returning to a VAMC.
- "I'm fine going back beccause they're taking precautions"
- "Perfectly comfortable with going back, seem to be taking reasonable precautions"

Generally understood the PASS results next steps.
- "For the visit, I'm allowed to pass through the doors."
- "I show them the screen and they make me keep a mask on and sit down."

Generally understood the FAIL results next steps.
- "Someone needs to eval me to see if I can come in."
- "Probably pull you off to the side."

Most participants thought the application was easy and simple to use. They generally completed the questions in about 1 minute.
- "Liked it was easy straightforward."
- "Straight and to the point very easy to answer these questions."
- "I'm on a lot of sites and I know a lot of people who would love to do this."

In some cases (2 of 7), text messages delivered to Android phone appeared out of order.
- "Seems out of order, had to scroll up."

Some participants did not know what they "passed" (2 of 7)
- could be misleading didnt say what you pass for
- if I have it I'm asymptomatic and maybe I don't have it (MW: concern about clarifying what PASS really means)

One participant confused the VCL info in the text as related to the screener.
- "I assume chat is a live VA person."

Some participants were concerned that the screener could be "gamed".
- "It will help, (I) still think people can lie"

Some participants (2 of 7) mentioned the VA branding is clear and inspired trust.
- "As long as I know it's really from VA I trust it"
- "I recognize the VA.gov branding"

One participant confused by the term "screener" meaning a person vs a tool.
- "I was a bit taken back by the "screener", like it was a person"

Participants generally thought the screener would improve their entry process.
- "I'm impressed, this would have made things a lot easier."

One participant was concerned that the contact question did not have an "I don't know" option.
- "At bottom for last question re: contact with someone with covid, add 'I don't have a clue'"

One caretaker completed the screener for both herself and the Veteran at once.

Some participants indicated that the screener may reduce stress arriving at a VAMC
- "If doing from vehicle, then you are at a safe distance from staff and others."
- "Less stress having it in this format."


## Recommendations

- Break text messages into multiple deliveries or make them smaller to reduce issues with Android devices.
- Find way to remove the VCL contact info from the first text.
- Re-word the "pass" message to clearly indicate completion of screener only, not a COVID test pass.
- Emphazise the results section by visually differentiating it from the questions more fully.
  - "Dislikes? At the end when you're done, make result full page and takes up full screen."
- Consider additional langauge/tone that will reduce stress in the app interaction, increase the Veteran's sense of ease and certainty on arrival.
