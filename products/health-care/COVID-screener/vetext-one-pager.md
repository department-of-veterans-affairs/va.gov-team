# VEText patient tracking 
**A text-based feature to help protect Veterans, caregivers, and employees at VA health facilities**

## THE PROBLEM
To protect Veterans, caregivers, and VA employees during the coronavirus pandemic, VA facilities must follow CDC guidance on physical distancing for in-person appointments. But many clinics have small waiting rooms that don’t allow for this distancing.

## THE SOLUTION
A new VEText feature allows VA facilities to check patients in remotely while ensuring physical distancing. Providing simple, easy-to-use digital tools like this one helps reduce wait times, ease stress, and lower exposure risk. It also helps Veterans gain confidence in the new reality of increased digital interactions as part of their VA health care experience.

## TOOL FEATURES

VA designed this tool in partnership with Veterans and medical center leadership, incorporating feedback from user testing to ensure the tool meets Veteran and employee needs.

**Text check-in**
The Veteran sends a text when they arrive at a facility. They receive automated instructions for where to wait for their appointment time.

**Remote patient tracking**
Facility staff uses the VEText portal to track patient appointment status. They then text the Veteran when it’s time to come in for their appointment.

**Pre-registration by phone**
Facilities may opt to perform pre-registration via phone to get the Veteran’s updated demographic and insurance information while the Veteran is waiting outside.

**Quick access to crisis support**
For Veterans in need of immediate support, the tool provides quick access to the Veterans Crisis Line.
