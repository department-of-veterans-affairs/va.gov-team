# VA COVID-19 screening tool
**A digital tool to help you protect patients and employees at your VA health facility**

## THE PROBLEM

To protect patients and staff, VA must now screen everyone for coronavirus symptoms and exposure each time they enter a health facility. In-person screening can delay care and increase exposure risk. It can also be stressful for some people.

## THE SOLUTION

A digital pre-entry screening tool allows Veterans, caregivers, and employees to answer questions on their mobile phones and share their results at the VA facility entrance. Staff members can then quickly triage people to either enter the building or go to a designated area for more screening.

Providing simple, easy-to-use digital tools like this one helps reduce wait times, ease stress, and lower exposure risk. It also helps Veterans gain confidence in the new reality of increased digital interactions as part of their VA health care experience.

## TOOL FEATURES

VA designed this tool in partnership with Veterans and medical center leadership, incorporating feedback from user testing to ensure the tool meets Veteran and employee needs.

**Simple experience** <br>
Users can access the tool quickly via text message. Large text and buttons, plain language, and a simple flow of questions allow users to complete screening in under a minute.

**Clear results** <br>
The results screen shows 1 of 2 messages ("OK to proceed" or "More screening needed") plus a timestamp and next steps. The large, clear text and color-coded screens help staff easily triage.

**Quick access to crisis support** <br>
For Veterans in need of immediate support, the tool provides quick access to the Veterans Crisis Line.

**Easy-to-update screening protocols** <br>
The tool's features allow us to update questions within 24 hours to meet evolving needs.

The Office of the CTO will continue to closely monitor usage, performance, and feedback, and will update content and features as needed. For questions or to offer feedback, contact us at [email].
