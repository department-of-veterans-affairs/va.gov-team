# Intro screen

_[update notes: added "-19" for "COVID-19," lowercased "screener," and tightened copy for length]_ 

**COVID-19 screener**

As part of our coronavirus screening, you'll need to answer 6 questions before entering a VA facility.

We won't store or share your data.

# Question 1

_Questions here as I'm thinking through this. Let me know if see value in exploring these further now or in future:_ 

_1. In this iteration of the screener, will the user's answer affect the other questions they receive in any way or result in a "patient/visitor/employee" label on their results screen? If no, wondering if we could get right into the symptoms questions and get this down to 5 total?_

_2. Is there is a possibility of showing a variation on question 6 depending on patient/visitor vs. employee (i.e., not mentioning PPE in patient version)?_

_3. Right now, my understanding is that visitors aren't allowed in VA health facilities. So just wondering if by letting a user who selects "Visitor" take the pre-screen, are we potentially setting them up to think they'll be able to get in? Might cause frustration for visitors and problems for staff? Is there a way of either removing "Visitor" for now or showing a different "We're limiting visitors at VA facilities right now...please call..." kind of message for those who select "Visitor?"_
