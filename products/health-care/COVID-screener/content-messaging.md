# Intro screen

_[update notes: added "-19" for "COVID-19," lowercased "screener," and tightened copy for length]_ 

**COVID-19 screener**

As part of our coronavirus screening, you'll need to answer 6 questions before entering a VA facility.

We won't store or share your data.

# Question 1

_Questions here as I'm thinking through this. Let me know if see value in exploring these further now or in future:_ 

_1. In this iteration of the screener, will the user's answer affect the other questions they receive in any way or result in a "patient/visitor/employee" label on their results screen? If no, wondering if we could get right into the symptoms questions and get this down to 5 total?_

> MW: The only reason to ask for the employee is for the PPE question (assuming it stays). We could combine patient and visitor...? Patient or caregiver?

_2. Is there is a possibility of showing a variation on question 6 depending on patient/visitor vs. employee (i.e., not mentioning PPE in patient version)?_

>MW: Yes I believe we can have question variation depending on the type of user. 

_3. Right now, my understanding is that visitors aren't allowed in VA health facilities. So just wondering if by letting a user who selects "Visitor" take the pre-screen, are we potentially setting them up to think they'll be able to get in? Might cause frustration for visitors and problems for staff? Is there a way of either removing "Visitor" for now or showing a different "We're limiting visitors at VA facilities right now...please call..." kind of message for those who select "Visitor?"_

>MW: "Visitor" might be the wrong word? Caregiver? Basically if the patient needs someone to help communicate or ambulate, they can come with them. But only one person.

**Question 1 of 6** 
Are you a:

[button] Patient

[button] Visitor

[button] Employee or contractor


# Question 2

**Question 2 of 6**

In the past 24 hours, have you had a fever?

[button] Yes

[button] No


# Question 3

_[update notes: changed "week" to "7 days" for consistency with other symptom questions]_

**Question 3 of 6**

In the past 7 days, have you had a cough or shortness of breath that's new or getting worse?

[button] Yes

[button] No

# Question 4

**Question 4 of 6**

_[update notes and question: changed this question to reflect more cdc symptoms (minus cough since that's covered in Q3). Martha, does this presentation with bullet points work in the design? If no, I can break out into 2 questions with just text.]_

In the past 3 days, have you had any of these symptoms?

- Fever or feeling feverish (chills, sweating)
- Sore throat
- Muscle pain or body aches
- Vomiting or diarrhea
- Change in smell or taste

[button] Yes

[button] No

> MW: Wondering if we can have the radio buttons and keep the No button in place as well...? I really want the employees to never have to move their thumb as they answer all the questions.

# Question 5

_[update notes: switched order of Qs5 and 6 so that we go through all symptoms first, then exposure]_

**Question 5 of 6**

Do you currently have a sore throat, runny nose, or nasal congestion?

[button] Yes

[button] No

# Question 6

_[update notes: tightened/plain language'd copy a bit more]_

**Question 6 of 6**

In the past 14 days, have you had contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)?

> MW: I guess this is an employee/contractor only question?
