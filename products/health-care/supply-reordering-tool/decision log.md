| June 21, 2024     | Kaitlin F., Jenny W.                  | Short term: Update reordering form to match the updated form template in VADS while fixing identified usability and accessibility issues. Long term: Merge with Medications on MHV on VA.gov and stop using form template.  | There are many usability and accessibility issues that prevent users from submitting orders successfully currently. It will take less time to fix that before investing a longer time to merge with Medications on MHV on VA.gov, on top of that there're limited people who work on medical supplies. |
|May 23, 2024      | Patrick B.,Jasmine Y.                   | Will be focusing on adding assistive devices to the supply reodering tool by EOY vs. integrating with medications                      |Given timelines for medications Phase 1 and discussion on 5/22 with Meds Design Leads, it is better to devote resources we have to adding additional supply types per DLC's request           |
