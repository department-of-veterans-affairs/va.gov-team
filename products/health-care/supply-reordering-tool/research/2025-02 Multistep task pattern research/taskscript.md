- **Task success (A and B)** = Veteran clicks submit on review page and lands on a confirmation page
- **Objective**: To compare the efficiency and intuitiveness of the multistep task pattern (version B) against the old form pattern (version A) in the context of reordering medical supplies, and to understand if this new pattern meets veterans' expectations for completing routine tasks quickly and easily.
### Post-task questions
1. How easy was it to reorder a hearing aid battery using this tool?
2. If this were real, how confident would you feel that the you successfully submitted the medical supply order? 
3. Was there any point during the task where you felt lost or unsure of what to do next?

## Task 2: Edit email address

Please go through the process of reordering a hearing aid battery again, but update the email address to newemail@gmail.com, then complete the order. Click "I have completed the task" when you're done. Note: if you get stuck, press "R" on your keyboard to restart the prototype
- **Task success (A and B)** = Veteran clicks submit on review page with **updated email.**
- **Objective**: To assess which pattern option (A or B) Veterans are more successful and faster in editing their email address.
### Post-task questions
1. How easy was it to edit the email?
2. How confident did you feel that you successfully edited the email?

## Task 3: Find Instructions for an Unavailable Supply 

- **Task**: Locate the unavailable supplies and the instructions on how to reorder them. Click "I have completed the task" when you're done. Note: if you get stuck, press "R" to restart the prototype
- **Task success (A)** = Veteran lands on select supplies page and clicks "complete task"
- **Task success (B)** = Veteran lands on "unavailable" view of landing page
- **Objective**: To assess which pattern option (A or B) provides clearer guidance to veterans when encountering unavailable supplies and to gauge if the new pattern aligns with veterans' expectations for handling such situations.
### Post-task questions
1. How easy was it to find the unavailable supplies?
2. How easy was it to understand that the supply was unavailable to reorder?
3. How clear are the instructions for what to do if you want to order an unavailable supply?

- **Task**: Imagine you're in the middle of the process of ordering a hearing aid battery, but you discover you have extra batteries and decide you no longer need to place the order. Please cancel the in-progress battery order. Click "I have completed the task" when you're done. Please do not exit out of Optimal Workshop for this task.
Note: if you get stuck, press "R" to restart the prototype
- **Objective**: To evaluate which pattern option (A or B) offers a more straightforward and satisfying exit path, contributing to greater trust and satisfaction with the VA's digital patient portal experience.
