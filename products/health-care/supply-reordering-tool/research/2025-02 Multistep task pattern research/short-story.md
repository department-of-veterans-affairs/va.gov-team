# Multistep Task Tool Speeds Up Veteran Supply Orders

## TL;DR  
Veterans complete supply orders faster and more successfully with a new multistep task tool, but there’s room to refine the user experience.

## What We Did  
The Office of the CTO team conducted unmoderated A/B prototype testing to evaluate how two design patterns—an older form-based tool and a new multistep task tool—helped Veterans reorder medical supplies. The goal was to determine which design made common tasks faster, easier, and more intuitive.

## Key Insights  
- **The new tool is significantly faster for Veterans.**  
  - Veterans completed tasks 43% faster using the multistep tool. "Why go to a second page to order the supply? Why not just click and be done?"

- **Veterans are more successful with the multistep tool.**  
  - Success rates improved by 140% for the most critical task. "Your system makes it easier to follow through without getting stuck."

- **A clearer confirmation process builds confidence.**  
  - Veterans want confirmation alerts with more details like item names and delivery dates. "I’d feel better if it told me exactly what I ordered."

- **Veterans lean toward single-session task completion.**  
  - 95% of participants expect to complete tasks without pausing. "I don’t want to come back later—I want it done now."

- **Unavailable supplies create confusion.**  
  - Veterans struggled to locate unavailable items in a separate tab. "Why would I look for unavailable items first? Just show me everything."

## Between The Lines  
The multistep tool aligns with Veterans’ mental models for quick, straightforward task completion. However, the design patterns still include unnecessary steps and confusing navigation that could frustrate users.

## Yes, But  
While the multistep tool is more effective overall, some Veterans didn’t find it significantly easier to use. Many changes offered statistical gains but lacked a meaningful practical difference for Veterans’ experiences.

## Why It Matters  
This research supports VA’s broader goals of improving the digital experience for Veterans. Streamlined tools and intuitive designs directly contribute to OCTO’s mission of delivering faster, more reliable outcomes for Veterans managing their health.

## What’s Next  
- Make list view cards clickable to reduce steps.  
- Integrate unavailable items into a unified list with filters.  
- Enhance confirmation alerts with detailed order information.  
- Test these improvements on other My HealtheVet tools.
