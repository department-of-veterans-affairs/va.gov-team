## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jenny and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you ok with them joining the call? But before we get to them, I'll talk a little bit about what we'll be doing today.  

We are part of a team working on the health sections of the website VA.gov. We’d like to get your feedback on the supplies reordering process. So, I will be asking you to walk me through how you would order medical supplies on the VA.gov website and will be asking you questions and hearing your thoughts and reactions while you do that. Most of what we'll be asking you is about your reactions to what you see on the website and what you might expect. Part of understanding how we can best improve this website is to understand what's working for our Veterans and what's not. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Your feedback today will help us make sure that we meet your needs and expectations on the website. 

It is worth noting that we will be using a testing website. This is not the actual website. We use it to explore what the website could look like and get feedback from users like yourself before we make any final changes to the website. This testing website will not work exactly like a website and may not contain all the information. 

Also, there are a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know. 
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was okay to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this) or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- Last one - one of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not but like to ask ahead of time. I'll also confirm at the end of the interview that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've talked about. 
    - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?** 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let’s start with a few questions... 

- Can you tell me a bit about what supply you use and your last experience reordering supplies?
- How was that experience?
- How did you find out about how to reorder supplies?
- What notifications do you receive about reordering?
- How do you know when to place an order?
- _If they have ordered on VA.gov before_ Ask how and what was the experience like for them.
- _If they have ordered on physical forms only_ Ask if they are aware of the digital form on VA.gov.

Great, that’ll be helpful to know as we move forward. 

Thank you for sharing all that with me! 


**Let’s start screen sharing so you can show me how you’d do that. Are you familiar with how to share your screen with Zoom?** 

Screen sharing instructions:

In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 

If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again. 

(If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared) 

Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser. 

Great, now I can see your screen! 

Thank you for your patience in figuring this out. Now let's go to that website. I can post the URL in the chat or just say it to you. Which of you prefer? 

_Send them or say: https://staging.va.gov/health-care/order-hearing-aid-batteries-and-accessories/ 

This is a test version of VA.gov. It looks like the real website and we have turned some special features on for our session. Nothing we do here will impact your information and you will see it has test data (like a made-up name) in certain parts of the site. 


## Task 1 : Can you walk me through how you would order a hearing aid supply? - 20 minutes 

#### _Now at Order content landing page_

If participant mentions or attempts to sign in send credentials 

If participant does not attempt to sign in, let them explore a bit 

If you signed in, do you think anything different would be available? 

If participant mentions or attempts to sign in, send credentials 


Please think out loud and let me know what your thoughts are about the page, the information here, and how everything is organized. 

Where would you go next? 

Participant clicks quicklink 

Now that we are at this page, can you show me what you would do next to make a supply order? 

Participant clicks quicklink 

#### _Step 1 Page : Veteran Information_

You have now arrived at the first step of the order form. Please think out loud and let me know what your thoughts are about the page, the information here, and how everything is organized. 

Anything confusing?  

Would you add, remove, or change anything on this page?  

Any additional questions on this page? 

#### _Step 1 Page (cont). : Veteran Information_

What do you think about this page? Can you please show us how you would complete this step of the form? 

Before you hit continue, how would you describe the difference between a permanent address and a temporary address? When would you sue one over the other?  

#### _Step 1 Page (cont). : Veteran Information_ 

Observe if there's any confusion for this page and what they need to do. Ask if they seem stuck or quiet. 

Let’s see if you’re at a different location from your home, how would you add your current location and make sure the supplies ship to your current location?  


#### _Step 2 : Select your supplies_

Can you show me how you would order a hearing aid supply from this page? Please think out loud about this page and let me know your thoughts. 

Once participant has selected supply 

Before you hit continue, is there any other information that would have been helpful to identify or select the correct supply? 

Would you add, remove, or change any details about each supply to this screen?  

Scale of 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to select the supplies that you need to reorder?  

Point to CPAP supplies being not available:  

What if this supply is what you needed, what would you do next?  

#### _Step 3: Review order details_

Can you show us how you would submit your order? 

At this point, you realized that you forgot to add X supply to this order, how would you go about adding that to this order?  

Let’s say that at this point in your order, you realize that you need to ask a question to your VA provider before placing the order, and you need to save this order and come back later to submit. Could you show me how you would save this order, then resubmit it?  

#### _Step 4: Confirmation screen_

So at this point in the order, you would see a confirmation screen. Here is what that looks like : ([share screen of screenshot and/or prototype screen](https://www.figma.com/proto/WKX0HaQ74uZjO43g0lI2Pl/Mock-ups?page-id=64%3A8063&type=design&node-id=64-8064&viewport=529%2C263%2C0.26&t=91vqyZ5LF5jezA13-1&scaling=min-zoom&mode=design)) 

Can you share any reactions and thoughts you have for this? 

Is there anything confusing or if you have any questions on this page?  

Can you tell me what you ordered here? Would you like to add anything to this page?

#### _Overall_

How would you rate this reordering overall experience from 1 to 5, 5 being the easiest? 

If you could change one thing about this supply reordering experience, what would it be? 

 

## Closing - 10 minutes 

Thank you for doing that task, we gained some insight into how Veterans may go through this form. As we wind down, I hope you don't mind if we ask a couple more questions about supply ordering. 

How would you go about changing your supply type or brand? 

If a supply isn't available and you are told to talk to your provider, then how would you do that? 

In your experience/opinion, are we missing any devices? 

Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you’d like to share? Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up? 

## Thank You

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
