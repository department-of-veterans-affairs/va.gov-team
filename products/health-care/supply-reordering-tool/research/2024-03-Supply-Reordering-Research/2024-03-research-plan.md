# Research Plan for Supply Reordering Usability Test, Health Portfolio, March 2024

## Background

The Supply Reordering tool seeks to relieve the burden on the Veteran of going to DLC for reordering devices and filling out a form via mail, or calling to reorder their devices by going to VA.gov instead. Veterans currently sign into VA.gov (authenticated) to place a re-oder for: 
- Hearing aids and batteries
- CPAP supplies
  
Due to this online tool functionality, DLC has seen a drastic reduction in the use of their contact centers for supply reorders, which allows them to use their time towards other goals. 

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

Veterans can manage their health services online
Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

- Goal 1: We want to understand how Veterans currently order and re-order medical supplies. 
- Goal 2: We want to evaluate if the current digital form on VA.gov is user-friendly, easy to understand, and useful to Veterans. 

### Outcome
We want to determine if the current digital ordering process is serving Veterans' needs and is as intuitive as possible for the future state of this product. The insights of the study will also help us improve the medical supplies ordering experience. 

### Research questions

1. What are Veterans' reactions to and understanding of the current digital medical supplies ordering tool?
	- Is it clear that the form may include hearing aid supplies and CPAP supplies?
	- Is it clear to users why some supplies are available and some are not?
	- Is the form clear on what Veterans need to do when supplies are not available?
	- Do Veterans know what to do when they want to change supplies after submission?
2. How are Veterans notified when their prescribed medical supplies are eligible to reorder?
   	- How is the process of reordering indicated to Veterans first time and subsequent times? 

### Hypothesis

- Hypothesis 1: Participants will get through the tasks of ordering the supplies relatively easily.
- Hypothesis 2: Participants may not know how to change supplies once orders are submitted. 
- Hypothesis 3: Veterans probably look to see what shape their supplies are in to know when to reorder and/or are notified by their clinician.
- Hypothesis 4: Veterans probably find out about the reordering process from their VA provider.
- Hypothesis 5: Most Veterans would probably call DLC or try to call their VA Medical Center to discuss changing supplies, for example, if they want a different-sized CPAP supply after submitting a supply order. 


## Methodology	

We will conduct remote usability and interview sessions on Zoom. The interviews will consist of a combination of tasks and direct questions. We will conduct the study in the staging environment, with one test account and a different password created specifically for the study. We will document each password created and participants' demographics in the sensitive repo. 
  
### Location
All sessions Will be remote on Zoom.
