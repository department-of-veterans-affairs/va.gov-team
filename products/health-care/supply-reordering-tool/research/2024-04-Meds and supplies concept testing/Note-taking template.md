## Interview - 20 minutes 

### _Task: Order a mask strap for CPAP and glucose testing strips._ You need to order a mask strap for your CPAP and some glucose testing strips. Using this prototype, can you show me how you'd do that from here? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking as you figure out how to do this on the website. 

**- Observe what they do first:**
Participants may try to find either mask traps or glucose testing strips first, remember to ask “Which one are you looking for” before they click on something on MHV home (for all 3 options).
 
**- Questions for Option 1:**
   - If they are unsure which link to click, ask "What confuses you, OR what are you thinking?"
   - Before you click on anything, tell me what you're thinking and what you'd click on next.
   - What do you expect to see when you click...? (regardless of what they click)
      - _If they click before you ask this question: Is this what you were expecting to see?"_
        
Wherever they land on the next step, ask: 

- What is this page, OR what's the purpose of this page?
- What do you like and dislike about this page?
- (If applicable, to remind them) What would you do from here to order a mask strap for your CPAP? Or what would you do from here to order glucose testing strips?
- After they do something, ask "Is this what you expected to see?"
  
After completing the task:

- How easy or hard was it to find where to order the mask strap? 5 being the easiest and 1 being the hardest. Why?
- How easy or hard was it to find where to order glucose testing strips ? 5 being the easiest and 1 being the hardest. Why?
- What did you find the easiest and most difficult about this activity?         

  
**- Questions for Option 2:**
   - If they are unsure which link to click on, ask "What confuses you, OR what are you thinking?"
   - Before they click on either one of the links under Medications and medical supplies card on MHV home, ask "What do you think the differences are?” (Only if they are confused) What do you find confusing? How would you change it to make it less confusing?
   - What do you expect to see when you click...? (regardless of what they click)
      - _If they click before you ask this question: Is this what you were expecting to see?"_

Wherever they land on the next step, ask: 

- What is this page, OR what's the purpose of this page?
- What do you like and dislike about this page?
- (If applicable, to remind them) What would you do from here to order a mask strap for your CPAP? Or what would you do from here to order glucose testing strips?
- After they do something, ask "Is this what you expected to see?"
  
After completing the task:

- How easy or hard was it to find where to order the mask strap? 5 being the easiest and 1 being the hardest. Why?
- How easy or hard was it to find where to order glucose testing strips ? 5 being the easiest and 1 being the hardest. Why?
- What did you find the easiest and most difficult about this activity?
  

**- Questions for Option 3:**
- If they are unsure which link to click on, ask "What confuses you, OR what are you thinking?"
- Can you describe what you expect to see after you click on...?
- Observe and see if they know they need to click on the "refill and order" link to order the mask strap or testing strips, or do they go to the list page? 

Wherever they land on the next step, ask: 

- What is this page, OR what's the purpose of this page?
- What do you like and dislike about this page?
- (If applicable, to remind them) What would you do from here to order a mask strap for your CPAP? Or what would you do from here to order glucose testing strips?
- If they have difficulties finding the mask strap on the list view page, point it to them, but ask "How would you change it to make it easier to find?"
- After they do something, ask "Is this what you expected to see?"

After completing the task:

- How easy or hard was it to find where to order the mask strap? 5 being the easiest and 1 being the hardest. Why?
- How easy or hard was it to find where to order glucose testing strips ? 5 being the easiest and 1 being the hardest. Why?
- What did you find the easiest and most difficult about this activity?         


**- Questions after showing all 3 options:**
- Which option did you find the easiest for you in terms of finding the mask strap and glucose testing strips and ordering them?
- Based on your understanding and experiences, what are the similarities and differences between medical supplies and medications?
- If you could change one thing about what you saw today, what would it be?
