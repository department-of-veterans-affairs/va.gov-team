## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jenny and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you ok with them joining the call? But before we get to them, I'll talk a little bit about what we'll be doing today.  

We are part of a team working on the health sections of the website VA.gov. We’d like to get your feedback on some changes we've made on there. So, I will be asking you questions and hearing your thoughts and reactions while you walk me through some activities I will be giving you on the website. Most of what I'll be asking you is about your reactions to what you see and what you might expect. Part of understanding how we can best improve this website is to understand what's working for our Veterans like you and what's not. As much as possible today, I would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Your feedback today will help us make sure that we meet your needs and expectations on the website. 

It is worth noting that we will be using what we call a prototype. This is not an actual website. It is a file that we use to explore what the website could look like and get feedback from users like yourself before we make any final changes to the website. This prototype will not work exactly like a website. For example, not all of the links will work and you cannot click the back button in your browser because it will take you away from the prototype.

Also, there are a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know. 
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was okay to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this) or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- Last one - one of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not but like to ask ahead of time. I'll also confirm at the end of the interview that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've talked about. 
    - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?** 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let’s start with a few questions... 

- What medical equipments have you been prescribed? 
- Have you ordered accessories for your medical equipment online before? If yes, how was your last experience? If no, move on to the next question.

Great, thank you for sharing all that with me! 

**Screen sharing instructions**

First, I'd like you to share your screen so I can see how you navigate the site. Do you know how to share your screen? 

_Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:_
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

Thanks for your patience in figuring that out. 

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen? 

A reminder: This is a prototype. It looks like the real website, but doesn't function like the real website. We have turned some special features on for our session, and nothing we do here will impact your information and you will see it has test data (like a made-up name).


## Interview - 20 minutes 

**Show each participant all 3 design options, and route the order you show the options**

Next, I will give an activity that you may do in your real life, then I will ask you to use 3 different prototypes to do the activity. While you use the prototypes, I would like to hear your thoughts and observe your reactions for each prototype. 

**_Task: Order a mask strap for CPAP._** You need to order a mask strap for your CPAP. Using this prototype, can you show me how you'd do that from here? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking as you figure out how to do this on the website. 

- Observe what they do first:
   - If they scroll up and down, ask "What are you thinkng as you...?"
 
- Questions for Option 1:
   - If they are unsure which link to click on, ask "What confuses you on, OR what are you thinking?"
   - If they click and get to medications, ask "What did you click...?"
   - If they click on any links for medical supplies, ask "What do you think will happen when you click...?"
   - On "Medical supplies" page, ask:
        - What is this page, OR what's the purpose of this page?
        - What do you like and dislike about this page?
        - What would you do from here to order a mask strap for your CPAP?
   - How would you rate your experience of finding the mask strap to order and why you'd rate that? 5 being the easiest and 1 being the hardest.
  
- Questions for Option 2:
   - If they are unsure which link to click on, ask "What confuses you on, OR what are you thinking?"
   - 
  
- Questions for Option 3:


- Questions after showing all 3 options:

   - 

 

## Thank you and Closing - 5 minutes 

Thank you for walking me through how you'd order and sharing your thoughts with me. As we wind down, I hope you don't mind if we ask a couple more questions about what we have done so far. 

- 

Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you’d like to share? Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up? 

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
