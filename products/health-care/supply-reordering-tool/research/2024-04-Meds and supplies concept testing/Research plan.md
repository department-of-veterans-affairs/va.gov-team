# Research Plan for [Medications and Devices Pod, Medical Supplies Reorder, April 5, 2024]

## Background

In a [previous study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secondary-nav/Comparison-study/research-findings.md), there is an indication that Veterans think there's a connection between medical supplies and medications. As our team continues to iterate on the medical supplies reordering functionality to MHV on VA.gov, we need to understand where Veterans expect to find medical supplies on the auth MHV home page, and how similar or different Veterans think about medications and medical supplies.

### OCTO Priorities 

- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.
	- Key Result 1: The number of transactions processed using our products has increased by 25%.
 	- Key Result 2: All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.

### Veteran Journey

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging


## Research Goals	

The purpose of this study is to: 

- Understand how Veterans categorize medications and medical supplies.
- Understand whether Veterans expect to view and order all medical supplies and medications as subsections within the same section, within a fully integrated list, or in separate sections.
- Establish which I.A. is easier to use.
- Gather insights into the advantages and disadvantages of each design option.


### Outcome

This research will inform how to display medical supplies on the MHV on the VA.gov landing page and help us decide if medications and medical supplies should be integrated in any way within the next iteration of medical supplies on MHV on VA.gov.

### Research questions

- Using which IA option did most Veterans easily locate and order medical supplies?
- Do Veterans expect medical supplies and medications to be completely different tools on MHV on VA.gov (design option 1), OR do they expect them to be in the same category of tools with different characteristics (design option 2), OR do they expect them to be the same (design option 3), OR something else?
- Where do Veterans have difficulty navigating?
- What advantages and disadvantages do Veterans identify for each concept?


### Hypothesis

- Veterans may think medical supplies and medications are in the same category because they both need to be prescribed.
- Veterans may have difficulties finding and ordering medical supplies if they are on the same list as medications because the list can get very long.
- Veterans may expect medical supplies and medications to be in the same category on MHV home but expect to view and order them separately, which is option 2.
- Veterans may be confused about categorizing supplies like testing strips and wound care supplies as medications or medical supplies. 


## Methodology	

This will be a mix of research methodologies, including concept test, moderated user interviews, and exploratory/comparison test. We will conduct remote sessions on Zoom. Interview sessions will consist of tasks and direct questions regarding participants' behaviors, thoughts, and reactions. We will conduct the study with Figma prototypes. 

### Location

All sessions will be remote on Zoom.
