**[MHV on VA.gov Landing Page Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/landing-page/research/2023-03-Landing-Page-User-Research)**
- The researcher recalled a handful of participants flagging medical supplies specifically as something that excited them about the new landing page design. However, the medical supplies section was not specifically tested during the research, and it's unclear what they were excited about (e.g. it could simply be the fact they see the feature of ordering supplies as new and available). 

**[MHV on VA.gov Secondary Navigation Comparison Study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secondary-nav/Comparison-study/research-findings.md)**
- The majority thought they'd find CPAP supplies under Medications. This was both when participants were looking at the secondary navigation (top anchor links) and when they were looking at the landing page.
- Participants seem very committed to their assessment that CPAP would fall under Medications, to the point that they thought they'd find it in the Medications box (Link: refill) on the landing page (even though a clear CPAP re-ordering link is lower on that same page).

**[My Health I.A. Tree Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-01-my-health-ia-tree-test)**
- Only 1 person went to medications to order hearing aid batteries. The task of ordering hearing aid batteries (in the top level menu - medical supplies) was 94% successful and mostly all direct success. 

**[Medications Usability Testing Round1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medications/research/2023-07-medications-usability-testing-round1)**
- The question was "What other types of supplies or non-medication items would you expect to find on this list?"
- Many supplies were mentioned by participants when asked what types of supplies or non-medication items they expected to find on the medications list page. Keywords are aid, alcohol, bandage, brace, CPAP, device, diabetic, glucose, hear(ing), insulin, machine, monitor, non (medical), pad(s), strip(s), supply, and syringe.
