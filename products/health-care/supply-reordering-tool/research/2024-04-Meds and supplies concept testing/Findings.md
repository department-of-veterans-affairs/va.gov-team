## Research Goals

In a [previous study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secondary-nav/Comparison-study/research-findings.md), there is an indication that Veterans think there's a connection between medical supplies and medications. As our team continues to iterate on the medical supplies reordering functionality to MHV on VA.gov, we need to understand where Veterans expect to find and order medical supplies on the auth MHV home page, and how similar or different Veterans think about medications and medical supplies. 

The purpose of this study is to:

- Understand how Veterans categorize medications and medical supplies.
- Understand whether Veterans expect to view and order all medical supplies and medications as subsections within
- the same section, within a fully integrated list, or in separate sections.
- Establish which I.A. is easier to use.
- Gather insights into the advantages and disadvantages of each design option.
  

## Research Questions

- Using which IA option did most Veterans easily locate and order medical supplies?
- Do Veterans expect medical supplies and medications to be completely different tools on MHV on VA.gov (design option 1), OR do they expect them to be in the same category of tools with different characteristics (design option 2), OR do they expect them to be the same (design option 3), OR something else?
- Where do Veterans have difficulty navigating?
- What advantages and disadvantages do Veterans identify for each concept?


## Methodology 

We conducted 40-50 mins long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants were asked to order glucose testing strips and mask straps for CPAP using 3 Figma prototypes with different designs. We showed 3 prototypes in various orders and asked them to order glucose testing strips and mask straps in different orders to avoid biases.

- [Design option 1 prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-53043&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A53043&show-proto-sidebar=1)
- [Design option 2 prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-54298&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A54298&show-proto-sidebar=1)
- [Design option 3 prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-55328&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A55328&show-proto-sidebar=1)


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans may think medical supplies and medications are in the same category because they both need to be prescribed.
   - LIKELY FALSE. In terms of usage, most participants (11/15) think medications and medical supplies are completely different. 3 mentioned that they all need to be prescribed for the similarities. With that being that, most participants still preferred medications and medical supplies to be in the same category even though they thought they were different.
     
2. Veterans may have difficulties finding and ordering medical supplies if they are on the same list as medications because the list can get very long.
   - LIKELY TRUE. Out of the 10 who preferred to have medications and supplies items on the same screen, 7 participants mentioned that the list should have some type of separation between medications and supplies or organizations to help them find things easily.
     
3. Veterans may expect medical supplies and medications to be in the same category on MHV home but expect to view and order them separately, which is option 2.
   - Half LIKELY TRUE and half LIKELY FALSE. 10 out of 15 participants prefer to have medical supplies and medications in the same category on the MHV landing page (option 3 prototype). They like that medications and supplies are all in one place, and they don't have to go to different places to look for them. Even though they expect medications and medical supplies to be in the same place/list, as mentioned in the 2nd bullet point, 7 participants mentioned that the list should have some type of separation between medications and supplies or organizations to help them find things easily.
     
4. Veterans may be confused about categorizing supplies like testing strips and wound care supplies as medications or medical supplies.
   - LIKELY TRUE. We asked participants to order mask straps and glucose testing strips. Everyone knew they needed to go to the medical supplies section to find mask straps. However, no one expected to find testing strips in the prescriptions/medications section. 5 participants knew they could find testing strips in prescriptions, only because they had prescribed testing strips and learned it's in the prescriptions section of the MHV Classic today. 


## Key Findings

**1. Most participants (10 out of 15) found the [option 3](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-55328&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A55328&show-proto-sidebar=1) the easiest to find and order glucose testing strips and mask straps, but mentioned that medications and medical supplies are difference when asked to define them.**
  - _On the refill and order page of option 3:_ Most participants (7 out of the 10) communicated that they wanted to change how medications and medical supplies are organized. 3 participants wanted medications to be separate from medical supplies, and 4 wanted medications and medical supplies to be in one list with the ability to filter or sort. 
  - Despite previous experience with ordering glucose testing strips on MHV Classics, 5 participants still chose option 3.
  - With [option 1](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-53043&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A53043&show-proto-sidebar=1) and [option 2](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-54298&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A54298&show-proto-sidebar=1), most participants (10 out of 15) struggled to find glucose testing strips because they thought glucose testing strips were medical supplies.
  - 5 participants chose [option 1](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-53043&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A53043&show-proto-sidebar=1) as the easiest to use and liked medications and medical supplies are completely separate on MHV on VA.gov landing page and reorder page.

**2. Some (7 out of 15) participants found it confusing to have both a list page and an order page because they didn't see much difference and value in having both pages.**


## Details of Findings 

### Finding 1: Most participants (10 out of 15) found the [option 3](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-55328&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A55328&show-proto-sidebar=1) the easiest to find and order glucose testing strips and mask straps and liked everything in one place, but mentioned that medications and medical supplies are difference when asked to define them.

The moderator assigned two tasks to participants: ordering CPAP Mask straps and ordering glucose testing strips. The task and order that the prototypes were shown to the participants varied to remove bias. Participants were able to use all 3 options to order mask straps, but most had trouble finding glucose testing strips with option 1 and option 2. Overall, option 3 was picked as the easiest to use to order mask straps and glucose testing strips by most participants (10/15). Those participants expressed that they liked everything being consolidated in one place and didn't have to go through different screens to find things. 

> _Supporting data: "I didn't have to go through different screens to find what I'm looking for."_

> _Supporting data: "Easily the first one (option 3). They were in one place. Having everything I need to order in one place. For the other options, I had to figure out where they were. Fewer clicks are always the easiest."_

> _Supporting data: "Everything was combined so it was easier to find everything in one place."_

> _Supporting data: "You don't always know if it's a medication or prescription. You no have to look in 2 different places instead of going to one place."_

When asked about the similarities and differences between medications and medical supplies, all participants said they were mostly different by definitions with little similarities. They mentioned that medications are for internal use and supplies are for external. The moderator asked this question in between prototypes or at the end of all prototypes. Considering the differences these participants mentioned, they still preferred to see medications and supplies in one place because it's easier and has fewer clicks. 

> _Supporting data: "Similarity is they are all doctors' orders."_

> _Supporting data: "Medications are pills. Supplies are something you use."_

> _Supporting data: "Medications are things you take into your body (orally or injection), and supplies are things to put outside of my body."_

> _Supporting data: "I don't find it confusing to see prescriptions (with supplies). The ability to go to one place is just easier for me."_

> _Supporting data: "It doesn't matter that medications and supplies are different. It's just nice to have them on the same page."_

**_On the refill and order page of option 3:_ Most participants (7 out of the 10) communicated that they wanted to change how medications and medical supplies are organized. 4 participants wanted medications and medical supplies to be in one list with the ability to filter or sort, and 3 wanted medications to be separate from medical supplies.**

Most participants wanted to see a separation or a better organization between medications and medical supplies on the refill and reorder page. One participant mentioned that it might be hard to find what they need to refill/reorder if the list gets long. 

> _Supporting data: "I think they should be separated on one page. Sorted in alphabetical order, but all on the same page._

> _Supporting data: "Having tabs on the page would help navigation (referred to finding medications vs. supplies)."_

> _Supporting data: "Want to filter/sort or alphabetical orders on the order page."_

> _Supporting data: "Likes the first screen, but still separate medications and supplies on the order page."_

**Despite previous experience with ordering glucose testing strips on MHV Classics, 5 participants still chose option 3.**

There were 5 participants who knew where to find glucose testing strips on the MHV Classic, so they went to the prescriptions section to order glucose testing strips using option 1 and option 2. However, they still thought testing strips should be a supply. 

> _Supporting data: "I looked in prescriptions first for the testing strips because that's where I see them now. They are under Pharmacy on the current MHV. I would put testing strips under the supplies._

**Most participants (10 out of 15) struggled to find glucose testing strips using [option 1](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-53043&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A53043&show-proto-sidebar=1) and [option 2](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-54298&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A54298&show-proto-sidebar=1) because they thought glucose testing strips were medical supplies.**

Most participants had struggled to find glucose testing strips. Because they thought glucose testing strips were medical supplies, they went straight to the medical supplies section when asked to order glucose testing strips. 

> _Supporting data: "Why weren't glucose testing strips a supply? That would be confusing for me._

> _Supporting data: "I'd move testing strips under the supplies section._

> _Supporting data: "(one participant who is experienced in MHV Classic) I looked in prescriptions first for the testing strips because that's where I see them now. They are under Pharmacy on the current MHV. I would put testing strips under the supplies._

> _Supporting data: "You don't always know if it's a medication or prescription._

**5 participants chose [option 1](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-53043&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A53043&show-proto-sidebar=1) as the easiest to use and liked medications and medical supplies are separate on MHV on VA.gov landing page and reorder page.**

The participants (5 out of 15) who didn't choose option 3 picked option 1. They liked that medications and medical supplies are separate on MHV home and have different order pages. The general concern is that they might be overwhelmed by the large number of medications and medical supplies in one place and might not want to see medications if they only want to order supplies. One participant mentioned that they liked that option 1 is a small and easy change from the MHV Classic for them to adapt. 

> _Supporting data: "I can click on medical supplies when I'm not ordering medications."_

> _Supporting data: "If I want medications, I go to that section. If I want medical supplies, I go to that section. That's what I like better (about option 1)."_

### Finding 2: Some (7 out of 15) participants found it confusing to have both a list page and an order page because they didn't see much difference and value in having both pages.

This finding applied to all 3 options (see the screenshot below for the list page link and order page link on the MHV landing page). Some participants looked at the list link and order link on the MHV home page and were not sure what the differences were. 4 participants clicked on the list link when asked to order, and then they either tracked back to the home page to click on the order link or took a while to click on the order link on the list page. There is value in having a list page for medications, but this needs more research to see if there's a use case for a view-only list for medical supplies.

> _Supporting data: "The supplies list doesn't have any value to me. Why not have print and download on the order page?_

> _Supporting data: "Not sure the differences between list and order links are."_

> _Supporting data: "List and order supplies are repetitive on MHV home."_

> _Supporting data: "It doesn't make sense to me that I need a list of what I have and a separate screen to order."_


## Recommendations

* Recommendation 1

Here's [a list of medical supplies-related research studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/supply-reordering-tool/research/2024-04-Meds%20and%20supplies%20concept%20testing/A%20list%20of%20supplies%20related%20research%20data.md) with highlights on Veterans feedback and behaviors and expectations around medications and medical supplies. Combining the past studies and what we found in this study (a total of 2 behavior-focused studies and 2 feedback/sayings-focused studies), there is a split between medications and medical supplies when asked to order non-medications or types of supplies.
