## Research Goals

In a [previous study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secondary-nav/Comparison-study/research-findings.md), there is an indication that Veterans think there's a connection between medical supplies and medications. As our team continues to iterate on the medical supplies reordering functionality to MHV on VA.gov, we need to understand where Veterans expect to find and order medical supplies on the auth MHV home page, and how similar or different Veterans think about medications and medical supplies. 

The purpose of this study is to:

- Understand how Veterans categorize medications and medical supplies.
- Understand whether Veterans expect to view and order all medical supplies and medications as subsections within
- the same section, within a fully integrated list, or in separate sections.
- Establish which I.A. is easier to use.
- Gather insights into the advantages and disadvantages of each design option.
  

## Research Questions

- Using which IA option did most Veterans easily locate and order medical supplies?
- Do Veterans expect medical supplies and medications to be completely different tools on MHV on VA.gov (design option 1), OR do they expect them to be in the same category of tools with different characteristics (design option 2), OR do they expect them to be the same (design option 3), OR something else?
- Where do Veterans have difficulty navigating?
- What advantages and disadvantages do Veterans identify for each concept?


## Methodology 

We conducted 40-50 mins long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants were asked to order glucose testing strips and mask straps for CPAP using 3 Figma prototypes with different designs. We showed 3 prototypes in various orders and asked them to order glucose testing strips and mask straps in different orders to avoid biases.

- [Design option 1 prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-53043&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A53043&show-proto-sidebar=1)
- [Design option 2 prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-54298&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A54298&show-proto-sidebar=1)
- [Design option 3 prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-55328&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A55328&show-proto-sidebar=1)


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans may think medical supplies and medications are in the same category because they both need to be prescribed.
   - LIKELY FALSE. In terms of usage, most participants (11/15) think medications and medical supplies are completely different. 3 mentioned that they all need to be prescribed for the similarities. With that being that, most participants still preferred medications and medical supplies to be in the same category even though they thought they were different.
     
2. Veterans may have difficulties finding and ordering medical supplies if they are on the same list as medications because the list can get very long.
   - LIKELY TRUE. Out of the 10 who preferred to have medications and supplies items on the same screen, 7 participants mentioned that the list should have some type of separation between medications and supplies or organizations to help them find things easily.
     
3. Veterans may expect medical supplies and medications to be in the same category on MHV home but expect to view and order them separately, which is option 2.
   - Half LIKELY TRUE and half LIKELY FALSE. 10 out of 15 participants prefer to have medical supplies and medications in the same category on the MHV landing page (option 3 prototype). They like that medications and supplies are all in one place, and they don't have to go to different places to look for them. Even though they expect medications and medical supplies to be in the same place/list, as mentioned in the 2nd bullet point, 7 participants mentioned that the list should have some type of separation between medications and supplies or organizations to help them find things easily.
     
4. Veterans may be confused about categorizing supplies like testing strips and wound care supplies as medications or medical supplies.
   - LIKELY TRUE. We asked participants to order mask straps and glucose testing strips. Everyone knew they needed to go to the medical supplies section to find mask straps. However, no one expected to find testing strips in the prescriptions/medications section. 5 participants knew they could find testing strips in prescriptions, only because they had prescribed testing strips and learned it's in the prescriptions section of the MHV Classic today. 


## Key Findings

**1. Most participants (10 out of 15) found the [option 3](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9zkSuKTzHm9eQqHTEN1iz/Medical-supplies-reorder?page-id=505%3A53042&type=design&node-id=505-55328&viewport=315%2C661%2C0.34&t=v2HTVy1zki0uT7TU-9&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=505%3A55328&show-proto-sidebar=1) the easiest to use, and liked medications and medical supplies are all in one place.**
  - 7 out of the 10 participants who found option 3 the easiest to use expressed that they wanted some type of separation or organization for medications items and medical supplies items on the refill and reorder page. 
    
**2. Every participant thought glucose testing strips were medical supplies.**
  - 5 participants who had been prescribed glucose testing strips and knew it's in the prescriptions section of the MHV Classic today thought the same.

**3. 

**4. Participants didn't have difficulties navigating, only when they didn't find where to find testing strips 
list vs. order page

5 picked option 1 - medications are separated from supplies, have not prescribed glutoce testing strips
