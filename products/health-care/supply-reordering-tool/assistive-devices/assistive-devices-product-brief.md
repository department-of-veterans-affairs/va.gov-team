# Supply Reordering Assistive Devices Product Brief 
---

## Overview


## Problem Statement
Veterans with medical devices such as hearing aids, and CPAP machines, are able to any supplies related to those items on VA.gov. Currently, we do not serve Veterans who need Assistive Device supplies. 

 ### Users should be able to:
 - Order any medical supply in a quick, efficient and easy way
 - Understand eligibility/steps for re-ordering
 - Be able to monitor what supplies are available and what are not to order
 - Contact the correct teams for assistance when needed. 

## Desired User Outcomes: 
- Improve transparency / reduce confusion around supply reordering process
- Veterans are well informed about the process are able to independently take reordering actions (prescription, eligibility, ordering)
- Veterans are well-informed about the status of their supplies

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Supply reordering tool doesnâ€™t provide the user with the same functionality that they have today- causing frustration and dissatisfaction.
- Veterans are confused about supplies.
- Misalignment in data and functionality on VA Health and Benefits Application. MHV on va.gov and with DLC


## Desired Business Outcomes
- Enabling users to understand and self-service supply needs leads to more timely care, reduces burden on clinical and call center staff, and increases patient safety
- Easily accessible and identifiable supplies list will alleviate congressional and patient safety questions.

## Project Timeline & Activities

Our committment to DLC is to have the ability to add Assistive Devices to the reordering tool by the end of the year 2024/or the beginning of 2025.
