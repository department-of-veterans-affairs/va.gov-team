# Medical Supplies Product Outline/Overview

## Overview


## Problem Statement
This is part of a larger initiative to move all Veteran transactions around managing their health care to a central portal, rather than having multiple websites and mobile applications to do the same medical supplies transactions. The medical supplies reordering tool can be accessed through MHV on VA.gov, but the link will take Veterans to VA.gov (outside of MHV experience) to continue the reordering process. The medical supplies reordering tool only supports hearing aid batteries and accessories and CPAP supplies; there will be more types of equipment and supplies in the future to incorporate into the reordering tool.  

 ### Users should be able to: 
 - Order any medical supply in a quick, efficient and easy way
 - Understand eligibility/steps for re-ordering
 - Be able to monitor what supplies are available and what are not to order
 - Contact the correct teams for assistance when needed. 

## Desired User Outcomes: 
- Improve transparency / reduce confusion around supply reordering process
- Veterans are well informed about the process are able to independently take reordering actions (prescription, eligibility, ordering)
- Veterans are well-informed about the status of their supplies

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Supply reordering tool doesnâ€™t provide the user with the same functionality that they have today- causing frustration and dissatisfaction.
- Veterans are confused about how to order their supplies.
- Misalignment in data and functionality on VA Health and Benefits Application, MHV on va.gov and with DLC


## Desired Business Outcomes
- Enabling users to understand and self-service supply needs leads to more timely care, reduces burden on clinical and call center staff, and increases patient safety
- Easily accessible and identifiable supplies list will alleviate congressional and patient safety questions.
- Support receives fewer calls and emails related to ordering supplies.
- Veterans' overall experience and trust in VA improves.
