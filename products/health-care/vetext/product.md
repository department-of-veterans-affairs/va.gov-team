# Product brief for the VEText Program

## Background

Each year, more than 9 million VA health care appointments go unutilized due to missed appointments (no-shows).  To increase access to health care for all Veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) developed VEText – an interactive text messaging solution – to remind Veterans of an upcoming appointment.  

In early 2018, VEText was selected by the Office of Veterans’ Access to Care (OVAC) as the official SMS appointment reminder system for all VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community-Based Outpatient Centers (CBOCs).  

In 2020, the VEText Program became a part of the Office of the VA Chief Technology Officer’s (OCTO) portfolio.  In addition to appointment reminders, VEText powers digital notifications for several health care (and a few non-healthcare) use cases.
