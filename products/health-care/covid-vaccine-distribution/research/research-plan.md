# Research Plan for [VAOCTO, KeepMeInformed (TBD), December 4, 2020]

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	

## Goals	
1. **What product & team are you doing this research for?** The Veterans Affairs, Office of the CTO is rapidly developing a product/solution to facilitate the “pooling” of interest of the COVID-19 vaccine from Veterans across the nation. Additionally, the product/solution will also capture the interest of Veterans in receiving updates to their status in receiving the vaccine but also to receive trusted and authoritative information about the vaccine.

2. **Background:** Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is so much uncertainty which drives the constantly changing federal guidelines and safety recommendations for the general public as well as health systems. With the vaccine imminently to be deployed, there are additional challenges with regards to the uncertainty not only in how the vaccine will be deployed but especially with concerns in receiving the vaccine. Communications and the dissemination of information across VAMCs across the nation as well as to the broader Veteran community will be critical. The product/solution that is in development was informed by speaking to several VAMCs and in through understanding their challenges in the deployment of vaccine and communicating locally, the solution was defined in leveraging existing technologies with a nationwide presence to augment and support VAMC communications and resource allocation challenges. The proposed solution will provide support for 2 primary needs:
- **The Pooling of Interest:** Through VA.gov, Veterans will be asked to indicate their interest in receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Receipt of the vaccine will depend on the Veteran’s place in the phased prioritization guidelines (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - ACIP) and is based on their age and medical risk conditions. The capture of interest in the vaccine near-real time will provide a national snapshot of interest that could be assigned to the local VAMC and provide valuable information that may inform their outreach for communications, sharing of vaccine information, as well as inform their deployment strategy and scheduling practices. This information may also roll up to inform the next phased deployment of limited supply vaccine nationally across VAMCs as additional vaccines will be deployed in subsequent months with the pressing need to ensure no vaccine goes to waste.
- **Communications and the Dissemination of Information and Updates:** The solution will also leverage existing technologies that are currently available nation-wide (i.e., VETText, etc.) which provides an ability for direct messaging to Veterans (mass or group or targeted). This would provide a vehicle for providing sources for trusted and authoritative information on the vaccine which may be provided nationally at VA.GOV as well as more locally-based communication from a VAMC. This may also provide a means of providing the Veterans who expressed interest in receiving the vaccine, routine updates to their status and to indicate when action needs to be taken (i.e., direct scheduling for their appointment series at their local vaccine clinic, etc.).  

3. **Research questions:** What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? Questions to be included fall into one of several groupings:
- **Vaccine:**
  - Are you interested in receiving the COVID-19 vaccine?
  - Why?
  - Why Not?
  - How would you express your interest in receiving the vaccine?  
  - What are your expectations after expressing interest in the vaccine?
- **Communications:**
  - **Information:**
    - Who do you trust to receive information about COVID?
    - What source do you trust to receive information about COVID?
    - Would you be interested in receiving information about the COVID vaccine?
    - If so, what information would be important to you with regards to the vaccine?
    - If not, why?
 - **Updates/Notifications:**
   - If interested in receiving the vaccine, how often would you like to receive updates to your status?
   - What is your preferred method to receiving updates?
   - How often would you like to receive updates to your status?

4. **Hypothesis:** What is your hypothesis for this research? National and standardized method of communicating about COVID-19 vaccine.

## Method	
1.	**What method of research are you planning?** The sample methodologies to be used include directed interviews through structured question guides with Veterans in a remote/virtual moderated environment. Engaging with Veterans on their preferences of engagement related to the COVID-19 vaccine updates and information will provide valuable insight that will inform the product/solution.
2. **Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?** Direct engagement with Veterans on their preferences with regards to updates, information, and vaccine interest is the best way to receive valuable end-user perspective on such a sensitive topic. Meeting Veteran needs through a user-friendly and yet lightweight solution to deliver immediate benefit to all downstream users will be critical during the pandemic and with limited supply of vaccine to be delivered to only a select few VAMCs within weeks.
3. **Where are you planning to do your research?** Research is best to be conducted in a remote/virtual environment due to risks associated with the pandemic. We will leverage existing online tools that have previously been used for Veteran engagement. 
4. **What will you be testing?** (Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.) Testing our understanding of what Veterans communication preferences are and their interest in vaccine as well as their rationale. The team will be testing and evaluating interest from Veterans on the following:
  - Interest in COVID-19 vaccine
  - Interest in receiving (or trusted sources of accessing) COVID-19 Vaccine information
  - Interest in receiving direct notifications on any aspects of the COVID-19 vaccine (even for Veterans uncertain about receiving vaccine)

**If remote:** What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex). It will be remote and most probably Zoom or other existing online tools for direct Veteran engagement.

## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	**Participant criteria:** What are you looking for in a participant? For the purposes of this engagement, it is critical to engage with a representative sample of Veterans across gender, age groups, racial and ethnic backgrounds, by accessibility preferences and across varied geographic regions. With that said, we expect this to be an ongoing exercise through 2021 and initially, the primary focus may be those Veterans registered as a VHA patient that fall in the early phases of vaccine receipt (Phase 1c: Veterans with high risk medical conditions 65+). 

(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.). Criteria #1: Veteran. Criteria #2: Enrolled in VHA to receive care at a VA facility.

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	**What is your recruitment strategy?** 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)	

## When? 	
1.	**Timeline:** What dates do you plan to do research? (IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) The plan for research is to be started as soon as possible and ideally to hold the first of a series of these calls for the week of December 7th and weekly moving forward until we achieve critical mass with regards to actionable input to inform the solution/product.
2.	**Prepare:** When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.). The team intends to have the basic components for an MVP by the end of the week of December 7th or into early half of the week of December 14th.
3. **Length of Sessions:** How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time. Due to the urgent nature, we are happy to accommodate the minimal time to begin engagement. We expect that no more than 60 minutes and at minimum 30 minutes — the initial calls may help refine the optimal time for engagement on these issues moving forward. 
4.	**Availability:** If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any. Due to the urgent nature of this work, there is ultimate flexibility in the sessions in terms of days and times.  
5.	**Pilot:** Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? As soon as possible. For the design team: TBD.
