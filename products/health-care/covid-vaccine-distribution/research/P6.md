## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauryl Zenobi and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your thoughts on the COVID-19 vaccine and how you would like to receive information and updates on the vaccine in the months to come.  

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

  - once or twice a month, seem slike a little more because that's the touchpoint for getting into a lot of things like checking claims, healthcare

    - I sign up for a lot of things thru VA.gov and VSOs, so everyday I get a rundown of what's available, I get lots of different sources
    - email, two or three times a day
    - email is good, but it'd be nice to get text messages. I like instant, simple, easy, accesible. But if I can get info on text message that would be convenient
- _If interested in receiving the vaccine_ How would you like to learn when the vaccine is available?
  - What is your preferred method?
  - How often would you like to get updates on whether the vaccine is available yet or not?

## Stay Informed Website 20-30 mins

Ok, now I'd like to have you look at a potential solution and get your feedback. I'm going to share a link in the chat. What I'd like to do is have you open that on your computer's internet browser and share your screen so we can follow along with what you're seeing. I'd like you to think out loud as you look at this prototype together. I want to point out that since this is a prototype, not everything will work, so in that case, please tell me what you expect would happen. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers, and your feedback will help us build better tools for Veterans.

### Main Mini Hub page
- What are you seeing here?
   - I see the VA and covid vaccines at the VA
   - reading thru, this is good info, it says they are working with the CDC, and other partners
   
- What stands out to you?
  - looking at things on the side
- (stay informed call out) What is this telling you?
   - asks you about interest in getting the vaccine
  - What would you be signing up for?
    - I would guess I would get emails
- Who is this site for?
  - definitely for Veterans
  - I have a spouse, but not sure if it would be for her or not

### On this page links
- Let's say you wanted to find out when you might be able to get the vaccine, how would you do that?
  -immediately clicked on sign up button
- How would you find out more information about the vaccine?
- What information is missing here?

### Sign up
- Let's say you wanted to sign up to get updates on when a vaccine was available, how would you do that?
  
- _auth vs non-auth flow_ What are you seeing here?
    - I can sign in or not, and it's telling me i don't need to sign up to get a vaccine, and you can change your mind at any time
    - reads diclaimer
    - see CDC guidelines about, would click that
  - Which option would you choose? Why?
   - I'm thinking if I sign in it would connect me
   - somedays I might not sign in, because I have to remember the password, depends on how energetic I'm feeling today
   - clicks sign on, uses DS Logon, first excellent
   - sometimes I have problems with DS Logon, so I'll use MHV
   - [directed to continue to sign up without logging in]

### Communication sign up form
- What do you think this page is for?
  - does look vaguely familiar, but I look at a lot of websites
  - would give me updates, info on when I could get the vaccine
  - It's telling me if I don't want to sign up for stuff I can still get the vaccine
  - I would sign up
  - I'm thinking I have to sign up/it would be easier for me to get updates if I sign up using this form
- What do you think of the information you're asked to fill out here?
    - name, DOB, SSN, I don't have a problem with it, pretty standard for any other VA sites
  - _probe on zipcode_
    - odd that they ask if I would be in this zip code for the next 6-12 months, why do you need that info?
    - not a problem answering, but not sure why needed
    - maybe for demographic info on interest by zip code
  - _probe on interest level radio buttons_
    - for me, I don't have a problem with it I will say yes
    - until a few days ago I was at a not sure
    - was unsure since it's unprecendented how fast the vaccine came through. But supposedly, based on FDA, CDC, Dr. Fauci, and seeing others getting the vaccines, I will get it but am thinking I will lay back for a few months to see if there are any adverse effects
    - its sort of like a flu shot, but on a whole different level. Seeing is believing.
    - I think it covers a lot of bases, since some people are private, have different mindsets, shouldn't be an offensive question
- What would you expect to happen once you fill out this form?
   - I would think that I would get an email, since I give my email address. Phone is on there too, so sometimes I'll get calls and such.
   - also, phone, possibly could get text messages to get links to go get more covid information
   - I know I'd be contacted but not sure how. I'm big on text messages. I'm on email daily
   - my mom for instance is 80, she doesn't want to login to her email everyday.

### Confirmation/review page
- What are you seeing on this page?
  - thanks for signing up, info received. 
  - when new info is ready, they will send me info by email or text, very good, I like that.
  - options to look at other pages for more info
  - my only concern is a lot of older Veterans aren't down with email and text, so if there was a way for them to get that info.
  - I want everyone to get this info, it's important
- Let's say you change your mind about your interest in getting the vaccine, say after 6 months, what would you do?
  - if weren't getting it continue social distancing, online shopping etc
  - to stop getting updates, look for an opt-out option
  - to remove interest, send secure message to primary care physician

### Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
- What are you thoughts on what you looked at today?
  - It's good info, simple, concise
- Is there anything we didn't ask you that would be important to know?
  - What I'm unclear on is can my spouse get a VA vaccine? Is this just for Veterans or for anybody that can use the VA healthcare?
  - I know when I went to get the flu shot, lots of people brought their spouses, I'm not sure if they were enrolled or not in VA, sometimes spouses can get shots sometimes not. 
   - not sure how I would find that out on this page.
   
- Do you have any questions about what you saw today?
- Any questions for me?

### Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
Before we go, I just want to mention that what you saw today is something that the VA is considering building to help Veterans like yourself get more information about when a vaccine might be available, but it's not a way to sign up or reserve a spot to get a vaccine. The VA will be following CDC guidelines on how to roll out the vaccine. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is helpful to us as we continue to work on solutions to support Veterans’ needs. 


Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 

**If Yes:** Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.
Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
