# Key Findings

1. Overwhelmingly, Veterans consider the VA as a reputable source of information about coronavirus and covid-19 vaccines.
2. Safety, manufaturer information, and short and long term side effects are major concerns for Veterans, especially for those that have underlying diseases and allergies. Veterans want more information about recent studies, safety, and who should or shouldn't get the vaccine. These pieces of information are critical to their decision process, especially for those that felt the vaccine development process was rushed. 
3. MyHealtheVet is a universally used tool, and most Veterans expect announcements about coronavirus and covid-19 vaccines to come through MHV and other official VA channels.
4. For the Veterans that are cautious about receiving the vaccine, they defer to their doctor's expertise. Doctors could play an outsized role in educating Veterans about covid-19 vaccines, as Veterans trust their doctors to have their best interests in mind.
5. There's interest in learning more about the vaccines, even from Veterans that aren't interested in getting vaccines. Many cited wanting to be informed so they could help others make informed choices.
6. Veterans want more details on what facilities will have the vaccine, and what the timelines for distribution will be for those facilities. They are interested in the logistics, as they consider them a key part of the decision process to get the vaccine or not.
7. Veterans want to decide how they will get updates from the signup form, whether that's by phone, text, or email. 
8. Dignity and autonomy are important. Participants appreciate the balanced tone of the signup form and website information.

## Key Quotes:

- "I Don't have a good answer [on what would convince me to get the vaccine]. My and my friends are conspiracy theorists, so there's always something behind what the gov is involved [in]"	
- "It's [the website] well presented, allows you to get to where you need to go to fill out the form."				
- "I would [get the vaccine at] the VA, because I trust them and they take good care of me"
- "I trust the VA."	
- "Oh, you can sign up! Awesome. I like that. That tells me that when I sign up, I'll get information on when the vaccine is available, and that will help them to prepare to get more vaccines"	
- "It says they'll closely monitor everyone for reactions and side effects, that's good. I don't think regular doctors would be able to do that out in the public. There's a lot more civilians out there than Veterans. I just don't think they can monitor as well as the VA can."		
- "Despite how I feel about it, I think it's wise to be informed. Even if I feel like the vaccine may not be for me, but it may help others. If I can help others, give them information, so they can make their own information."
- "The only thing that I can think of is a start date, that's the only thing that I don't see. When will they start and a definitive list of VA facilities that will have it right away. If I wanted to get it, and they weren't doing it near me, where could I go to get it?"	
- "When I read stuff, hear stuff, a lot of it is experience, like the yellow fever shot, I knew what to expect because other soldiers had gotten it."	
- "The source is just as important as the information itself"	
- "I don't see the people excluded from this. I don't see what people shouldn't take this. People with certain illnesses. Nothing here says with my current conditions, if I couldn't get it"	
- "Email is good, but it'd be nice to get text messages. I like instant, simple, easy, accesible."	
- "I'm concerned about roll out, is there info on adverse effects? You get the vaccine, do you get less sick, not sick, asymptomatic transmission? All that is important to me"
- "I was unsure since it's unprecendented how fast the vaccine came through. But supposedly, based on FDA, CDC, Dr. Fauci, and seeing others getting the vaccines... I will get it but am thinking I will lay back for a few months to see if there are any adverse effects"	
- "What I'm unclear on is can my spouse get a VA vaccine? Is this just for Veterans or for anybody that can use the VA healthcare?"		
- "If it's [the vaccine] at the VA, I would expect some kind of notifcation. It should definitely be on the website. I'd expect a mass email" 
- "I've seen that Pfizer has had anaphalysis issues for those with severe allergies, so I definitely want to know which one I'm getting. I want to know what side effects are."	
- "Most Veterans see their primary care once a year or so, so I'd expect my doctor to ask me if I want it at an annual appointment like when they ask you about flu shots"	
- "I really like it, it answers questions, provides info in an easy to understand straightforward manner. It's direct, not confusing."	"I've already decided I'm getting it so that wouldn't convince me personally, but [having data on interest level that's published] could help convince other folks. Say 55% of Veterans want it, how can that data help others make better choices?"	
- "My bottom line, does it work on the first ones who get the shot and if so then everyone should go get it"	
- "Like any new vaccine, I have my doubts for a while. Once I see it's working well I'll jump out to get a shot."	
- "I can get my flu shot just about anywhere. I would expect that I could go somewhere to get a [covid] shot"	"How do vaccines work, that's over my head and I don't care. I believe that if you're a doctor and you tell me to get one, I believe you"		
- "Side effects are what I'm interested in learning, following the UK allergy reactions. I have rx allergies, and as an epipen carrier I'm concerned".
- "If it rolls out to my VAMC, there are 7 clinics around us. How will it be rolled out if the facilities aren't able to store the vaccines?"	
- "I would be a little concerned, because it's [the signup form] got all this info, but I guess this is from my MHV, so everything's already in there."			
- "I don't think would actively seek it out myself, but would expect my doctor to ask about it. If I were comfortable [getting the vaccine] at that time, I would get it then"	
- "I tend to check email frequently. When I get texts that aren't from friends or family I ignore them"	
- "My mind is pretty made up that I'm not going to get it right now, and I have a lot of other things on my mind than to research how they are going to distribute a vaccine I'm not going to get right away"	
- "I know there have been some adverse reactions and that not being listed here doesn't give the Veteran reading this site the ability to make an informed decision. It feels like they're minimizing any risks by not calling that out"		
- "I'm not surprised there's a limited amount initially, [it's] interesting that their goal is the most good for the most people. I imagine that would mean excluding some people. I don't know who exactly would be excluded. I'm guessing healthy younger people would be at the bottom of the list"	
- "I hope this is a good vaccine, there's definitely things the goverment has covered up."	
- "FAQ, I would click on all these pluses, would go down entire list."	
- "I'm guessing if you clicked continue without logging in, this is a way for them to get this data on you, maybe get more Veterans interested in getting healthcare and creating accounts."
- "I think it's good information, I think it's adequate to answer a lot of questions folks may have. It's not too technical, not over the top and going over people's heads."	
- "I would like to see clinics like they did with a flu shot, because everyone had access to it. We didn't have that extra step of going to doctor. Every extra step has more time to wait, more chances for mistakes. Streamline it and give it to us out in the parking lot."
- "I think it would take a lot of time to cycle everyone thru clinics unless there are special arrangements. I think there will be a big rush when things do open up. It might be months done the road."	
- "I don't know the logistics, but I'm sure not all the older Veterans have email. The whole logistics boggles my mind."	
- "I'd like to get a text or an email from the VA saying "here's where we stand, you may have heard", with locale specific information on rollout and how to get it."	"I've heard that the VA people will be guinea pigs, because the vaccine is unproven, so they are using the VA to see what happens. I don't think that, but I've heard that from others"	
- "Sometimes you hear things second hand and I like to go to the VA.gov to fact check information"	
- "Because I have a brain injury, I forget things, so secure messaging is easy for me because I can go back and track"	
- "I would trust the VA to at least have a ballpark figure [on rollout timeline]."	
- "The fact that you acknowledge we have a right to chose is important."

_Figure 2. Usability Results_


The website performed very well for most users. With a few exceptions, all participants were able to intuit that the sign up form would send them text or email updates about covid-19 vaccines at the VA, and that the purpose of the form was to gauge interest by location in order to help the VA prepare for vaccine distribution. No participants thought they were reserving a spot in line or signing up to get the vaccine itself. 

Some areas of trouble were:
- Some users were confused by having to click sign up for updates a second time after logging in. They expected to be brought directly to a form or similar page after selecting the auth path. 
- One user confused the sign in process with indicating interest in getting updates. They assumed the "continue without signing in" button meant a user would be saying they didn't want updates, and was therefore confused on why the subsequent form page was asking for signup information. 
- Only two participants understood that they could update their interest by resubmitting the form. Most participants expected to opt out or change interest through eBenefits, Gmail unsubscribe, or by sending their doctor a secure message through MHV.
- Participants appreciated the tone and content of the main hub, especially the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/#questions-you-may-have-about-c), but they wanted more information about safety, adverse and common side effects, whether studies were continuing after distribution started, and what to expect with logistics and the timeline of rollout to specific facilities.
- Participants wanted to be able to see what facilities near them would have the vaccine, but understood that the content of the site was in flux and likely to be updated as new information was released. 
- Some participants assumed the 6-12 months question related to zip codes meant the VA was operating on a 6-12 month roll out plan. Since timeline information is not available on the [main page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/), participants filled in that information themselves based on what they saw in the signup form. 
- Those in rural areas expressed concern about logistics, and would've liked to see more reassurance on how sensitive vaccine storage would interact with roll out plans for their area. 

## Recommendations

- Consider redirecting users directly to signup form after logging in
- Add additional information about safety, excluded populations, adverse reactions, and long term monitoring plans as that information is surfaced
- Consider adding context on anticipated roll out timeline, even if broad and subject to change
- Add vaccine status and availability to Facility Locator or to the main page (note, there is current work going on at VA Lighthouse API Program to add vaccine availability to the Facility Locator page, Lauryl is conducting UX on that project)
