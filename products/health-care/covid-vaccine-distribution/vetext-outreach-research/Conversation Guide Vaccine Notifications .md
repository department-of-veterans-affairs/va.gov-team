## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauren and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today I'd like to ask you some questions about scheduling COVID-19 vaccine appointments at VA. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be respectful of your time. 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record our audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
