# Research Plan for VEText COVID-19 Appt Self-Schedule
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	This is for the COVID-19 vaccine outreach via VEText. 

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

   VA is using several different ways to notify veterans about their eligibility for a COVID-19 vaccine appointment. One of those ways is direct scheduling via VEText. Deployed in late January, this option has been used to schedule over 30,000 appts as of 2/16/21; however, we are seeing a low response rate. We want to use this research as an opportunity to check in with Veterans who have not responded to learn how we can improve the notification process for vaccines and potentially increase comfort with using text messaging for appointments.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

   - Are the notifications that VA is using to reach out to Veterans about COVID-19 appointments effective? 
   - (How) can VA improve its text-based outreach to Veterans to increase response rate? 
   - What are current wins/pain points related to the Veterans' vaccine experience at VA? 

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

   - Veterans may not recall or know that they received a text message, or may not be aware that it is from VA. 
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Phone interviews with veterans

2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
   We want to keep it low fidelity and have a simple, guided discussion to learn about pain points. 
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	
   Online, via Zoom or GTM 
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
   N/a 
5.	If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
   Whatever is available 
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - We will provide a list of Veterans who we have reached out to about the vaccine via text message, who have not responded.


2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
Provide the list to Perigean to try to recruit. 

## When? 	
1. Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
   Evenings after 2/18-26 

2. Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
   n/a

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.
   30 minutes 

4. Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
   7-8 AM 
   6-9 PM EST 

5. Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	

   6/17
