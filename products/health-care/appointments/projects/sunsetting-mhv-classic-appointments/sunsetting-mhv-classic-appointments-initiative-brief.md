# Initiative Brief - Sunsetting My HealtheVet (MHV) Classic Appointments

## Overview

Sunsetting MHV Classic appointments and officially transitioning to MHV on VA.gov appointments.

---

## Outcome Summary

As a Veteran, I want to schedule, view, and modify my appointments on MHV on VA.gov instead of viewing them on MHV Classic.

**Related/Associated product(s)**
- MHV on VA.gov appointments
- MHV Classic appointments

## Problem
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
  - Veterans can view two MHV appointment lists on web. Veterans have reported confusion on seeing differences across the lists.
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
  - The complete transition to MHV on VA.gov isn't complete yet.
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - Improve user satisfaction

## Desired Outcomes
- Veterans use MHV on VA.gov for their appointment needs on web.
- If a Veteran accesses MHV Classic, they are redirected to MHV on VA.gov for their appointment needs.
- Veterans and staff are made aware of this changes before it occurs.

## Undesired Outcomes
- A user continues to have multiple appointments lists on web: one on MHV Classic and one on MHV on VA.gov

## Measuring Success

- Success will be measured by the increased number of veterans using MHV on VA.gov instead of MHV Classic
- Will look at these specific measurements:
  - Number of unique users of VAOS
  - Number of pageviews of appointment details page

## Discovery

### Relevant studies

### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Veterans might resist changing from MHV Classic to MHV on VA.gov
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Veterans transitioning to MHV on VA.gov might initially have some difficultly navigating across the new experience.
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Must work with our engineers to see what available data we can use to enhance the appointment details 
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - This initiative requires much coordination and communication across large groups of VA. Some audiences impacted are outlined in the [kickoff Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1722277428883/ac37491142f5bcb8bcc4ce98cdeae81de1cf95af?sender=u7c471a43344939c759cb1640).
