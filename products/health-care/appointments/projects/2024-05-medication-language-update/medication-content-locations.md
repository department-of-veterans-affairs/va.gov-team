# Medication Language Locations

All the touchpoints considered for the medication language to appear.

## Will display the language - already on team roadmaps

### Appointments Web (MHV on VA.gov)

How this content display on the details page for the following types of appointments/requests:

**Upcoming/confirmed**
Display on:
- VA In-person
- VA Video Care at Home
- VA Video Care at a VA location
- VA Video Care at an ATLAS location
- VA Phone

TBD:
- Community care (TBD, but assumed yes)
- Claim exam appointment (TBD, but assumed no)

**Past**
Do not display. There is no need to prepare for appointments in the past.

**Canceled**

Do not display. There is no need to prepare for appointments that have been canceled.

**VA Requests (pending or canceled)**

Do not display. Requests have not been scheduled yet, so there is no appt to prepare for.

**CC Requests (pending or canceled)**

Do not display. Requests have not been scheduled yet, so there is no appt to prepare for.

### Pre-check-in web

Display on the details page for:
- VA In-person appointments

Display on pre-check-in confirmation page.

### Mobile App Appointments

Same as Appointments Web (MHV on VA.gov)

## Will display the language - still need to be added to team roadmaps

### Email reminders

Will explore adding this to the updated appointment reminders that will be sent from VA Notify (which are migrating from MHV). Other emails may be part of a later phase. Next steps: talk to VA Notify team.

### MHV Classic

TBD, but likely to have a similar design and content to Appointments Web. Next step is to talk to Bresha Lipscomb to share the VA.gov content and evaluate addition to MHV Classic.

### VA Video Care
Need to work with VCC to determine how to update their existing emails and (other VVC locations?)

### My VA Health (Oracle Health)
TBD, but likely to have a similar design and content to Appointments Web. Need to talk to that team to share the VA.gov content and evaluate next steps.

## Will NOT display the language

### Check-in Experience

- Will not add this wording because the Veteran is onsite for their appointment and did their preparation already.

### Text reminders
- Text message reminders allow a Veteran to confirm that they will be attending their appointment. Once a Veteran confirms, they have the option to complete the pre-check-in experience. Since pre-check-in will have this wording, we won't add it to the appointment reminders text messages. Text messages also have a very short character limit and cost extra for additional messages. Next steps: talk to VeText to evaluate if there are some edge case scenarios to add this langauge to.
