## [Veteran Health Library wording](https://www.veteranshealthlibrary.va.gov/RelatedItems/3,40992)

```
What to bring to your healthcare provider visit
Suggestions of what to bring include:

- A list of your medicines. Include the doses and how often you take them. You can also bring all of your medicines in their original containers. Many times this makes it easier for you and more accurate for your provider. Be sure to bring nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, skin creams, eye drops, antacids, and vitamins. Include any diet or herbal supplements you are taking.

- A list of other providers you see

- Information about past health history, hospital stays, surgeries, and allergies

- A list of questions you have and anything you want to tell your provider

- A family member or friend to help you

- Copies of records and tests from other hospitals or providers 

- A pen and paper to take notes. You may also ask your provider if it is OK to record your visit.
