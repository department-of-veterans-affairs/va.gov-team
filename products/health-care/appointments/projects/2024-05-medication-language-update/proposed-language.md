# Medication Review - Proposed Language

The medication review language will appear on most (possibly all) scheduled appointments. It should be short, to the point,and easy to scan. Veterans will not need to read this content every time they open an appointment. It should be available as needed.

See [this CAIA ticket](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/appointments-fe-ux-5fff340c2d80a4000fb6f69c/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/82472) for the latest updates.

This language was reviewed by stakeholders and updated by our content team based on their feedback. We're currently waiting for their review/approval.

## Proposal 

[Heading] **What should I bring to my VA health care appointments?**

Always bring your insurance cards to health appointments.

Be ready to share a list of all the medications you're taking now, including the amount you take and when and how often you take them. Include these medication types:

- Prescriptions from VA and non-VA providers
- Over-the-counter medications
- Vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies

And be ready to share anything that might help your health care team work with you to make treatment decisions. Bring a list of these things:

- Any changes in the medications you're taking or how you're taking them
- Any problems, questions, or concerns you have with your medications
- Any allergies or reactions you've had to your current or past medications
- Any health care you're receiving from other VA facilities or from providers outside VA

You may need to take other steps to prepare for certain types of appointments, like video appointments. You can find these instructions in your appointment details.
