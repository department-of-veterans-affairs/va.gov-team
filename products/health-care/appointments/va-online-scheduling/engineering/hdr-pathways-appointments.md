From a 8/9/2019 email with Leidos contacts at HDR Pathways: "The SoapUI scripts can be used to query Appointments data from our SQA 1 Integration environment. The script contains test data that returns a meaningful testing scenario."

Scripts: [SQA1-HDR-VistA-soapui-project.xml](SQA1-HDR-VistA-soapui-project.xml)
