# Watch Officer / Watch Tower

To ensure the reliability of the Department of Veterans Affairs website (va.gov), two programs were established in response to concerns raised by Congress: the Watch Officer program and the Watch Tower program. 

The Watch Officer, representing the CTO, reviews va.gov alerts daily and requests more information or actions from relevant teams.
The daily process involves the watch officer reviewing alerts, checking for existing discussions, for appointments that would be in the [#appointment-alerts](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C016QB6T340) channel, searching for open issues on GitHub, and filing new issues requesting more details from teams as needed.

See the following video explaining the Watch Officer program: [Watch Officer program](https://dsva.slack.com/files/U0461SR18GK/F071YAQM6P4/recording-20240503_130126__1_.webm)

The Watch Officer will address high-priority alerts on the [Watch Tower Dashboard](https://ubiquitous-disco-woq2nem.pages.github.io/).
Alerts are prioritized from P1 (highest, respond ASAP) to P5 (informational). Teams should prioritize responses based on the priority level.
