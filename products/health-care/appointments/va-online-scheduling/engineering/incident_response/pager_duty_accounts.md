## PagerDuty Account Setup and Maintenance

To disable the VAOS application or display a warning message you need to have access to the DSVA instance of PagerDuty.  PagerDuty licenses are limited, so only VAOS team members who will be on-call for launches or responsible for disabling the application or displaying warning messages should have accounts.

### Requesting Changes to VAOS PagerDuty Accounts

1. Create a ticket in Github using this [link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=operations&labels=platform-sre&labels=ops-access-request&template=custom.md&title=VOAS%20PagerDuty%20Account%20Request)

          **labels**: *operations*, *platform-sre* and *ops-access-request*
