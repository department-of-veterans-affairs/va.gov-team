This is a WIP mapping from design prototype page to existing service endpoints. It does not currently include data requirements for the Community Care flows or direct scheduling by type of care.

Broken out by page (Design: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/WATIINRHZ3F)

- Data need to load the app overall
   - ICN or some kind of indication that person is a VA patient
      - `/users/v1/session/mhpuser`
   - Registered at at least one facility
      - `/users/v1/session/identifiers.json`
   - Right of access accepted flag
      - `/users/v1/session/mhpuser`
   - CC eligibility
      - `/adr/v2/patients/{patient-icn}/eligibility/communityCare`
   - Sites supporting VAR
      - Used to determine routing for initial new appointment page
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/facility-service/supported-facilities`
- https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/WATIINRHZ3F#/screens/379622427 (type of care)
   - List of registered medical systems (with City/State)
      - `/users/v1/session/identifiers.json`
   - Types of care available at each health system
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/direct-scheduling/institutions`
          - GAP: Currently the api is used to get the list of clinics in a system that have a type of care
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/clinical-services/types-of-care`
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/community-care-services/type-of-cares` 
- https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/WATIINRHZ3F#/screens/379622428 (pact)
   - PACT team
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/direct-scheduling/site/{site-code}/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/pact-team`
- https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/WATIINRHZ3F#/screens/379622433 (Request details)
   - Clinic address, purpose, type, preferred dates, office number, contact number, call back time
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/appointment-service/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/appointments`
- https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/WATIINRHZ3F#/screens/379622447 (provider choice)
   - List of providers across facilities
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/direct-scheduling/site/{site-code}/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/pact-team`
   - GAP: What about other, non-PACT, providers? How do we schedule against them directly? Is this the same as scheduling a clinic? The data we have isn't clearly associated with a clinic
- https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/WATIINRHZ3F#/screens/379622470 (calendar page)
   - Clinics supporting direct scheduling
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/clinical-services/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/clinics`
      - This is probably a missing page, to pick one if necessary
   - Appointment slots
      - `VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/direct-scheduling/site/{site-code}/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/available-appointment-slots`
- https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/WATIINRHZ3F#/screens/379622475 (Appt details)
   - Doctor name, specialization
   - Address, date and time, purpose, type, contact info
      - `/appointments/v1/patients/{patient-id}/appointments`
   - GAP: Don't see appt type, reason, doctor, specialization, or contact info in service
- https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/WATIINRHZ3F#/screens/379622432 (pending appt list)
   - List of pending appointments
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/appointment-service/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/appointments`
   - Community care requests are included in appointment request service
- https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/WATIINRHZ3F#/screens/379622474 (confirmed appointments list)
   - List of confirmed appointments
      - `/appointments/v1/patients/{patient-id}/appointments`
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/direct-scheduling/site/{site-code}/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/booked-appointments` (unused because telehealth is enabled?)
   - Community care appointments are a separate endpoint, combined on front end
     - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/direct-scheduling/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/booked-cc-appointments`
- Other data-related GAPs
   - Appointments are scheduled into clinics, but clinics are not shown in any flow. How do we deal with this?
   - Clinics have request limits, where are those enforced?
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/direct-scheduling/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/request-limit`
      - `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/direct-scheduling/site/{site-code}/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/{eligibility}/visited-in-past-months`
   - Does custom text exist in the new designs?
      - No
   - Do we need the facility timezones? How exactly is that used (hard to tell from code)?
