# Determining the necessity of the PACT member check

We've done some discovery around whether or not the PACT member service call is necessary in the VAOS redesign. Based on our research, we believe that it isn't, but we can't know for sure without full access to CDW and PCMM and a thorough understanding of the PCMM to CDW import process.

## Technical Details

Our technical discovery is documented in [PACT Service Discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/engineering/discovery/pact_service_discovery.md).

## Possible Solutions and Temporary Workarounds

- We could simply remove this call and wait for issues to flow back to us from schedulers and/or sites.

## Ideal and Viable Solutions.

Ideally, we can use a metrics based approach to determine if the call is necessary. If the call is no longer causing UI responsiveness issues, then we can leave it in place to match the functionality of legacy VAOS and follow these steps:

1. Look for any instances of the analytics event that is dispatched when the PACT check fails (event name TBD)
2. If any instances of that event are found, we can add a Sentry message that dispatches when the PACT check fails and the clinics check succeeds, and include the PACT in this state in the event data
3. If any instances of the new event occur, we can investigate the PACT causing this problem and determine if its bad data or an expected use case
4. Once we're satisfied that this situation is not occuring or the occurences are minimal and due to data errors, we can decide to remove the PACT call.

## Final Decision

TBD
