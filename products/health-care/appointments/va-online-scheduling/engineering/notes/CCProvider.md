# Community Care Provider Brain Dump

## Source of data

The source of the data comes from PPMS. The API for querying PPMS supports geo-location, search radius, and type of care (specialty code) filtering, all of which are needed to build the type of UI we feel is most suitable for veterans to select their provider based on proximity and medical needs.

## Problems with the data and apis

1. The taxonomy that PPMS uses for "specialty codes" is different than the taxonomy than that which VAOS uses. It is far more granular than the type of care codes we commonly use across the rest of VAOS.
2. While PPMS does have slightly more generic specialty codes, commonly referred to as "rollup specialty codes," there are about 245 of these more generic specialty codes. Furthmore, not all 6 million records necessarily have a roll-up specialty code associated with them.
3. The PPMS API is limited in allowing you to only query by 4 specialty codes at a time. This is a problem since the VAOS notion of type of care is far more generic than the types of care that PPMS has (even their rollup which as alluded before is not associated with all providers).
4. While we can access the PPMS data from the Facilities API and we can query for PPMS specialty codes directly, the geo-location attributes we include need to be submitted as a bounding box that is calculated by the FE. This is not a huge problem, but ideally we would be able to just provide a Lat/Long and not have to do this added step since the PPMS API also supports receiving just Lat/Long and is actually more performant in this manner.

Of these problems, the main problem is around Taxonomy Mappings, and the next few sections will attempt to capture problem in more detail.

### "Type of Care" taxonomies across the VA 

There are many different "Type of Care" classifications or taxonomies across the VA. A few of the most relevant ones are referenced below:

|           Taxonomy          |    Count    | Reference Documentation | Additional Notes |
|:---------------------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------------:|:----------------:|

| HSRM                        | unknown     |                         |                  |

VAOS currently supports 6 CC types of care.

1. Primary Care
2. Audiology - Routine hearing exam
3. Audiology - Hearing aid support
4. Nutrition
5. Podiatry
6. Optometry

The Light house facility API supports 14 and maps to 5 of these 6 types uniquely. The two Audiology type of care, are captured by the same type of care on Facilities API. That being said, the Facilities API does support querying by PPMS specialty code, so we do not need to map from 6 VAOS Types of care to 5 Facilities API Types of care before we get to the 245+ PPMS Specialty Codes. We can instead map our 6 Types of Care directly to the relevant Specialty Codes and still use the Facilities API.

An example query currently might look like this:
`https://api.va.gov/v1/facilities/ccp?address=1901%20Kelly%20Lane,%20Pflugerville,%20Texas%2078660,%20United%20States&bbox[]=-98.34&bbox[]=29.72&bbox[]=-96.84&bbox[]=31.22&type=provider&specialties[]=213E00000X&page=1&per_page=10&trim=true`

Where specialties is an array of up to 4 specialty codes. 

###  Examining PPMS Specialty Codes more closely

I've taken the liberty of sorting the PPMS specialty codes according to the prefix of the ID which correseponds to a distinct classification of sub-specialties. In most cases, the first row is actually considered a generic sub specialty which could be associated with some but not all facilities in the 6 million records PPMS has in its database. It's necessary to search through this sorted list for various keywords to identify potential target specialty codes for mapping taxonomies.

For example, in the case of Primary Care we could search for the word "Primary" or "General" or in the case of Audiology we might want to look at "Audio", "Hear", "Speech" to help identify a set of PPMS specialty codes we might want for our taxonomy mapping.

The data for specialties is fetched via the Facilities API. Then using a ruby script, I've sorted and grouped the results according to the first 4 of the id. The script is available here: [PPMS Rollup Specialties Ruby Script](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/engineering/notes/PPMS/ppms_rollup_specialties.rb). And the results are available here: [PPMS Specialties Grouped](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/engineering/notes/PPMS/20201111_ppms_specialties.csv). A summary of these is broken out below. Please note, the searching for keywords is just for example purposes only. The ideal mapping is something we hope to discover through further research with schedulers, physicians, and analytics and some of that is already underway or scheduled for the weeks ahead.

#### Audiology

Lighthouses Facility API only supports one categorization for both of the VAOS Audiology types when searching with Service Type. However they also expose the ability to provide Specialty Code for querying PPMS. We can therefore map these two to our own taxonomy as deemed most relevant. 

1. Audiology - Routine hearing exam
2. Audiology - Hearing aid support

### Challenge of mapping taxonomies

We want to identify a set of 4 specialty codes for each of the above categorizations. Some of the research being conducted in the weeks ahead with schedulers and veterans alike, as well physicians and stakeholders should shed some light on the ideal set of specialty codes we will use. In the meantime good judgment by selecting 4 of the more general specialty codes from each category should provide us a starting point for future iteration.

An example of a more general specialty code is any code ending in 0000X.

### Iteration

1. The Facilities API currently only supports BBOX querying. We will want to work with Lance, Michelle, and Dave Conlon to see if they could support querying via Lat/Long in lieu of this BBOX. It's not a tremendous burden currently, but ultimately it will make querying PPMS more performant to make this improvement.

2. Through a combination of user research and data analytics facilitated by logging data and google analytics, we hope to learn more about the type of results returned based on veteran interaction. This data will prove useful in tuning our taxonomy mappings as well as determining optimal radii for the PPMS query to use for a variety of locations. For example, you might need to expand your search radius when you are in a less metropolitan area.

### Short Term Strategy

The short term strategy is to use the Facilities API in its current V1 state and to determine the ideal 4 codes we would want to query with respect to our 6 CC Types of Care.

Outstanding Questions:

1. Of the 6 Million records, how many of the PPMS Providers have a Rollup Specialty Code associated with them (Possible Forum Item for PPMS Weekly Call).
2. Based on #1 what is an ideal taxonomy of our 6 Types to the 245+ PPMS Specialty Codes. Is there a physician or stakeholder who needs to weigh in on this decision as it seems like a business decision more than a product decision.

### Medium Term Strategy

1. Work with Facilities Team to support Lat/Long querying.
2. Work with Facilities Team and stakeholders to share data and research in fine tuning our radii and taxonomies.
3. Work with PPMS Teams to share findings and research so they too can improve.

### Long Term Strategy

Long term it seems like it would make a great deal of sense for to be a concept of Type of Care shared comprehensively across the VA. There are a number of different things converging and ultimately they will all face this same challenge. 

1. VAOS
2. Cerner
3. HSRM
4. VISTA and CDW
5. PPMS

During PI Planning, Dr. Greenstone mentioned that PPMS has been providing Cerner a data dump of their 6 million records. Is Cerner building a service around this data they plan on exposing? Is this simply to aid in their efforts of mapping taxonomies? I would like for us to learn more about this. Furthermore, if we could get a similar data dump from PPMS perhaps we could stand up a service that consolidates the various of concepts of taxonomy and build a data structure that is more performant than what we have available today.

### Summary
