# Mobile Application System Design Document (SDD)

The System Design Document (SDD) is a dual-use document that provides the conceptual design as well as the as-built design. This document will be updated as the product is built, to reflect the as-built product.

### Application Classification

| Mobile Application Classification (Only one box may be checked) | Mark with X |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1 - Very Low: Mobile Application does not use VA Resource | |
| 2 - Low: Read only access to VA Resources (No PII / PHI) | |
| 3 - Medium: Write access to VA Resources | |
| 4 - High: Read and/or Write access of sensitive data to VA Resources (include PII/PHI) | X |

### Supported Devices:

The new redesign is a web only interface, there is no native application component. It should be accessible across all smart devices that have a web client.

### Design Principles and Patterns
Coming Soon

### Conceptual Perspective

The combination of the new veteran facing application on VA.gov and the API wrapper that it interfaces are the only two changes to the existing SDD. The API wrapper interfaces with VAMF services in precisely the same way that VAR Web does today. The wrapper ensures that ICN, EDIPI, patient IDs, and other PII are not exposed to VA.gov FE.  The API wrapper receives a JWT token from UserService, thereby enabling it invoke other service calls within the API Gateway. The API wrapper maintains a short lived cache of the JWT token for future requests it needs to make during the duration of the users session and interactions withing the veteran facing tool. The details of this authentication flow are available here in [Authentication Flow](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/engineering/authentication_flow.md)

The veteran facing application on VA.gov does not interface with any VAMF services directly, all interactions are facilitated through the VA.gov BE API Wrapper (the client). This is the only significant change from an architectural standpoint from how service calls would be made on VAR Web today.

### Common Concepts

1. Feature Toggles - Features can be disabled / enabled based on user email, environment, and other conditions.
1. Circuit Breakers - Timeouts and Failed Requests are closely monitored, and can trigger a circuit break, which will limit outbound requests until the service becomes available again.
1. StatsD Metrics - Realtime metrics for any type of data can be added.
1. Rails Logs - Can add logs at any point in execution
1. Grafana - Can create custom graphs to monitor statsd and other metrics
1. Prometheus - Can view statsd and other metrics in realtime
1. Cloudwatch - Can view and query logs in aggregate
1. Sentry - Detailed realtime error reporting
1. Google Analytics - FE analytics

### Logical Perspective

### User Service

No Routes are exposed to user service. This is handled entirely by the va.gov backend and does not expose user service JWT to the veteran facing application.

### Appointments Service

#### Collection Actions
All appointment collections including VA, CC, and Booked are facilitated by a single controller. More notably they are facilitated by a single controller action.

| Method | Route | VAOS Route | Description | Swagger |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/v0/vaos/appointments?type=va` | `/appointments/v1/patients/{patient-id}/appointments` | Lists confirmed VA appointments | Coming Soon |
| GET | `/v0/vaos/appointments?type=cc` | `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/direct-scheduling/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/booked-cc-appointments` | Lists community care appointments | Coming Soon |
| GET | `/v0/vaos/appointments?type=booked` | `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/direct-scheduling/site/{site-code}/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/booked-appointments` | Lists booked appointments | Coming Soon |

Supported Params: `type`, `start_date`, `end_date`
Required Params: `type`, `start_date`, `end_date`

### Messaging Service
Messaging is facilitated through a distinct controller nested as a resource under its parent request.

#### Collection Actions

| Method | Route | VAOS Route | Description | Swagger |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------|---------|
| GET | `/v0/vaos/appointment_requests/{id}/messages` | `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/appointment-service/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/appointments/system/var/id/{requestId}/messages` | List messages associated with a request | Coming Soon |
| POST | `/v0/vaos/appointment_requests/{id}/messages` | `/VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/appointment-service/patient/{assigning-authority}/{patient-id}/appointments/system/var/id/{requestId}/messages` | Send a message for the request | Coming Soon |

#### Member Actions
Messaging does not have any member actions.

### Scheduling Preferences


### VA Scheduling Eligibility
Various controllers and nested controller that return collections of "constants" to determine when and where a veteran can schedule appointments

#### Collection Actions

#### Member Actions
There are no member actions

### Community Care Scheduling Eligibility
| Method | Route | VAOS Route | Description | Swagger |

| GET | `/v0/vaos/community_care/supported_sites` | ` /VeteranAppointmentRequestService/v4/rest/facility-service/supported-facilities` | Lists VA parent facilities that are CC enabled | Coming Soon |

Since the first action above is not really returning a collection, perhaps it should be part of systems or an attribute of the user?
