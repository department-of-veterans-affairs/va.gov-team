# External Referral Appointment Scheduling System

## Goals
1. Streamline the process of scheduling external referral appointments for veterans
2. Reduce manual intervention in the referral and appointment scheduling process
3. Improve veteran experience by providing easy access to referral information and appointment scheduling
4. Ensure data security and privacy throughout the referral and appointment process
5. Integrate with existing VA systems (MAP, EPS, Vista) to provide a seamless experience

## Overview
The External Referral Appointment Scheduling System is designed to automate and simplify the process of managing external referrals and scheduling appointments for veterans.  The system integrates with VA Notify for communications and EPS for appointment management.

## Scope
- Integration with VA Notify for sending referral notifications to veterans
- Development of a frontend interface for veterans to view referrals and schedule appointments
- Integration with the External Provider Services (EPS) system for appointment management
- Integration with the CCRA (VA referrals and other info) via the MAP services as a pass through service
- Ensuring compliance with VA accessibility standards

## Assumptions
1. Referral data through MAP services which references CCRA (which is built within HSRM, a 3rd party cloud system)
2. Veterans have access to either SMS or email for receiving notifications
3. The EPS system is available and can be integrated for appointment scheduling
4. Staff members will continue to manually synchronize appointment data between EPS and Vista systems
5. The system will operate within the VA's existing authentication framework

## Design Decisions
1. Utilization of Redux for state management in the frontend
2. Integration with VA Notify for sending notifications to veterans
3. Use of the existing vets-api encryption library for securing referral data
4. Implementation of a two-tier approach for referral data retention
5. Daily checks for appointment synchronization between EPS and Vista

## Key Processes

### User Workflow
1. User receives SMS/Email with referral link and clicks it.
2. User is directed to login and authenticate.
3. After authentication, user is redirected to the referral page.
4. Frontend retrieves referral data from Vets API and stores it in Redux.
5. If an appointment exists that matches a referral number of the referral coming in, reject the apppointment, as we are ONLY booking first referral appointments
6. Frontend checks for EPS appointments and combines them with existing appointments in Redux for the list.
7. Clicking into the scheduling process shows referral information
8. After the user verifies this information, they may go to the slots of the provider available (slots are date/time unique points that a user can book an appointment in)
9. After choosing a slot, the user sees a final verification page
10. Clicking confirm, will book the appointment in CCRA, and send the user a notification (there are some async processes here in the EPS system and the airgap to the CCRA system)

## Resources

Since we already have 'Appointment' resource under VAOS (VA Online Scheduling) service, we're going to use that resource. We have discussed this with the VAOS backend engineering team and they are in agreement with this approach. This avoids any confusion for the Appointment resource and object. However the downside is that we're going to have to add logic to retrieve the appointments from EPS and dedupe those within the existing appointments service code, which is going to add complexity and latency for existing consumers.

'Referral' and 'Provider' are going to be a new resources. Endpoints are:

## Removing duplicates and preventing duplicates of referrals
- A duplicate referral refers to a referral that has already been entered into our system. The incoming referral ID will match an existing referral ID in our postgress DB. This is likely a referral that hasn't been scheduled into an appointment yet. See blow for existing appointment
- An existing appointment refers to an appointment that has been made with a referral ID, that referral ID matches to a "new" referral, which means it was already made. We can also possibly hold referrals in our DB and mark them as "completed" or "referral made" in the same manner, after the user has completed making an appointment with a referral
- Expired referrals are referrals whose end date has expired, regardless of if an appointment exists or not

## Submit Asynchronous Process
1. When confirming and submitting the final appointment, the async process will be dual
2. The FE will submit the appointment and if successful poll the /appointments/{appointmentId} endpoint until a valid response or failure returns (up to 30 to 60 seconds)
3. The BE will poll the same endpoint, but send a notification via VA Notify the user on success or failure

## Integration Points
1. CCRA: Source of referral data
2. VA Notify: For sending notifications to veterans
3. EPS (External Provider Services): For appointment management

## Performance Considerations
- Drive time seems to take a long time to retrieve results
- Async process in the confirmation

## Accessibility
- The frontend interface will comply with existing VA accessibility standards.
- No additional accessibility requirements specific to this project.

## Open Questions and Future Considerations
1. Need to get what will be referred to as the providerID for the EPS system that matches to what's in the CCRA object. Refer to EPS document/yaml/json for the call `provider-services/{providerServiceId}`
2. Get user data from full auth user object in vets-api to get address and phone and email
