# Feature Brief - Clarify Requests

## Overview

An appointment request is user-initiated intent for an appointment sent to a provider. In VAOS, users can submit a request for an appointment at a VA facility or to a provider in the community (if eligible for Community Care). A staff member is required to complete the booking of the requested appointment. The requested appointments that are pending staff response are available to view and cancel in VAOS.

## Problem

We have heard in user research and user feedback (submitted through feedback tools and through business stakeholders) that requests are confusing.

### Scope

There are multiple points that may contribute to this confusion. The scope of improvements that can be implemented in VAOS include:
- nomenclature used throughout the app
- appointments lists
- appointments details
- request scheduling flow

## Discovery

In order to surface more specific areas of opportunity, we conducted user research with two hypotheses: one for scheduling, one for appointment details
