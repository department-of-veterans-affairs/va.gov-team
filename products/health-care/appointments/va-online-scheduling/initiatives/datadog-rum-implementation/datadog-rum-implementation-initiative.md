## Measuring Success

- Success will be measured by the increased number of veterans using VAOS instead of MHV
- Will look at these specific measurements:
  - Number of unique users of VAOS

  - No increase in average response time of appointment list page
  - Decrease in the number of errors when fetching appointment data (desired)
