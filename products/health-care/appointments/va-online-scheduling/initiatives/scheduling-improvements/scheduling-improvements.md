### Feasibility meeting notes

- **Irrelevant locations**: Kay asked, will the list of relevant locations include CC? Yes, if they are eligible. List can be based on drive time to nearest VA from address on file. We should explore what personalization might look like 
- **Surfacing Availability:** We might be able to see more available options in the future such as phone or video appointments. - Oracle Health Scheduling: Non-negotiable: PID. Kay asked how can we get more care types added and then when they are added how do we handle the Veteran navigating a really long list of care types? We should explore chat options for scheduling
- **Direct scheduling for Community Care:** How can we make referrals part of the scheduling process. We will need to work with IVC to understand what is already being done for CC scheduling.
- **Prioritization:** #1 OH #2 Irrelevant locations and or CC. #3 Availability
