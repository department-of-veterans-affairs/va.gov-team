- **Irrelevant locations**: Kay asked, will the list of relevant locations include CC? Yes, if they are eligible. List can be based on drive time to nearest VA from address on file. We should explore what personalization might look like 
- **Surfacing Availability:** We might be able to see more available options in the future such as phone or video appointments. - Oracle Health Scheduling: Non-negotiable: PID. Kay asked how can we get more care types added and then when they are added how do we handle the Veteran navigating a really long list of care types? We should explore chat options for scheduling
- **Direct scheduling for Community Care:** How can we make referrals part of the scheduling process. We will need to work with IVC to understand what is already being done for CC scheduling.
- **Prioritization:** #1 OH #2 Irrelevant locations and or CC. #3 Availability

### CES Metting notes

<details>
<summary>February 22, 2024</summary>

In regards to our CES call today about Community Care appointments in Oracle Health, per Anthony Pilozzi, they are sending appointments recorded ini HSRM back to Cerner (aka Oracle Health). If we can distinguish Community Care appointments from VA appointments in Oracle Health we could just filter out those appointments so they aren't displayed to the Veteran.bility

### Oracle Health Integration in Appointments on va.gov transactional features

I. **Cancelation Reason**
   - VHA has paired down the cancelation reasons down, so now it is only 5 or so. It is restricted in revenue cycle. 
   - Tia A will share list. 
   - Do we need any logic around what is cancellable? Match VAOS today or just the Mental Health flag? Brad C
   - What is the meaning of cancelation data? For staff? For veterans? (Brad C)
   - We want to prevent veterans from canceling in certain situations for example mental health.
   - We want to be consistent and standard across facilities (Tia)
   - Cerner publishes these rules in their FHIR documentation. 
   - In OH, multiple resources are tied to one appointment. For example for surgery, imaging machines etc. You may have to cancel each resource (Tia)
   - Is there an exclusion list for cancelable appointments?
   - There is not a list of the non-cancelable but there is a list of types that have to offer direct schedule. (Tia)
   - Anything that is not listed in the TOC list, those are VAOS required. 
   - (Anything that is list is also cancelable) (Tia)
   - We can put together an exclusion list of appointments we do not want the Veterans can cancel. 

II. **VAOS Configuration**
   - The facility has the ability to disable direct scheduling etc. Do you see it being possible to come up with a policy on a high level to implement on the VistA side? (Brad C)
   - Yes- that would be the idea. It would require us to force the hand of the facilities. Limit what facilities can enable/ disable. (Tia)
   - Anyone with the supervisor key at a facility can change the configuration in VATS. I think it should be IVC’s direction to say who is allowed to do this and what the policy should be. (Brad C)
   - Sites were concerned about their inability to manage patients who already have appointments, ensuring that patients are not inadvertently requesting additional appointments for the same issue they are already scheduled for. (Tia)
   - Want to be able to open up access to patients to direct schedule but then they can schedule with anyone maybe even someone on the other side of the country. 
   - Not going to have requests with OH because they might be able to request a time at 4:30 when it is 4:26 and the staff will miss that. 
   - We would like to start creating a list of policies and checks. (Brad C )

III. **Current Scheduling Capabilities**
   - What can they schedule today? (Jeff)
   - For Self scheduling: Face to face and telephone (Tia)

IV. **Baseline Requirements and Ideal SOP**
   - What are the baseline requirements and the nice to have? (Brad C)
   - If we could follow the VAOS SOP that would be ideal. 

V. **Message Center and Location Selection**
   - It is not ideal for patients to request appointments in message center in OH (Tia) 
   - There are advantages to picking location first and is something we are looking into on the VAOS side. (Jeff)

VI. **Patient Appointment Restrictions**
   - We want to restrict patients from being able to schedule an appointment with someone they have never been seen before. We do not want them to be able to see options that they should not been seen at like across the country on OH

Scheduling Configuration:
- Each facility has its own configuration for scheduling policies for various types of care.
- Supervisors at facilities can make changes to scheduling options.
- Policies can be set regarding the number of open appointment requests a veteran can have at a given time.
- Direct booking and appointment requests can be enabled or disabled based on criteria like “encounter” time frame.
 
Cancellations:
- Tia is going to chat with program offices to determine the national standard for cancellations.
- The current system allows for cancellations, but there's a need to consider which types of appointments should be cancellable.
- The policy around cancellations needs to be looked at.
- Brad- selectively adding overrides and changing policies for appointments outside standard care types.
- We need to look into how to manage cancellations based on medical service or appointment type in Oracle Health. 

Patient status:
- Brad- there are implications determining patient status (new or established) for specific services like amputation.
- TIA - patient status shouldn't restrict scheduling for certain services.

Appointment Display in Portal:
- Melissa- the display of appointment details in the portal, specifically regarding provider names or the “with” category might be confusing.  
- Brad - need to ensure accurate and user-friendly display of appointment details even if it is based on resources, including providers, rooms, or equipment.

Patient friendly names:
- Tia- we need to standardize patient facing naming conventions.
