# VAOS Homepage Refresh Release Plan (WIP)

---

## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

n/a - UAT to be conducted after additional initiatives using refresh 

## Phase II: Staged Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)

### Planning

- Desired date range:
  - Mon, 6/28/21 - Mon, 7/12/21
- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it:
  - VA.gov feature flag `va_online_scheduling_homepage_refresh`
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?:
  - Appointment-related errors
- Links to dashboard(s) showing "success criteria" metrics:
  - [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/dashboard/1iZBzQ5ITaG9AdBCy6rLeg/a50123418w177519031p176188361/)


### Stage A: Canary

_Test a small population of users to make sure any obvious bugs / edge cases are caught._

#### Planning

- Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): 1% (~1,400 users)

#### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- What UX changes (if any) are necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?

### Stage B: moderate

_Test a larger population of users to make sure there are no issues exposed by larger usage patterns._

#### Planning

- Length of time: x (_minimum 1 day_)
- Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): 25% (x users)

#### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
