# VAOS Service Integration - Release Plan

Work for the vaos service integration is broken up into 4 toggles:
- Community Care appointments (va_online_scheduling_vaos_service_cc_appointments)
- Facilities (va_online_scheduling_facilities_service_v2)
- Request-related services (va_online_scheduling_vaos_service_requests)
- VA VistA-based appointments (va_online_scheduling_vaos_service_va_appointments)

For this launch, the staged rollout of each toggle will happen consecutively (not concurrently).

1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
