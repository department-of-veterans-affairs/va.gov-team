# Initiative Brief - Appointment Details Improvements

## Overview

Looking to improve the user experience in VAOS by updating the appointment details page to help the veterans view their appointment information. 
The goal is to have the Veteran easily read their healthcare appointments online. 

 
---

## Outcome Summary

A user can view their appointments details (upcoming, pending, canceled or past) without any confusion and provide value information to the Veteran.

**Related/Associated product(s)**
- None

## Problem
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
  - Majority of the Veterans use the MyHealtheVet appointment details to help manage and understand their appointments and as more Veterans move to VAOS to do the same tasks, they may see a discrency between to the two details. 
  - The user may be confused with viewing their appointment details in two separate applications and having to do two separate logins. 
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
  - Current functionality
  - Anecdotal feedback from stakeholders and Veterans
  - Qualitative feedback from surveys
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - Improve user satisfaction
  - Meet user expectations of available online transactions

## Desired Outcomes
- Provide clear information that answers basic questions about appointments in the details view
- Seamless navigation experience from MHV (MyHealtheVet) to VAOS
- Veterans are able to find all the same appointment information in VAOS as currently available in MHV

## Undesired Outcomes
- A user does not have clear information about their appointment details

## Changes

Restructure layout and cleaned up language to make it easier to scan for information. Also helps align designs between Appointments and Check-in.

Clarify button and links to improve accessibility.

Include more appointment data:
- Add sections for _type of care_ and _provider_ information so we can show that data in a consistent location when we have it.
- Add modality and how to attend to all appointment types
- Change main phone number to clinic phone number when it's available for all appointments.
- Add clinic location to all VA appointments that the Veteran attends in person.

Merge appointment types that were the same to reduce complexity:
- GFE and Video appointments.
- COVID Vaccine and In-person appointments.

Add a link to view after visit summary.

Add a link to verify health care contacts.

Reduce alert noise on past appointments.

Add link to `Schedule new appointment` to all canceled appointments.


## Key Decisions
- It is preferred that VAOS provides the same value and information of the appointment list similiar to MHV application
- Use of icons to differentiate the different types of care is preferrable, based on user research

---
## Measuring Success

- Success will be measured by the increased number of veterans using VAOS instead of MHV
- Will look at these specific measurements:
  - Number of unique users of VAOS
  - Number of pageviews of appointment details page
  - No increase in average response time of appointment details page
  - Decrease in the number of errors when fetching appointment data (desired)

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Key Result | Baseline | Target | Link to data source (e.g. GA, Domo)

### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - The experience may vary based on the data we have for the appointment type
  - If user is unable to find any value in VAOS, they may lose trust in the application and are less likely to return
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - We will have to balance between showing the right amount of information in the appointment list 
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Must work with our engineers to see what available data we can use to enhance the appointment details 
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements 

### Prioritization
1. Provide clear and value information in the appointment details

### Solution Summary
- Date and time change only

## Launch Planning
### Collaboration Cycle
> ðŸ’¡ *Use for any Collab Cycle tracking, questions.*

- Kickoff ticket

### Go-to-market 
> *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful? Which groups/orgs are necessary to make this happen?*
1. Launch of the updated appointment details view will be marketed as an enhancement and will be part of a re-launch campaign for VAOS.
* Re-launch and new appointment details will be marketed through veteran focused electronic newsletters, especially those related to health care.
* Specific newsletters need to be identified and timelines for publication coordinated with launch plans

2. VAOS team investigating the use of an online, one time notice that would appear to veterans when navigating to VAOS landing page
* Notice would be a small indicator that something is new on the site.
* Clicking on the notice would provide more details about the change to the appointment list view.
* The online notification would lose focus after a veteran has clicked on it.  This includes subsequent sessions.
* Online notification would only be visible for a configurable date range.
* VAOS team to investigate feasibility of such a feature with the platform support team.

3. VA and CC scheduling personnel will need to be informed of the appointment view update and provided a demonstration.

4. VAOS product guide will need to be updated to include new screen shots of the updated appointment list view

5. Call Center will need to be informed of change to appointment list view
