# Initiative Brief - Update API domain 
## Overview

 
---

## Outcome Summary


**Related/Associated product(s)**
- Dependent on [VAOS service launch](.md) rollout 

## Problem
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?

  - The Cloud Isolaation team is making this change on their end which will impact the VAOS application. 

* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
  - The problem is not occuring at the moment. If the VAOS team does not make any changes and if the updated domain names are in production, then VAOS application will not work properly. 
  
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?

  - The initiative will help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals because the VAOS code will be aligned to the VA.gov platform.

## Launch Planning
### Collaboration Cycle
> ðŸ’¡ *Use for any Collab Cycle tracking, questions.*

- Kickoff ticket

### Go-to-market 
> *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful? Which groups/orgs are necessary to make this happen?*
1. Launch of the updated appointment list view will be marketed as an enhancement and will be part of a re-launch campaign for VAOS.
* Re-launch and new appointment list will be marketed through veteran focused electronic newsletters, especially those related to health care.
* Specific newsletters need to be identified and timelines for publication coordinated with launch plans

2. VAOS team investigating the use of an online, one time notice that would appear to veterans when navigating to VAOS landing page
* Notice would be a small indicator that something is new on the site.
* Clicking on the notice would provide more details about the change to the appointment list view.
* The online notification would lose focus after a veteran has clicked on it.  This includes subsequent sessions.
* Online notification would only be visible for a configurable date range.
* VAOS team to investigate feasibility of such a feature with the platform support team.

3. VA and CC scheduling personnel will need to be informed of the appointment view update and provided a demonstration.

4. VAOS product guide will need to be updated to include new screen shots of the updated appointment list view

5. Call Center will need to be informed of change to appointment list view
