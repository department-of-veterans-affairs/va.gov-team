# Feature Brief - Community Care and Request Appointment Flow 

## Overview

In VAOS, a Veteran can submit a request for an appointment at a VA facility or Community Care provider (if eligible) in the event they cannot directly schedule an appointment. 

## Problem

We have heard from Veterans based on user research and user feedback (submitted through Medallia) that the request flow is confusing. The user may feel that they are booking an appointment but at the end state they only have submitted a request for an appointment. VAOS team is looking for guidance on how the content for the Request/Community Care flow should be in the application that will help the Veteran understand whether they are in the direct scheduling or request for an appointment workflow.  


### Scope

The VAOS team is looking to improve the following flows: 
- When a Veteran clicks on Starts Scheduling and they are routed to the request flow (since the facility is not configured for direct scheduling). 
- When a Veteran clicks on Start Scheduling and selects a Type of Care that is eligible for Community Care, then they are directed to the request flow for an appointment.
