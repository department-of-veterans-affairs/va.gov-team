# Initiative Brief - Vaccine Workflow Update 
## Overview
VAOS team is looking to improve the user experience when scheduling a COVID-19 appointment in VAOS application. The goal is to have the Veteran have the capability to book a COVID-19 appointment regardless if it is their first, second, or booster shot. We also would like to update the vaccine list available for the Veteran (for ex: Novavax).

## Outcome Summary


**Related/Associated product(s)**
- Dependent on [VAOS service launch](.md) rollout 

## Problem
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
The VAOS application currently supports the Veteran scheduling their first vaccine appointment in VAOS. 
  
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
When the application was built during the peak of the pandemic, we did not have any information on how the VA will support future dose appointments online.  
  
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - It will allow Veterans to schedule additional COVID-19 appointments and will reduce the number of Veterans calling the facility to schedule their second and/or booster shots.

### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - We believe if we have the feature available to the Veteran, more Veterans will schedule their COVID-19 appointments online. 
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Since we have already have the current flow to schedule a first dose COVID-19 appointment online, we don't anticipate major changes to the flow and a Veteran should be able to schedule the same way they have done before.  
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - This may require additional technical support from the backend services endpoints to help identify which facility offers second/booster shots. 
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - There will be a positive impact when we do implement the changes and will enahnce the COVID-19 service experience to the Veteran. 

### Prioritization
1. Review the current vaccine workflow (user workflow and end to end workflow) 
2. Request a content review in VAOS for COVID-19 appointment workflow 
3. Determine MVP requirements for the feature 
4. Make design updates, if needed  
5. Research any logic that may need to be updated
