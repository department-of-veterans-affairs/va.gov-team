# Vaccine COVID-19 Workflow in VAOS (VA Online Scheduling) 

## Overview

We would like to improve the vaccine appointment workflow. In the current state, we only allow the Veteran to schedule their first dose online. If they want to schedule a second dose, we ask the Veteran to call the facility. 

We want to remove the first dose requirements and allow the Veteran to schedule a COVID-19 vaccine appointment regardless if it's their first, second or booster dose. 

The team is looking for guidance and suggestions from the Content team to help improve the Veteran's experience when scheduling a COVID-19 vaccine online.
