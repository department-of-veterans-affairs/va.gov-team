# Vaccine COVID-19 Workflow in VAOS (VA Online Scheduling) 

## Overview

We would like to improve the vaccine appointment workflow. In the current state, we only allow the Veteran to schedule their first dose online. If they want to schedule a second dose, we ask the Veteran to call the facility. 

We want to remove the first dose requirements and allow the Veteran to schedule a COVID-19 vaccine appointment regardless if it's their first, second or booster dose. 

When a Veteran starts scheduling a COVID-19 vaccine appointment in VAOS, the Veteran will see a page providing details for only scheduling a first dose and to call the facility for the second or booster dose.
