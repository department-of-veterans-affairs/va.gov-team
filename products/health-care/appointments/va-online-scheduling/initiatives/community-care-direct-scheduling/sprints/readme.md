## More About Sprints

- Each sprint has a specific goal or set of deliverables, known as the sprint goal(s).
- The team works on the tasks during the sprint. Daily stand-up meetings are often held to discuss progress and any obstacles.
- At the end of the sprint, a sprint review meeting is held to demonstrate what has been accomplished. This allows stakeholders to provide feedback.
- By working in sprints, agile teams aim to improve productivity, accommodate changes more easily, and deliver functional software more frequently.
- **Incremental delivery:** The goal of each sprint is to produce a potentially shippable product increment, meaning the work completed should be functional and usable.
