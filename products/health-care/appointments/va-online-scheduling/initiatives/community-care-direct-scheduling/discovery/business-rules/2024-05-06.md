# EPS/VAOS Business Process Discussion - Follow Up

_May 6, 2024_

## Referral approvals and authorization letters

- Once a referral has been approved, then the Veteran will receive their authorization letter to schedule. If a provider for the speciality is participating in sharing their grids with EPS, then those providers will appear in the CC "digital self-scheduling" experience in Appointments.
- Consult Toolbox sends approved referral information to HSRM. Then, the authorization letter is mailed to the Veteran. 
- Authorization letters are mailed, and the time between approval and receiving an authorization letter varies between site.
- CID defaults to today if it's not discussed during the referral intake process. 

## "Digital self-scheduling" vs. scheduling with a provider that isn't sharing their grids 

- Sometimes the Veteran would prefer a provider that isn't sharing their grids. E.g., the provider that the Veteran wants to see, fits the authorization, but doesn't have their grids open. As a result, Veterans should still be able to call and schedule an appointment with them. Or, for example, if the provider the Veteran wants to see doesn't have appointment availability until 30 days out, a Veteran should be able to schedule with any other "eligible" provider.
- **The PID/CID is captured during the referral intake process. Therefore, there's no need to re-capture PID during "digital self-scheduling."**
