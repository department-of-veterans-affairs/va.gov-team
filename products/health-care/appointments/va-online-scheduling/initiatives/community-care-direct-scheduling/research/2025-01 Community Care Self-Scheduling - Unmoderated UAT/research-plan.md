# Research Plan - Community Care Self-Scheduling - Unmoderated UAT

## Background

**The Cleland Dole Act** addresses Veteran homelessness, access to care, community care, mental health, research, telehealth, prostate cancer, provider oversight and transparency, long-term care, rural health, benefits, information technology and more. 

**Self-Scheduling and Community Care Self-scheduling Pilot Program**
- As a congressional mandate under the Cleland-Dole Act, VA must address the following for Veterans by the end of 2024:

Self-scheduling appointments
- Allows Veterans seeking for primary care, specialty care, and mental health care under the Veteran’s Community Care Program to self-schedule, modify, and cancel appointments directly online
- Allows VA to expand capabilities of an existing appointment self-scheduling technology or purchase a new appointment self-scheduling technology

The pilot program MVP will allow Veterans at pilot sites in the Greater Los Angeles area to self-schedule physical therapy appointments using Appointments on va.gov once a referral is approved. They will also have the ability to cancel and reschedule those appointments.

**This UAT study aims to get Veteran feedback on the Community Care self-scheduling pilot process and ensure that Veterans were able to complete the process successfully. These results will inform if future iterations are needed ahead of releasing to more sites.**

### OCTO Priorities
The Community Care Self-Scheduling initiative aligns with the following OCTO-DE Priorities:
- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey
This research corresponds to the following points of the Veteran journey:
- Taking care of myself

## Research Goals

### Outcome
This study will give us insight into if Veterans from pilot sites were able to successfully and easily complete the Community Care Self-Scheduling process, as well as capture any feedback they have about the process. 

### Research Questions
- Will users be able to complete the Community Care Self-Scheduling process successfully?


### Hypotheses
- Will users be able to complete the Community Care Self-Scheduling process successfully?
  - Hypothesis: If users make an attempt to complete the self-scheduling process, then they should be able to successfully schedule without assistance.


## Method
This research will be conducted as an unmoderated survey study using Optimal Workshop. To recruit Veterans from the pilot sites, we will add information and a link on the confirmation page of the Community Care Self-Scheduling flow. This will lead to a tailored Perigean registration form so Perigean can easily identify the participants who are looking to complete our UAT survey for this specific feature.

**Staff script/interception:**
When CC scheduling staff contact Veterans and ask them if they would like to opt in to self-scheduling, we’ll have them ask Veterans if they’re interested in providing feedback on the process and, if so, to look out for a link at the end of the scheduling process to register to provide feedback at veteranusability.us. 

### Location
Tests will be conducted online at the participant’s leisure.
