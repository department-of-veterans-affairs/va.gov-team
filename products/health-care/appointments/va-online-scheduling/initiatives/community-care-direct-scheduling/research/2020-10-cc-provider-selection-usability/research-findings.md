# CC provider selection usability study research findings

*Research findings from 2020-10*

## Key takeaways

- All participants wanted the list of providers to be more personalized. **The top request was to be able to schedule with providers they have seen in the past, or a specific provider they had researched/heard about.**
- **For both cases, appointment availability was top of mind.** Most participants wanted to know how soon they could see the provider, or if the provider was available on specific dates.
- Participants liked knowing a provider’s distance, but **some wanted to see the provider list in alphabetical order so they could find someone who they already knew - either an existing provider, or one they had researched.**
- **Most participants said they would spend time researching providers before reaching this step,** googling review sites to get a sense of the provider’s reputation.
