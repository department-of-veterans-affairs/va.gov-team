## Warm up questions - 3 minutes 
- Before we go to the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions:

- Have you used the Appointments tool on VA.gov to schedule and manage your health appointments before? Yes 
When was the last time? Around the end of May. 

- And, what device are you using to join this session today? My iPhone

- So, I will be sharing a web page link with you during this session. How would you prefer to receive the link? For example, I could send it through the Zoom (messages) chat or email it to you.

- _If the participant is using a screen reader:_
  - Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- _If the participant is using screen magnification:_
  - Are you using a screen magnification tool today? If so, what type? (For example, Zoom.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- Great. Thank you.

## Semi-structured interview - Referrals - 10 minutes
- We have a few different activities we’ll complete during this session. To start, I’ll ask you a few questions about receiving authorization from VA to receive care from another VA provider for specialty care or a community care provider.

- First off, have you received care from a community care provider before? (You don’t need to talk about what it was for.) Yes
  
- _If yes:_ Could you talk me through how you got that (or typically get that) appointment scheduled?  
The most recent was, when I went to see my primary care and she suggested a treatment, it took a month to two months for community care to call and schedule the appointment. Once the appointment was scheduled the facility followed up that the appointment was scheduled. I don’t receive any documentation initially for the referral. After the appointment with community care, I will get a letter saying what was paid.
  
- _If no:_ No, problem. Have you ever received care from a VA provider that you needed VA's authorization for?
    - _If yes:_ How did you schedule that appointment?

  - _If no to all:_ So, if you wanted to receive care from a community care provider in the future, could you tell me how you would go about requesting to receive care from them?

- What documentation would you expect to receive from your VA provider to receive care by another provider?
It shows what the treatment was. What was billed, what was allowed, and what was paid. 

- And, what information would you expect to be included in that document (or documents)?

- Where would you expect to be able to find a record of that document on VA.gov, especially if it required you to self-schedule an appointment as a next step? to those referrals. My healthy e-vet. Going under appointment scheduler 
- And, what about finding those documents for appointments that you've already had. Where would you expect to find those documents on VA.gov? Probably my HealthE-vet


## Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

- Ok, thank you!
  
- So now I'll have you try a prototype for scheduling an appointment online with a community care provider, imagining that you recently requested to self-schedule physical therapy during a recent appointment.  

- Do you have any questions about that before we get started?

- Ok, I’m sending you the prototype link now. 

   - _Send [Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/DsRXEFiYLCFnY5nBkp9Dc4/CC-Referral-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=294-3585&t=LCu6HynSx7l1uQBW-1)._

- You can go ahead and select that link. And let me know when you have that open. 


```
   [If needed: Instructions for opening chat]

   - Ok. Now go ahead and tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap (or select) the screen a menu will appear at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) “Chat."
```


- Ok, now I’d like to be able to see your screen so I can see how you’re using the prototype. **Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me today?**
   - _If no:_ No problem. In that case, would you be able to describe aloud to me what you are doing as you go through the prototype?
     - _If still no, for non-screen reader users, moderator can choose to share their own screen._
        - No problem. I'd like to try something else. I'll share my screen and control the prototype, but you can tell me what you would do next and I'll do that. How does that sound?
          
        - _Skip to [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/DsRXEFiYLCFnY5nBkp9Dc4/CC-Referral-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=294-3585&t=LCu6HynSx7l1uQBW-1)._ 

   - _If yes:_ Great. Now, if there’s any apps, web pages or notifications on your device that you’d like to close or turn off before I’m able to see your screen, I’ll give you a moment to do that now.


```
  [If needed: Screen Sharing Instructions - 2 Minutes]

   - So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.
   - Tap (or select) the screen anywhere.
   - And, as you tap the screen a menu will open at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) "Share." If you can’t find “Share” in that menu, you may need to tap the menu and drag it to the left to uncover more options.
   - And, when you find the “Share” option, go ahead and select it.
   - Then, tap (or select) "Screen."
   - Then, tap the words, “Start Broadcast.”
   - Now, tap (or select) anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen that starts with "Everything on your screen."
```

_**Participant starts at Text message:**_

- Now, imagine you just received this text message from VA. 

- Go ahead and review it, but don't select anything yet. 
It is straightforward. I would hope this would make things faster. I would click on this right away. 
Typically you are sent to community care because the VA is backed up more than 30 days/ But community care is backed up one to two months just to get the call to make an appointment. It seems pretty redundant. 
- Is there anything that's confusing about this information?

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here and go ahead and do that. 

_**Participant is at mock sign in page:**_

- At this point you would sign in to VA.gov, but go ahead and choose ID.me, since this is just a prototype representing a sign in.
  
- And, go ahead and begin to add your email address and it will auto-populate some information.
  
- Great. Now, go ahead and select "Sign in" to continue.
  
- And, once more, go ahead and begin to enter the 6-digit code that was, if we're imagining, texted to you.

- Perfect. And, go ahead and select "Continue." 

---

_**Participant is at Appointment list:**_

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Could you tell me if this is where you were you expecting to end up after selecting the link in the text message?

- Now let’s review what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
I like right at the top of the page that it says when it expires and that you can schedule your appointment. I think it would be helpful if it showed how many appointments you are authorized for. 

  - _Things to watch for:_
    - _Do they mention the referral task card/notification?_
    - _Do they mention the expiration date of the referral?_
Yes it is helpful you might have something going on at the moment but this tells me how long I have to get the appointment. With community care the time period is never this long.
Typically for me I would schedule now because if I asked for Community Care it’s because the VA is not able to get me in right away. In my mind medical care is very important so why I am I going to wait. 
  - _If needed:_
    - What did you expect to be on this page?
    - Is anything information on this page confusing?

- Without doing anything yet, tell me a little about what you’d do next on this page based on the text message you received.

- _If task card was not mentioned:_ 
  - Did you notice anything about a scheduling an appointment? 
  - Did you notice the box at the top of the page? And, what does that seem to mean to you?

- _If expiration date was not mentioned:_
  - Did you notice the expiration date for scheduling an appointment? And, what was your reaction when reviewing it?
  - Was there anything confusing about that information?

- Ok, still thinking out loud as you go along, go ahead and go through the process you'd follow to schedule the appointment mentioned in the text message you received.
So here it shows the number of visits I like that. It shows your referral number it gives a referral link. It has a little drop down where if you are approved for more than one appointment it shows the provider information. I don’t like that you don’t get to choose your provider. 
Because I am in a pretty rural area my options are kind of limited, they did give me a few options when I lived in a larger city. 
---

_**Participant is on referral page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about the information on this page?

- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?
Showing if you already scheduled your appointment information is helpful. Sometimes meds can mess with your memory. 
- How clear are the steps for what you should do next?
It says if you were approved for more than one appointment schedule your first appointment using this tool. You’’ need to schedule the remaining appointments with your provider. That is good but it doesn’t show up on your appointments list.
- Ok, and before you do anything here, I have a few more questions: 

   - What are the most important factors to you when choosing a provider? Let's say, to find a new primary care provider for routine care? 
Location is important, I like to read any reviews they might have, to see if the majority of patients are happy with the care they are receiving. 

      - (Provide examples if needed, but try not to be leading: for example, their reputation, their distance to your home, etc.)

   - And, what about if you're choosing a provider for specialty care? For example, you’re searching for an orthopedic specialist that can do a total knee replacement. What would be the most important factors when choosing a provider? Distance at that point wouldn’t be the most important. Reviews would be most important are they well rated with the hospital and patients. 

- Ok, thank you. Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next on this page.

---

_**Participant is on provider page:**_ 
- Tell me about this page.
The Va uses several providers, the one they want you to use is on top, but you can see a list of other providers you could choose from. 
- _If preferred provider wasn't mentioned:_ What's your understanding of the box at the top of the page?
  
- And without doing anything, I'm curious -- from here, how would you continue through finding a provider if I wasn't guiding you?

- Ok thanks. And, what would you do if you wanted to search for a specific group or category of providers?

- Go ahead and walk me through how you'd do that.
  
- **Did you notice the "Filter and sort" link? Okay, now go ahead and select that link.**
  Some people prefer male or female so that is good. Online scheduling is good, it can be frustrating getting ahold of a provider. 
---

_**Participant is on filter page:**_ 

- Tell me about this page.

- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  
- Is this information what you expected to find?

[ONLINE SCHEDULING FILTER]

- _If online scheduling option was not mentioned:_ And what about the third filter on the screen? what does that mean to you? 
 
- _If not yet mentioned:_ And, if the provider you knew you wanted to schedule with did NOT have online scheduling, would you still expect to find information on that provider in this tool?
I would look and see what my options are, but if I had a specific provider I would probably stay with them.  
    - _If yes:_ What information would you expect to find for that provider?
    - _If no:_ Could you tell me more about that? Why not? 
 
- And if the provider you preferred to schedule with didn't offer online scheduling at this time, would that change your decision on who to schedule with?

[GENERAL]

- And what about the rest of the filters on this page? Is there anything confusing about those?
  
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find?

- Ok, and without doing anything yet, could you describe what filters you might select on this page?
  
- Ok, for the purposes of this session, you can go ahead and select [Practice], then the first option, and [Only show providers with online scheduling]. Then, submit those choices. 

---

_**Participant is on 2nd provider page:**_
- Tell me about this page now.
  
- What's your understanding of the provider list now that you selected those filter choices?
  - _If needed:_ How has the page changed?It shows providers that meet the selection I made
  - _If needed:_ How do you know that those choices were selected?

- And how does this match up to what you expected to find after submitting those options? 

- Ok, thank you. Let's pretend that the first provider under "All providers" matches what you're looking for. Go ahead and choose that provider.


---

_**Participant is on choose time and date page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  This page is easy to understand. I think like a red color or a way to make it clearer for the older population to see the difference between available and unavailable days. 
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?

- Now, slowly walk me through how you would continue from here and go ahead and take those next steps. _(Stop participant to ask about any usability hurdles)_
Click on the day with the gray square I assume is the first available appointment. 
---

_**Participant is on review/confirm choices page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about this page?
This is all straightforward. It tells you the provider, the reason for the appointment, the day and time and a confirm button. 
- Without selecting anything, what would you do if you wanted to change some of your appointment details?

- And what would you expect to happen after selecting the edit link?
It would take you back to the previous screen. If you chose edit on the provider it would either take you back to the filtered provider or the original list. 
- Great. Now go ahead and continue to the next step.

---

_**Participant is on success/detail page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and the information included here. 
I like that it has the directions link, I like that it has print because I keep a log of appointments and can refer back to it. 
- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find after you just confirmed the appointment?

- Thank you. And lastly, how would you expect to be able to cancel or reschedule this appointment if you needed to? I would hit the cancel button, and hopefully it would give me an option to reschedule.
  
- Do you think you would have to call the community care provider to cancel the appointment? 
It should let the provider know in the background.
----

## Task #2: Referral concept test - 5 minutes

- Thank you! I just have one more thing for you to review.
  
- Now I’ll have you go back to your list of appointments by selecting the "Review your appointments" link towards the top of the page. _(guide them back if needed)_

_**Participant is on appointment list page (no task card):**_
- Great. So, earlier, I asked you an open-ended question about where you would expect to find a list of your referrals. So, now, I’d like to get your feedback on an early concept for where those referrals might be located in this tool. 

- Earlier, you mentioned that _______. **_(RECAP where the participant expected to find referrals from their earlier responses.)_**.

- At this point, let's say you remembered you had another referral waiting to be self-scheduled. From this page, without selecting anything yet, where would you go to find that referral?
Start scheduling and hopefully it gives a list of providers to schedule with. 
- And again, without selecting anything yet, where would you go on this page to review your older referrals from appointments you already completed? 
I would probably go to my past appointments. 
- Ok, thank you. Now, I’ll have you navigate to your "Pending" appointments. 

---

_**Participant is on Pending page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and what’s included here.
It shows pending request that you have probably asked your primary about. It also shows canceled requests that you can review. It also gives you the option to schedule your dental referral. I like the detail link. 
I like that the dental referral is at the top so you know what you still need to do. 
- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find?
  
- Do you have any other comments or questions about the information presented on this page? Please don't hesitate to give us your feedback; this is a very early concept that may or may not be used.
No I think everything is straightforward. I think it will be a helpful tool if and when it comes to be. I think it is both helpful to the provider and the veteran they can see what the status of the referral is and what the next step is. 

Is pending a good word to describe the list of appointments that you need to schedule?
I think it’s a good word but can be confusing at the same time because it doesn’t show that it has pending referrals as well. For me I would think those are pending appointments in the VA system.
What is a pending appointment to you?
The referral has been set and your are waiting for that specific department in the VA to acknowledge the referral and they are either going to send it to community care or the right department in the VA. 
What would be another word besides pending?
Maybe referrals or open referrals. If I saw that it would be a place where I know my doctor has referred this it’s in the system, and I know where to go to follow up with it. 

## Post-Task Interview - 1-2 minutes
- Ok, thank you! That concludes that activity and is everything we need to go through today.
  
- Do you have any other questions for me or additional comments about what we’ve reviewed today together?
  
- Ok, and just curious, would you expect VA to contact you if you haven't self-scheduled your first appointment leading up the referral's expiration date?
   - And, when and how would you expect for VA to contact you? (_If needed: For example, one week before the expiration date, one week after the referral was approved? For example, on VA.gov, by phone, by letter?_) 
I would expect a 10 to 15-day follow-up. Again, the reason for Community Care is because the VA can’t see you within 30 days, so why would you do this and then not schedule your appointment in a timely manner? 
- _If the participant agreed to record this session:_ 
   - Lastly, I'd like to confirm once again: **Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?"** We won’t share any information that identifies you, and we’ll remove your face and name from any videos if we do share them. 

      - _If yes:_ Thank you.
     
## Thank you and Closing - 1 minute
- Great. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on this tool and make sure it really works for Veterans.

- Thanks, and lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans who might be interested in participating in future research studies like this as well.

- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
