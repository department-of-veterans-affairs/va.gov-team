## Intro - 1 minutes
- Thanks for joining us today!
  
- My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is here taking notes during our session. We also have [A11Y SUPPORT NAME] here to help with any technology assistance.

- _If observers are present in Zoom waiting room:_
  - I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

- Today, we're going to talk about receiving approval to self-schedule an appointment with a community care provider. 

---
## Warm up questions - 3 minutes 
- Before we start, I have a few warm-up questions for you:

- _If the participant is using a screen reader:_
  - Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- _If the participant is using screen magnification:_
  - Are you using a screen magnification tool today? If so, what type? (For example, Zoom.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- Have you used the Appointments tool on VA.gov to schedule and manage your health appointments before?

- And, what device are you using to join this session today? (E.g., iPhone or Android device.)

- So, I will be sharing a web page link with you during this session. How would you prefer to receive the link? For example, I could send it through the Zoom (messages) chat or email it to you.

- Great. Thank you.

## Session overview - 3 minutes
- Before we go to the prototype, I have a few more things that I want to go over with you:
- **This entire session should take about 1 hour and 15 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers and we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to, and whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with VA. If you'd like to stop the session or don't want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- _If observers are present in Zoom waiting room:_ 
    - I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
       - _If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
       - _If yes: Admit observers._
         - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov._ 
         - _Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth._



- **Great. So, you'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be interactive, and some will not. And none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **We like to record these sessions to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and may share video clips with our colleagues at VA to show actual user feedback.** We won’t share any information that identifies you, and we’ll remove your face and name from any videos if we do share them. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
   - _If yes:_ **Ok, once I start recording, I am going to once more ask for you to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session.**
     
      - _*Start recording.*_

      - **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
        
      - Great. Thank you.


## Semi-structured interview - Referrals - 5-7 minutes

_Note for moderator: If Veteran has difficulty answering some of these questions, consider not asking all of the them and moving to the next section._

- We have a few different activities we’ll complete during this session. To start, I’ll ask you a few questions about receiving authorization from VA to receive care from another VA provider for specialty care or a community care provider.

- First off, have you received care from a community care provider before? (You don’t need to talk about what it was for.)
  - _If yes:_ Could you briefly talk me through how you got that (or typically get that) appointment scheduled?

  - _If no:_ No, problem. Have you ever received care from a VA provider that you needed VA's authorization for?
    - _If yes:_ How did you schedule that appointment?

  - _If no to all:_ So, if you wanted to receive care from a community care provider in the future, could you tell me how you would go about requesting to receive care from them?

- What documentation would you expect to receive from your VA provider to receive care from another provider?

- And, what information would you expect to be included in that document (or documents)?

- Where would you expect to be able to find a record of that document on VA.gov, especially if it required you to self-schedule an appointment as a next step?

- And, what about finding those documents for appointments that you've already had. Where would you expect to find those documents on VA.gov?

-------

## Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

- Ok, thank you!
  
- So now I'll have you try a prototype for scheduling an appointment online with a community care provider, imagining that you recently requested to self-schedule physical therapy during a recent appointment.  

- Do you have any questions about that before we get started?

- First, I’d like to be able to see your screen so I can see how you’re using the prototype. **Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me today?**
   - _If no:_ No problem. In that case, would you be able to describe aloud to me what you are doing as you go through the prototype?
          
   - _If yes:_ Great. Now, if there’s any apps, web pages or notifications on your device that you’d like to close or turn off before I’m able to see your screen, I’ll give you a moment to do that now.


```
  [If needed: Screen Sharing Instructions - 2 Minutes]

   - So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.
   - Tap (or select) the screen anywhere.
   - And, as you tap the screen a menu will open at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) "Share." If you can’t find “Share” in that menu, you may need to tap the menu and drag it to the left to uncover more options.
   - And, when you find the “Share” option, go ahead and select it.
   - Then, tap (or select) "Screen."
   - Then, tap the words, “Start Broadcast.”
   - Now, tap (or select) anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen that starts with "Everything on your screen."
```

- Ok, now, I’m sending you [directly in the Zoom chat, by email, or by text message] some information that represents a text message from VA. 

_Send info and link:_ 
> **Your community care referral for physical therapy has been approved. Sign in to VA.gov and go to your VA appointments to schedule: https://codepen.io/team/va-cie/live/MWdaWeb.**


- _(Backup for non-AT users in case of prototype issues: [Figma prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/DsRXEFiYLCFnY5nBkp9Dc4/CC-Referral-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=1538-33305&t=LCu6HynSx7l1uQBW-1&starting-point-node-id=1538%3A33305))_



```
   [If needed: Instructions for opening chat]

   - Ok. Now go ahead and tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap (or select) the screen a menu will appear at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) “Chat."
```

_**Participant starts at Text message (in Zoom chat / email / or text):**_

_Note for moderator: Get through this section quickly to save time._

- Now, imagine you just received this text message from VA. 

- Go ahead and review it, but don't select anything yet. 

- Is there anything that's confusing about this information?

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here and go ahead and do that. 

---

_**Participant is at mock sign in page:**_

- At this point you would sign in to VA.gov, but go ahead and choose any option, since this is just a prototype representing a sign in.

---

_**Participant is at Appointment list:**_

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Could you tell me if this is where you were expecting to end up after selecting the link in the text message?

- Now let’s review what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?

  - _Things to watch for:_
    - _Do they mention the referral task card/notification?_
    - _Do they mention the expiration date of the referral?_

  - _If needed:_
    - What did you expect to be on this page?
    - Is anything information on this page confusing?

- Without doing anything yet, tell me a little about what you’d do next on this page based on the text message you received.

- _If task card was not mentioned:_ 
  - Did you notice anything about a scheduling an appointment? 
  - Did you notice the card at the top of the page? And, what does that mean to you?

- _If expiration date was not mentioned:_
  - Did you notice the expiration date for scheduling an appointment? And, what was your reaction when reviewing that?
    
  - _If needed:_
    - Knowing that there's an expiration date, how does that affect how you’re thinking about this scheduling process? (For example, does it change how you’re thinking about it at all?)
    - And if we weren’t doing this together now and this was a real appointment with a community care provider that you were going to schedule on your own, when would you schedule this appointment?

- Ok, still thinking out loud as you go along, go ahead and go through the process you'd follow to schedule the appointment mentioned in the text message you received.

---

_**Participant is on referral page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about the information on this page?

- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?

- How clear are the steps for what you should do next?

- Ok, and before you do anything here, I have a few more questions: 

   - What are the most important factors to you when choosing a provider? Let's say, to find a new primary care provider for routine care? 
      - _(Provide examples if needed, but try not to be leading: for example, their reputation, their distance to your home, etc.)_

   - And, what about if you're choosing a provider for specialty care? For example, you’re searching for an orthopedic specialist that can do a total knee replacement. What would be the most important factors when choosing a provider?

- Ok, thank you. Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next on this page.

---

_**Participant is on provider page:**_ 
- Tell me about this page.

- _If preferred provider wasn't mentioned:_ What's your understanding of the (card) section at the top of the page?
  
- And without doing anything, I'm curious -- from here, how would you continue through finding a provider if I wasn't guiding you?

- Ok thanks. And, what would you do if you wanted to search for a provider that fits requirements or preferences you have?

- Go ahead and walk me through how you'd do that.
  
- _If needed:_ **Did you notice the "Filter and sort" link? Okay, now go ahead and select that link.**
  
---

_**Participant is on filter page:**_ 

- Tell me about this page.

- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  
- Is this information what you expected to find?

[ONLINE SCHEDULING FILTER]

- _If online scheduling option was not mentioned:_ And what about the third filter on the screen? What does that mean to you?

   - Would you expect this tool to include providers that don't offer online scheduling?

      - _If no:_ Could you tell me more about that? Why not? 

   - And, if they were included in this tool, how would you expect to be able to schedule an appointment with them? 

      - _If needed:_ Their contact information? Phone number? 

   - _If not yet mentioned:_ And, if your preferred provider did NOT offer online scheduling, would you still expect to find them listed in this tool? 
 
   - And if the provider you preferred to schedule with didn't offer online scheduling, would that change your decision on who to schedule the appointment with?

[GENERAL]

- And what about the rest of the filters on this page? Is there anything confusing about those?
  
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find?

- Ok, and without doing anything yet, could you describe what filters you might select on this page?
  
- Ok, for the purposes of this session, you can go ahead and select [Any practice], then the first option in the drop down, and select [Only show providers with online scheduling]. Then, for provider gender, you can select female. And then, submit those choices. 

---

_**Participant is on 2nd provider page:**_
- Tell me about this page now.
  
- What's your understanding of the provider list now that you selected those filter choices?
  - _If needed:_ How has the page changed?
  - _If needed:_ How do you know that those choices were selected?

- And how does this match up to what you expected to find after submitting those options? 

- Ok, thank you. Let's pretend that the first provider under "All providers" (Dr. Kristina Jones, MD) matches what you're searching for. Go ahead and choose that provider.

---

_**Participant is on choose time and date page:**_

- This page is not completely accurate for what would actually be here, but we do have a representation of the steps you’d take at this point. Could you review those and talk me through that?
- _If needed:_
  - Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  - Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?

- Thank you. Now, let’s imagine we selected July 26 for the date and then 8:30 am for the time. And, keeping that in mind, you can go ahead and select continue.

---

_**Participant is on review/confirm choices page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about this page?

- Without selecting anything, what would you do if you wanted to change some of your appointment details?

- And what would you expect to happen after selecting the edit link?

- Great. Now go ahead and continue to the next step.

---

_**Participant is on success/detail page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and the information included here. 

- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find after you just confirmed the appointment?

- Thank you. And lastly, how would you expect to be able to cancel or reschedule this appointment if you needed to?
  
- Do you think you would have to call the community care provider to cancel the appointment? 

----

## Task #2: Referral concept test - 5 minutes

- Thank you! I just have one more thing for you to review.
  
- Now I’ll have you go back to your list of appointments by selecting the "Review your appointments" link towards the top of the page. _(guide them back if needed)_

_**Participant is on appointment list page (no task card):**_
- Great. So, earlier, I asked you an open-ended question about where you would expect to find a list of your referrals. So, now, I’d like to get your feedback on an early concept for where those referrals might be located in this tool. 

- At this point, let's say you remembered you had another referral waiting to be self-scheduled. From this page, without selecting anything yet, where would you go to find that referral?

- And again, without selecting anything yet, where would you go on this page to review your older referrals? For example, a referral from an appointment you already saw the provider for? 

- Ok, thank you. Now, I’ll have you navigate to your "Pending" appointments. 

---

_**Participant is on Pending page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and what’s included here.

- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find?
  
- Do you have any other comments or questions about the information presented on this page? Please don't hesitate to give us your feedback; this is a very early concept that may or may not be used.

-------

## Post-Task Interview - 1-2 minutes
- Ok, thank you! That concludes that activity and is everything we need to go through today.
  
- Do you have any other questions for me or additional comments about what we’ve reviewed today together?

_Note for moderator: If time is getting close, skip this question._

   - Ok, and just curious, would you expect VA to contact you if you haven't self-scheduled your first appointment leading up the referral's expiration date?
      - And, when and how would you expect for VA to contact you? (_If needed: For example, one week before the expiration date, one week after the referral was approved? For example, on VA.gov, by phone, by letter?_) 

- _If the participant agreed to record this session:_ 
   - Lastly, I'd like to confirm once again: **Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?"** We won’t share any information that identifies you, and we’ll remove your face and name from any videos if we do share them. 

      - _If yes:_ Thank you.
     
## Thank you and Closing - 1 minute
- Great. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on this tool and make sure it really works for Veterans.

- Thanks, and lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans who might be interested in participating in future research studies like this as well.

- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
