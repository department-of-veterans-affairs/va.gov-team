## Warm up questions - 3 minutes 
- Before we go to the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions:

- Have you used the Appointments tool on VA.gov to schedule and manage your health appointments before? Yes, to schedule and manage appointments, talk to a nurse, cancel and stuff like that. 
I have to scroll thorough a long list of people. If a nurse could figure that out that would be great. (We’ll take not of that)
- And, what device are you using to join this session today? IOS

- So, I will be sharing a web page link with you during this session. How would you prefer to receive the link? For example, I could send it through the Zoom (messages) chat or email it to you.

- _If the participant is using a screen reader:_
  - Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- _If the participant is using screen magnification:_
  - Are you using a screen magnification tool today? If so, what type? (For example, Zoom.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- Great. Thank you.

## Semi-structured interview - Referrals - 10 minutes
- We have a few different activities we’ll complete during this session. To start, I’ll ask you a few questions about receiving authorization from VA to receive care from another VA provider for specialty care or a community care provider.

- First off, have you received care from a community care provider before? (You don’t need to talk about what it was for.) Yes
  - _If yes:_ Could you talk me through how you got that (or typically get that) appointment scheduled?

  - _If no:_ No, problem. Have you ever received care from a VA provider that you needed VA's authorization for?
    - _If yes:_ How did you schedule that appointment?

  - _If no to all:_ So, if you wanted to receive care from a community care provider in the future, could you tell me how you would go about requesting to receive care from them?

- What documentation would you expect to receive from your VA provider to receive care by another provider? I really don’t keep track of documentation, I assume if I give you this information and sign the waver they will send my information to the VA. I keep a journal of dates and information and check with my doctor to see if they got the information. 

- And, what information would you expect to be included in that document (or documents)?

- Where would you expect to be able to find a record of that document on VA.gov, especially if it required you to self-schedule an appointment as a next step?

- And, what about finding those documents for appointments that you've already had. Where would you expect to find those documents on VA.gov?

## Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

- Ok, thank you!
  
- So now I'll have you try a prototype for scheduling an appointment online with a community care provider, imagining that you recently requested to self-schedule physical therapy during a recent appointment.  

- Do you have any questions about that before we get started?

- Ok, I’m sending you the prototype link now. 

   - _Send [Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/DsRXEFiYLCFnY5nBkp9Dc4/CC-Referral-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=294-3585&t=LCu6HynSx7l1uQBW-1)._

- You can go ahead and select that link. And let me know when you have that open. 


```
   [If needed: Instructions for opening chat]

   - Ok. Now go ahead and tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap (or select) the screen a menu will appear at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) “Chat."
```


- Ok, now I’d like to be able to see your screen so I can see how you’re using the prototype. **Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me today?**
   - _If no:_ No problem. In that case, would you be able to describe aloud to me what you are doing as you go through the prototype?
     - _If still no, for non-screen reader users, moderator can choose to share their own screen._
        - No problem. I'd like to try something else. I'll share my screen and control the prototype, but you can tell me what you would do next and I'll do that. How does that sound?
          
        - _Skip to [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/DsRXEFiYLCFnY5nBkp9Dc4/CC-Referral-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=294-3585&t=LCu6HynSx7l1uQBW-1)._ 

   - _If yes:_ Great. Now, if there’s any apps, web pages or notifications on your device that you’d like to close or turn off before I’m able to see your screen, I’ll give you a moment to do that now.


```
  [If needed: Screen Sharing Instructions - 2 Minutes]

   - So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.
   - Tap (or select) the screen anywhere.
   - And, as you tap the screen a menu will open at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) "Share." If you can’t find “Share” in that menu, you may need to tap the menu and drag it to the left to uncover more options.
   - And, when you find the “Share” option, go ahead and select it.
   - Then, tap (or select) "Screen."
   - Then, tap the words, “Start Broadcast.”
   - Now, tap (or select) anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen that starts with "Everything on your screen."
```

_**Participant starts at Text message:**_

- Now, imagine you just received this text message from VA. 

- Go ahead and review it, but don't select anything yet. 

- Is there anything that's confusing about this information?
I barely read the message and click right on the website sometimes I have to go back and see what it is. This is good now I know what I am looking at. My physical therapy has been approved. Sometimes I go for so many things like who are you what are you for so this is good. I can see that it is for physical therapy. There are other situations where if they don’t specify it could be confusing. Would like more detail but understands how HIPPA might conflict too much detail.
- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here and go ahead and do that. I would click on the link and it would give me more detail about what this is for. 
---

_**Participant is at mock sign in page:**_

- At this point you would sign in to VA.gov, but go ahead and choose ID.me, since this is just a prototype representing a sign in.
  
- And, go ahead and begin to add your email address and it will auto-populate some information.
  
- Great. Now, go ahead and select "Sign in" to continue.
  
- And, once more, go ahead and begin to enter the 6-digit code that was, if we're imagining, texted to you.

- Perfect. And, go ahead and select "Continue." 

---

_**Participant is at Appointment list:**_

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Could you tell me if this is where you were you expecting to end up after selecting the link in the text message?

- Now let’s review what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
I see these all the time, it’s not uncommon after seeing your primary several of these will pop up. You have to check and make sure they don’t overlap. 
I assume you click on the green button. The schedule your appointment and start scheduling are the same thing as far as I know. 
  - _Things to watch for:_
    - _Do they mention the referral task card/notification? Expires in 310 days which is weird. I am use to 30 days 90 days. 
    - _Do they mention the expiration date of the referral?_
310 is crazy, I assume it is because this is a prototype. I think it is awesome to get 310 days, but I don’t know why anyone would get 310 days. It takes so long to get seen; I want a smaller window so that I can get seen. I have something wrong with my body, I want to be seen and get fixed. That’s the problem with the VA it takes so long to get seen. 
I would want a calendar and see days and times and see what works for me. I have Wednesdays open so that is what I would look for. I have seizures and have to plan ahead. I am not supposed to be driving and I have to have childcare. 
Would schedule an appointment immediately.
  - _If needed:_
    - What did you expect to be on this page?
    - Is anything information on this page confusing?

- Without doing anything yet, tell me a little about what you’d do next on this page based on the text message you received.

- _If task card was not mentioned:_ 
  - Did you notice anything about a scheduling an appointment? 
  - Did you notice the box at the top of the page? And, what does that seem to mean to you?

- _If expiration date was not mentioned:_
  - Did you notice the expiration date for scheduling an appointment? And, what was your reaction when reviewing it?
  - Was there anything confusing about that information?

- Ok, still thinking out loud as you go along, go ahead and go through the process you'd follow to schedule the appointment mentioned in the text message you received.

You have more than 6 months you can choose someone local. You get 10 visits. It is great information as far as what I want to see. This is awesome. 

_**Participant is on referral page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about the information on this page?

- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?

- How clear are the steps for what you should do next?

- Ok, and before you do anything here, I have a few more questions: 

   - What are the most important factors to you when choosing a provider? Let's say, to find a new primary care provider for routine care? 
There is an app that has all the information about doctors, I am not picky I’m out in the boondocks there aren’t many options so I take what I can get.
    
  - (Provide examples if needed, but try not to be leading: for example, their reputation, their distance to your home, etc.)

   - And, what about if you're choosing a provider for specialty care? For example, you’re searching for an orthopedic specialist that can do a total knee replacement. What would be the most important factors when choosing a provider? 
Distance is most important. Distance and then I would use the app and look at the reviews. 

- Ok, thank you. Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next on this page.

---

_**Participant is on provider page:**_ 
- Tell me about this page.

- _If preferred provider wasn't mentioned:_ What's your understanding of the box at the top of the page?
  
- And without doing anything, I'm curious -- from here, how would you continue through finding a provider if I wasn't guiding you?
Filter and sort okay. 
- Ok thanks. And, what would you do if you wanted to search for a specific group or category of providers?

- Go ahead and walk me through how you'd do that.
  
- **Did you notice the "Filter and sort" link? Okay, now go ahead and select that link.**
  
---

_**Participant is on filter page:**_ 

- Tell me about this page.
The preferred provider didn’t change but the rest are female doctors. I figured I would get the calendar and pick your date and time. At this point, I would copy and put it in my calendar. I like that it says why I am scheduling this appointment,
- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  
- Is this information what you expected to find?

[ONLINE SCHEDULING FILTER]

- _If online scheduling option was not mentioned:_ And what about the third filter on the screen? what does that mean to you?
 
- _If not yet mentioned:_ And, if the provider you knew you wanted to schedule with did NOT have online scheduling, would you still expect to find information on that provider in this tool? 
    - _If yes:_ What information would you expect to find for that provider?
    - _If no:_ Could you tell me more about that? Why not? 
 
- And if the provider you preferred to schedule with didn't offer online scheduling at this time, would that change your decision on who to schedule with?

[GENERAL]

- And what about the rest of the filters on this page? Is there anything confusing about those?
  
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find?

- Ok, and without doing anything yet, could you describe what filters you might select on this page?
  
- Ok, for the purposes of this session, you can go ahead and select [Practice], then the first option, and [Only show providers with online scheduling]. Then, submit those choices. 

---

_**Participant is on 2nd provider page:**_
- Tell me about this page now.
  
- What's your understanding of the provider list now that you selected those filter choices?
  - _If needed:_ How has the page changed?
  - _If needed:_ How do you know that those choices were selected?

- And how does this match up to what you expected to find after submitting those options? 

- Ok, thank you. Let's pretend that the first provider under "All providers" matches what you're looking for. Go ahead and choose that provider.


---

_**Participant is on choose time and date page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?

- Now, slowly walk me through how you would continue from here and go ahead and take those next steps. _(Stop participant to ask about any usability hurdles)_

---

_**Participant is on review/confirm choices page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about this page?

- Without selecting anything, what would you do if you wanted to change some of your appointment details? I would click on edit. 

- And what would you expect to happen after selecting the edit link?
I have to hit confirm button on the bottom. 
- Great. Now go ahead and continue to the next step.

---

_**Participant is on success/detail page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and the information included here. 

- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find after you just confirmed the appointment?
This is great that is shows all the appointments and the location I would make the mistake and think they were all at the same place but it shows you the location. 

- Thank you. And lastly, how would you expect to be able to cancel or reschedule this appointment if you needed to?
  
- Do you think you would have to call the community care provider to cancel the appointment? 

----

## Task #2: Referral concept test - 5 minutes

- Thank you! I just have one more thing for you to review.
  
- Now I’ll have you go back to your list of appointments by selecting the "Review your appointments" link towards the top of the page. _(guide them back if needed)_

_**Participant is on appointment list page (no task card):**_
- Great. So, earlier, I asked you an open-ended question about where you would expect to find a list of your referrals. So, now, I’d like to get your feedback on an early concept for where those referrals might be located in this tool. 

- Earlier, you mentioned that _______. **_(RECAP where the participant expected to find referrals from their earlier responses.)_**.

- At this point, let's say you remembered you had another referral waiting to be self-scheduled. From this page, without selecting anything yet, where would you go to find that referral?
I would check my text messages. It wouldn’t be on this page here. I would click on the scheduling button again. (kept using the word pending but never noticed the button)
- And again, without selecting anything yet, where would you go on this page to review your older referrals from appointments you already completed? 

- Ok, thank you. Now, I’ll have you navigate to your "Pending" appointments. 

---

_**Participant is on Pending page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and what’s included here.

- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find?
  
- Do you have any other comments or questions about the information presented on this page? Please don't hesitate to give us your feedback; this is a very early concept that may or may not be used.
I really like the print option. I will sometimes print things I see and go back to it later. 
-------

## Post-Task Interview - 1-2 minutes
- Ok, thank you! That concludes that activity and is everything we need to go through today.
  
- Do you have any other questions for me or additional comments about what we’ve reviewed today together?
  
- Ok, and just curious, would you expect VA to contact you if you haven't self-scheduled your first appointment leading up the referral's expiration date?
   - And, when and how would you expect for VA to contact you? (_If needed: For example, one week before the expiration date, one week after the referral was approved? For example, on VA.gov, by phone, by letter?_) 

- _If the participant agreed to record this session:_ 
   - Lastly, I'd like to confirm once again: **Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?"** We won’t share any information that identifies you, and we’ll remove your face and name from any videos if we do share them. 

      - _If yes:_ Thank you.
     
## Thank you and Closing - 1 minute
- Great. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on this tool and make sure it really works for Veterans.

- Thanks, and lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans who might be interested in participating in future research studies like this as well.

- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
