## Warm up questions - 3 minutes 
- Before we go to the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions:

- Have you used the Appointments tool on VA.gov to schedule and manage your health appointments before? Yes I have. 

- And, what device are you using to join this session today?
Laptop, would you be open to rejoining from your phone? (used both) IOS

- So, I will be sharing a web page link with you during this session. How would you prefer to receive the link? For example, I could send it through the Zoom (messages) chat or email it to you. 
Zoom is fine!

- _If the participant is using a screen reader:_
  - Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- _If the participant is using screen magnification:_
  - Are you using a screen magnification tool today? If so, what type? (For example, Zoom.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- Great. Thank you.

## Semi-structured interview - Referrals - 10 minutes
- We have a few different activities we’ll complete during this session. To start, I’ll ask you a few questions about receiving authorization from VA to receive care from another VA provider for specialty care or a community care provider.

- First off, have you received care from a community care provider before? (You don’t need to talk about what it was for.) Yes
  - _If yes:_ Could you talk me through how you got that (or typically get that) appointment scheduled? 
It’s been awhile since I’ve used the VA for care, but I believe I used VA.gov to schedule

  - _If no:_ No, problem. Have you ever received care from a VA provider that you needed VA's authorization for?
    - _If yes:_ How did you schedule that appointment?

  - _If no to all:_ So, if you wanted to receive care from a community care provider in the future, could you tell me how you would go about requesting to receive care from them?

- What documentation would you expect to receive from your VA provider to receive care by another provider? A referral 

- And, what information would you expect to be included in that document (or documents)?
My providers information as well as the information for who I am being referred to. So that if I have to contact them I know I am contacting the right person. With a  brief description for reason of referral.
- Where would you expect to be able to find a record of that document on VA.gov, especially if it required you to self-schedule an appointment as a next step?
If I remember correctly when you log in to VA.gov there are a few different tabs. I would think under the healthcare tab, I would expect to go down that rabbit hole and find it that way. Like patient portal or something like that.
- And, what about finding those documents for appointments that you've already had. Where would you expect to find those documents on VA.gov?
Ideally, I would expect to find it under my healthcare under some sub-sections. Where it is all segregated out and not just one landing spot. I would expect to see something that I can refer back to.

## Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

- Ok, thank you!
  
- So now I'll have you try a prototype for scheduling an appointment online with a community care provider, imagining that you recently requested to self-schedule physical therapy during a recent appointment.  

- Do you have any questions about that before we get started?
No
- Ok, I’m sending you the prototype link now. 

   - _Send [Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/DsRXEFiYLCFnY5nBkp9Dc4/CC-Referral-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=294-3585&t=LCu6HynSx7l1uQBW-1)._

- You can go ahead and select that link. And let me know when you have that open. 


```
   [If needed: Instructions for opening chat]

   - Ok. Now go ahead and tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap (or select) the screen a menu will appear at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) “Chat."
```


- Ok, now I’d like to be able to see your screen so I can see how you’re using the prototype. **Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me today?**
   - _If no:_ No problem. In that case, would you be able to describe aloud to me what you are doing as you go through the prototype?
     - _If still no, for non-screen reader users, moderator can choose to share their own screen._
        - No problem. I'd like to try something else. I'll share my screen and control the prototype, but you can tell me what you would do next and I'll do that. How does that sound?
          
        - _Skip to [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/DsRXEFiYLCFnY5nBkp9Dc4/CC-Referral-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=294-3585&t=LCu6HynSx7l1uQBW-1)._ 

   - _If yes:_ Great. Now, if there’s any apps, web pages or notifications on your device that you’d like to close or turn off before I’m able to see your screen, I’ll give you a moment to do that now.


```
  [If needed: Screen Sharing Instructions - 2 Minutes]

   - So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.
   - Tap (or select) the screen anywhere.
   - And, as you tap the screen a menu will open at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) "Share." If you can’t find “Share” in that menu, you may need to tap the menu and drag it to the left to uncover more options.
   - And, when you find the “Share” option, go ahead and select it.
   - Then, tap (or select) "Screen."
   - Then, tap the words, “Start Broadcast.”
   - Now, tap (or select) anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen that starts with "Everything on your screen."
```

_**Participant starts at Text message:**_

- Now, imagine you just received this text message from VA. 

- Go ahead and review it, but don't select anything yet. 

- Is there anything that's confusing about this information?
Nothing confusing, I will say that I do like that it’s coming from the VA and even has the logo as like a compact photo. In this day and age you get so many scam email links. This does seem more official so I wouldn’t confuse it as a scam email. 
- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here and go ahead and do that. 
I would click the link. 
---

_**Participant is at mock sign in page:**_

- At this point you would sign in to VA.gov, but go ahead and choose ID.me, since this is just a prototype representing a sign in.
  
- And, go ahead and begin to add your email address and it will auto-populate some information.
  
- Great. Now, go ahead and select "Sign in" to continue.
  
- And, once more, go ahead and begin to enter the 6-digit code that was, if we're imagining, texted to you.

- Perfect. And, go ahead and select "Continue." 

---

_**Participant is at Appointment list:**_

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Could you tell me if this is where you were you expecting to end up after selecting the link in the text message?
Yes, this would be a great place to end up. It’s very relevant, I see the start scheduling tab. 
- Now let’s review what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
I like the pending, I like the print option, some people like to take a hard copy with them. I like the time and date where to go for appointment information. It looks like if I hit details, it will take me to maps or something, so if I don’t know where to go it will show me.   The only thing that seems redundant or confusing is if I hit start scheduling vs. schedule your appointment, where would that take me?
Would you mind elaborating on that? If I hit schedule my appointment, I'm probably going to get something maybe even an auto-populated with the referral.  If I hit start scheduling maybe that would be more of a generalized scheduling where maybe I need to select the location and provider.
  - _Things to watch for:_
    - _Do they mention the referral task card/notification?_
    - _Do they mention the expiration date of the referral?
The expiration, date I like I assume is how long I have before the referral expires. You know sometimes I get busy and forget to schedule, this is good to know how long I have before I would have to get a new referral. 
When would you schedule this appointment?
I would schedule it now because I would assume it’s a physical therapy appointment for a pain that I am experiencing. So it’s something that I would want to address sooner vs later.
  - _If needed:_
    - What did you expect to be on this page?
I see that my referral has been accepted, that’s good to know because a lot of times maybe it is unclear. And seeing that I need to schedule the appointment is good to see. 
    - Is anything information on this page confusing?
Not really sure what the if you already schedule the appointment what that’s for. 
Go ahead and select that one. See if it makes sense.
Oh okay yeah if you have already scheduled you don’t  have to do anything. 
- Without doing anything yet, tell me a little about what you’d do next on this page based on the text message you received.
I’m going to hit the schedule your appointment link. 

- _If task card was not mentioned:_ 
  - Did you notice anything about a scheduling an appointment? 
  - Did you notice the box at the top of the page? And, what does that seem to mean to you?

- _If expiration date was not mentioned:_
  - Did you notice the expiration date for scheduling an appointment? And, what was your reaction when reviewing it?
  - Was there anything confusing about that information?

- Ok, still thinking out loud as you go along, go ahead and go through the process you'd follow to schedule the appointment mentioned in the text message you received.

---

_**Participant is on referral page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about the information on this page?

- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?

- How clear are the steps for what you should do next?

- Ok, and before you do anything here, I have a few more questions: 

   - What are the most important factors to you when choosing a provider? Let's say, to find a new primary care provider for routine care? For me it’s location. I would rather see someone local vs. an hour away. I have done physical therapy before and I prefer to save myself some time and stay with someone close to me.
      - (Provide examples if needed, but try not to be leading: for example, their reputation, their distance to your home, etc.)

   - And, what about if you're choosing a provider for specialty care? For example, you’re searching for an orthopedic specialist who can do a total knee replacement. What would be the most important factors when choosing a provider? Would it change from the proximity of your home? Yeah absolutely in that case you want someone that is five stars vs two stars. 

- Ok, thank you. Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next on this page.

_**Participant is on provider page:**_ 
- Tell me about this page.
The name of the provider, and the location, even telling me they are 12 minutes away. That is great to be able to see. I like to see other options, under here, but I would assume if I got referred to a provider I would have to see that provider. 
- _If preferred provider wasn't mentioned:_ What's your understanding of the box at the top of the page?
  
- And without doing anything, I'm curious -- from here, how would you continue through finding a provider if I wasn't guiding you? Like I said for physical therapy it is just some stretches, I live in a big city and I don’t want to have to drive anywhere. So for me it is about the proximity of where I live. 

- Ok thanks. And, what would you do if you wanted to search for a specific group or category of providers? I would go to filter and sort

- Go ahead and walk me through how you'd do that.
  
- **Did you notice the "Filter and sort" link? Okay, now go ahead and select that link.**


_**Participant is on filter page:**_ 

- Tell me about this page.
Sort by providers in terms of distance which is great that is important to me. Sort by practice. I would expect to click on physical therapy and then put in my distance preferences. 

- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  No all seems very straight forward cut and dry. 

- Is this information what you expected to find?

[ONLINE SCHEDULING FILTER]

- _If online scheduling option was not mentioned:_ And what about the third filter on the screen? what does that mean to you?
 
- _If not yet mentioned:_ And, if the provider you knew you wanted to schedule with did NOT have online scheduling, would you still expect to find information on that provider in this tool? 
    - _If yes:_ What information would you expect to find for that provider?
    - _If no:_ Could you tell me more about that? Why not? 
 
- And if the provider you preferred to schedule with didn't offer online scheduling at this time, would that change your decision on who to schedule with? No I am not afraid to pick up the phone and call. 

[GENERAL]

- And what about the rest of the filters on this page? Is there anything confusing about those?
  It filters it down for me. I’ve got four options here to choose from. I have my preferred provider here at the top. I am assuming because they are not here that means they actually don’t meet the criteria that we used to filter. I don’t know if that’s true or not.
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find? I would expect that if they did fall under that criteria to see them on the list. 

- Ok, and without doing anything yet, could you describe what filters you might select on this page?
  
- Ok, for the purposes of this session, you can go ahead and select [Practice], then the first option, and [Only show providers with online scheduling]. Then, submit those choices. 

---

_**Participant is on 2nd provider page:**_
- Tell me about this page now.
  
- What's your understanding of the provider list now that you selected those filter choices?
  - _If needed:_ How has the page changed?
  - _If needed:_ How do you know that those choices were selected?

- And how does this match up to what you expected to find after submitting those options? 

- Ok, thank you. Let's pretend that the first provider under "All providers" matches what you're looking for. Go ahead and choose that provider.


---

_**Participant is on choose time and date page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
No, I think this is pretty standard and straightforward. 
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?

- Now, slowly walk me through how you would continue from here and go ahead and take those next steps. _(Stop participant to ask about any usability hurdles)_
I would expect that today is July 10th but it shows the first date I can make an appointment is July 26, I can select that date or if it doesn’t work there is an arrow I can push the date to the next month. If I select July 26 I expect it would then show me a list of available times. 
---

_**Participant is on review/confirm choices page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about this page?
No nothing confusing. 
- Without selecting anything, what would you do if you wanted to change some of your appointment details?
I would hit the edit, if I didn’t like the provider I could change it or if I didn’t like the time and date I would edit it. 
- And what would you expect to happen after selecting the edit link?

- Great. Now go ahead and continue to the next step.

---

_**Participant is on success/detail page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and the information included here. I like to be able to see all your appointments. If I have multiple referrals I can click on the next one and start the process again. 
- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find after you just confirmed the appointment? I like that all the information is here, I can add it to my calendar, I can click and go to maps, and I can click and call from here instead of switching back and forth between here and the phone. I like the print option and the cancel appointment option. 

- Thank you. And lastly, how would you expect to be able to cancel or reschedule this appointment if you needed to? I think I would have to click the cancel the appointment link.
  
- Do you think you would have to call the community care provider to cancel the appointment? 
I would expect that if I clicked the link it would cancel the appointment and let the provider know.

## Task #2: Referral concept test - 5 minutes

- Thank you! I just have one more thing for you to review.
  
- Now I’ll have you go back to your list of appointments by selecting the "Review your appointments" link towards the top of the page. _(guide them back if needed)_

_**Participant is on appointment list page (no task card):**_
- Great. So, earlier, I asked you an open-ended question about where you would expect to find a list of your referrals. So, now, I’d like to get your feedback on an early concept for where those referrals might be located in this tool. 

- Earlier, you mentioned that _______. **_(RECAP where the participant expected to find referrals from their earlier responses.)_**.

- At this point, let's say you remembered you had another referral waiting to be self-scheduled. From this page, without selecting anything yet, where would you go to find that referral?
I would expect to hit the start scheduling. If I know that I have a referral and needed to schedule it that is where I would go. 
- And again, without selecting anything yet, where would you go on this page to review your older referrals from appointments you already completed? 
I would hit the past. 
- Ok, thank you. Now, I’ll have you navigate to your "Pending" appointments. 

---

_**Participant is on Pending page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and what’s included here.
First we have a dental referral that has not been scheduled yet. I'm not sure what the video link is for, for the podiatry referral. I see it's already scheduled and there is no scheduling link. Maybe it is a virtual appointment and that is what the video link is for. 
So cancelled requests, I don’t know if I like the line through it. It’s under the canceled request banner. If I canceled, maybe a reschedule link would be good. If I had to cancel it and would like to reschedule it, I would like to see a link there. I could go  back to the top and click the schedule link but if there was a reschedule option then all the information would just transfer over. 
- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find?
  
- Do you have any other comments or questions about the information presented on this page? Please don't hesitate to give us your feedback; this is a very early concept that may or may not be used.

-------

## Post-Task Interview - 1-2 minutes
- Ok, thank you! That concludes that activity and is everything we need to go through today.
  
- Do you have any other questions for me or additional comments about what we’ve reviewed today together?
  
- Ok, and just curious, would you expect VA to contact you if you haven't self-scheduled your first appointment leading up the referral's expiration date?
   - And, when and how would you expect for VA to contact you? (_If needed: For example, one week before the expiration date, one week after the referral was approved? For example, on VA.gov, by phone, by letter?_) 

- _If the participant agreed to record this session:_ 
   - Lastly, I'd like to confirm once again: **Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?"** We won’t share any information that identifies you, and we’ll remove your face and name from any videos if we do share them. 

      - _If yes:_ Thank you.
     
## Thank you and Closing - 1 minute
- Great. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on this tool and make sure it really works for Veterans.

- Thanks, and lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans who might be interested in participating in future research studies like this as well.

- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
