# Conversation guide

## Warm-up questions - 3 minutes 
- Before we go to the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions:

- Have you used the Appointments tool on VA.gov to schedule and manage your health appointments before? A couple of times yes. 

- And what device are you using to join this session today?
Android, Samsung Galaxy
- So, I will be sharing a web page link with you during this session. How would you prefer to receive the link? For example, I could send it through the Zoom (messages) chat or email it to you.

- _If the participant is using a screen reader: _
  - Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- _If the participant is using screen magnification:_
  - Are you using a screen magnification tool today? If so, what type? (For example, Zoom.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- Great. Thank you.

---
## Semi-structured interview - Referrals - 10 minutes
- We have a few different activities we’ll complete during this session. To start, I’ll ask you a few questions about receiving authorization from VA to receive care from another VA provider for specialty care or a community care provider.

- First off, have you received care from a community care provider before? (You don’t need to talk about what it was for.) Yes I have
  - _If yes:_ Could you talk me through how you got that (or typically get that) appointment scheduled? I had my VA provider set up the initial appointment, and then the follow-up appointments I do with the community care provider. 

  - _If no:_ No, problem. Have you ever received care from a VA provider that you needed VA's authorization for? 
    - _If yes:_ How did you schedule that appointment?

  - _If no to all:_ So, if you wanted to receive care from a community care provider in the future, could you tell me how you would go about requesting to receive care from them?

- What documentation would you expect to receive from your VA provider to receive care by another provider?

- And, what information would you expect to be included in that document (or documents)?

- Where would you expect to be able to find a record of that document on VA.gov, especially if it required you to self-schedule an appointment as a next step?  I wouldn’t know where to find that. 

- And, what about finding those documents for appointments that you've already had. Where would you expect to find those documents on VA.gov? 
I’m really not sure.

## Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

- Ok, thank you!
  
- So now I'll have you try a prototype for scheduling an appointment online with a community care provider, imagining that you recently requested to self-schedule physical therapy during a recent appointment.  

- Do you have any questions about that before we get started?

- Ok, I’m sending you the prototype link now. 

   - _Send [Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/DsRXEFiYLCFnY5nBkp9Dc4/CC-Referral-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=294-3585&t=LCu6HynSx7l1uQBW-1)._

- You can go ahead and select that link. And let me know when you have that open. 


```
   [If needed: Instructions for opening chat]

   - Ok. Now go ahead and tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap (or select) the screen a menu will appear at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) “Chat."
```


- Ok, now I’d like to be able to see your screen so I can see how you’re using the prototype. **Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me today?**
   - _If no:_ No problem. In that case, would you be able to describe aloud to me what you are doing as you go through the prototype?
     - _If still no, for non-screen reader users, moderator can choose to share their own screen._
        - No problem. I'd like to try something else. I'll share my screen and control the prototype, but you can tell me what you would do next and I'll do that. How does that sound?
          
        - _Skip to [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/DsRXEFiYLCFnY5nBkp9Dc4/CC-Referral-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=294-3585&t=LCu6HynSx7l1uQBW-1)._ 

   - _If yes:_ Great. Now, if there’s any apps, web pages or notifications on your device that you’d like to close or turn off before I’m able to see your screen, I’ll give you a moment to do that now.


```
  [If needed: Screen Sharing Instructions - 2 Minutes]

   - So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.
   - Tap (or select) the screen anywhere.
   - And, as you tap the screen a menu will open at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) "Share." If you can’t find “Share” in that menu, you may need to tap the menu and drag it to the left to uncover more options.
   - And, when you find the “Share” option, go ahead and select it.
   - Then, tap (or select) "Screen."
   - Then, tap the words, “Start Broadcast.”
   - Now, tap (or select) anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen that starts with "Everything on your screen."
```

_**Participant starts at Text message:**_

- Now, imagine you just received this text message from VA. 

- Go ahead and review it, but don't select anything yet. 

- Is there anything that's confusing about this information?
No it’s pretty apparent to me that I need to click on the link and it will take me to schedule the appointment. 
- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here and go ahead and do that. 

---

_**Participant is at mock sign in page:**_

- At this point you would sign in to VA.gov, but go ahead and choose ID.me, since this is just a prototype representing a sign in.
  
- And, go ahead and begin to add your email address and it will auto-populate some information.
  
- Great. Now, go ahead and select "Sign in" to continue.
  
- And, once more, go ahead and begin to enter the 6-digit code that was, if we're imagining, texted to you.

- Perfect. And, go ahead and select "Continue." 

---

_**Participant is at Appointment list:**_

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Could you tell me if this is where you were you expecting to end up after selecting the link in the text message? Yeah it tells me about the referral and there is a link to schedule my appointment. IT’s pretty much what I expected to see.

- Now let’s review what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
I see it also has a list of other appointments I already have scheduled.
  - _Things to watch for:_
    - _Do they mention the referral task card/notification?_
    - _Do they mention the expiration date of the referral?_

  - _If needed:_
    - What did you expect to be on this page?
    - Is anything information on this page confusing?
No it’s pretty self explanatory. I would be able to work through this. 

- Without doing anything yet, tell me a little about what you’d do next on this page based on the text message you received. Click on the schedule appointment. First I would review my scheduled appointments and then I would schedule my appointment. 

- _If task card was not mentioned:_ 
  - Did you notice anything about a scheduling an appointment? 
  - Did you notice the box at the top of the page? And, what does that seem to mean to you?

- _If expiration date was not mentioned:_
  - Did you notice the expiration date for scheduling an appointment? And, what was your reaction when reviewing it? I expected the expiration date, I have an experience with that in the past. It’s not unexpected, it’s a little long then I would expect. 
I would do this right then and there.
  - Was there anything confusing about that information?

- Ok, still thinking out loud as you go along, go ahead and go through the process you'd follow to schedule the appointment mentioned in the text message you received.
It’s telling me what the appointment is for, how long I have to schedule it, who I am going to schedule it with. It’s all pretty clear to me. 
---

_**Participant is on referral page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about the information on this page?

- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page? Nothing I would expect to see everything I need to know is here. 

- How clear are the steps for what you should do next?

- Ok, and before you do anything here, I have a few more questions: 

   - What are the most important factors to you when choosing a provider? Let's say, to find a new primary care provider for routine care? Prefer my primary care be an actual Physician over a PA or NP because I have a lot of issues. My level of care needs to be an actual physician. I can’t think of anything else I would be looking for. 
      - (Provide examples if needed, but try not to be leading: for example, their reputation, their distance to your home, etc.)

   - And, what about if you're choosing a provider for specialty care? For example, you’re searching for an orthopedic specialist that can do a total knee replacement. What would be the most important factors when choosing a provider? No just as long as they are Board certified. I like to know they have the certifications and meets all the requirements to be certified. 

- Ok, thank you. Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next on this page.

---

_**Participant is on provider page:**_ 
- Tell me about this page.
I would assume the preferred provider is who I asked my physician about at the time of my appointment. There are other choices other than the preferred provider. 
- _If preferred provider wasn't mentioned:_ What's your understanding of the box at the top of the page?
  
- And without doing anything, I'm curious -- from here, how would you continue through finding a provider if I wasn't guiding you?
Assuming the one I want to use is on this page I would look at availability and schedule my appointment.
- Ok thanks. And, what would you do if you wanted to search for a specific group or category of providers?
It gives me a filter and sort, I would click on that. 
- Go ahead and walk me through how you'd do that.
  
- **Did you notice the "Filter and sort" link? Okay, now go ahead and select that link.**
  
---

_**Participant is on filter page:**_ 

- Tell me about this page.
Give me a list of choices to filter, I can then sort it based on distance. 
- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  No not really, I can’t see any further screening I would see necessary. 
- Is this information what you expected to find?

[ONLINE SCHEDULING FILTER]

- _If online scheduling option was not mentioned:_ And what about the third filter on the screen? what does that mean to you?
 
- _If not yet mentioned:_ And, if the provider you knew you wanted to schedule with did NOT have online scheduling, would you still expect to find information on that provider in this tool? 
It would be nice to have it as a point of reference, down the road I wanted to use a different practitioner that does not have online scheduling. 
    - _If yes:_ What information would you expect to find for that provider? Location and availability, contact information. 
    - _If no:_ Could you tell me more about that? Why not? 
 
- And if the provider you preferred to schedule with didn't offer online scheduling at this time, would that change your decision on who to schedule with? Probably not, I’m not opposed to making a phone call. I’m an analog guy in a digital world. 

[GENERAL]

- And what about the rest of the filters on this page? Is there anything confusing about those?
  
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find?

- Ok, and without doing anything yet, could you describe what filters you might select on this page?
  
- Ok, for the purposes of this session, you can go ahead and select [Practice], then the first option, and [Only show providers with online scheduling]. Then, submit those choices. 
Distance and the first practice group, check box for online scheduling and the box for female. 
---

_**Participant is on 2nd provider page:**_
- Tell me about this page now.
  A list of females, they all meet the filters I picked. 
- What's your understanding of the provider list now that you selected those filter choices?
  - _If needed:_ How has the page changed?
  - _If needed:_ How do you know that those choices were selected?
They all have female names and belong to the same medical group. 
- And how does this match up to what you expected to find after submitting those options? 
It’s pretty much I expected, it still has my preferred provider as I expected. 
- Ok, thank you. Let's pretend that the first provider under "All providers" matches what you're looking for. Go ahead and choose that provider.


---

_**Participant is on choose time and date page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  No it’s pretty self-explanatory. 
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?
No I imagine all I do is click on a date and hit continue and it will give me available times.
- Now, slowly walk me through how you would continue from here and go ahead and take those next steps. _(Stop participant to ask about any usability hurdles)_
If I pick the 26 it automatically shows me time. I click a time and continue
---

_**Participant is on review/confirm choices page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about this page?

- Without selecting anything, what would you do if you wanted to change some of your appointment details? I would click the back button and go pick a different date and time. 

- And what would you expect to happen after selecting the edit link?
I would go to a screen to change something if I needed to. I don’t know why I would need to edit anything. Maybe provider. 
Okay well let’s try to do that and see where it takes us. 
It took me back to the main list of providers. I would have expected it to take me to the providers that I had filtered. I would have to go back and filter it out, and then look for new date and time. 
- Great. Now go ahead and continue to the next step.

---

_**Participant is on success/detail page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and the information included here. 
It gives me options to review my appointments, schedule a new appointment if I wanted to. I have the option to print, to cancel, add it to my calendar. I didn’t expect to add it to my calendar option I didn’t know I could do that. 
- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find after you just confirmed the appointment?

- Thank you. And lastly, how would you expect to be able to cancel or reschedule this appointment if you needed to? There is a link to cancel or schedule an appointment. I would schedule a new appointment first then cancel. I don’t see a link here to change or reschedule. 
  
- Do you think you would have to call the community care provider to cancel the appointment? 

----

## Task #2: Referral concept test - 5 minutes

- Thank you! I just have one more thing for you to review.
  
- Now I’ll have you go back to your list of appointments by selecting the "Review your appointments" link towards the top of the page. _(guide them back if needed)_

_**Participant is on appointment list page (no task card):**_
- Great. So, earlier, I asked you an open-ended question about where you would expect to find a list of your referrals. So, now, I’d like to get your feedback on an early concept for where those referrals might be located in this tool. I think I would want to click on start scheduling and hopefully I would see something there. I am kind of unsure, I am guessing I would have to click on start scheduling. 

- Earlier, you mentioned that _______. **_(RECAP where the participant expected to find referrals from their earlier responses.)_**.

- At this point, let's say you remembered you had another referral waiting to be self-scheduled. From this page, without selecting anything yet, where would you go to find that referral?

- And again, without selecting anything yet, where would you go on this page to review your older referrals from appointments you already completed? For appointments I already had, I would click on the menu from the top and see what drops down there. 

- Ok, thank you. Now, I’ll have you navigate to your "Pending" appointments. 

---

_**Participant is on Pending page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and what’s included here.

- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find?
  This is all new to me, it’s something I have never experienced before. It’s nice to know that it’s going to be available. 
I would click on the one I want to work on. I would click on the details link and go from there. 
- Do you have any other comments or questions about the information presented on this page? Please don't hesitate to give us your feedback; this is a very early concept that may or may not be used.

-------

## Post-Task Interview - 1-2 minutes
- Ok, thank you! That concludes that activity and is everything we need to go through today.
  
- Do you have any other questions for me or additional comments about what we’ve reviewed today together? It is nice to know that this will be available, and I don’t have to bother the VA. There will be minimal interactions with people. 
  
- Ok, and just curious, would you expect VA to contact you if you haven't self-scheduled your first appointment leading up the referral's expiration date?
   - And, when and how would you expect for VA to contact you? (_If needed: For example, one week before the expiration date, one week after the referral was approved? For example, on VA.gov, by phone, by letter?_) 

- _If the participant agreed to record this session:_ 
   - Lastly, I'd like to confirm once again: **Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?"** We won’t share any information that identifies you, and we’ll remove your face and name from any videos if we do share them. 

      - _If yes:_ Thank you.
     
## Thank you and Closing - 1 minute
- Great. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on this tool and make sure it really works for Veterans.

- Thanks, and lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans who might be interested in participating in future research studies like this as well.

- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
