## Warm up questions - 3 minutes 
- Before we go to the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions:

- Have you used the Appointments tool on VA.gov to schedule and manage your health appointments before? Yes

- And, what device are you using to join this session today? iPhone did not work had to switch to Desktop and used JAWS

- So, I will be sharing a web page link with you during this session. How would you prefer to receive the link? For example, I could send it through the Zoom (messages) chat or email it to you.

- _If the participant is using a screen reader:_
  - Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- _If the participant is using screen magnification:_
  - Are you using a screen magnification tool today? If so, what type? (For example, Zoom.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- Great. Thank you.

---
## Semi-structured interview - Referrals - 10 minutes
- We have a few different activities we’ll complete during this session. To start, I’ll ask you a few questions about receiving authorization from VA to receive care from another VA provider for specialty care or a community care provider.

- First off, have you received care from a community care provider before? (You don’t need to talk about what it was for.) Not too often I usually use the VA. 
 
 - _If yes:_ Could you talk me through how you got that (or typically get that) appointment scheduled?

  - _If no:_ No, problem. Have you ever received care from a VA provider that you needed VA's authorization for?
    - _If yes:_ How did you schedule that appointment?

  - _If no to all:_ So, if you wanted to receive care from a community care provider in the future, could you tell me how you would go about requesting to receive care from them?

- What documentation would you expect to receive from your VA provider to receive care by another provider?

- And, what information would you expect to be included in that document (or documents)?

- Where would you expect to be able to find a record of that document on VA.gov, especially if it required you to self-schedule an appointment as a next step?

- And, what about finding those documents for appointments that you've already had. Where would you expect to find those documents on VA.gov?

## Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

- Ok, thank you!
  
- So now I'll have you try a prototype for scheduling an appointment online with a community care provider, imagining that you recently requested to self-schedule physical therapy during a recent appointment.  

- Do you have any questions about that before we get started?

- Ok, I’m sending you the prototype link now. 

   - _Send [Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/DsRXEFiYLCFnY5nBkp9Dc4/CC-Referral-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=294-3585&t=LCu6HynSx7l1uQBW-1)._

- You can go ahead and select that link. And let me know when you have that open. 


```
   [If needed: Instructions for opening chat]

   - Ok. Now go ahead and tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap (or select) the screen a menu will appear at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) “Chat."
```


- Ok, now I’d like to be able to see your screen so I can see how you’re using the prototype. **Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me today?**
   - _If no:_ No problem. In that case, would you be able to describe aloud to me what you are doing as you go through the prototype?
     - _If still no, for non-screen reader users, moderator can choose to share their own screen._
        - No problem. I'd like to try something else. I'll share my screen and control the prototype, but you can tell me what you would do next and I'll do that. How does that sound?
          
        - _Skip to [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/DsRXEFiYLCFnY5nBkp9Dc4/CC-Referral-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=294-3585&t=LCu6HynSx7l1uQBW-1)._ 

   - _If yes:_ Great. Now, if there’s any apps, web pages or notifications on your device that you’d like to close or turn off before I’m able to see your screen, I’ll give you a moment to do that now.


```
  [If needed: Screen Sharing Instructions - 2 Minutes]

   - So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.
   - Tap (or select) the screen anywhere.
   - And, as you tap the screen a menu will open at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) "Share." If you can’t find “Share” in that menu, you may need to tap the menu and drag it to the left to uncover more options.
   - And, when you find the “Share” option, go ahead and select it.
   - Then, tap (or select) "Screen."
   - Then, tap the words, “Start Broadcast.”
   - Now, tap (or select) anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen that starts with "Everything on your screen."
```

_**Participant starts at Text message:**_

- Now, imagine you just received this text message from VA. 
I would click on the http//: Link

- Go ahead and review it, but don't select anything yet. 

Need help? I would put this out front and center, if they need help they need help. 

- Is there anything that's confusing about this information?

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here and go ahead and do that. 

---

_**Participant is at mock sign in page:**_

- At this point you would sign in to VA.gov, but go ahead and choose ID.me, since this is just a prototype representing a sign in.
  
- And, go ahead and begin to add your email address and it will auto-populate some information.
  
- Great. Now, go ahead and select "Sign in" to continue.
  
- And, once more, go ahead and begin to enter the 6-digit code that was, if we're imagining, texted to you.

- Perfect. And, go ahead and select "Continue." 

---

_**Participant is at Appointment list:**_

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Could you tell me if this is where you were you expecting to end up after selecting the link in the text message? 
The Talk to The Veterans Crisis Line Now tab is a good thing, someone with a mental health crisis need to see this first!
“Breadcrumb” is confusing don’t use that language say specifically what it is. 
Start scheduling Link, good clear!
Expires in 310 days, what is that? What expires in 310 days? I don’t know what you mean. 
You can now schedule your PT community care appointment. That is very clear, but the 310 days is not clear. 
Language has to be clear and concise, or it will confuse people. 
Upcoming, pending , past that is clear it makes sense. 
July 2024 that should be at the top. 

12:30 pm PT Primary care with J.K. Hoffman is this a different provider? 
These are two different appointments. Oh ok, hum… I don’t know it’s a little confusing. Details link I guess that is ok. 
Some of the prototype glitches are confusing ex. July 55? 
Scrolling down, need help… If you need help scheduling your appointment please call your VA community care health facility. That’s good… this should be put up where schedule your appointment is. Do you have a number linked with this or will you. 

Get rid of the breadcrumbs! 

- Now let’s review what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?

  - _Things to watch for:_
    - _Do they mention the referral task card/notification?_
    - _Do they mention the expiration date of the referral?_

  - _If needed:_
    - What did you expect to be on this page?
    - Is anything information on this page confusing?

- Without doing anything yet, tell me a little about what you’d do next on this page based on the text message you received.
The two different scheduling links are confusing. Just Schedule your appointment that’s all you need.
Crisis line again is important. 

- _If task card was not mentioned:_ 
  - Did you notice anything about a scheduling an appointment? 
  - Did you notice the box at the top of the page? And, what does that seem to mean to you?

- _If expiration date was not mentioned:_
  - Did you notice the expiration date for scheduling an appointment? And, what was your reaction when reviewing it?
  - Was there anything confusing about that information?
*The headers, Flag “official united states government” then crisis line info and then VA info over and over is redundant to this screen reader. He just wants to go to schedule appointment. He got stuck in chrome browser. 
- Ok, still thinking out loud as you go along, go ahead and go through the process you'd follow to schedule the appointment mentioned in the text message you received.
I would click on the Schedule your appointment link.
---

_**Participant is on referral page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about the information on this page?
What do you mean by expiration date? Do I expire in 30 days or… Does the referral expire in 30 days? I don’t understand.
State “Your referral will expire in 30 days” make it clear. 
Type of care: physical therapy… Perfect very clear. 
Number of visits, is that the number that I had or have? I think it means the number I had. 
“ You are approved for 10 visits” make it clear.
Referral number, what is that?
Details you shared? What’s that I didn’t know I was sharing anything. 
“Details you shared with your PCP”
Booking note? 
How about notes on your appointment?
DO you have any questions about your referral, that’s good to know. Need help contact the VA. Phone number that is good!
Need help that’s more important then the flag. I have nothing against the flag but need help that’s important.
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?

- How clear are the steps for what you should do next?

- Ok, and before you do anything here, I have a few more questions: 

   - What are the most important factors to you when choosing a provider? Let's say, to find a new primary care provider for routine care? 
      - (Provide examples if needed, but try not to be leading: for example, their reputation, their distance to your home, etc.)

   - And, what about if you're choosing a provider for specialty care? For example, you’re searching for an orthopedic specialist that can do a total knee replacement. What would be the most important factors when choosing a provider?

- Ok, thank you. Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next on this page.

---

_**Participant is on provider page:**_ 
Talk to someone now button, that is important! If you get frustrated and need help that should be here. Need help now. 
The back button, is confusing you are trying to make the appointment  you don’t want to go back.

- Tell me about this page.
Next Available: July 6, 20204 then goes to review available appointments that doesn’t make sense. I think I can see him July 26 but now you are telling me view available appointments. Which one is it next available appointment is July 26th or I have to review available appointments?
I would say review upcoming appointments. That way I can look at other appointments if the 25th doesn’t work for me.
- _If preferred provider wasn't mentioned: _ What's your understanding of the box at the top of the page?
  
- And without doing anything, I'm curious -- from here, how would you continue through finding a provider if I wasn't guiding you?

- Ok thanks. And, what would you do if you wanted to search for a specific group or category of providers?

- Go ahead and walk me through how you'd do that.
  
- **Did you notice the "Filter and sort" link? Okay, now go ahead and select that link.**
  Filter and sort what? Sorting 52 providers for primary care is that… Are you trying to say filter your appointment? It’s confusing. 
Scrolling down…Next available appointment July 9th what time?
Participant chose Dr. Chistina Jones and skipped the filter process. 
While on all providers list, he chose Christina Jones. It says next available: July 26th how do I know what date and time? I guess I would click on review available appointments. 

---

_**Participant is on filter page:**_ 
Redirected to the filter page. 

- Tell me about this page.
Why do I need to filter, I don’t understand.
The page did not display properly. Facilitator had to explain the purpose of filter. Had to skip filter process.
- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  
- Is this information what you expected to find?

[ONLINE SCHEDULING FILTER]

- _If online scheduling option was not mentioned:_ And what about the third filter on the screen? what does that mean to you?
 
- _If not yet mentioned:_ And, if the provider you knew you wanted to schedule with did NOT have online scheduling, would you still expect to find information on that provider in this tool? 
    - _If yes:_ What information would you expect to find for that provider?
    - _If no:_ Could you tell me more about that? Why not? 
 
- And if the provider you preferred to schedule with didn't offer online scheduling at this time, would that change your decision on who to schedule with?

[GENERAL]

- And what about the rest of the filters on this page? Is there anything confusing about those?
  
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find?

- Ok, and without doing anything yet, could you describe what filters you might select on this page?
  
- Ok, for the purposes of this session, you can go ahead and select [Practice], then the first option, and [Only show providers with online scheduling]. Then, submit those choices. 

---

_**Participant is on 2nd provider page:**_
- Tell me about this page now.
  
- What's your understanding of the provider list now that you selected those filter choices?
  - _If needed:_ How has the page changed?
  - _If needed:_ How do you know that those choices were selected?

- And how does this match up to what you expected to find after submitting those options? 

- Ok, thank you. Let's pretend that the first provider under "All providers" matches what you're looking for. Go ahead and choose that provider.

---

_**Participant is on choose time and date page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
 
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?
- Now, slowly walk me through how you would continue from here and go ahead and take those next steps. _(Stop participant to ask about any usability hurdles)_
I want to select a time. I will click review appointments and see what happens. The way the Choose date reads is slightly confusing, however, going down the next line the radio buttons clear the confusion and he realizes he can pick the time. 
I want to choose a time faster this is too much.
Why is there a back button, you want to continue with your appointment not go back.

Out of time here. Quickly what would you expect if you clicked continue.
I would want to know that this appointment was successfully continued and I would expect an email to confirm it was successful. 
---

_**Participant is on review/confirm choices page:**_
- Is there anything confusing about this page?

- Without selecting anything, what would you do if you wanted to change some of your appointment details?

- And what would you expect to happen after selecting the edit link?

- Great. Now go ahead and continue to the next step.

---

_**Participant is on success/detail page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and the information included here. 

- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find after you just confirmed the appointment?

- Thank you. And lastly, how would you expect to be able to cancel or reschedule this appointment if you needed to?
  
- Do you think you would have to call the community care provider to cancel the appointment? 

----

## Task #2: Referral concept test - 5 minutes

- Thank you! I just have one more thing for you to review.
  
- Now I’ll have you go back to your list of appointments by selecting the "Review your appointments" link towards the top of the page. _(guide them back if needed)_

_**Participant is on appointment list page (no task card):**_
- Great. So, earlier, I asked you an open-ended question about where you would expect to find a list of your referrals. So, now, I’d like to get your feedback on an early concept for where those referrals might be located in this tool. 

- Earlier, you mentioned that _______. **_(RECAP where the participant expected to find referrals from their earlier responses.)_**.

- At this point, let's say you remembered you had another referral waiting to be self-scheduled. From this page, without selecting anything yet, where would you go to find that referral?

- And again, without selecting anything yet, where would you go on this page to review your older referrals from appointments you already completed? 

- Ok, thank you. Now, I’ll have you navigate to your "Pending" appointments. 

---

_**Participant is on Pending page:**_
- Talk to me about this page and what’s included here.

- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find?
  
- Do you have any other comments or questions about the information presented on this page? Please don't hesitate to give us your feedback; this is a very early concept that may or may not be used.

-------

## Post-Task Interview - 1-2 minutes
- Ok, thank you! That concludes that activity and is everything we need to go through today.
  
- Do you have any other questions for me or additional comments about what we’ve reviewed today together?
  
- Ok, and just curious, would you expect VA to contact you if you haven't self-scheduled your first appointment leading up the referral's expiration date?
   - And, when and how would you expect for VA to contact you? (_If needed: For example, one week before the expiration date, one week after the referral was approved? For example, on VA.gov, by phone, by letter?_)
