# Community Care Self-Scheduling - Usability and Concept Testing
## Background
**The Cleland Dole Act** addresses Veteran homelessness, access to care, community care, mental health, research, telehealth, prostate cancer, provider oversight and transparency, long-term care, rural health, benefits, information technology and more. 

**Self-Scheduling and Community Care Self-scheduling Pilot Program**
- As a congressional mandate under the Cleland-Dole Act, VA must address the following for Veterans by the end of 2024:
Self-scheduling appointments
- Allows Veterans seeking for primary care, specialty care, and mental health care under the Veteran’s Community Care Program to self-schedule, modify, and cancel appointments directly online
- Allows VA to expand capabilities of an existing appointment self-scheduling technology or purchase a new appointment self-scheduling technology

**The pilot program MVP will allow Veterans at pilot sites in the Greater Los Angeles area to self-schedule physical therapy appointments using Appointments on va.gov once a referral is approved. They will also have the ability to cancel and reschedule those appointments.**


### OCTO Priorities
The Community Care Self-Scheduling feature aligns with the following OCTO-DE Priorities:
- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey
This research corresponds to the following points of the Veteran journey:
- Taking care of myself

-------

## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans on the CC appointment scheduling process and develop a better understanding of Veterans’ expectations around referrals. We also hope to evaluate reactions to initial concepts for referral locations. 

### Outcome
This study will give us insight into 
- if Veterans find it easy to schedule their community care appointments using the proposed scheduling process 
- where Veterans expect to find their new and past referrals, and what information they expect referrals to contain
- if our initial concepts for referral locations fit Veterans’ needs and expectations within the Appointments experience 

### Research Questions

#### Referrals
- What terms do Veterans use to describe the process of getting approved to schedule a community care appointment and then scheduling that appointment? Is referral the correct term to use for this process?
  
- **New referrals**
  - Where do Veterans expect to find their new referrals to schedule a related appointment?
  - What information are Veterans generally looking for in new referrals?
  - How do the concepts presented address or not address Veterans’ expectations around referrals?
  
- **Past referrals**
  - Where do Veterans expect to find information about past referrals?
  - What information are Veterans generally looking for in past referrals?
  - What, if anything, would Veterans use past referrals for?

#### Scheduling Flow
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to start the scheduling process via a text (or email) notification and Appointments list task card prompt?
  **Referral expiration:** Do Veterans find the expiration date on the referral task card helpful? 
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to schedule their community care appointments using the new CC scheduling flow?
  - **Referral page:** Do Veterans understand the information included on the Referral page and what it means for their scheduling options?
  - **Sort and filter:**
    - How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to tailor their provider list via the filter/sort options?
    - Do Veterans find the sort and filter options helpful when searching for a physical therapist (e.g., provider)?
  - **Review page:** Do Veterans understand the Review page information as it relates to their scheduling choices, and how to edit those choices?
- Do Veterans expect to find information in this tool for providers that DO NOT offer online scheduling (in order to schedule by phone)?
- What, if any, scheduling needs or preferences do Veterans have that are not currently addressed in the CC scheduling flow?

### Hypotheses
#### Referrals
- What terms do Veterans use to describe the process of getting approved to schedule a community care appointment and then scheduling that appointment? Is referral the correct term to use for this process? 
  - HYPOTHESIS: The majority of Veterans will use the term “referrals” when referring to community care requested and approved by VA.
- **New referrals**
  - Where do Veterans expect to find their new referrals to schedule a related appointment?
    - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans expect to receive notifications about referrals and find their new/active referrals on the Appointment list.
  - What information are Veterans generally looking for in new referrals?
    - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will be looking for general referral information around type of care and number of visits approved, as well as information on the provider and location preferences they previously indicated.
- How do the concepts presented address or not address Veterans’ expectations around referrals?
  - HYPOTHESIS: The concept presented (using the task card to surface actionable referrals on the appointment list, while including all referrals within the Pending appointments) will align with Veterans’ expectations of new/actionable referrals. 
- **Past referrals**
  - Where do Veterans expect to find information about past referrals?
    - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans expect to find information on past referrals somewhere in Pending appointments or within medical records on MHV.
  - What information are Veterans generally looking for in past referrals?
    - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will be looking for general information around type of care, number of visits approved, and referring VA facility.
  - What, if anything, would Veterans use past referrals for?
    - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans need to be able to access referrals as part of their records, and will want to use past referrals to obtain another referral of the same kind.
  - How do the concepts presented address or not address Veterans’ expectations around referrals?
    - HYPOTHESIS: The concept presented (referrals housed within Pending appointments) will not align with where Veterans expect to find referrals.

#### Scheduling Flow
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to start the scheduling process via a text (or email) notification and Appointments list task card prompt?
    - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will find it easy to start the scheduling process via text or email notification, as the steps follow a similar process as other VA reminders and prompts.
  - **Referral expiration:** Do Veterans find the expiration date on the referral task card helpful? 
    - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will find the expiration date helpful, but might be confused by the duration it's good until. 
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to schedule their community care appointments using the new CC scheduling flow?
    - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will easily find a provider and schedule an appointment.
  - **Referral page:** Do Veterans understand the information included on the Referral page and what it means for their scheduling options?
    - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will understand their referral information but will not know what it means for scheduling options until arriving on the provider list. 
  - **Sort and filter:**
    - How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to tailor their provider list via the filter/sort options?
      - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will easily use the sort/filter options to find a provider.
    - Do Veterans find the sort and filter options helpful when searching for a physical therapist (e.g., provider)?
      - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will find the filters extremely helpful when searching for a provider. 
  - **Review page:** Do Veterans understand the Review page information as it relates to their scheduling choices, and how to edit those choices?
    - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will understand the information on the Review page and will know how to edit their choices.
- Do Veterans expect to find information in this tool for providers that DO NOT offer online scheduling (in order to schedule by phone)?
  - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans expect to find information on all eligible providers they can choose from, regardless of if they can schedule via self-scheduling or by phone.  
- What, if any, scheduling needs or preferences do Veterans have that are not currently addressed in the CC scheduling flow?
    - HYPOTHESIS: Veterans will expect more filtering options and additional provider information.

## Methodology

This research will be conducted as a moderated study using Zoom. After some initial questions around referrals, we will have participants go through a prototype for the scheduling flow. The moderator will then have the participant review an initial concept for housing referrals in the pending section in Appointments.

### Location
The study will be conducted online via Zoom.
