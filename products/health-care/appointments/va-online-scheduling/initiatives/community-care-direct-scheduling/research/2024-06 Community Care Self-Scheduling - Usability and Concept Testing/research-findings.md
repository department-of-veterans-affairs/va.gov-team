## Hypotheses and Conclusions

### General referrals
- The majority of Veterans will use the term “referrals” when referring to community care requested and approved by VA. 
  - LIKELY TRUE
### New referrals
- Veterans expect to receive notifications about referrals and find their new/active referrals on the Appointment list.
  - MAYBE TRUE
- Veterans will be looking for general referral information around type of care and number of visits approved, as well as information on the provider and location preferences they previously indicated.
  - MABYE TRUE
- The concept presented (using the task card to surface actionable referrals on the appointment list, while including all referrals within the Pending appointments) will align with Veterans’ expectations of new/actionable referrals.
  - LIKELY TRUE

### Past referrals
- Veterans expect to find information on past referrals somewhere in Pending appointments or within medical records on MHV.
  - SOMEWHAT TRUE  
- Veterans will be looking for general information around type of care, number of visits approved, and referring VA facility.
  - INCONCLUSIVE 
- Veterans need to be able to access referrals as part of their records, and will want to use past referrals to obtain another referral of the same kind.
  - INCONCLUSIVE 
- The concept presented (referrals housed within Pending appointments) will not align with where Veterans expect to find referrals.
  - LIKELY TRUE 

### Scheduling Flow
- Veterans will find it easy to start the scheduling process via text or email notification, as the steps follow a similar process as other VA reminders and prompts.
  - DEFINITELY TRUE 
- **Referral expiration:** Veterans will find the expiration date helpful, but might be confused by the duration it's good until. 
   - DEFINITELY TRUE  
- Veterans will easily find a provider and schedule an appointment.
  - LIKELY TRUE
- **Referral page:** Veterans will understand their referral information but will not know what it means for scheduling options until arriving on the provider list.
  - LIKELY TRUE  
- **Sort and filter:**
  - Veterans will easily use the sort/filter options to find a provider.
    - HYPOTHESIS: LIKELY TRUE
  - Veterans will find the filters extremely helpful when searching for a provider. 
    - INCONCLUSIVE 
- **Review page:** Veterans will understand the information on the Review page and will know how to edit their choices.
  - DEFINITELY TRUE 
- Veterans expect to find information on all eligible providers they can choose from, regardless of if they can schedule via self-scheduling or by phone.
  - DEFINITELY TRUE  
- Veterans will expect more filtering options and additional provider information.
    - DEFINITELY TRUE

## Key Findings

### Referrals
- What terms do Veterans use to describe the process of receiving authorization from VA to schedule an appointment with a community care provider? 
  - **[Finding # 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-1):** One third of participants, without moderator prompts, identified the process or document received when VA has approved care by a community care provider as a “referral,” while others used different terms such as consult, request, authorization, or were not sure what term to use.

- Where do Veterans expect to find new referrals that are waiting to be self-scheduled?
  - **[Finding # 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-2):** Before concept testing, participants expected to find new referrals in Appointments on va.gov or within My HealtheVet, with more participants indicating they’d look in My HealtheVet.
- Where do Veterans expect to find their past referrals?
  - **[Finding # 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-3):** Before concept testing, participants weren’t confident in where they expected to find past referrals, but mentioned both Appointments and Medical Records.
- **Concept testing:** How do the concepts presented in the prototype address or not address Veterans’ expectations around referrals?
  - **[Finding # 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-4):** Slightly less than half of participants were able to find a link to navigate to review all of their referrals in the prototype, but the majority of participants were able to identify where to look for older referrals. 

### Self-scheduling user flow
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to start the scheduling process from a text message and a task card component on the Appointments landing page?
  - **[Finding # 5](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-5):** The majority of participants were able to easily start the scheduling process from the Appointments list task card, while 2 participants selected the incorrect link.

- Do Veterans find the referral expiration date helpful? 
  - **[Finding # 6](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-6):** The majority of participants noticed the expiration date of the referral and found the presence of this information helpful, but many found the expiration date used in the prototype (e.g., 310 days) and wording to be confusing or misleading.
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to schedule their community care appointments using the prototype?
  - **[Finding #7](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-7):** Participants were able to easily navigate the scheduling process and complete all tasks, but did run into challenges at two points. In addition, many participants offered unprompted positive feedback around the tool.
- Do Veterans understand the information and what to do next on the referral introduction page?
  - **[Finding # 8](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-8):** Participants understood the information on the referral introduction page as a whole, but had some questions and suggestions for additional information. All participants were able to easily find the "schedule appointment" call to action.
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to find the right provider using the filter and sort?
  - **[Finding # 9](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-9):** The filter pattern did not present any usability concerns, but our results lacked conclusive evidence that Veterans would use the feature prior to prompting them to use it. Though participants said the filters met overall expectations, some called out specific filters as confusing or missing. 
- Do Veterans expect to find providers in this tool that DO NOT offer online scheduling (e.g., schedule by phone)?
  - **[Finding # 10](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-10):** Of the four participants we had time to ask, all four understood the "online scheduling" filter and found it beneficial. However, participants also expected to find providers that didn’t offer online scheduling and told us they would call and schedule with those providers, if needed. 
- Would Veterans expect that they’d have to call the community care provider or VA to let them know they canceled a scheduled community care appointment?
  - **[Finding # 11](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-11):** Participants knew how to cancel their appointments in the prototype and understood there was no reason to take an additional step to call. Although 1 participant still said they’d call the office after canceling to make sure it had worked.
 
### Expectations for VA staff follow up
- Would Veterans expect VA to contact them if they hadn't self-scheduled their referral in a certain amount of time? If so, in how many days? 

   - **[Finding # 12](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-12):** The majority of participants said they would expect VA to contact them if they haven't self-scheduled their appointment within a certain amount of time.

## Details of Key Findings

### Referrals

#### Finding #1: 

**One third of participants, without moderator prompts, identified the process or document received when VA has approved care by a community care provider as a “referral,” while others used different terms such as consult, request, authorization, or were not sure what term to use.**

- 5 of 15 participants identified an approved consult as a referral during contextual inquiries, compared to 10 of 15 participants named it something else or did not have a confident response.

> P2: "VA told me to standby and they would send the referral in. And then a day or two after that the community care provider called me."

> P16: "I put in the request through my primary care physician, but then someone from my VA home base called me back. They gave me some choices of who to go to."

> P3: "I sent a secure message to my primary - 'I need a consult for endocrinology for this date, this location, this doctor for my follow-up. They forward it to CC and hopefully it gets done because I already have the appointment.'"

> P12: "You have to tell your provider and they will send it to somebody for authorization and then they call you and they set up appointments."

#### Finding #2: 

**Before concept testing, participants expected to find new referrals in Appointments on va.gov or within My HealtheVet, with more participants indicating they’d look in My HealtheVet.**

- When asked where Veterans might expect to find new referrals waiting to be self-scheduled online, 2/8 participants said they’d go to Appointments on VA.gov and 5/8 participants said they’d go to My HealtheVet, with 1 of these 5 participants saying they’d then go to Appointments to schedule their appointment. 1 participant said he’d have his wife take care of it and wasn’t sure where she’d navigate.

> P17: "I would see if there's a link for referrals [on the Appointments page to find other referrals that need to be scheduled]. Referral would be the only way I know. Referrals or referrals to be scheduled."

> P5: "Probably in My HealtheVet [is where I would navigate to find a referral]. I typically look at my Blue Button to make sure my [provider] notes are correct and the appointment information is correct."

#### Finding #3: 

**Before concept testing, participants weren’t confident in where they expected to find past referrals, but mentioned both Appointments and Medical Records.**

- To locate past referrals, 1 participant said they'd go to their Health tab and navigate to either Appointments or Medical Records, 2 participants would go to their past Appointments on VA.gov, and 2 participants didn’t know where they'd navigate.

> P6: "Well I’m guessing it would be somewhere under health, health records."

> P2: "Definitely would go to my appointments and see if past authorizations are there."

> P7: "I really wouldn't know where to find that for community care appointments. I’m really not sure, to be honest with you."

#### Finding #4: 

**Slightly less than half of participants were able to find a link to navigate to review all of their referrals in the prototype, but the majority of participants were able to identify where to look for older referrals.** 

- 5 of 11 participants navigated to the Pending appointments tab to find approved referrals that needed to be self-scheduled (either on their own without moderator cues or with some help), while 6 of 11 participants did not consider navigating to the Pending appointments tab or needed significant cues to get there.

> P19: "It would be in Pending, wouldn't it? That's good! I like that."

- Other responses included:
  - **Select 'Start scheduling' (3 participants)** - _**P1:** "I would expect to just hit start scheduling [to start scheduling another approved referral] if I know I have a referral to start scheduling, that's where I would go."_
  - **Check for a task card (2 participants)** - _**P2:** "I always look at the stuff on top [of the page] for the things you still have to deal with [as far as  another referral needing to be scheduled]."_
  - **Check for a new text (1 participant)** - _**P4:** "I guess I'd go back to my text messages. I'd go click on the link again and I'd come back to this website."_

-
- 5 of 8 participants said they would select the the Past appointments tab to find referrals for their past appointments, while 2 participants could not complete this task or were not sure.

> P5: "[If I wanted to review older referrals from past appointments,] I would go to my past appointments because it should show the appointment and then I should be able to get the details about that."

### Self-scheduling user flow

#### Finding #5: 

**The majority of participants were able to easily start the scheduling process from the Appointments list task card, while 2 participants selected the incorrect link.**

- 13 of 15 participants were able to easily find the action link on the Appointments page to start scheduling their referral, while 2 participants would have selected the incorrect “Start scheduling” call to action. 5 participants cited confusion between the two similar links to start scheduling, with 2 participants describing the links as going to the same place.
> P2: "Start scheduling is right in front of me. Looks like I could select schedule your appointment or start scheduling."
> P4: "I would think that both of them go to the same spot, it's just a matter of the green one is to get your attention. It just prefers that you probably click on the green one, otherwise I think that both start scheduling and schedule your appointment are the same website as far as I know."

<img width="700" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 4 34 56 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f44708c5-1fea-4650-9c04-6d6b6f80b865">


#### Finding #6: 

**The majority of participants noticed the expiration date of the referral and found the presence of this information helpful, but many found the expiration date used in the prototype (e.g., 310 days) and wording to be confusing or misleading.**

- 13 of 14 participants noticed the referral expiration without prompts from the moderator, while 1 needed a small cue to notice it. 

- 8 participants cited confusion around wording or expiration length.
> P14: "I'd recommend putting something like referral expires in 310 days [for the tag] because I don't know what expires in 310 days. It says you can schedule your appointment now. So, there's nothing to me that explains what expires." 

- 2 participants felt a long expiration date was misleading or a sign of slow care from VA.
> P4: "I think that's pretty awesome that you get 310 days, but I also really would not know why anybody would get 310 days because that also gets a little frustrating. Because then you get along the lines of one of the issues at VA is it takes so long to get seen, so I really don't want to get 310 days. I'd rather get 30 days or 90 days in which the doctor's going to see me within a smaller window. If I'm coming in with a complaint, I'm coming in with a pain, I'm coming in with an issue, I want to get seen as soon as I can.

<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 4 33 13 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df8f3abf-b9b1-42ca-8a09-11271c4cd013">

#### Finding #7: 

**Participants were able to easily navigate the scheduling process and complete all tasks, but did run into challenges at two points. In addition, many participants offered unprompted positive feedback around the tool.**

- **Challenges:**
  - The filter tasks proved challenging for some participants, with 9 of 15 participants noticing the sort and filter link without help from the moderator.
  - Though 12 of 13 participants were able to find the call to action to review a provider's availability, 1 screen reader user (using JAWS) had significant challenges navigating the provider list page and was unable to move forward to the next step. They expected the "next available" appointment to be something that they could select, and then choose a time.
> P13: "I want to see her on July 26. I'd want to select it [next available]." That's the confusing part because now it's telling me review available appointments. I need to know the time I can see her."

- 6 participants had unprompted positive feedback when asked if they had other questions or comments.
> P5: "Everything is pretty straightforward. I think it will be a very helpful tool and it will streamline the process. It will make things easier for our providers, but also for the Veteran as well, so we're not waiting so long."
> P17: "This would make life a lot easier compared to sitting on hold with the VA. Sometimes the community care provider won't call you back and you're just waiting and waiting."

<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 4 39 19 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6224ef1-61ce-48f7-ad5c-1ed3357d5b09">


#### Finding #8: 

**Participants understood the information on the referral introduction page as a whole, but had some questions and suggestions for additional information. All participants were able to easily find the "schedule appointment" call to action.**

- 13/14 participants understood the information on the referral page and knew how to continue with scheduling their appointment, although 1 screen reader participant mentioned confusion and had suggestions for content changes around the expiration date and referral number.
> P13: "What do you mean expiration date? Does the referral expire in 30 days? I don't understand. Say 'your referral will expire in 30 days.'" Referral number: "What does that mean? I have no idea."

- 2 participants mentioned additional information they’d expect to find on the page, such as what type of services their appointment would include and what to do if, later on, they aren’t satisfied with their provider choice and want to change providers for a second opinion. 
> P19: "I would want to know, after so many appointments, what do I do if I'm not satisfied with that provider? ... How do I get a second opinion? Those are the things that I would want."

- 1 participant said the the format of the expiration date on the referral page was much easier to understand than the formatting on task card (on the subsequent page). 

- 2 participants interpreted “number of visits” as needing to complete 10 visits before the expiration date, 1 participant said they’d need to schedule 10 visits before that date, and 1 participant thought they already had 10 visits with this provider.
> P13: "When it says number of visits: 10. Are you saying the person has 10 visits or had 10 visits? I assume that the number of visits I (already) had with this person is 10. [I would suggest it reads,] you are approved for 10 visits"

<img width="200" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 4 41 47 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b168f49-039d-46d3-84f1-d5ab711a9fcd">


#### Finding #9: 

**The filter pattern did not present any usability concerns, but our results lacked conclusive evidence that Veterans would use the feature prior to prompting them to use it. Though participants said the filters met overall expectations, some called out specific filters as confusing or missing.** 

- No concerns arose around the filter and sort page pattern and participants were able to select and apply filters very easily.

- 9 of 15 participants noticed the filter and sort link without help from the moderator when asked how they’d narrow down the list of providers. 4 participants found the filter and sort link only with moderator help, while 2 participants never noticed it or were not asked about it due to time. 

- 12 of 13 participants reported that the type of filters on the filter and sort page met their expectations, although 2 participants mentioned expecting a language filter and 1 of these participants suggested adding filters for religion and provider’s years practicing. 3 participants said they were unsure of what the practice filter meant before reviewing the field options.
> P13: "So you can select a practice meaning you can select from this menu of physicians. I think what you're trying to say is physical therapy or heart specialist."
> P6: "So that’s good, like I said I can pick a male or a female, but it doesn’t give you, like, languages. And for some people, maybe religion is a really big thing, though I don’t know why for a doctor. Maybe also how long has he or she has been a doctor."

<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 4 44 04 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/578a3f8d-6134-44e0-a5e9-7401a1ded73c">

#### Finding #10: 

**Of the four participants we had time to ask, all four understood the "online scheduling" filter and found it beneficial. However, participants also expected to find providers that didn’t offer online scheduling and told us they would call and schedule with those providers, if needed.** 

- 4 of 4 participants, when prompted, said that the online scheduling filter was beneficial (e.g., a nice to have) when self-scheduling an appointment in this tool, and called out positives of this filter. 
> P5:  "Online scheduling, I like that. I get frustrated waiting on the phone and waiting on the phone tree to get to the scheduler and leave a message and never get a call back. So, I like the fact that you can filter for online scheduling." 

- However, participants told us they’d still expect to find providers who didn’t offer online scheduling in the provider list and would call and schedule with their provider of choice even if they didn’t offer online scheduling. 7 of 10 participants said it didn’t matter if the provider they wanted to schedule with offered online scheduling or not, while the remaining 3 participants said it’s circumstantial (e.g., urgency, how well they know the doctor they'd like to schedule with, etc.)
> P1: "Online scheduling is great, but I don't have a problem making a phone call to schedule an appointment."
> P7: "It would be nice to have it just as a point of  reference if I decided down along the road that I wanted to use a different person, different practitioner, and none of the ones with online scheduling met a requirement I was looking for, whether distance or whatever, it’s nice to know that someone without the online scheduling is available, I’d just have to make a phone call."

<img width="225" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 4 49 44 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44f978b2-f6c3-423f-a1be-f584750976e5">


#### Finding #11: 

**Participants knew how to cancel their appointments in the prototype and understood there was no reason to take an additional step to call. Although 1 participant still said they’d call the office after canceling to make sure it had worked.**

- 11 of 11 participants were able to find how to cancel their scheduled appointment from the appointment details page.

- 6 of 6 participants would not expect to have to call the community care provider or VA after canceling their appointment online. However, 1 participant mentioned that they’ve been told to call anyways because sometimes the providers don’t receive the cancellation. 
> P6: "I would call the office if I had to cancel or reschedule. It gives you the option here you can click on cancel and I guess that would cancel it, but I would still want to touch base with the office because sometimes I noticed when the VA sends out appointments reminders like YES/MAYBE, sometimes it comes in an email sometimes in a text. And I was told by people at the clinic, they said: “We don’t even get those.” So I don’t know where it goes when you click yes."
> P5: "I would expect that canceling would ask me to confirm if I wanted to cancel and then ask if I wanted to reschedule. I would expect that it would let the CC provider in the background that the appointment was canceled."


- Rescheduling: 3 participants mentioned being unsure about how to reschedule their appointment after canceling. 
> P7: "If I wanted to reschedule, I would probably go ahead and schedule a new appointment first and then cancel this one. Because I don’t see a link here to revise this appointment. I don’t see anything on this page to change it."
> P15: "I would schedule a new appointment (from the appointment details page to schedule the remaining  appointments of the referral).

### Expectations for VA staff follow up

#### Finding #12: 

**The majority of participants said they would expect VA to contact them if they haven't self-scheduled their appointment within a certain amount of time.** 

- 8/10 participants said they’d expect VA to contact them if they hadn’t self-scheduled their appointment within a certain amount of time. Timing varied from "within 7 days" to "30, 60, 90 days out from the referral expiring," and methods of communication were via text (5), call (4), email (3), and mobile app push notifications (1).
> P1: "I would expect a reminder from VA; email, text. 30, 60, 90 days out from the referral expiring."
> P5: "I would expect a 10-15 day follow-up from VA if I didn't schedule this appointment from the time I received this message. Typically most people these days are on top of their phones and text messages, so it seems like 10-15 reminder would make sense if it hasn't been scheduled."
> P17: "I would expect to receive a call if I hadn't scheduled my appointment. Within 7 days, they should at least call or send a text message or email."
> P2: "I use the [mobile] app a lot and get notifications a lot that I have a new message [in a good way]. If there was a way to send a push notification out until you took care of it, that wouldn't be a weird or bad thing."

- 1 participant said they did not expect a staff follow-up, and 1 participant was not sure.
> P12: "Most times they're so short staffed the MSAs can't reach out to everybody."

## Recommendations

### Referrals
1. Continue to use "Referral" to identify this process and documentation (of receiving authorization from VA and scheduling an appointment with a community care provider), which had the higher number of mentions by participants. ([See Finding # 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-1))

2. If new referrals are kept within the Pending page of the Appointments experience on VA.gov, like they were in the concept testing, consider changing the title of the page. Or consider adding a dedicated Referrals tab. ([See Finding # 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-4))
3. Regardless of the link placement to navigate to referrals in the Appointments experience, work with staff to create messaging/scripting to point Veterans to the correct place on VA.gov when needed, or consider a short-term addition (such as a “did you know” highlight) that can call out this new feature. ([See Finding # 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-4))
4. Consider including access to referrals in Medical Records, in addition to Appointments on VA.gov, particularly because past appointments disappear from the Appointments experience after 2 years. In Medical Records today, Veterans can access Non VA Care Consult Result Notes, but this doesn’t include the associated referral. ([See Finding # 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-3))
5. When feasible, include links to referrals in individual past appointment detail pages (not MVP). ([See Finding # 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-4))

### Self-scheduling user flow
6. **Start scheduling links:** ([See Finding # 5](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-5))
   - Identify how an omnipresent "Start scheduling" action for all appointment types and a community care-specific scheduling action can co-exist on the Appointments page without causing confusion.
   - Change the community care appointment link to be more explicit to the action, e.g., schedule your community care referral.  
7. **Expiration date:** Consider new phrasing for the expiration date in the task card, possibly mirroring the expiration date on the referral introduction page. ([See Finding # 6](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-6))
8. **Provider list page:** Work with a11y experts to evaluate if the benefit of "next available appointment" information outweighs the difficulty it can present screen reader users. And, if it does, consider ways the process could be clarified for those users. (Note: complete blocker for AT user) ([See Finding # 7](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-7))
9. **Referral introduction page:**
   - Determine where content can be tweaked to help with questions/concerns that Veterans brought up about the information on the referral page, e.g., number of visits. In addition, simplify information about how to schedule remaining community care appointments. ([See Finding # 8](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-8))
   - Consider if any additional information should be included, e.g. services included
10. **Filter and sort:** ([See Finding # 9](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-9))
   - Consider if including the filter and sort for MVP is worth the engineering effort knowing that not all Veterans would utilize this feature.
   - If included, determine how additional value and clarity can be brought to the filter options, and test with real scenarios when possible:
     - Update the name of the Practice filter to remove confusion
     - Work towards adding additional filters or information based on Veteran feedback (language), or other factors Veterans use to find a provider (e.g., years practicing, patient ratings and reviews, language spoken, specialties and services, etc.).
     - Further test an updated filter pattern with real provider and patient data to determine how many Veterans use the feature and how it is received.   
11. **Online scheduling:** Continue to include providers that don’t offer online scheduling. ([See Finding # 10](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-10))

### Expectations for VA staff follow up
12. **VA follow-up:** Coordinate with VA Notify, IVC, VHA, and VA staff to schedule early follow-up reminders prior to the existing 21-day text used to confirm appointment information – to go out to Veterans if they haven't self-scheduled their first appointment within a certain amount of time. ([See Finding # 12](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-12))

## Conclusions

#### **Veterans don't have a strong mental model for finding referrals on VA.gov and will benefit from multiple paths to access them**
Veterans don't have a strong mental model for where they'd look for new and past referrals, though slightly favored finding them with the appointments (vs. in their medical records). Regardless of where referrals reside on VA.gov, until a mental model is better understood it will be important to provide clear paths to access referrals, as well as train VA staff on how to talk to Veterans about finding their referrals on VA.gov.

#### **The Community Care Digital Self-Scheduling process (from being notified about a new referral to scheduling an appointment) meets Veterans’ overall expectations and needs, but can be iterated on to decrease confusion around specific content areas, add more value to the filters, and ensure a smoother experience for screen reader users**
Most Veterans were easily able to navigate through the scheduling process. However, updates will need to be made to specific points in the flow that presented significant challenges for a screen reader participant and content adjusted in areas that some Veterans found confusing. Additionally, if feasible, filters and provider information should be expanded to included additional details – such as years of experience, languages spoken, and services and sub-specialties – to help Veterans choose the right provider for them.

#### **Veterans expect VA to follow up with timely reminders to schedule their appointments even if they’ve elected to self-schedule**
Following existing expectations around receiving notifications and reminders, Veterans value communication from VA regarding their health care and appointments, and expect VA to use messages, calls, emails, and/or push notifications to remind them to schedule their community care appointments if they haven’t done so in a certain amount of time.

## Demographics

### **We talked to 15 participants throughout our 2-part study:**
1. Part 1 (Non-AT users):  9 participants, emphasis on cognitive impairment
2. Part 2 (AT users): 6 participants total, 4 screen reader users and 2 screen magnification users

**All participants:**
- 9/15 Veterans had used the Appointments tool on va.gov
- 13/15 Veterans had received care from a community care provider
- 14/15 Veterans used their mobile devices, while 1 used a laptop

**Specific to Part 1 (Non-AT users):**
- 6/9 Veterans reported having a cognitive disability

**Specific to Part 2 (AT users):**
- 4/6 Veterans used screen readers 
- 2/6 Veterans used screen magnification

### **Who we didn't talk to:**

Our aim for any subsequent studies will be to include the populations that we missed, including: 
- Immigrant origin
- Asian and Native 
- Expat (living abroad)
- LGBTQ+
