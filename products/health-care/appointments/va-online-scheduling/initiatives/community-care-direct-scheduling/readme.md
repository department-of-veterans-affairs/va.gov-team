## Research findings

### Previous research 

#### CC provider selection usability study research findings

*[Research findings from 2020-10 full report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/2020-10-cc-provider-selection-usability/research-findings.md#findings-and-recommendations)*

##### Key takeaways

- All participants wanted the list of providers to be more personalized. **The top request was to be able to schedule with providers they have seen in the past, or a specific provider they had researched/heard about.**
- **For both cases, appointment availability was top of mind.** Most participants wanted to know how soon they could see the provider, or if the provider was available on specific dates.
- Participants liked knowing a provider’s distance, but **some wanted to see the provider list in alphabetical order so they could find someone who they already knew - either an existing provider, or one they had researched.**
- **Most participants said they would spend time researching providers before reaching this step,** googling review sites to get a sense of the provider’s reputation.
