## So what does this mean for using and moving tickets in Zenhub?

- In a sprint, if we foresee that a ticket is **not** going to be completed, we are to revise the tasks in the ticket to a manageable amount to get completed and closed by sprint end. And, create another ticket for the backlog to complete the rest of the tasks in an upcoming sprint.  

- Tickets need to be moved into **Closed no later than midnight on the last Monday of the sprint.** That means, if you need work validated by a coworker or colleague outside of our team or initiative, allow the appropriate time for their review OR if it's the case where, for example, we're waiting on feedback from CAIA, we simply close the ticket and wait for their feedback. When we receive their feedback, we create a new ticket and go through the normal refinement and sprint planning process.

- **Is it okay to work on tickets in the current sprint that aren't documented in the Sprint Goals?** Yes, however, because those tickets aren't a commitment to the established Sprint Goals, do not move the ticket in ZenHub into the Current Sprint, but you're free to mention that you're working on it during stand ups. **However, if you do feel like it's going to be a quick complete, we just need to make sure that, 1) you pull it into the Current Sprint column, 2) that it correctly assigns the current sprint date-range label on the ticket (this is the most important part), and 3) that it gets closed prior to sprint end on Monday night.**
