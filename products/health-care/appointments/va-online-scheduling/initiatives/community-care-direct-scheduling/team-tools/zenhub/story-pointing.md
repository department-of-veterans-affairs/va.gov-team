# Story Points

Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work.

When we estimate with story points, we assign a point value to each item. The raw values we assign are unimportant. What matters are the _relative values_. A story that is assigned a 2 should be twice as much as a story that is assigned a 1. It should also be two-thirds of a story that is estimated as 3 story points.

## Pointing baseline

- 1 and 3 is small
- 3 and 5 is medium
- 5 and 8 is large

Note: If the value of an item is 8, it likely means it needs to be broken down into smaller parts.
