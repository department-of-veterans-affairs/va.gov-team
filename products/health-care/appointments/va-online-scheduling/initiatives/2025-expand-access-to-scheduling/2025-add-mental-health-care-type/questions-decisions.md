| Question/Consideration | Conversation | Final Decision |
|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| 6/30 Kickoff - Why is this important do do now? | 6/30 - This is part of the overall initiative to expand access. It's easier to expand the definition of Mental Health (and Primary Care) vs. specialty appts. But we expect to follow quickly with other types of care | | |
| 6/30 Kickoff - Clinics will be available to new patients - is this true only for this type of care? See new mental health filtering rules in [111672](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/111672) that require user have previous visit. | 6/30 Russo - We've discussed before that after 36 months a patient has to re-establish care at a facility, so it might still apply | | |
| 6/30 Kickoff - Will this ToC be available for VA requests? | 7/21 - (Kristen) We aren't changing any rules related to requests with this effort. We are only impacting direct scheduling.| |
| 6/30 Kickoff - Will this ToC be available for community care requests? | 7/21 - (Kristen) We aren't changing any rules related to requests with this effort. We are only impacting direct scheduling. | |
| 6/30 Kickoff - are any of the business rules for this ToC configurable per facility? | 7/21 - (Kristen) The bottom of the user stories and requirements doc has information on how configurations will change. | |
| 6/30 Kickoff - Will Oracle Health scheduling support this type of care? | | |
| 6/30 Kickoff - Consider using the [existing sub-types of care pattern](https://www.figma.com/slides/vcbgZmKq7stonTLrN3eYgl/Kickoff--Adding-new-types-of-care?node-id=3-23&t=copcLN3sqtLrnxuD-4) | 6/30 Kickoff - We'll need to decide if we expect this to be discoverable under mental health, or would be more easily discovered in the main list of ToC | |
| 6/30 Kickoff - Do we currently display substance abuse disorder appointments? If so, can we get one created in staging so we can see how they display? | 7/21 - (Kristen) Current understanding is that we aren't getting these appointment types at this time. | | 
| 6/30 Kickoff - Will these appointments be cancelable? (Are they currently cancelable?) | | |
| 6/30 Kickoff - What's the release plan? | | |
