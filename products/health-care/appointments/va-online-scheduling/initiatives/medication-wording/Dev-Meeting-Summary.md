Summary




Drupal Content-as-Config Discussion
Brian and Danielle discussed the potential risks and benefits of using Drupal's content-as-config feature for their project. Danielle suggested scheduling a meeting involving Kristen and other relevant team members to further discuss these issues. Adam agreed to arrange this meeting.

Danielle agreed to discuss this in their next meeting. Brian asked about the use of Drupal components, to which Danielle clarified that they were only using it for error message labels and had not explored further. The team agreed to continue discussing the risks and next steps for drupal integration.
