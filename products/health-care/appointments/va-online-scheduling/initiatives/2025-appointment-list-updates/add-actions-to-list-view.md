# Initiative Brief: Add Actions to the List View

## Goals
- Veterans can start some tasks directly from the list view. This helps surface time-sensitive tasks like joining a video appointment or filing for travel pay, while making it easy to access common tasks like viewing an after-visit summary.

## Metrics
- Clicks on tasks from the list view go up and either continue to rise or level out (doesn't drop sharply).
