- **Reduction in Complaints**: Fewer complaints about printing, as tracked by Medallia.

## Roadmap
1. **Review User Feedback**: Assess feedback from Medallia and previous studies.
2. **Benchmark Best Practices**: Examine how Medications handle printing.
3. **Feature Decision**: Determine which features to improve, add, or build.
4. **Development Spikes**: Conduct development spikes as necessary.
5. **Collab Cycle Assessment**: 
    - Evaluate if new features require a Collaboration Cycle.
    - If required, combine this with the “adding actions” Collaboration Cycle and research activities.
