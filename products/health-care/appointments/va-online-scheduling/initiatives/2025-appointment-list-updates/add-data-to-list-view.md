## Github link
 - [Initative Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/110421)

## Metrics
- Complaints about data missing from list view go down (Medallia).
  - These will likely never go away, as for some users the data wonâ€™t display AND clinic name will not contain the needed information.
- Complaints about clinic names in list view do not start/increase (Medallia).
- Clicks into details views go down.
- Printing list view goes up.

## Roadmap
- Secondary research - Review previous related studies.
- Determine which appointment types should display clinic name and location in the list.
- Design wireframes with minimal changes to the current list view. Design explorations.
- Build under feature flag
- Run production UAT
- Phased release/track Medallia feedback
