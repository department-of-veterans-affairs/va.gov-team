# Solid Start Scheduling - Engineering Documentation

This folder contains technical documentation and recommendations for the Solid Start Scheduling initiative, which aims to streamline appointment scheduling for Veterans through va.gov integration with VASS (VA Appointment Solid Start).

## Overview

The Solid Start Scheduling project creates a seamless appointment scheduling experience for Veterans by connecting va.gov frontend with Microsoft Dynamics backend through a standardized API layer.

### [üìù recommendations.md](./recommendations.md)

Main technical recommendations and feedback document:

- API standards alignment (VA Standards, JSON API, OpenAPI)
- Specific endpoint feedback and improvements
- RESTful design principles
- Authentication and monitoring considerations
- Big picture architectural decisions

### [üîê api-authenicate.md](./api-authenicate.md)

- Veteran interaction points

### [üìä standard-api-response.md](./standard-api-response.md)

API response standardization:

- Proposed unified response structure
- Correlation ID implementation
- Error handling and success patterns
- Before/after examples for endpoint improvements

### [üîó LoROTA/](./LoROTA/)

Low Risk One Time Authentication diagrams and implementation ideas:

- Sequence diagrams for LoROTA integration
- Short-lived URL approach for veteran authentication
- GUID-based tracking system

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Frontend/Backend Split**: Veterans use va.gov interface, staff use Dynamics interface
2. **Data Storage**: All data stored in MS Dynamics database
3. **API Layer**: Standardized REST API between va.gov and Dynamics
4. **Authentication**: Sign in Service (SiS) integration with JWT tokens
5. **Notifications**: VA Notify integration for SMS and email

## Getting Started

1. Start with `recommendations.md` for high-level technical direction
2. Review `high-level-architecture.md` for system overview
3. Check `simple-happy-path.md` for user flow understanding
4. Dive into `api-authenicate.md` for auth implementation details
5. Use `standard-api-response.md` for API design patterns

## Outstanding Questions

The following questions need to be addressed during implementation:

## Dev access

- Can we get access to a lower environment (sandbox) to play with

### Infrastructure & Operations ([recommendations.md](./recommendations.md))

- How are we monitoring?
- How are we deploying?
- Should we be versioning the endpoints?
- Where is the source code located? Github?

### API Design - GetAppointments ([recommendations.md](./recommendations.md))

- What is the upperbound of number of appointments a Veteran could have?

### API Design - AppointmentAvailability ([recommendations.md](./recommendations.md))

- Should the get appointment slots support pagination?
- When does the time slot get locked?
- How are skills related to appointments?

### API Design - SaveAppointment ([recommendations.md](./recommendations.md))

- This is a UPSERT, that's fine, but what all fields get updated?

### API Design - CancelAppointment ([recommendations.md](./recommendations.md))

- What is the response? A HTTP 204?
