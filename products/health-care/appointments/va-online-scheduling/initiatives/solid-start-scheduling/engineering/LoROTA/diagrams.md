# LoROTA Idea

## Questions

- How long does the link need to live? Ever short code makes a new one?
  - LoROTA works for short lived (days) url
  - Could use `text "schedule" to get a link approach`
- If veteran is fully authenticated what do they see after login where is the link to VASS services?
  - THis could be solved on the appointments page

## Pros

- Low barrier to entry to get Veterans into a signed in state
  - full auth is hurdle with fully verified
- could be fully short code enabled flow

## Cons

- urls are short lived
  - extra complexities of making sure the Veteran always has a the a working link
- not fully authenticated so the urls could expire and leave the Vetaran without knowledge
