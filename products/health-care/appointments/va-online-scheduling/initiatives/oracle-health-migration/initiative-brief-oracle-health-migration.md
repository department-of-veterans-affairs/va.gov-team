# Initiative Brief- Oracle Health Migration 

## Overview

When a VA site is moving from Vista to Oracle Health system, the Applications tool on VA.gov will need to be modified during this transition. Sites that are moving over to Cerner will need time to clean up their Vista scheduling tool before migrating over to Oracle Health. 

## Outcome Summary 

A user has clear guidance on how they will manage their appointments at the VA site that is updating their system to Oracle Health. The user should still have a seamless experience on the application and is be able to find the information they need for their appointment.

## Problem
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
  -  The VA will undergo a transition of system updates from Vista to Oracle Health. The business owners will need the application to prohibit some features on the application so that the staff at the VA site could do a clean up of the scheduling queue before moving the appointments to Oracle Health. 
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
  - It is not a problem that is occuring but it's a business change that we need to support. 
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - We will satisfy the business need from OCTO-DE.

## Measuring Success

- Success will be measured by the increased number of veterans using VAOS instead of MHV
- Will look at these specific measurements:
  - Number of unique users of VAOS
  - Number of pageviews of appointment list page
  - No increase in average response time of appointment list page
  - Decrease in the number of errors when fetching appointment data (desired)

## Launch Planning
### Collaboration Cycle
> ðŸ’¡ *Use for any Collab Cycle tracking, questions.*

- Kickoff ticket

### Go-to-market 
> *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful? Which groups/orgs are necessary to make this happen?*
1. Launch of the updated appointment list view will be marketed as an enhancement and will be part of a re-launch campaign for VAOS.
* Re-launch and new appointment list will be marketed through veteran focused electronic newsletters, especially those related to health care.
* Specific newsletters need to be identified and timelines for publication coordinated with launch plans

2. VAOS team investigating the use of an online, one time notice that would appear to veterans when navigating to VAOS landing page
* Notice would be a small indicator that something is new on the site.
* Clicking on the notice would provide more details about the change to the appointment list view.
* The online notification would lose focus after a veteran has clicked on it.  This includes subsequent sessions.
* Online notification would only be visible for a configurable date range.
* VAOS team to investigate feasibility of such a feature with the platform support team.

3. VA and CC scheduling personnel will need to be informed of the appointment view update and provided a demonstration.

4. VAOS product guide will need to be updated to include new screen shots of the updated appointment list view

5. Call Center will need to be informed of change to appointment list view
