# Initiative Brief - Travel Pay for Past Appointments

## Overview
This initiative allows Veterans to file a mileage-only beneficiary travel (BT) reimbursement claim for an eligible appointment from their past appointments list on VA.gov. An elibible appointment means any appointment:
- For which the Veteran travelled to a VA facility
- That cccurred before today and up to 30 days in the past    
- Hasnâ€™t had a BT claim already filed for the same day and at the same facility (using the BTSSS Get Claim Status API).
 
## Outcome Summary
A Veteran can submit a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim for a past appointment via their past appointments list on VA.gov in addition to the existing options of submitting a paper form to the travel office or submitting online via the BTSSS portal.

## Problem
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
  - Veterans find it difficult to use the BTSSS portal to file a travel reimbursement claim.
  - Veterans find it time consuming to submit a paper form for a travel reimbursement claim.
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
  - Filling out paper forms is time consuming
  - BTSSS portal is confusing 
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - Improve user satisfaction
  - Meet user expectations of available online transactions 
 * Veteran feedback during research

### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): Limited to mileage-only travel reimbursement claims because that comprises approximately 80% of all travel claims.  
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it): Usability risks are mostly limited to the complexity of the new travel form 
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data): None
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact): Getting the word out to Veterans about the feature will help determine the success of the feature.

### Solution Steps
- Veteran logs into VA.gov

- Veteran selects a past appointment and navigates to the appointment details for the selected appointment
- System determines if the selected appointment is eligible for mileage-only travel reimbursement
    - An appointment is eligible for mileage-only travel reimbursement when
        - It occured within the last 30 days
        - It is one of these in-person appointment types:
            - In-person appointment
            - In-person vaccine appointment
            - Video at a VA facility appointment 
- If the selected appointment is eligible for a mileage-only travel claim, Veteran can choose one of these actions    
    - If no claim has yet been filed for the selected appointment date and facility, Veteran can choose to submit a claim
        - System navigates the Veteran to the new online mileage-only BT claim form 
        - Veteran answers 'Yes' to the following questions
            - Filing mileage-only claim?
            - Used own vehicle to travel to the appointment?
            - Travelled from Veteran's on-file home address?
        - Veteran submits the form
        - Veteran receives confirmation that their claim has been submitted
    - If a claim has already been filed for the selected appointment date and facility, Veteran can choose to view the status of the claim
        - System navigates the Veteran to the new BT Status Claim tool
        - Veteran views the status of the claim
