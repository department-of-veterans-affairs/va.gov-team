# Initiative Brief - Travel Pay for Past Appointments

## Overview
This initiative allows Veterans to file a mileage-only beneficiary travel (BT) reimbursement claim for an eligible appointment from their past appointments list on VA.gov. An elibible appointment means any appointment:
- For which the Veteran travelled to a VA facility
- That cccurred before today and up to 30 days in the past    
- Hasnâ€™t had a BT claim already filed for the same day and at the same facility (using the BTSSS Get Claim Status API).
 
## Outcome Summary
A Veteran can submit a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim for a past appointment via their past appointments list on VA.gov in addition to the existing options of submitting a paper form to the travel office or submitting online via the BTSSS portal.

## Problem
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
  - Veterans find it difficult to use the BTSSS portal to file a travel reimbursement claim.
  - Veterans find it time consuming to submit a paper form for a travel reimbursement claim.
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
  - Filling out paper forms is time consuming
  - BTSSS portal is confusing 
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - Improve user satisfaction
  - Meet user expectations of available online transactions 
 * Veteran feedback during research

## Desired Outcomes
- Veterans have an online method via VA.gov with which they can submit a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim for a past appointment.
- Veterans find the online process easy-to-use.

## Undesired Outcomes
- Veterans do not understand that they can submit **only** a mileage-only claim using this new method.
- Veterans do not undersatnd how to submit a mileage-only claim via VA.gov.
- Veterans prefer to submit a travel reimbursement claim via a paper form or the BTSSS portal.

## Key Decisions
- We are limiting submission of a travel reimbursement claim to mileage-only claims because that is the only type of claim the BTSSS API currently supports.

## Measuring Success
- Increase in the number of BT claims being submitted

### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): Limited to mileage-only travel reimbursement claims because that comprises approximately 80% of all travel claims and is the only claim type supported by the BTSSS API.  
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it): Usability risks are mostly limited to the complexity of the new travel form 
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data): None
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact): Getting the word out to Veterans about the feature will help determine the success of the feature.
