- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum

1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
