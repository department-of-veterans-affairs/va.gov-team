**Related/Associated product(s)**

## Problem
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
  -  We would like to improve the Veteran's experience when viewing their appointment list. We have heard numerous feedback from the users about being able to print from the page. 
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
  - We do not have a function on the page that allows a user to click Print.
  - Anecdotal feedback from stakeholders and Veterans
  - Qualitative feedback from surveys
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - Improve user satisfaction
  - Meet user expectations of available online transactions

## Measuring Success

- Success will be measured by the increased number of veterans using VAOS instead of MHV
- Will look at these specific measurements:
  - Number of unique users of VAOS
  - Number of pageviews of appointment list page
  - No increase in average response time of appointment list page
  - Decrease in the number of errors when fetching appointment data (desired)

## Discovery

### Relevant studies

 
 
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - We believe most users will benefit from the print feature because it will allow them to print the list of their upcoming, pending and past appointments in the application. 
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - We will need to research and see where is the best place to put the print feature so it's accessible for all users. 
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - We do not anticipate to have technical risk of adding the print feature. 
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements 

### Prioritization
1. Appointmnet List Redesign
2. Print List

## Launch Planning
### Collaboration Cycle
> ðŸ’¡ *Use for any Collab Cycle tracking, questions.*

- Kickoff ticket

### Go-to-market 
> *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful? Which groups/orgs are necessary to make this happen?*
1. Launch of the updated appointment list view will be marketed as an enhancement and will be part of a re-launch campaign for VAOS.
* Re-launch and new appointment list will be marketed through veteran focused electronic newsletters, especially those related to health care.
* Specific newsletters need to be identified and timelines for publication coordinated with launch plans

2. VAOS team investigating the use of an online, one time notice that would appear to veterans when navigating to VAOS landing page
* Notice would be a small indicator that something is new on the site.
* Clicking on the notice would provide more details about the change to the appointment list view.
* The online notification would lose focus after a veteran has clicked on it.  This includes subsequent sessions.
* Online notification would only be visible for a configurable date range.
* VAOS team to investigate feasibility of such a feature with the platform support team.

3. VA and CC scheduling personnel will need to be informed of the appointment view update and provided a demonstration.

4. VAOS product guide will need to be updated to include new screen shots of the updated appointment list view

5. Call Center will need to be informed of change to appointment list view
