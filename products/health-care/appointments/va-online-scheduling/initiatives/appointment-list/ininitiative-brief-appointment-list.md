# Initiative Brief - Appointment List Improvements
## Overview

Looking to improve the user experience in VAOS by updating the appointment list page to help the veterans view their upcoming appointments, pending apppointments and past appointments. The goal is to have the VAOS appointments list show the same information and value as the equivalent list in MyHealtheVet.
 
---

## Outcome Summary

A user can view their appointments (upcoming, pending, canceled or past) without any confusion and provide value information to the veteran

**Related/Associated product(s)**
- Dependent on [VAOS service launch](.md) rollout 

## Problem
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
  - Majority of the Veterans use the MyHealtheVet appointment list to help manage and understand their appointments and as more Veterans move to VAOS to do the     same tasks, they may see a discrency between to the two lists. 
  - The user may be confused with viewing their appointment list in two separate applications and having to do two separate logins. 
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
  - Current functionality
  - Anecdotal feedback from stakeholders and Veterans
  - Qualitative feedback from surveys
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - Improve user satisfaction
  - Meet user expectations of available online transactions

  <summary><b>User Feedback Quotes</b></summary>
  
  <q>
   I hate that when I clicked on schedule an appointment, I must go to another site to log back in. It should be on one page."
  </q></p>
  
  <q> 
   The log-in process is frustrating because you are already logged into MHV and when you need to schedule an appointment why would I need to log in again?
  </q></p>

</details>

## Desired Outcomes
- Provide clear information that answers basic questions about appointments in the list
- Seamless navigation experience from MHV (MyHealtheVet) to VAOS

## Undesired Outcomes
- A user does not have clear information about their appointment details in the list 

## Key Decisions
- It is preferred that VAOS provides the same value and information of the appointment list similiar to MHV application.

### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - The experience may vary based on the data we have for the appointment type
  - If user is unable to find any value in VAOS, they may lose trust in the application and are less likely to return
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - We will have to balance between showing the right amount of information in the appointment list 
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Must work with our engineers to see what available data we can use to enhance the appointment details 
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements 

### Prioritization
1. Provide clear and value information in the appointment list
2. Facility location 
3. TBD - "Appointment List Improvement" requests

### Solution Summary
- Date and time change only
