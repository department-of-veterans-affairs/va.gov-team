## Purpose: 
Set the foundation for building trust, facilitating open communication, and defining our working disciplines that will guide self-organization on our team. 

These working disciplines, or “ground rules,” are the Team’s agreement as to how they will interact with one another and plan, set, and achieve common goals.

### Working Agreements = defining expectations for how we will function together
_Ground rules don’t come about after having a big meeting to create them. They usually evolve over time and with the team. Most of the time a rule is added to the list when the squad solves a problem and decides to do things in a certain way._

- **Meetings** - Start on time/End on time with video on
  - Be conscious of people's time, calendars, and timezones.
  - Days most desired for meetings? Times?
  - If missing a meeting - shared in DSVA #vaos-team slack
  - All work that moves into “Current Sprint” must have clear acceptance criteria and if possible been pointed/sized
- **Team norms**
  - No one is bigger than the team. 
  - Have a shared sense of responsibility and ownership for VAOS. 
  - We will not be afraid to ask for help
  - No finger pointing
  - We succeed as a team, we fail as a team
- **Definition of Done**
- Significant technical decisions are a team effort (We build better things together than we do as individuals)
- Outcomes over output, problems over requirements
- Identify points of failure - in the team, in the product, in the system
- **Documentation**
  - Maintain lean but relevant documentation throughout product lifecycle
- Voice concerns, ideas, and risks about work early and often
- Prioritize ruthlessly
- We will focus on building both iteratively and incrementally
- **Tackling testing, bugs and tech debt**

## Using Fist of Five for Alignment
Sometimes we need to gauge team agreement/aligment as a team when making commitments. We will use the fist of five method to help see where everyone stands. This is used as a confidence check, and sometimes we'll need to 'disagree and commit.' 
1. finger: I have grave misgivings about this courses of action and can neither live with or support it. I do not think we should move forward
2. fingers: I have reservations about this solution and would have trouble supporting this 
3. fingers: I can live with and support this decision
4. fingers: I am really happy with this and am glad we came up with such a great plan or solution
5. fingers: I love this idea. I wish I had thought of it myself. It is the best we can possibly do
