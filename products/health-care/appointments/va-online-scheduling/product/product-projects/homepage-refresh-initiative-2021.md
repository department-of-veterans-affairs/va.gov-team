# Homepage Refresh - Product Initiative
---

## Overview
Move the VA online scheduling homepage more towards a dashboard-like experience where Veterans are able to more effectively prepare and manage already booked (or almost booked) appointments.

## Problem Statement
As a Veteran who uses VA online scheduling, I want to be able to manage all my appointments from a single place which includes preparing for upcoming appointments, printing specific details about appointments, reviewing past appointments, and rescheduling appointments I need (not just cancel them).
 
## Desired Outcomes
- Improve overall satisfaction (rating) of VA online scheduling
- Improve retention rate of VA online scheduling homepage (dashboard)
- Decrease number of appointments canceled (instead actively rescheduled)

## Undesired Outcomes
- Increase in (VAOS-caused) Help Desk support from trends related to the homepage
- Increase in abandonment of online scheduling
