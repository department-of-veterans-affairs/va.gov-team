# Community Care Provider Selection MVP Release Plan

## Staged Rollout 

### Planning

- Desired date range: _\[mm/dd/yy - mm/dd/yy\]_
- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it:
  - va_online_scheduling_provider_selection feature toggle
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?:
  - Preference step completion &#916; >0%
  - Request submissions &#916; >0%
- Links to dashboard(s) showing "success criteria" metrics: [https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/18828]

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
