# Community Care Provider Selection MVP Release Plan

## Staged Rollout 

### Planning

- Desired date range: Wednesday, February 17, 2021 - Sunday, February 28, 2021 (tentative)
- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it:
  - va_online_scheduling_provider_selection feature toggle
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?:
  - Preference step completion &#916; >0%
  - Request submissions &#916; >0%
- Links to dashboard(s) showing "success criteria" metrics: [https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/18828]
