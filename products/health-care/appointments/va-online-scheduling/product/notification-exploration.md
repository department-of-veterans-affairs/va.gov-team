# Notifications and VA Online Scheduling

## Current State
There are a few forms of notifications and messaging involved with VA Online Scheduling. 
1. Veterans currently get emails that are mostly void of useful information upon submission, upon status change, and reminders. 
2. Schedulers need a way to communicate back-and-forth with Veterans to resolve a request for an appointment. Currently, schedulers do not have a good way to access secure messenger (though this may resolved with the pools function in Cerner), and calling Veterans does not always work because Veterans may not answer due to availability or not recognizing the VA number. The legacy system has a messaging/chat function, but Veterans have told us that within the appointmen scheduling tool is not where they would expect to communicate with the VA about this appointment. 

## Desired State
- As a Veteran, I can set my communication preferences for appointments (text, email, phone). VA will correspond with me using my preferred communication methods. 
- As a Veteran, I will get notifications about my appointments, triggered by the following events:
  1. I successfully self-schedule an appointment.
  2. I successfully submit an appointment request. 
  3. My self-scheduled appointment or request submission did not go through (error). 
  4. My appointment request has been fulfilled. 
  5. My appointment request has been fulfilled at a time other than when I requested. 
  6. My community care health appointment has been scheduled. 
  7. My VA Video Connect (telehealth) appointment has been scheduled. 
  8. My appointment has been canceled by me or by VA.
  9. Reminder about an upcoming appointment (in person)
  
- As a Veteran I can communicate back-and-forth with my scheduler to resolve a request in the following ways:
  - Secure Messenger
  - Sirius XM Chat
  - Text
  - Phone call 
  
- As a Veteran, if an appointment becomes available before the time I currently have AND I have indicated that I want a sooner appointment, use open slot management to help me reschedule.
