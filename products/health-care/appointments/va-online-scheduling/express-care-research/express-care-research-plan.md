# Research Plan for VAOS Express Care Discovery

## Goals	

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?

   VA devloped Express Care to enable virtual access between Veteran patients and their medical providers ("PACTs"). However, Express Care as a service is not utilized by providers or patients and research needs to be conducted to better understand why and how the VA can improve this service, especially during a time when a Veteran may need medical attention, but be seen at a physical location.

   The problem we are focused on is: understanding when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent", "immediate", and "now" through VA digital channels. We specifically want to understand:

   - when do Veterans seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care
   - what types of care do Veterans seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care / how do they define same day care
   - would Veterans use an online method for receiving same day care / do Veterans know what services are available to them for same day care through VA

   Additionally, we would like to learn from Veterans if they know of and would seek urgent, same-day, Telehealth care from VA for a COVID-19 screening, if they are experiencing symptoms. 

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

   Veterans have medical needs that may either be resolved without an in-person appointment and/or want guidance about how seek additional care for a medical concern, yet may not demand a trip to the ER. For various reasons, the Veteran may not be able to go into a physical location for this care. In both cases, however, the Veteran needs to talk to a medical professional *today*.

   Currently, "Express Care" is a care option developed by VA for immediate, same day evaluation via VA Video Connect (VA's proprietary telehealth platform). However, Express Care is not utilized by VA providers or patients and we believe the business rules in place prevent this platform from being a preferred option by providers and patients, alike.

   This problem may also be a subset to a larger problem statement - Veterans have access to various types of care which can make it difficult to understand what kind of care to access and how to access it. This is especially true when considering the different VA digital access points to accessing care.

   Additionally, with the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to give Veterans fast, safe access to care and evaluation via telehealth either as an alternative to in office, face-to-face visits. The VAOS team believes Express Care can serve as a tool to facilitate immediate access to remote medical care as well as provide VA providers a remote mechanism for screening patients who suspect they have COVID-19.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

   - How do Veterans define "Express Care"? Is it Telehealth or in-person?
   - What types of appointments do Veterans consider using Telehealth appointments for? 
   - How do Veterans seek same-day / urgent care virtually?
   - Do Veterans consider "same-day" care the same thing as scheduling an appointment? If not, how is this different?
   - What resources VA health care resources are Veterans aware of related to COVID-19?
   - Will Veterans choose Express Care for COVID-19 screening?
   - Will Veterans use a VA online COVID-19 screening tool?
   - When do Veterans think COVID-19 Express Care appointments be available to them?
   - What is a Veteran's mental model for scheduling an Express Care appointment and is it the same as a regular appoiuntment?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

   -  Veterans only have access to Express Care if and when their PACT enables Express Care. Express Care is only an option if and *only if* their PACT enables Express Care *and* makes availability during normal business hours. As a result, Veterans are unaware of Express Care as an option for scheduling an appointment, due to unavailability from providers.
   -  Veterans don't think to make an Express Care appointment the same way as other types of VA appointments because of the timeliness of the appointment.

## Method	

1. What method of research are you planning? 	

   - Remote moderated usability research and usability testing mid-fidelity prototypes.

2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

   - We need to learn from Veterans what their mental model of scheduling and same-day medical / Telehealth from VA is, with a focus on COVID-19 screening.
   - We need to validate our hypotheses about Veterans perception of scheduling an Express Care appointment.
   - We need to validate our design recommendations for a COVID-19 screener resource.

3. Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*

   Zoom

4. What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 

   [Low-fidelity prototype](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/3PWYUFVAVQU#/screens/414573920)

5. If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)

   Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment	

1. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	
   (Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)

   - Veterans who CURRENTLY USE VA health care
   - Veterans who currently have experience with the VA Online Scheduling tool
   - Veterans who can be on an iPad or Laptop with Zoom enabled
   - Veterans who are interested in / have sought out same day medical / Telehealth appointments either from VA or another medical provider

2. What is your recruitment strategy? 	

   Perigean

## When?
