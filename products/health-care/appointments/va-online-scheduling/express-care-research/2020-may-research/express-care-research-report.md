# VA Online Scheduling: "Express Care" Research Report

## Research Process

### Research focus

VA developed Express Care to enable virtual access between Veteran patients and their medical providers ("PACTs"). However, Express Care as a service is not utilized by providers or patients, respectively. This research was conducted to better understand why and how the VA can improve this service, especially during a time when Veterans may need medical attention, but due to current circumstances cannot be seen at a physical locations.

The problem we were focused on is: understanding when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent", "immediate", and "now" through VA digital channels. We specifically sought to understand:

- When Veterans seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care
- What types of care do Veterans think to seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care for / how do Veterans define same day care
- Would Veterans use an online method for same day care / do Veterans know what services are available to them for same day care through VA

Additionally, we wanted to learn from Veterans if they were aware of and would seek urgent, same-day, Telehealth care from VA for a COVID-19 screening, if they were experiencing symptoms.



### Research methodology

For this study, we conducted remote moderated usability research and usability testing with mid-fidelity prototypes. Veterans were asked questions related to their general understanding of types of visits, virtual medical appointments, options for Telehealth and same-day types of care at the VA, experience receiving these types of care either from VA or non-VA providers, and about scheduling appointments and their expectations around being seen for a same-day appointment. 

Veterans were shown and interacted with a clickable prototype to help us learn more about their expectations around same-day virtual medical appointments from VA, how to initiate that type of visit, and expectations around what they can be seen for, when they would be seen, and by whom.

[may remove] This research focused on learning more about Veterans' perspective about same-day, virtual appointments from VA providers, how they would initiate that type of visit, who they would be seen by, and if this type of visit is of use to Veterans.

## Findings and Recommendations Overview

### Findings overview

Overall, all (100%) participants said they would use virtual medical appointments for both routine/pre-scheduled appointments as well as same-day or urgent visits, if they are given this option. However, no (0%) participants were familiar with "Express Care" as a means for connecting with a VA provider for a same-day, Telehealth visit. (Two (18%) participants said they heard of "Express Care", but neither could accurately describe the service.) 

Several key themes emerged throughout our research:

- Experience varies per facility 
- Response quality: responder and timeliness 
- Perception of Telehealth
- Brand recognition
- Appointment types (availability vs. desire)
- Scheduling methods
- COVID

| Number of participants who...                                | #    | %    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ---- |
| Said they knew about / heard about "Express Care"*           | 2    | 18%  |
| Have used VA Telehealth before                               | 10   | 91%  |
| Expect a response from a medical professional                | 10   | 91%  |
| Expect / want to be seen by PACT                             | 5    | 45%  |
| Thought they would instantly be connected to chat / Telehealth appointment / receive a call | 2    | 18%  |
| Consider same-day visits and pre-scheduled appointments the same (for scheduling) | 3    | 27%  |
| [from the appointment screen] select:  "Request Express Care Screening" button | 8    | 73%  |
| [from the appointment screen] select:  "New appointment" button | 3    | 27%  |
| [from the appointment list] select:  "Express Care" option   | 2    | 18%  |
| [from the appointment list] select:  "same-day Telehealth" option | 3    | 27%  |
| Like / want to continue to use Telehealth                    | 11   | 100% |
| would use "Express Care" / Telehealth for COVID screening    | 11   | 100% |

**None of the participants could accurately define "Express Care", even if they said they knew what it was.*


### Recommendations overview

- Create consistency in the experience for "Express Care", Telehealth, and other services offered from location to location, in order to build trust between Veterans and the VA, especially during this unprecedented time. This will enhance brand recognition of "Express Care", a term that is completely unknown to Veterans, based on our research. 
- "Express Care" requests must be responded to by medical professionals who can provide medical advice and/or deduce next steps for resolving urgent medical needs, not by a scheduler. 
- Provide, in plain language, clarification around types of care Veterans can receive through "Express Care", who will be responding to their request, when they will get a response and how.
- Conduct a more comprehensive audit of ways to schedule an appointment, both official and unofficial methods, in an effort to streamline this process. 
- Incorporate "Express Care" and/or Telehealth resources immediately for Veterans to access. Dealing with coronavirus is an ongoing, uncertain matter and Veterans need tools to manage this situation and their health effectively.
