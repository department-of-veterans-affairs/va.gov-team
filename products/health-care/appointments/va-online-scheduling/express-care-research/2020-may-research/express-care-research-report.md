# VA Online Scheduling: "Express Care" Research Report

## Research Process

### Research focus

VA developed Express Care to enable virtual access between Veteran patients and their medical providers ("PACTs"). However, Express Care as a service is not utilized by providers or patients, respectively. This research was conducted to better understand why and how the VA can improve this service, especially during a time when Veterans may need medical attention, but due to current circumstances cannot be seen at a physical locations.

The problem we were focused on is: understanding when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent", "immediate", and "now" through VA digital channels. We specifically sought to understand:

- When Veterans seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care
- What types of care do Veterans think to seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care for / how do Veterans define same day care
- Would Veterans use an online method for same day care / do Veterans know what services are available to them for same day care through VA

Additionally, we wanted to learn from Veterans if they were aware of and would seek urgent, same-day, Telehealth care from VA for a COVID-19 screening, if they were experiencing symptoms.



### Research methodology

For this study, we conducted remote moderated usability research and usability testing with mid-fidelity prototypes. Veterans were asked questions related to their general understanding of types of visits, virtual medical appointments, options for Telehealth and same-day types of care at the VA, experience receiving these types of care either from VA or non-VA providers, and about scheduling appointments and their expectations around being seen for a same-day appointment. 

Veterans were shown and interacted with a clickable prototype to help us learn more about their expectations around same-day virtual medical appointments from VA, how to initiate that type of visit, and expectations around what they can be seen for, when they would be seen, and by whom.

[may remove] This research focused on learning more about Veterans' perspective about same-day, virtual appointments from VA providers, how they would initiate that type of visit, who they would be seen by, and if this type of visit is of use to Veterans.

## Findings and Recommendations Overview

### Findings overview

Overall, all (100%) participants said they would use virtual medical appointments for both routine/pre-scheduled appointments as well as same-day or urgent visits, if they are given this option. However, no (0%) participants were familiar with "Express Care" as a means for connecting with a VA provider for a same-day, Telehealth visit. (Two (18%) participants said they heard of "Express Care", but neither could accurately describe the service.) 

Several key themes emerged throughout our research:

- Experience varies per facility 
- Response quality: responder and timeliness 
- Perception of Telehealth
- Brand recognition
- Appointment types (availability vs. desire)
- Scheduling methods
- COVID

| Number of participants who...                                | #    | %    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ----: |
| Said they knew about / heard about "Express Care"*           | 2    | 18%  |
| Have used VA Telehealth before                               | 10   | 91%  |

| [from the appointment list] select:  "Express Care" option   | 2    | 18%  |
| [from the appointment list] select:  "same-day Telehealth" option | 3    | 27%  |
| Like / want to continue to use Telehealth                    | 11   | 100% |
| would use "Express Care" / Telehealth for COVID screening    | 11   | 100% |

**None of the participants could accurately define "Express Care", even if they said they knew what it was.*

#### Scheduling methods

Participants use a variety of methods to schedule their VA appointments. Some participants use more than one method. No one mentioned using new VAOS.

| Scheduling method | # | % | 
|----------------------- | ----: | ----: |
| Phone | 9 | 81% |
| Secure Messenger | 5 | 45% |
| Legacy VAOS (MHV) | 4 | 36% |
| During in-office visit | 3 |  27% |
| Reminder from VA (RTC aka return to clinic) | 1 | 9% |
| New VAOS | 0 | 0 |

### Recommendations overview

Telehealth is a valuable resource to Veterans and something that all participants want and like to use and/or want to continue using in the future. However, all participants identified areas of inconsistency and confusion with the Telehealth experience at VA, stemming from operational differences based on the types of care they most often receive, their most frequently visited facilities, physical location, and experience with Telehealth through VA. This research showed even greater disparate experiences in scheduling, Telehealth, and participants' interaction with the "Express Care" model and prototype. As a result, the following are our recommendations: 

1. Incorporate "Express Care" and/or Telehealth resources immediately accessible for Veterans when scheduling appointments.
2. If "Express Care" is going to be offered, the experience must clear and consistent across the entire VA medical ecosystem. 
3. If "Express Care" is going to be offered, responses must be from medical professionals, not schedulers. 
4. Timeliness is critical, especially for same-day and urgent types of care. Responses to "Express Care" requests must be within the time promised. 
5. Conduct a comprehensive audit of the ways to schedule VA appointments, not limited to official methods offered by VA. 

Finally, all (11, 100%) participants indicated that they would use "Express Care" as a screener for coronavirus. It is clear the value that Telehealth, especially "Express Care" can have if implemented effectively. Dealing with coronavirus is an ongoing, uncertain matter and Veterans need tools to manage this situation and their health effectively. 


## Research Findings & Recommendations

### 1. Incorporate "Express Care" and/or Telehealth resources immediately for Veterans to access.

All participants said they are interested in continuing using or starting to use virtual medical appointments as much as possible and see the value in Telehealth beyond the pandemic. 

However, it participants were unsure how to schedule Telehealth visits, most stating that they were only given the option recently as a result of the novel coronavirus. Telehealth should be clearly identified as an option, where available when a user is scheduling appointments. 

Additionally, many of the participants differentiated the term "Express Care" from "same-day Telehealth" by describing the former as an in-person same-day type of care, versus the latter being a virtual visit. However, when presented with the prototype [screen: appointment type selection page], it was unclear which types of appointments were offered as Telehealth appointments. 


### 2. If "Express Care" is going to be offered, the experience must clear and consistent across the entire VA medical ecosystem.

> Quotes go here

Although VA has offered "Express Care" since 2017 and despite experience with VA Telehealth appointment, none of the participants could accurately describe "Express Care," although two participants saying they heard of it before. 

While unfamiliar, in our sessions, most participants selected the "Express Care screener" option to initiate a same-day virtual appointment from the appointment screen, based on the content and context of this option from the landing page from the prototype. However, this option still presented confusion about what "Express Care" would accomplish for them. Additionally, when presented with a list of options and asked to schedule a virtual appointment for today, when given the options "Express Care" or "Telehealth screening" with the same description, participants either could not tell the difference or that the "Express Care" option should include Telehealth in the name because they didn't understand it to be a virtual option, despite including this in the description. 

Provide, in plain language, clarification around types of care Veterans can receive through "Express Care", who will be responding to their request, when they will get a response and how.

We believe this gap in knowledge about the service stems from both lack of offering as well as variation in experience across the VA medical facility ecosystem. Messaging about the service must be clear, in plain language, and consistent from one VISN/VAMC to another. 


### 3. If "Express Care" is going to be offered, responses must be from medical professionals, not schedulers.

> Quotes go here

Nearly all (91%) participants expected a response from a medical professional, either a nurse, LIP, or a doctor, regardless if it was someone from their PACT or not. "Express Care" requests must be responded to by medical professionals who can provide medical advice and/or determine medically necessary next steps for resolving urgent medical needs, not by a scheduler. 



### 4. Timeliness is critical, especially for same-day and urgent types of care. Responses to "Express Care" requests must be within the time promised.

> Quotes go here

Participants had varying expectations about the VA's ability to meet or exceed the expectations of a 4-hour response window for "Express Care". Opinions varied about the 4-hour response window, falling into the following categories: they didn't believe that it was accurate, that it was only accurate if they initiated the request in the morning, or that it was acceptable. 

Since our research, VA has proposed a 1-hour response window. With this change, **it is critical that there is staff available and capable to respond to "Express Care" requests as indicated to Veterans.**


### 5. Conduct a comprehensive audit of the ways to schedule VA appointments, not limited to official methods offered by VA.

> Quotes go here

When asked how they currently schedule appointments with VA providers, participants identified five unique methods for scheduling an appointment. Additionally, some participants identified multiple ways they go about scheduling appointments, depending on the type of care or responsiveness of their provider or initial appointment request method. 

A comprehensive audit will lead to a better understanding of Veterans' mental model of scheduling, how to present the information in a meaningful way, and how to redesign the scheduling experience on VA.gov. Furthermore, as Telehealth becomes a fundamental part of providing care for Veterans by the VA medical system, understanding how Veterans think of this type of visit in the construct of appointments and scheduling is imperative.
