# VA Online Scheduling: "Express Care" Research Report

## Research Process

### Research focus

VA developed Express Care to enable virtual access between Veteran patients and their medical providers ("PACTs"). However, Express Care as a service is not utilized by providers or patients, respectively. This research was conducted to better understand why and how the VA can improve this service, especially during a time when Veterans may need medical attention, but due to current circumstances cannot be seen at a physical locations.

The problem we were focused on is: understanding when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent", "immediate", and "now" through VA digital channels. We specifically sought to understand:

- When Veterans seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care
- What types of care do Veterans think to seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care for / how do Veterans define same day care
- Would Veterans use an online method for same day care / do Veterans know what services are available to them for same day care through VA

Additionally, we wanted to learn from Veterans if they were aware of and would seek urgent, same-day, Telehealth care from VA for a COVID-19 screening, if they were experiencing symptoms.



### Research methodology

For this study, we conducted remote moderated usability research and usability testing with mid-fidelity prototypes. Veterans were asked questions related to their general understanding of types of visits, virtual medical appointments, options for Telehealth and same-day types of care at the VA, experience receiving these types of care either from VA or non-VA providers, and about scheduling appointments and their expectations around being seen for a same-day appointment. 

Veterans were shown and interacted with a clickable prototype to help us learn more about their expectations around same-day virtual medical appointments from VA, how to initiate that type of visit, and expectations around what they can be seen for, when they would be seen, and by whom.

[may remove] This research focused on learning more about Veterans' perspective about same-day, virtual appointments from VA providers, how they would initiate that type of visit, who they would be seen by, and if this type of visit is of use to Veterans.

## Findings and Recommendations Summary

### Findings summary

The majority of participants we spoke with said they now have experience with Telehealth from VA providers, largely as a result of the onset of the novel coronavirus. Despite experience with VA Telehealth appointments, none of the participants could accurately describe "Express Care," although two participants saying they heard of it before. Many of the participants differentiated "Express Care" from "same-day Telehealth" by describing the former as an in-person same-day type of care, versus the latter being a virtual visit. 

All participants said they are interested in continuing using or starting to use virtual medical appointments as much as possible and see the value in Telehealth beyond the pandemic. All participants said they would turn to a Telehealth resource as a COVID-19 screener, if it became available to them. 

Most participants selected the "Express Care screener" option to initiate a same-day virtual appointment. Nearly all participants, regardless of which method they used to initiate the visit, said they expected a medical professional (most likely a nurse) would follow up with them.
