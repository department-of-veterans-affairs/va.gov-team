# VA Online Scheduling: "Express Care" Research Report

## Research Process

### Research focus

VA developed Express Care to enable virtual access between Veteran patients and their medical providers ("PACTs"). However, Express Care as a service is not utilized by providers or patients, respectively. This research was conducted to better understand why and how the VA can improve this service, especially during a time when Veterans may need medical attention, but due to current circumstances cannot be seen at a physical locations.

The problem we were focused on is: understanding when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent", "immediate", and "now" through VA digital channels. We specifically sought to understand:

- When Veterans seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care
- What types of care do Veterans think to seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care for / how do Veterans define same day care
- Would Veterans use an online method for same day care / do Veterans know what services are available to them for same day care through VA

Additionally, we wanted to learn from Veterans if they were aware of and would seek urgent, same-day, Telehealth care from VA for a COVID-19 screening, if they were experiencing symptoms.



### Research methodology

For this study, we conducted remote moderated usability research and usability testing with mid-fidelity prototypes. Veterans were asked questions related to their general understanding of types of visits, virtual medical appointments, options for Telehealth and same-day types of care at the VA, experience receiving these types of care either from VA or non-VA providers, and about scheduling appointments and their expectations around being seen for a same-day appointment. 

Veterans were shown and interacted with a clickable prototype to help us learn more about their expectations around same-day virtual medical appointments from VA, how to initiate that type of visit, and expectations around what they can be seen for, when they would be seen, and by whom.

[may remove] This research focused on learning more about Veterans' perspective about same-day, virtual appointments from VA providers, how they would initiate that type of visit, who they would be seen by, and if this type of visit is of use to Veterans.

## Findings & Recommendations Overview

### Findings overview

Overall, all (100%) participants said they would use virtual medical appointments for both routine/pre-scheduled appointments as well as same-day or urgent visits, if they are given this option. However, no (0%) participants were familiar with "Express Care" as a means for connecting with a VA provider for a same-day, Telehealth visit. (Two (18%) participants said they heard of "Express Care", but neither could accurately describe the service.) 

Several key themes emerged throughout our research:

- Experience varies per facility 
- Response quality: responder and timeliness 
- Perception of Telehealth
- Brand recognition
- Appointment types (availability vs. desire)
- Scheduling methods
- COVID

| Number of participants who...                                | #    | %    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----: | ----: |
| Said they knew about / heard about "Express Care"*           | 2    | 18%  |
| Have used VA Telehealth before                               | 10   | 91%  |
| Expect a response from a medical professional                | 10   | 91%  |
| Expect / want to be seen by PACT                             | 5    | 45%  |
| Thought they would instantly be connected to chat / Telehealth appointment / receive a call | 2    | 18%  |
| Consider same-day visits and pre-scheduled appointments the same (for scheduling) | 3    | 27%  |
| [from the appointment screen] select:  "Request Express Care Screening" button | 8    | 73%  |
| [from the appointment screen] select:  "New appointment" button | 3    | 27%  |
| [from the appointment list] select:  "Express Care" option   | 2    | 18%  |
| [from the appointment list] select:  "same-day Telehealth" option | 3    | 27%  |
| Like / want to continue to use Telehealth                    | 11   | 100% |
| would use "Express Care" / Telehealth for COVID screening    | 11   | 100% |

**None of the participants could accurately define "Express Care", even if they said they knew what it was.*

### Scheduling methods

Participants use a variety of methods to schedule their VA appointments. Some participants use more than one method. No one mentioned using new VAOS.

| Scheduling method | # | % | 
|----------------------- | ----: | ----: |
| Phone | 9 | 81% |
| Secure Messenger | 5 | 45% |
| Legacy VAOS (MHV) | 4 | 36% |
| During in-office visit | 3 |  27% |
| Reminder from VA (RTC aka return to clinic) | 1 | 9% |
| New VAOS | 0 | 0 |



### Recommendations overview

Telehealth is a valuable resource to Veterans and something that all participants want and like to use and/or want to continue using in the future. However, all participants identified areas of inconsistency and confusion with the Telehealth experience at VA, stemming from operational differences based on the types of care they most often receive, their most frequently visited facilities, physical location, and experience with Telehealth through VA. This research showed even greater disparate experiences in scheduling, Telehealth, and participants' interaction with the "Express Care" model and prototype. As a result, the following are our recommendations: 

1. Incorporate "Express Care" and/or Telehealth resources immediately accessible for Veterans when scheduling appointments.
2. If "Express Care" is going to be offered, the experience must clear and consistent across the entire VA medical ecosystem. 
3. If "Express Care" is going to be offered, responses must be from medical professionals, not schedulers. 
4. Timeliness is critical, especially for same-day and urgent types of care. Responses to "Express Care" requests must be within the time promised. 
5. Conduct a comprehensive audit of the ways to schedule VA appointments, not limited to official methods offered by VA. 

Finally, all (11, 100%) participants indicated that they would use "Express Care" as a screener for coronavirus. It is clear the value that Telehealth, especially "Express Care" can have if implemented effectively. Dealing with coronavirus is an ongoing, uncertain matter and Veterans need tools to manage this situation and their health effectively. 


## Research Findings & Recommendations

### 1. Incorporate "Express Care" and/or Telehealth resources immediately for Veterans to access. 

> [Telehealth] is a time saver and stress reliever for the household. (P01)

> [Coronavirus] Yes, probably would be the first options instead of risking infecting other people. (P01)

> [Telehealth] Comfortable going back to normal office visiting or continue with this.: This would be useful in the future; I have a lot of grandkids and this is much easier than taking them all with me for an appointment. (P02)

> I personally rather deal with the computer than with the people calling or trying to wait for a response from the securing messaging because they do not always check it right away. (P02)

> [Telehealth] Yeah if it saves me from going through the issue of making an appointment with your doctor...Depending on your claims maybe you can use this option instead of going to your doctor because some of us need to travel to see the doctor. (P03)

> [Telehealth] I would, I am in the process of trying to increase my VA claim and instead of me going to the doctor and I can do it on video chat that would be better instead of going into possible infected areas. If they can ask you instead of having to go to the actual VA it will save time and prevent them from traveling or getting infected. (P03)

> [Telehealth] I guess you would be in front of the computer and talk back and forth, hopefully you will be able to text as well because I am hard of hearing. (P04)

> [Coronavirus] The contact us first helps us protect you and others. (P04)

> [Telehealth] Yes, depending on severity. Like if my leg is detached than Telehealth wouldnâ€™t work. If it were allergies than yes. (P04)

> [Coronavirus] If I have symptoms of COVID-19 I would click on Express Care. (P05)

> [Telehealth] I think [VA] would and they probably do and should. Especially right now due to the circumstances. Then again go to the VA in Providence RI and they only have 15 doctors for all veterans so it is hard to get your doctor on the line. (P05)

> I have a standing every 2 weeks for the oncology social worker, I cannot get out and she has gotten access for telehealth so she sends me an email and I click on it. It is like sitting there with her and it was really great. (P05)

All participants said they are interested in continuing using or starting to use virtual medical appointments as much as possible and see the value in Telehealth beyond the pandemic. 

However, it participants were unsure how to schedule Telehealth visits, most stating that they were only given the option recently as a result of the novel coronavirus. Telehealth should be clearly identified as an option, where available when a user is scheduling appointments. 

Additionally, many of the participants differentiated the term "Express Care" from "same-day Telehealth" by describing the former as an in-person same-day type of care, versus the latter being a virtual visit. However, when presented with the prototype [screen: appointment type selection page], it was unclear which types of appointments were offered as Telehealth appointments. 

An additional consideration for immediate implementation for"Express Care" specifically is providing a means for coronavirus screening, virtually. All participants said they would be interested in utilizing "Express Care" if they were concerned about symptoms of coronavirus, before seeking in-person medical help. 


### 2. If "Express Care" is going to be offered, the experience must clear and consistent across the entire VA medical ecosystem.

> I know it says 4 hours but I think it would be within an hour to 45 minutes or if you are lucky 10-15 minutes. (P03)

> When you click submit it would go to the VA and I assume it will go to the big VA than they will send an email or call the smaller VA where they do my medical and call me quicker rather than the big VA. From the timeframe I want them to call the smaller VA would call and explain in better detail than they tell me to come in or go to urgent care. (P03)

> I was not expecting a pending appointment... They have all of this information and then it would go to the person that it needs to go than they will call back instead of a video screen to ask what is going on then you describe what is occurring than the doctor on call. (P03)

> Screening is when they give a quick assessment, within 5 minutes of clicking the button maybe someone will popup asking what is occurring and asking if everything is alright. Hopefully, they would pop up quick to get on the line to see what is occurring. (P03)

> Hopefully get a call within 4 hours, it depends on how many people are making requests. So roll the dice and hope for the best. (P04)

> Express care to me makes me think I have to go somewhere. (P04)

> If experiencing symptoms you can do an express screening prior to going to the clinic. Same day and telehealth is the same as express. I would go with express. (P05)

> I think it looks really good and I cannot wait for them to roll it out. I would list the type of care you need. Yes, the new appointments I would probably put in a lot more. (P05)

Although VA has offered "Express Care" since 2017 and despite experience with VA Telehealth appointment, none of the participants could accurately describe "Express Care," although two participants saying they heard of it before. 

While unfamiliar, in our sessions, most participants selected the "Express Care screener" option to initiate a same-day virtual appointment from the appointment screen, based on the content and context of this option from the landing page from the prototype. However, this option still presented confusion about what "Express Care" would accomplish for them. Additionally, when presented with a list of options and asked to schedule a virtual appointment for today, when given the options "Express Care" or "Telehealth screening" with the same description, participants either could not tell the difference or that the "Express Care" option should include Telehealth in the name because they didn't understand it to be a virtual option, despite including this in the description. 

Provide, in plain language, clarification around types of care Veterans can receive through "Express Care", who will be responding to their request, when they will get a response and how.

We believe this gap in knowledge about the service stems from both lack of offering as well as variation in experience across the VA medical facility ecosystem. Messaging about the service must be clear, in plain language, and consistent from one VISN/VAMC to another. 


### 3. If "Express Care" is going to be offered, responses must be from medical professionals, not schedulers.

> I would assume a team of nurses would be running this. (P01)

> [Was it clear to you that express care is a screening?] No. (P01)

> It guarantees someone will call within 4 hours and that knocks out the screening portion...The screening kind of takes out the middleman of going to the urgent care unless it is serious. (P01)

> If it is triage, definitely a nurse, but if it is behavioral health related than a doctor. It depends on the type of care it is...If it is same day then you must understand that you are working with someone that is available and may not be on your team. (P01)

> [How would you feel if you received a call form a scheduler first?] Unless they decided that it could not be handled with Telehealth I would be irritated. (P02)

> I would not expect a scheduler to call me unless they decided a Telehealth appointment would not work. (P02)
>
> I assume depending on the situation it may be the nurse. Depending on what it is the nurse will call and ask what it happening and screen to the doctor to have the conversation. The nurse is knowledgable and knows what to do. (P03)

> So if you pick same day Telehealth they call to schedule an appointment. I did not realize that. What I read, I think it is the nurse or PA or doctor calling back depending on the issue. (P04)

> If I look at Express Care I would think a nurse. (P05)

> So same day telehealth would be a virtual. Express care, you would want to put telehealth in the title. If I just look at it this way I think I will get an in person appointment but if I look at same day I see telehealth. I would like to see express care Telehealth screening. (P05)

Nearly all (91%) participants expected a response from a medical professional, either a nurse, LIP, or a doctor, regardless if it was someone from their PACT or not. "Express Care" requests must be responded to by medical professionals who can provide medical advice and/or determine medically necessary next steps for resolving urgent medical needs, not by a scheduler. 


### 4. Timeliness is critical, especially for same-day and urgent types of care. Responses to "Express Care" requests must be within the time promised.

> There is only calling the crisis line or waiting the 4 hours to them to call you. (P01)

> Within four hours depending on when you tell them that you want them to call. [If you submit now at 2:20pm EST do you expect a call back within 4 hours?] Knowing the VA and they normally close at 3pm. Not until tomorrow. (P02)

> If they provide the 4 hour window you think you have cleared the window for making an appointment. (P04)

> Yes, let them decide the level of care I need. (P04)

> I do not like the 4 hours; I think that is probably a little to long. That is what it is. I guess it is the standard time. (P05)

> It is good that it is 8 to 8. So divided by 4 and you have morning, afternoon, and evening...If you clicked noon at noon, they should call at by 4pm and if not I hope they would call in the evening. (P05)

> Express, you think fast. Same day you can do it at 8am or until 6pm. Within the same 24 hour care I think same day, with express I think within a short amount of time. (P05)

> I was upset I did not hear something until later and I was surprised pleasantly at 645pm when he call but happy that he was still working. Changing his appointment to phone was seemed better and had to spend more time with them due to it being a phone call. (P06)

Participants had varying expectations about the VA's ability to meet or exceed the expectations of a 4-hour response window for "Express Care". Opinions varied about the 4-hour response window, falling into the following categories: they didn't believe that it was accurate, that it was only accurate if they initiated the request in the morning, or that it was acceptable. 

Since our research, VA has proposed a 1-hour response window. With this change, **it is critical that there is staff available and capable to respond to "Express Care" requests as indicated to Veterans.**


### 5. Conduct a comprehensive audit of the ways to schedule VA appointments, not limited to official methods offered by VA.

> Because we were not on the schedule it was like we were not priority. We were rushed in and out of there and it was a waste of time to be seen. Overall crappy experience. (P01)

> They only let you schedule so often on myhealthevet when you need an appointment but they would give me a call. (P03)

> [Scheduling same-day appointments] Yes, I have through my doctor. I have done that before...I had my wife call and do it. I tried it over the internet but they are busy and do not have time to check the email all the time. She called than we went over and they took care of it. It works but again most of the time they prefer you to go to the ER so they do not have to reschedule anyone else. (P04)

When asked how they currently schedule appointments with VA providers, participants identified five unique methods for scheduling an appointment. Additionally, some participants identified multiple ways they go about scheduling appointments, depending on the type of care or responsiveness of their provider or initial appointment request method. 

A comprehensive audit will lead to a better understanding of Veterans' mental model of scheduling, how to present the information in a meaningful way, and how to redesign the scheduling experience on VA.gov. Furthermore, as Telehealth becomes a fundamental part of providing care for Veterans by the VA medical system, understanding how Veterans think of this type of visit in the construct of appointments and scheduling is imperative.
