- **I have started recording. I would like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers?
What is telehealth: It is actually a good product to use especially where you are. I am close enough where I can drive in when I need but if they are rural they may not be able to get in. I used to work for the VA and my husband still works there. If it is just an update for a previous visit it is better to stay home to save the gas and call in using the phone or computer.
Same day care: Usually if I needed to come in to see my provider I can call in to see if there is an open appointment or go to urgent care if needed.
What is urgent care: It is open 24/7 and you can go in there as long as its not an emergency. If it is going to the ER. 

## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth

- Have you ever used Telehealth appointments? Yes
  - If YES: 
    - Was this with a VA provider or non-VA doctor? Yes.
        - If VA: How did you schedule your appointment: I usually schedule through myhealthevet to schedule the appointments there. If it is possible I can do telehealth by sending a message through secure messaging. 
    - Was this a same-day appointment? Yes, I have. 
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience?  It was good, from the iPhone from work. It is the case of I am concerned about an issue with my hand and she was able to look at it through the phone and set an appointment up with the surgeon. It was a cyst and was able to get the appointment and do the follow up using telehealth. 
Something that happened before: Something that occurred right at the start of COVID 19.
Would you have done it prior: Probably not, but my husband knew it was occurring so I asked to do it over the phone and I did that and then took care of it. There were 2 follow up , one for them to look at it than the other one to ask questions via telehealth.
Would you use it in the future: Well here at my VA they have been really consistent about offering telehealth but it has been going on longer than that. If you leave on the eastern peninsula and have an appointment you have an option to go in or talk to the provider on their computer, it saves time. This is from my time at the VA, that is a 4 hour drive and not everyone can drive 4 hours to go to the VA so its good that they can dial in from home.
Express care: No
What might it be: Sounds like urgent care
In person or virtual: Likely in person but it depends on the situation. Maybe you can call the nurse line on the weekends at the VA. I have never used it. 
- Have you heard anything about same-day/urgent care Telehealth appointments through VA? Yes. 
How would you do it: OI would call into the operator and see if they are available that day with my provider. If it is an emergency I would go to the hospital or urgent care but normally it is a call to see their schedule. I prefer to do it online if I could. 
Would it be okay to see any one or someone of your team: I prefer my provider but if I have to talk to anyone why not. 
Option to wait and talk to your team, would you if it is a longer wait: I would pick my provider even if I have to wait a day that is fine. If it is telehealth it is convenient instead of driving an hour. 
Same day with VA provider: Yes I have and it was with my normal provider. 
How: I called in. 
Were you able to be seen: No I had to wait a day for that. Of course when I worked for the VA I could just walk down to the second floor. Now since I do not work there I just have to call in. 
How do you schedule now: I go through myhealthevet and place a request via the system. 
Do you use the schedule list or secure messaging: I use both. It depends on the appointment available, if I need eye or ears I can normally get the same day, if it is mental health I have to call in but normally it is just going in to get an appointment. If it is special care I need to send it via messenger. 

## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment? No I would say it is urgent care. If it is same day or urgent care it would be urgent not normal appointments. 
How are they different: for urgent care that would depend on what it is , for me it  would be a bee sting, actually I have to go to the ER I am allergic. If I am bit by a tick to have it checked out and get a shot. If it were mental health I would call in, I go to the person outside of the VA but if it were mental health and I need to get in I would call or just do a walk in. 

- Can you tell me what types of urgent care you might seek through VA's same-day Telehealth appointments?   Usually for me I would be just going to the medical provider for that day. The scheduling system with the VA . For example, there was a doctor there that left because of the scheduling. He would have 2 appointments on one day and full the next and only there half the week. He would live up here during the summer than move down to FL. His biggest reason for leaving was because it was not consistent. It helps to be consistent if you spread out appointments. 


## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we are going to take a look at a prototype. We have stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it is a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.  This looks similar to myhealthevet. Basically, I like this request express care screen. I am assuming the appointments were same day or ones that are already set up. (reading page) I look at this way, I would pout if you think it is an emergency to go right to the ER, they have they will contact you within 4 hours. When you get to the VA they have it where you are screened and get a pass to get upstairs during this COVID period. If it is an emergency I would definitely put in if you think it is an emergency just go. Looks straight forward. 

- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed into your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment?  I can click request express care screening. I am assuming this is a future appointment on the screen, I would click request express care screening or click on new appointment than it will bring up options. I would click new appointment, usually if  need to do same day it will be with my provider. 
What do you think would happen if you click express care: It would send a request to any medical provider available and the request would go to a central area and whoever is on the team, normally the nurse will get back with the person to get it set up. 

Is that what you expected: There we go it has the 911 information, I would click in the details section and put in my synthons. Make sure my number is correct and like the availability and my email address and click request care screening. 
 
 - Is that what you expected to happen? 

- [in prototype: show scheduling list screen] Imagine you are signed into your account, want to make an appointment, and you see this appointment scheduling screen. From this list, walk me through how you would try to be seen today for something, virtually.

  - Why did you choose this option?

  - Based on the type of care description, what do you think will happen?

    - Was it clear to you that this is a screening before an actual appointment? Yes, because telehealth says phone to me. 

    - Was it clear to you that this is not an in-person appointment? 

    - Who do you think you will get a call from? (Clarify: a provider or a scheduler?) :A nurse.
How would you feel if it were a scheduler: That would be fine to. 

You saw 4 hours call back; do you think  you would get a call: If it were in the morning yes if it were in the afternoon most likely not.
What would the cut off be : If it were a 4 hour window maybe 10am. The normally hours are 8 to 430pm. They have additional days in the evening with rotations of doctors that handle the evening hours. I would day 10am for same day. 
What if you specific the time window: I would specify that they need to call me back and if its within an hour I would place that to alert he scheduler to call me as soon as possible. I go to the normal hospital but there are 7 COBC and they are adding another one. This has to be in respect to that as well because a lot of people choose to go to the closest one. 
Who do think they would get a call from: Someone from the hospital. I think depending on the size of the clinic there are 4-5 doctors and a lot of them are only open 4 days a week. I think if it were telehealth screening it would be from the hospital. 
Did you notice the best times to call back: Yes.
Do you think if you choose the evening option you would get a call back: I do not see why not. If you talk about the schedulers they are only during the say. If you have to call the 24 hours. I have never called in the evening. There are normally a few shifts for the operators at the call center. May 7am to 830pm. I do not know if theta would go to a more central call center, I do not know. If I were using this I would click all of them, just call me as soon as you can. In the details section I would place please call ASAP. 

Expect to happen when you submit: I would get an email conformation and then likely get a call back within a few hours.

Is this what you expected: (reading page) I like all of that. I would like to get an email confirmation as well. It have that if you have an appointment you will get a text, call, or email. The population here is older and not everyone have internet or iPhone but everyone has a phone and they will contact your multiple times to ensure that you are coming to the appointment.
When you see the providers list do you think they are contacting you: Most likely but it depends on the availability of the prover but if they are not able to the next doctor will call. It depends on time and available along with how many patients. 

- [in prototype: show Express Care scheduling screen] (Click continue from scheduling list screen) This is the Express Care request screen. What do you expect will happen once you submit this form? This is cool. Now this does depend though, some of these areas you will need a referral. There will be a  few thing that the medical provider would have to send a referral but most can be made same day or get an appointment without a refer. I would click express care, primary care, same day telehealth. Most of these would work for me. Social work definitely. I have never need it on there but that is a good one. Most of these I can do same day care. 

Looking at express care descriptions, based on type of care what do you think will happen: If it is express care I would like something that is less than 4 hours. If I click on it, I expect to get a call in a few hours.

Clear it is a screening: Yes. What I would do is to make it more, like for telehealth screening only in block letters.
Who would call you: A nurse or scheduler. 

## Section 4: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today? Yes

  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? Sure.

- Do you think VA has resources appointments available to help you if you are experiencing symptoms or may be suffering from coronavirus?  If I were uncertain I would do express care if it is more urgent I would just go to express care.

- Do you have any comments or questions about Express Care that we have not yet covered today?   No, I think you are on the right track for this. You just have to remember a lot of veterans are older and that must be taken into consideration.
