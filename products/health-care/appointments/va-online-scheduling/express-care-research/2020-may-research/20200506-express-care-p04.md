# Express Care: Participant 02

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I would like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers? 
What is telehealth: I do not know I have never used it; it is a good thing right now if you do not have any serious issues going on.
What would it be: I guess you would be in front of the computer and talk back and forth, hopefully you will be able to text as well because I am hard of hears. I have waited a long time for the VA to allow texting.
What is same day care: That would be wonderful!. 
What is urgent care: It would be a step below going to the ER I would think. 

## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth

- Have you ever used Telehealth appointments? I have not. 

  - If NO: 
    - In your own words, can you define "Telehealth"?
    - Have you considered it before?  Oh, yes.
Why: Because I do not have to get in the car to go somewhere. You know I am 68 I get to walk for 30 minutes and that is my activity to be health. 
Express care: No I have not.
What does it mean: Sounds like it would be an urgent care type places where we go and if they cannot help they send you to the hospital. It is basically a for profit clinic and they assess you to see if you need to go to the hospital. 
In person or virtual: I would rather do telehealth than in person. 
If someone said express care, would it be in person or virtual: I would think in person. 
- Have you heard anything about same-day/urgent care Telehealth appointments through VA? No, I have not. 
- Do you think that the VA offers any same-day urgent care Telehealth appointments?)- they probably do but I do not keep up with it now.

- Have you ever tried to make a same-day appointment with a VA provider, either someone you see regularly or any available provider? Yes I have through my doctor. I have done that before.
Process of making appointment: I had my wife call and do it. I tried it over the internet but they are busy and do not have time to check the email all the time. She called than  we went over and they took care of it. It works but again most of the time they prefer you to go to the ER so they do not have to reschedule anyone else. 
How do you currently schedule your appointment with your doctor: myhealthevet the website.
Online: Yes, as much as possible. 
Like using it: I have made appointments for my eye doctor, PMC, and hearing. With everything going on it has been changed. 

## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment?  Something like that I would go to the ER.
Skipping scheduling: Yes unless there was an urgent care available. 
Consider using telehealth: Yes, depending on severity. Like fi my leg is detached than telehealth wouldn’t work. If it were allergy than yes. 

    - How would you schedule this type of care appointment? Minor stuff like allergies, or if I have a cut on my arm or leg. Nothing serious, again minor stuff. 
A way to determine if you need further help: Yes let them decide the level of care I need. 

- Who do you expect to speak with for an urgent same-day VA Telehealth appointment? Anyone, I would expect my PMC to drop everything. He has appointments to do and he has other stuff to take care of beside my emergency stuff.
  

## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we are going to take a look at a prototype. We have stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it is a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. (reading screen) express care and appointments below. 

  - Probe: What does / does not make sense? This looks alright. 
Familiar to you: I have not seen this before, I do it through secure messaging. 

- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed into your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment?  Click express care screening.
Why did it stand out: Because it is the first thing highlighted on the page. It is at the top and it is highlighted. Also it has the explanation that is easy to read.

Anything in the explanation: The contact us first helps us protect you and others. 
 
 - Is that what you expected to happen? Yes, (reading page.) It tells you to add the additional details. 
Request care screen page: That looks good. 
What would you expect to happen when you submit: Well I would hopefully get a call between those times. I would make sure my wife was here because she would be answering the calls.
Which time would you pick: That would work fine because it would allow me to make sure that I was present for the call.
What if you could click more than one: I am available all day so that would be great.
Did you notice that the VA would call back within 4 hours of request: Yes.
Now if you click all boxes what would happen: Hopefully get a call within 4 hours, it depends on how many people are making requests. So roll the dice and hope for the best. 
Who would be calling you: Probably a nurse to begin with. It depends on the problem that you are dealing with but if it is steps above them maybe a doctor or a PA. it depends on the problem. You will be triaged. 
You mentioned that it would not be someone that is on your team, but if you had the option to request someone from your team: That would be nice because they know be and have my records.
If you could, would you mind waiting a bit longer to talk with them: If it were the same day, yes I would wait. It depends on the issue. I use secure messaging to talk with my nurse.
Option to get a call within 8 instead of 4: Yes that would be great. 
Is that what you expected: (reading page) Yes, it has preferred providers. Yes that is good.
Enough information: Yes.

- [in prototype: show scheduling list screen] Imagine you are signed into your account, want to make an appointment, and you see this appointment scheduling screen. From this list, walk me through how you would try to be seen today for something, virtually. 
	It provides more options there. Like express care button. I would use express care; sorry I see the same day telehealth. I would click that first. 

  - Why did you choose this option? Again it depends on the issue, for something minor. It would be better if I went for them and let them determine if I need to go to the next level of care. 
What about express care and same day, what is the difference: (reading page) express care and telehealth, are they the same thing.
What do you believe: It is the impression I am getting that they are the same.

  - Based on the type of care description, what do you think will happen? It looks like to me you would end with the same result. 
Based on the phrasing, who would contact you: The nurse or a PA depending on the problem. 

    - Was it clear to you that this is a screening before an actual appointment? 

    - Was it clear to you that this is not an in-person appointment?  Yes.

Was one more clear than the other: they are worded the exact way.

Seems like you saw express care and like it first but saw same day telehealth screening, did it help enforce what it was within the description: Express care to me makes me think I have to go somewhere. Same day telehealth means I can sit here and wait for them to get back to me. The wording is important.

So if it says express care than in the label identify it is virtual, would that help: That would be better or just get rid of it because telehealth same day care is the same thing. The two words to describe the same thing just use one. 

You get a scheduler first to set up an appointment, was that clear: so if you pick same day telehealth they call to schedule an appointment. I did not realize that. What I read, I think it is the nurse or PA or doctor calling back depending on the issue. If they provide the 4 hour window you think you have cleared the window for making an appointment.
