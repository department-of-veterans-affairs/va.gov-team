## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling Telehealth, or virtual medical, same-day appointments with a VA provider. I am going to ask you a series of questions and we'll take a look at a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you heard of "Express Care"?
  - If YES: 
    - What is it? 
    - Have you used it?
  - If NO: What do you think it might be?
  - Prompt if needed: Is it Telehealth or in-person?
- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers?
  - If YES: 
    - Which ones?
  - Have you ever utilized these services? 
    - (Prompt if needed: VA or non-VA providers)
  - How did you become aware of them?

## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth

- Have you ever used Telehealth appointments?
  - If YES: 
    - Was this with a VA provider or non-VA doctor?
        - If VA: How did you schedule your appointment 
    - Was this a same-day appointment?
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience?
  - If NO: 
    - In your own words, can you define "Telehealth"?
    - Have you considered it before? 
    - What would convince you to try it?
  - Would you consider using Telehealth appointments for a same-day appointment?
- Have you heard anything about same-day/urgent care Telehealth appointments through VA?
  - (Clarification question if needed: Do you think that VA offers any same-day urgent care appointments? Do you think that the VA offers any same-day urgent care Telehealth appointments?)
- Have you ever tried to make a same-day appointment with a VA provider, either someone you see regularly or any available provider?
  - If YES: 
    - Can you tell me what happened?
    - How did you make this appointment?
    - Were you able to be seen?
  - If NO:
    - Have you ever considered doing this, but something prevented you? If so, what?

## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or urgent care the same thing as scheduling an appointment? If not, how is this different?
- Can you tell me what types of urgent care you might seek through VA's same-day Telehealth appointments?
- Who do you expect to speak with for an urgent same-day VA Telehealth appointment?

## Section 3: Coronavirus appointments 

Next, I'm going to ask you some questions related to coronavirus. These are general questions related to how you might seek medical help if you are experiencing symptoms. If you feel uncomfortable at any point we can move on to the next section or stop, just let me know. 
- Can you tell me in your own words what COVID-19 means?
- When you are speaking with family or friends how do you refer to the current pandemic?
  - Do you differentiate between the disease versus the virus?
- Have you been practicing physical distancing, physical isolation, or quarantined, by choice or otherwise?
  - If so, what caused you to do so?
  - If not, what would cause you to do so?
- Where do you go to seek guidance on taking care of yourself and your family during this pandemic?
  - What VA health care resources are you aware of related to coronavirus, if any?
- Have you had any concern that you have experienced symptoms related to coronavirus?
  - If YES: 
    - What did you do to get care?
  - If NO: 
    - Imagine that you did, what would your first step towards seeking care be?
  - Are you aware of any coronavirus screening resources through VA available to you?
- Would you use an online screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus?
- Do you think VA has appointments available to help you if you are experiencing symptoms or may be suffering from coronavirus?
  - Do you think VA has any urgent Telehealth appointments available to yourself or Veterans?

## Section 4: [Prototype]

Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
