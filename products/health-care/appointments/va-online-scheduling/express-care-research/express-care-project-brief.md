# Express Care project brief

## Overview: 
We need to understand when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent", "immediate", and "now" through VA digital channels. We specifically want to understand:
 + when do Veterans seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care
 + what types of care do Veterans seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care / how do they define same day care
 + would Veterans use an online method for receiving same day care

## Problem Statement:
Some Veterans have a care need right now that requires immediate medical attention or guidance. For various reasons, the Veteran may not be able to go into a physical location for this care. Additionally, their care need may not require an in person visit. In both cases, however, the Veteran needs to talk to a medicial professional _today_. 

Currently, "Express Care" is a vehicle/care option by which the VA can provide immediate, same day evaluation via VA Video Connect (or telehealth). 

Additionally, given the recent COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to give Veterans fast access to care and evaluation via telehealth either as an alternative to in office, face-to-face visits or as a mechanism for screening patients who suspect they have COVID-19. 

This problem may be a subset to a larger problem statement - Veterans have acess to various types of care which can make it difficult to understand what kind of care to access and how to access it. This is especially true when considering the different VA digital access points to accessing care. 

## Goal:
We want to perform user research with various Veterans to collect insights and data on what types of care Veterans would seek same-day care access and how they would go about (care options) receiving this immediate care at the VA with emphasis on understanding use of 'telehealth' or online care options.

## Current Hypothesis:
We believe the existing vehicle for delivering this same day care "Express Care" online is a separate flow from VA Online Schedule because urgent online consultation/care is same day and not future facing like VA Online Scheduling. 

Flow could be surfaced/launched from our VAOS "view your appointments" landing page, but there may be a better entry point. What would that entry point be?

## Research Questions:
 + _Add questions here to supplement Research Plan_
 + How do Veterans define Express Care 
 + Why/when do Veterans seek out express care
 + Where would Veterans look to schedule/access this type of same day care
 + Are Veterans willing/able to use online methods for same day care
 + What type of devices/platforms have Veterans used to receive similar type of access (if at all?)
 + Where can we contextually redirect Veterans to appropriate access points based on need (e.g., if immediate need vs future facing need such as scheduled appointment)
 + What (if any) of the existing digital tools would a Veteran assume they'd use to receive immediate, same day digital care?
 + Is "same-day" care the same thing as scheduling an appointment? If not, how is this different?
 + Explain your current process for getting a same-day appointment
 + What is the latest time of day a Veteran should be able to get "same-day" care?

 ### Appendix of Background Research/Information
 + [Get Care Research (Fall 2019)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/patient-portal/get-care) -- Has some overlap with the broader question her of 'care access and digital tools.' They dabbled a bit in talking online health/telehealth. 
 + Current Veteran Care Access points/ecosystem:
  + VA Mobile Apps
  + MyHealtheVet (MHV) -- _Veterans comfortable using this digital place for all health related needs_
   + Secure Messaging
     + Secure messaging currently used to accomplish wide variety of tasks
     + High % of Veterans use Secure Message (need to get exact numbers)
    + Legacy VAOS (for now)
  + VA.gov
    + VAOS-R (new VA Online Scheduling on VA.gov)
  + VA Facility Locator
  + Telehealth
    + CVT
    + VVC (VA Video Connect) -- current focus Primary Care & Mental Health
      + Current initiative to increase VVC by providers for PC and MH care capable
 + Notes from Get Care research:
   + Veterans prefer face to face interactions
   + Veterans are not aware of online services
   + Veterans trust online services promoted/used by their primarcy care provider, however, there was expressed hesitancy associated with new technology. Veterans expressed first interaction with tech key and Veteran willingness to try if it can help their provider. 
  + Veterans are calling for items that could be handled online
  + Missed appointments high
  + High call volumes at call centers
  + High appointment request volume
  + Multiple tools exist to accomplish same tasks
  + Some VHA resources are _overutilized_ (e.g. call center volume)
