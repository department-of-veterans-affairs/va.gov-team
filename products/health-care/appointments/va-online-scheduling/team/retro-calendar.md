# Retrospective Calendar

VAOS uses [EasyRetro](https://easyretro.io/login) to create interactive retro boards.

(Team members must register for a free account before creating a new board.)

We have typically used the "Went Well, To Improve, Action Items" format, but there are many formats for capturing feedback.
- See the EasyRetro template descriptions for more options! https://easyretro.io/retrospective-ideas/
