# OH Scheduling Requirements (WIP)

This document captures the requirements for scheduling, requesting, and cancelling Oracle Health appointments. There will be an MVP for this work (target June 2025) and baseline complete functionality (target December 2025).

**This is a work in-progress document and requirements may change in the process. Final requirements will be noted.**

The scope of this is the MVP release. See the [out of scope](#out-of-scope) section for non MVP. 

See also our [open questions](#open-questions).

## MVP Release

The MVP will only support nutrition and food specialty care.


## User stories

- As a Veteran registered at an Oracle Health location, I want to be able to schedule appointments Oracle Health appointments online.

## Requirements (WIP)

### Access

Follows the business rules for [login and access](login-and-access.md).

OH facilities can be configured the online scheduling options available to Veterans:
- Direct scheduling through VAOS can be enabled for appointments of a given care type at a given location.
- Requests through VAOS can be enabled for appointments of a given care type at a given location.

### Direct scheduling

**A Veteran must [choose a type of care](schedule-flow/all--type-of-care.md).**
   - VAOS supports direct scheduling and requests. 
   - The MVP will only support nutrition and food specialty care.
   - In the future other types of care will be supported [Types TBD]

**A Veteran must [choose a location for their appointment](schedule-flow/va-direct--choose-location.md) for their selected type of care.**

The system displays all OH locations where the Veteran has had an appointment.

Facilities can be configured:
- Whether a facility supports direct-scheduling, requests, both, or neither for each type of care.
   - Note that the general rules for which scheduling types are allowed
- Whether a user is required to have had an appointment at that facility for each type of care
   - The timeframe for that appointment (e.g. 24 or 36 months - actual timeframes TBD)
- The number of requests a user is allowed to submit to a facility for a given type of care (e.g. 1-2)

A OH user can schedule nutrition and food appointments at any OH location where:
  1. They are a registered patient.
    - Note: registering at one OH location automatically registers them at all other OH facilities.
  1. AND They have had an appointment at that location for the selected type of care
  1. AND The location has enabled direct scheduling for the selected type of care

Note: Facilities with providers a user has a relationship with will only be displayed if the user has had a past appointment with that provider at that specific facility. This prevents users from accidentally scheduling appointments at distant locations if a provider has moved to a different facility.

When choosing an OH location, a Veteran will be directed to [request an appointment](#requests) if the facility:
  - Has disabled direct scheduling,
  - AND has enabled requests.

When choosing an OH location, a Veteran will be directed to call to schedule if:
   - They select any type of care other than those supported by VAOS 
   - They select a supported type of care, but have not had an appointment for that type of care at that location.
   - Neither DS nor requests are enabled

The system alerts the user if they can't continue scheduling an appointment because:
- They aren't registered at any facilities where they can schedule appointments
- None of their facilities support direct scheduling or requests.
- The facility they chose doesn't support direct scheduling or requests.
- They haven't had an appointment in the given timeframe at the location they selected.
- They have hit the limit of requests for the selected type of care at the selected facility.

**A Veteran may choose a provider for their appointment.**

Note: the URL for this page will be `https://va.gov/my-health/appointments/schedule/provider` 

The Veteran is given the option to select:
- Providers with whom they have had a recent appointment (within the timeframe configured in VAS) for a supported type of care.
- None of the options
    - If they choose this option:
      - AND requests are enabled, they are directed to [request an appointment](#requests).
      - If requests are disabled, they are directed to call to schedule.

**A Veteran must [provide the preferred date for their appointment](schedule-flow/va-direct--preferred-date.md).**
- Note: OH can't receive preferred date due to a technical limitation. However, this field is used to warn users that they can't select same day appointments.

**A Veteran must [choose an appointment date and time](schedule-flow/va-direct--choose-a-date.md)**


**A Veteran must [provide the reason for their appointment](schedule-flow/va-direct--reason-for-appointment.md).**


**A Veteran must [review/enter the contact information for their appointment](schedule-flow/va-direct--reason-for-appointment.md).**


**A Veteran must [review their appointment information](schedule-flow/va-direct--review-and-submit.md) before confirming/scheduling their appointment**

### Requests

A Veteran may request an appointment when:
- [Facility leadership] have enabled requests for the selected type of care at their chosen location and:
  - Direct scheduling isn't enabled.
  - OR There are no appointment times available.
  - OR they want a different provider than the options allow.
  
Requesting an appointment at OH follows the current VistA request flow business rules.

Note: We do not have the ability to tie a provider to the request. When requesting an appointment, the Veteran is not able to request a specific provider. They will only be able to request a time and date and location for their TOC and staff will contact them to finish scheduling. 

### Community care

A Veteran may not request community care for any care type through an OH location.

## Open Questions

**Note: All answers are unconfirmed unless noted otherwise.** Once we get closer to an agreed-upon approach we'll ask stakeholders to review and confirm these.

Q. Who determines whether or not to enable online scheduling/requests for given types of care at OH facilities? Does that happen at the facility level, or higher?

Q. Which types of care or "services" that VAOS supports today could allow for the patient to schedule with a provider they have never seen before? 

## Answered Questions (FAQ)

Q. What's the difference between an encounter, and an appointment?

An encounter is any interaction with a provider, and could include phone calls. An appointment is when a Veteran sees a provider for medical care or assessment. 


Q. Can a user schedule new patient appointments?
   - A. No, they need to be registered and have had a past appointment (in the last 36 months) with a provider for the selected type of care to schedule at a location.

Q. Can a user schedule into time slots that aren't associated with a provider?
   - A. No, selectable time slots always need to have a provider with whom the Veteran has had a previous appointment as the primary resource. 
       - Note: This is scenario is not likely to occur. The Provider will always be the primary resource, and usually with the Room as secondary. Time slots should always have provider data.
       - Note: Time slots may have a secondary resource, such as a room or machine, but we don't know if that information should be exposed to the Veteran.

Q. Can a user schedule into times reserved for new patients?
 - A. Yes. This doesn't make them a new user, it just means the tool will offer those slots to schedule into.

Q. Does a user need an appointment with a provider to schedule/request nutrition and food appointments with them?
   - A. Yes, they must have had an appointment within the last 36 months.
   - Note: In the future, for types of care other than `Nutrition and food`, a user MAY be able to schedule with providers when they don't have a recent appointment. One example that came up was `Whole Health`, which isn't supported by VAOS currently. We will update this document when we learn that's the case.
  
## Design Decisions

### Replace Request Limit Reached Alert
Replace the current alert informing Veterans that they are over the request limit with a simpler alert directing them to call to schedule.

### Reasoning
The current alert is lengthy and confusing, asking Veterans to cancel a previous request to make a new one, which may imply they don’t need their existing request. This could be misleading, as each request likely has a purpose. Instead, the alert should focus on a clear action Veterans can take: calling to schedule their appointment.

## Direct Veterans to the Request Flow in Specific Scenarios

Instead of displaying the “Which provider do you want to schedule with?” screen, direct Veterans to the request flow in the following situations:

1. **No Available Time Slots for Established Provider(s):**
   - Established providers have no available slots in the next 13 months.
   - Request option is enabled.

2. **Direct Scheduling Disabled:**
   - DS is disabled.
   - Request option is enabled.
   - Veteran recently had an appointment with a provider for this type of care (TOC) at this facility.

3. **Direct Scheduling Enabled, No Recent Appointment:**
   - DS is enabled.
   - Request option is enabled.
   - Veteran has not had a recent appointment at this facility.

4. **Direct Scheduling and Requests Enabled, No Recent Appointment:**
   - DS is enabled.
   - Request option is available.
   - Veteran has not had a recent appointment with any provider for this TOC at this facility.

### Reasoning

These scenarios prioritize sending Veterans directly to the request flow when scheduling options are unavailable. This approach focuses on available actions.

## Out of scope

We won't be surfacing provider availability in a way that lets Veterans compare providers to find the best time:
- For nutrition and food, we're just showing providers where the Veteran with whom a Veteran has had an appointment in the past 36 months.
- We don't have a situation where a Veteran can choose from any provider, whether or not they have a provider. Once that comes up, we can revisit this. 

We will not be including Building, Floor, or room number. Context: Fetching Encounters along with appointments increases request times.
Not all Encounters include building and floor information in the display string, likely due to missing details in the Location resource.
