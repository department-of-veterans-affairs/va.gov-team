# Appointments home page

## Overview
Starting page to schedule or manage appointments.

## User stories

- As a Veteran, I want a starting point for my appointment scheduling and management tasks.
- As a Veteran, I want to be able to schedule appointments online.
- As a Veteran, I want to be able to find my upcoming, past, and pending appointments.

## Requirements

### Functional
<!-- What the system should do in order to meet the user's needs (see user stories.) These are the aspects of the feature that the user can detect. -->

- User can start the process for scheduling an appointment online.
- User can navigate to their past appointments.
- User can navigate to their pending appointments.
- User can review a summary list of their [upcoming appointments](./appointment-lists/upcoming-list.md).

**Alerts**
- All messages to the user must provide an explanation of the issue and guidance for resolving the issue.  
- If user is ineligible to use VAOS because they are not registered at a VA facility the [alert that user is not registered at a VA facility](#alert-that-user-is-not-registered-at-a-va-facility) displays.
