# Login and access

## Overview
Appointments is authenticated and has some access requirements that Veterans must meet to use the tool.

## User stories

- As a Veteran I want to access tools that let me schedule and manage my VA appointments.

## Requirements

### Functional
<!-- What the system should do in order to meet the user's needs (see user stories.) These are the aspects of the feature that the user can detect. -->
- A user may only log into VAOS if all the following are true:  
  -  User is registered for care at a VA Medical Center (VAMC).
  -  User has a Premium MyHealtheVet, Id.me, Login.gov,  or DS Logon Level 2 login credential.     
- A message must display to any non-registered veterans informing them they must be registered at a VAMC to use VAOS.  

### Non-functional
- To determine registered facilities, the front end uses the facilities information provided by the VA Profile team.
   - Once the user logs in and is authenticated VAOS FE makes an call to the `/v0/user` 
   - the endpoint returns a response with a field called `vaProfile`.
   - The `vaProfile` field contains a field called `facilities`.  
   - If the field is empty, then the code will determine if the user is ineligible to use VAOS because they have not been registered at a VA facility.
