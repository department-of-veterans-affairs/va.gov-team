## Overview
Appointments is authenticated and has some access requirements that Veterans must meet to use the tool.

## User stories

- As a Veteran I want to access tools that let me schedule and manage my VA appointments.

## Requirements

**Functional**
<!-- What the system should do in order to meet the user's needs (see user stories.) These are the aspects of the feature that the user can detect. -->
- A user may only log into VAOS if all the following are true:  
  -  User is registered for care at a VA Medical Center (VAMC).
  -  User has a Premium MyHealtheVet, Id.me, Login.gov,  or DS Logon Level 2 login credential.     
- A message must display to any non-registered veterans informing them they must be registered at a VAMC to use VAOS.  

**Technical Notes**
- To determine registered facilities, front end uses the facilities information provided by the VA profile team. 
- VA Profile teams gets the registered facilities from the VAâ€™s Enrollment System team.
- The Enrollment System creates records based on HL7 Z07 messages that are triggered in VistA when a veteran is registered and/or key information on veteran is edited (this task needs to be running in the VistA instance:  IVM Background Job).
