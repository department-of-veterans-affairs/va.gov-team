# [Feature name]

## Overview
Veterans are asked what type of care they'd like to receive.

## User stories

- As a Veteran I want to schedule an appointment for a specific health care need.

## Requirements

**Functional**
<!-- What the system should do in order to meet the user's needs (see user stories.) These are the aspects of the feature that the user can detect. -->
- The VAOS types of care are a static list:
  - Amputation care
  - Audiology and speech
    - Routine hearing exam
    - Hearing aid support
  - COVID-19 vaccine
  - Eye care
    - Optometry
    - Ophthalmology
  - Mental health
  - MOVE! weight management program
  - Nutrition and food
  - Pharmacy
  - Podiatry
  - Primary care
  - Sleep medicine
    - Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
    - Sleep medicine and home sleep testing
  - Social work
- These are tied to clinics via stop codes that are [determined by the VA](../vista-appointments-facilities-clinics.md#clinic-stop-codes)
- Eye care, sleep care, and audiology have sub-types, which a user can choose from on the next page
    - For audiology, users are shown the facility type page before choosing the specific audiology type
- Podiatry is only available for community care. 
    - Users will see a modal if they select podiatry and they're not community care eligible
- If a user does not have a residential address, they are shown an alert on this page with a link to the va.gov profile.
- If a user chooses COVID-19 vaccine and clicks Continue, they're sent to the vaccine flow

**Check Community Care Eligibility**
- Community care eligibility is checked after the type of care page, if a user has chosen a type of care that supports community care:
    - Primary care (if they have never been seen by a VA primary care providerâ€”i.e., assigned to a PACT [Patient Aligned Care Team])
    - Audiology (for either routine exam or hearing aid support)
    - Optometry 
    - Podiatry (currently only available for Community Care)
    - Nutrition services

- A user is eligible if two checks pass:
    - The user is registered at a site that is marked as accepting community care requests
    - The community care eligibility api says that they're eligible for the type of care they chose
- If a user is community care eligible for the type of care they chose, then they will see a facility type page where they can choose between making a request for a VA appointment or for a community care provider.
