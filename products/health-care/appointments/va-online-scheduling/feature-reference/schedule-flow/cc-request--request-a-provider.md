# Request a provider - community care request flow

## Overview
Users are given an option to choose from a list of providers

## User stories

- As a Veteran I want choose the provider I would like to see. 


## Requirements

### Functional
<!-- What the system should do in order to meet the user's needs (see user stories.) These are the aspects of the feature that the user can detect. -->


- Users must be given an option to choose from a list of providers.
   - A provider must not be required to continue with the Community Care request flow. 
   - A message to veteran must be displayed to veteran if no PPMS providers are available.  
- The list may be sorted by:
    - Providers nearest a veteranâ€™s home address if veteran has a valid home address in the VA profile.
    - Providers nearest the closest city if veteran does NOT have a valid home address in the VA profile.
      - The cities listed are the same from the [closest city page](./cc-request--nearest-city.md).
    - User's current location (via their browsers's location information).
- An option to update residential address must be available during provider selection.  
- The user may only select one provider.

**Page navigation**
- `CONTINUE`: 
  - If the user has a residential address, they are sent to the [choose a language page](./cc-request--choose-a-language.md).
  - If the user doesn't have a residential address, they are sent to the [reason for appointment page](./cc-request--reason-for-appointment.md). 

### Non-functional
- Providers are fetched from the Provider Profile Management System (PPMS), using specialty codes mapped to the type of care the user has chosen for the selected provider.
