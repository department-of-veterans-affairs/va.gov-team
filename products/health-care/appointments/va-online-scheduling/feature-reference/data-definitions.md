  - `serviceType` is `NULL`, Front End will set type of care to ‘VA appointment’.
  - `serviceCategory` is other than `regular`, Front End will set type of care to ‘VA appointment’. 
      - Note, Backend sets the `serviceType` when the stop codes from the remote procedure call match VATS service type (VAT or CCM stop codes).  

- Type of Care may not be available for phone appointments and  video appointments from Virtual Care Manager (VCM) and/or Telehealth Management Platform.

**Technical notes:**

Treatment Specialty: Front End receives the HSRM "Service Requested" data in the `serviceType` for community care.  HSRM "Service Requested" maps to CPRS/CTB Standard Episode of Care field which would be too cryptic for the user. So for now Type of Care is not being displayed for CC appointments and instead provider name is displaying.
