# Cancel appointment

## Overview
Veterans can cancel appointments through VAOS.

## User stories

- As a user I want to cancel my appointments online.

## Requirements

**Functional**
<!-- What the system should do in order to meet the user's needs (see user stories.) These are the aspects of the feature that the user can detect. -->

- The user must be instructed to contact the facility to cancel an appointment if the appointment is any of the following: 
  - Community Care appointment
  - COVID appointment 
  - Compensation and Pension exam appointment
  - Video Visit appointment<sup>1</sup>

1. 01/25/24 There isn't a way right now to automatically cancel the associated appts either in VVS or the provider side appts. So a Veteran could still get video appt reminders even though they cancelled the VistA side. And/or the provider slot may not be notified to cancel.
 
### Status Message
- The canceled appointment displays a status indicating who canceled it.
- Canceled VA appointments with VistA Status = `CANCELLED BY PATIENT` (VSE GUI Expand Entry for appointment) status must display text indicating that the Veteran cancelled the appointment.
  - In this case, the alert message is "You canceled your appointment."  
- Canceled VA appointments with VistA Status = `CANCELLED BY CLINIC` (VSE GUI Expand Entry for appointment) status must display text indicating that the facility cancelled the appointment.
  - In this case, the alert message is "Facility canceled your appointment." 
 
**Non-functional/Backend**
- A VA appointment may only be cancelled if either of the following is true:
  - Clinic has Prohibit Access = NO/NULL (VistA Hospital Location file #44)   OR
  - Clinic has Prohibit Access = YES and VIAB proxy user is IN the privileged user list (VistA Hospital Location file #44).
- The VistA system must be updated when an appointment is cancelled:  
  -  A VAOS initiated cancelled appointment must file in VistA with status = `CANCELLED BY PATIENT` (VSE GUI Expand Entry for appointment) and VistA Cancel Reason = `UNABLE TO KEEP APPOINTMENT`
  - The original appointment request must be reopened in the VistA system if a VA appointment is cancelled in VAOS.
