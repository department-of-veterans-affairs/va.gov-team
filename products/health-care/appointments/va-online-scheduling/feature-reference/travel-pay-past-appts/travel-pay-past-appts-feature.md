# Travel Reiumbursement Claims for Past Appointments

## Overview
This initiative allows Veterans to file a mileage-only beneficiary travel (BT) reimbursement claim for an eligible appointment from their past appointments list on VA.gov. An elibible appointment means any appointment:
- For which the Veteran travelled to a VA facility
- That cccurred before today and up to 30 days in the past    
- Hasnâ€™t had a BT claim already filed for the same day and at the same facility (using the BTSSS Get Claim Status API).
 
## User stories

As a Veteran, I would like to easily submit online a BT claim for a past appointment so that I don't have to use a paper form or figure out how to use the BTSSS portal.
