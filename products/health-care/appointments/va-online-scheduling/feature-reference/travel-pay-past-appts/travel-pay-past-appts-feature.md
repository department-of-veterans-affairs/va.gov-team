# Feature Reference - Travel Reiumbursement Claims for Past Appointments

## Overview
This initiative allows Veterans to file a mileage-only beneficiary travel (BT) reimbursement claim for an eligible appointment from their past appointments list on VA.gov. An elibible appointment means any appointment:
- For which the Veteran travelled to a VA facility
- That cccurred before today and up to 30 days in the past    
- Hasnâ€™t had a BT claim already filed for the same day and at the same facility (using the BTSSS Get Claim Status API).
 
## User stories

As a Veteran, I would like to easily submit online a BT claim for a past appointment so that I don't have to use a paper form or figure out how to use the BTSSS portal.

## Requirements

**Functional**
- Veteran logs into VA.gov
- Veteran navigates to past appointments on VA.gov
- Veteran selects a past appointment and navigates to the appointment details for the selected appointment

    - An appointment is eligible for mileage-only travel reimbursement when
        - It occured within the last 30 days

- If the selected appointment is eligible for a mileage-only travel claim, Veteran can choose one of these actions    
    - If no claim has yet been filed for the selected appointment date and facility, Veteran can choose to submit a claim
        - System navigates the Veteran to the new online mileage-only BT claim form 
        - Veteran answers 'Yes' to the following questions
