To perform a screen reader accessibility check on a Mac, you can use the built-in VoiceOver utility. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Enable VoiceOver:**
   - Press `Command` + `F5` to turn VoiceOver on or off.
   - Alternatively, go to `System Preferences` > `Accessibility` > `VoiceOver` and check the "Enable VoiceOver" box.

2. **VoiceOver Basics:**
   - VoiceOver will start reading the screen contents immediately.
   - Use the `Control` + `Option` keys (also known as the VoiceOver keys) along with other keys to navigate.

3. **Navigate Using VoiceOver:**
   - `Control` + `Option` + `Arrow Keys` to move around the screen.
   - `Control` + `Option` + `Space` to activate items (like clicking).
   - `Control` + `Option` + `Shift` + `Arrow Keys` to navigate within text or other elements.

4. **Use the Rotor:**
   - Press `Control` + `Option` + `U` to open the Rotor, a menu that helps you navigate different elements like headings, links, form controls, etc.
   - Use the left and right arrow keys to choose a category and the up and down arrow keys to navigate within that category.

5. **Check Web Accessibility:**
   - Open a web browser and go to the site you want to check.
   - Use VoiceOver to navigate through the page, listening for logical reading order, clear descriptions, and ease of navigation.
   - Check for alternative text on images by navigating to them and listening to the descriptions provided by VoiceOver.
   - Test form elements, buttons, and links to ensure they are announced properly and can be activated using keyboard commands.

6. **Adjust VoiceOver Settings:**
   - You can customize VoiceOver settings by going to `System Preferences` > `Accessibility` > `VoiceOver` > `Open VoiceOver Utility`.
   - Here, you can adjust verbosity, speech rate, and other settings to tailor the screen reader to your needs.

7. **Practice and Familiarize:**
   - Spend some time practicing with VoiceOver to become familiar with its commands and how it interacts with different types of content.
   - This will help you better understand the user experience for those who rely on screen readers.
