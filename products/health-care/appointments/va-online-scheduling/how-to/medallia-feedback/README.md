## Overview

This folder contains the steps for collecting, coding, and sharing Medallia user feedback for Appointment products.
- [Request user feedback from Contact Center](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/how-to/medallia-feedback/step-1-request.md)
- For help, reach out in #vsp-contact-center-support. We may be able to add additional people to the email group—ask in the Slack channel.

All Appointments user feedback is stored in [this SharePoint folder](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FHealthApartment%2FShared%20Documents%2FAppointments%2FUser%20Feedback&viewid=9384f3a8%2De3e8%2D4abb%2Db2ab%2D24cf305ccdac&newTargetListUrl=%2Fsites%2FHealthApartment%2FShared%20Documents&viewpath=%2Fsites%2FHealthApartment%2FShared%20Documents%2FForms%2FAllItems%2Easpx), along with other relevant analyses. Analytics from the Likert scales can be found in these reports or in the [MHV CSAT Dashboard in Domo](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/601491420?userId=917050460).

### Feedback sources

User feedback comes from three sources:
- The blue feedback button at the bottom of each page
- The My HealtheVet intercept survey that pops up only under the `va.gov/my-health` URLs for authenticated users
- The VA.gov intercept survey. In October of 2024 this was replaced with the My HealtheVet intercept survey under `va.gov/my-health`. However, we still collect feedback from this survey when it pops up under the `va.gov/health-care/manage-appointments/` URL, as this is a major entry point into the tool.

**Note:** we used to collect data from the VA Application feedback survey which was linked at the bottom of each page in the Need Help section. The link to this survey was removed in April 2025. Historic data is in the 2025 analysis spreadysheet under the `Mobile App - PowerBI` tab.

### Reports

The appointments team delivers the following user feedback report-outs:
- [Weekly Medallia reports](#weekly-medallia-reports) 
- [Monthly IVC reports](#monthly-ivc-reports) 

We also update data in two sources used for other reporting:
- [Monthly MHV on VA.gov health apps spreadsheet](#monthly-mhv-on-vagov-feedback-spreadsheets) 
- [UX Metrics spreadsheet](#ux-metrics-spreadsheet)
