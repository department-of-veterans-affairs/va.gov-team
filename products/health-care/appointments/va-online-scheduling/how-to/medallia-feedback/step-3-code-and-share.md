## üßê How to Code Feedback

Analyzing feedback involves applying codes for themes, feature requests, and sentiment. We also highlight when a user mentions other health tools.

### Coding themes and feature requests

Each line of feedback may include multiple codes for themes or feature requests.  
Separate each code with a comma.  
**Example:**  
`appt-data-issue, fr-data-providername, fr-data-typeofcare, quote`

- **Themes**: Trends or recurring patterns found in the data
- **Feature requests**: User-identified needs for functionality that does not currently exist

Refer to the **[user feedback spreadsheet](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Appointments/User%20Feedback/2025%20Analysis.xlsx?d=wdaa5b5f611b649a28c4fcbc0bc8ef07a&csf=1&web=1&e=ZOW5q7)(2025)** for definitions of each code.


> [!TIP]
> Use the **URL field** to determine what part of the site the user was interacting with.
> If a comment is unclear, check which page the feedback came from to provide context.
  
### Adding and removing codes

- Only introduce new codes after reviewing at least **one month** of data and observing consistent trends.
- **Do not delete** any codes. At year-end, the team will evaluate which codes to retire when launching a new tracker.

 
### Administrative codes

#### `quote`
Use the `quote` code for feedback worth sharing with the team. These quotes are pulled into the team report.

Include comments that are:
- Specific and actionable
- Reveal the reason behind the feedback
- Show emotion that highlights the urgency or need

#### `other-health-tool`
Use this code when feedback refers to tools outside of the main application.  
Always include a value in the **Other Product/Tool** column.

Examples:
- Secure Messaging  
- Medical Records  
- Medications
 
 
### Examples

| Comment                                                                          | Able to complete task | Code                                     | Sentiment | Other Product/Tool | Explanation |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| To find out what clinic I'm supposed go to on the 19th of May                    |   No                  | appt-data-issue, fr-data-clinicname      | Negative  |                    |  They didn't fill out any likert ratings, but this is negative because they weren't able to complete their task, which was to identify the clinic. They were on the URL for their appointments list, so they were looking for the name of the clinic there. This is a data issue because important data was missing, and a feature request because they noted the data they wanted on the page          |
| my medications were stopped without warning, i still had refills.....            |  No                    |  unrelated, other-health-tool            | Negative  | Medications       |  This is unrelated to the tools because it's a staff process issue. However, because it mentioned medications, we note it for the Medications team so they can review. Along with the comment being about a generally bad situation, all the likert values were low, so the sentiment is negative         |


### Sentiment Codes

Each feedback item should be coded with **only one** sentiment value:

- **Positive**: The tool/feature meets the user‚Äôs needs
- **Negative**: The tool/feature does *not* meet the user‚Äôs needs
- **Mixed**: Comment contains both positive and negative aspects
- **Neutral**: No indication whether needs were met

#### When Sentiment is Unclear
Use these fields for guidance:

- **‚ÄúWere you able to do your task today?‚Äù**  
  - A ‚ÄúNo‚Äù response with a simple task description (e.g., ‚Äúcancel an appointment‚Äù) likely indicates **Negative** sentiment.
- **‚ÄúWhat is your overall satisfaction with this site?‚Äù**  
  - A Neutral or Negative comment with a **Likert rating of 3 or lower** should be marked **Negative**.
- **‚ÄúPlease rate your experience with this site today‚Äù** (MHV surveys only)

If sentiment is still unclear and no helpful ratings are available, leave the field **blank**.


## How to report/share out feedback

### Weekly Medallia reports

Every week we analyze feedback from the previous week and report to OCTO and the delivery team. These reports are generated from Medallia feedback - [here's how to request and code that feedback](#how-to-request-and-process-medallia-feedback).

#### How to collect data for the report

- Filter the Medallia sheet by the date range you're analyzing
- Add a second filter on the codes column for any cell that contains `quote`.
- Copy the quotes into the [Select Quotes sheet](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Appointments/User%20Feedback/2025%20Analysis%20-%20Select%20Quotes.docx?d=w2738630d47d64de68e05cef933b39cea&csf=1&web=1&e=mHnZM7) (2025 example)

#### How to organize the report

- Group the quotes into common themes. Codes can be helpful, but can also be combined here
    - For example, if a lot of comments around canceling and rescheduling, merging those can be helpful to illustrate that they're part of the same workflow - often when a user cancels an appointment, they want to reschedule it
    - If a comment spans categories, include it in the most relevant category
        - Unless each comment is truly separate, like a bulletted list of issues, each of which is a worthy quote. In that case, include in multiple categories.
- Important quotes go to the top.
    - Note any big changes in feedback - and, if possible, why (like if a new feature was released)
    - Note anything that sounds like a bug that needs to be addressed. 
  
#### How to share out the report

- Share links to both the updated spreadsheet and Select Quotes document in the `#appointments-fe-meetup` channel. Note the dates of the updated date, and ping Kay, Kristen, and Robyn Singleton.
   - If you think you identified a bug, ping the PM and Dev Lead. 
- Add the links to the Medallia ticket and close it.


### Monthly IVC reports 

Every month we report on the previous month's Medallia activity in an overall report to IVC.

1. Add a section for the previous month to the Medallia slide deck. Update the dates and copy in the relevant charts. 
2. When the IVC demo deck for that month is done, copy the Medallia slides into that deck. [IVC Monthly Demo Slide Decks](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=mPX7ia&CID=1a315a7a%2D9b50%2D4fd3%2Dbf47%2D79b746fd6e64&FolderCTID=0x012000E6CB91B251F8F14F832E520FAF90885D&id=%2Fsites%2FHealthApartment%2FShared%20Documents%2FAppointments%2FIVC%20Monthly%20Demo)

### Monthly MHV on VA.gov feedback spreadsheets

The MHV teams use a different process and format for analyzing user feedback. We copy the Medallia (auth) feedback into their monthly sheet, including the sentiment analysis but not the codes. The MHV monthly spreadsheets are in [this Sharepoint folder](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?newTargetListUrl=%2Fsites%2FHealthApartment%2FShared%20Documents&viewpath=%2Fsites%2FHealthApartment%2FShared%20Documents%2FForms%2FAllItems%2Easpx&id=%2Fsites%2FHealthApartment%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FMonitoring%2C%20Reporting%2C%20and%20Feedback%2FMedallia%20feedback&viewid=9384f3a8%2De3e8%2D4abb%2Db2ab%2D24cf305ccdac)

Process 
- Copy the feedback into the relevant sheet for the month, following the provided format.
- Include data for "sentiment" 
- Include data under "other health tool"
- Don't add the universal codes, or the codes we've added to the report.
