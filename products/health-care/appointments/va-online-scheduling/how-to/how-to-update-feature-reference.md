# How to update the Appointments FE feature reference docs

## What goes into the feature reference?

[The appointments feature reference](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/feature-reference) captures user stories, functional requirements, user flows, and anything else that describes the functionality of features in VAOS.

See the [template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/feature-reference/template-new-vaos-feature.md) to determine what goes into the different sections of each page.

## What doesn't go into the feature reference?

- Works in progress, ideas for future features, and anything else that hasn't made its way into staging.
- Detailed design specs and page content are documented elsewhere.
- [WIP] Some backend documentation is captured in the feature docs, but we're still sorting out what level of detail the Appointments FE team needs.

## Who can update the feature reference?

Anyone on the Appointments FE team. If you want to update them, but aren't sure if you should, reach out in the team Slack channel.

## When are docs in the feature reference updated?

There's currently no process for updating these on a consistent, regular basis. 

## How do I update the documents when existing features are updated?

Find the page for the feature and update as needed. 

## How do I add a feature?

If the feature doesn't exist yet, make a copy of the [template]((https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/feature-reference/template-new-vaos-feature.md)) in the appropriate folder and fill out the sections.
