# How to validate dev tickets

When devs have completed front end tickets, product and the UX team works together to test the work.

## Product

1. Add ticket to UX team board:
  - Add label `appointments-fe-ux`
  - Add to "Ready" pipeline
  - Mark as high priority 
2. Notify the UX team.

## UX Team
Anyone on the UX team can validate dev tickets

1. Assign the ticket to yourself and move it to the top of the "In Progress" queue.
2. Read through the ticket and all comments
3. Test that all AC are met.
4. Test against the [Accessibility testing checklist](accessibility-testing-checklist.md)
5. Add comments with any issues found and notify the dev

Once all issues are resolved:

1. Add a comment to Product and Dev saying that the review is complete.
2. Remove the `appointments-fe-ux` label. This will automatically remove from the ux board.
