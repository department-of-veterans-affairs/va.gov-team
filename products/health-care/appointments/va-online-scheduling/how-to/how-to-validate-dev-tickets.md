# How to validate dev tickets

When devs have completed front end tickets, product and the UX team works together to test the work.

## Product

1. Add ticket to UX team board:
  - Add to [UAE UX GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1214/views/11)
  - Set status to "Ready for UX QA"
2. Notify the UX team.

## UX Team
Anyone on the UX team can validate dev tickets

1. Assign the ticket to yourself
2. Read through the ticket and all comments
3. Test that all AC are met. Ask dev questions/meet with dev as needed
4. Test against the [Accessibility testing checklist](accessibility-testing-checklist.md)
5. Add comments with any issues found and notify the dev

Once all issues are resolved:

1. Add a comment to Product and Dev saying that the review is complete.
2. Change status to "Done" - do not click the Close button on the ticket. Devs will close dev tickets after they've been validated.
