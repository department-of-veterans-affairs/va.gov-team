# **How to Request Medallia Feedback**

1. Using the template below, submit a ticket in GitHub to Contact Center to collect the Medallia feedback. The feedback should be emailed to a VA.gov email address since it may contain PHI/PII information. 
2. Open the Excel file they send back on the network and scrub PII
3. Look for names, SSNs, other identifying numbers, and replace with asterisks or number symbols
4. Once the file is scrubbed, move a copy to the Teams folder on the network
5. Share the file with the leads using their VA.gov email addresses - Simi, Jeff, Leah, Kay, Peter, Melissa, Ciera
