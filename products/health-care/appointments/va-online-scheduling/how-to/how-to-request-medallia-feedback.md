**VA Email Address(es)**

[Your VA email address]

Note: Contact Center will email you the feedback to the VA email address you provide. See "How to process feedback" for next steps.

## How to pull "VA Mobile App" feedback

Note that this isn't feedback from the VA mobile app. It just comes from a form with that name.

1. Access [this Power BI report](https://app.powerbigov.us/groups/me/reports/aca54410-27d4-41a5-a376-bcd67c1c4e70/ReportSection8279b935900d2a4a0166?ctid=e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf) (Process for gaining access tba)

2. Open the Reviews tab

3. Under App Selection, choose `VA Online Scheduling` and `VA Online Scheduling Redesign`

4. Choose the timeframe you're analyzing.

5. All other fields can be "All"

6. Click the sneaky More Options button, then Export Data

7. Select Data with current layout

8. Download to your computer.

See "How to process feedback" for next steps.

## How to Process Feedback

This process is the same for Medallia and VA Mobile Form Feedback.

2. Download the spreadsheet to your machine on the VA network. 

3. Scrub the feedback of PII/PHI. Read through every user comment and replace personal information with codes as follows:
- Email addresses - PII_EMAIL
- Names - PII_NAME
- Social security numbers - PII_SSN
- Phone numbers - PII_PHONE
- Other identifying info - PII_OTHER

4. Copy the feedback into the appropriate tab of the current user feedback file.

5. Check that the headings are correct across the entire sheet. The order the data points are received in does change.

6. Sort the sheet by "URL". Move any feedback under the `https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/` URL to the Appts Benefits Hub tab.

7. Delete the original file from your computer.


## How to Analyze Feedback

**Add codes**

Codes for themes and feature requests are in the [user feedback spreadsheet](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Appointments/User%20Feedback/2025%20Analysis.xlsx?d=wdaa5b5f611b649a28c4fcbc0bc8ef07a&csf=1&web=1&e=ZOW5q7) (2025). Look in the tabs with those names. 


Codes for sentiment are:
* Positive
* Negative
* Mixed
* Neutral

Add the `quote` code to any piece of feedback that you want to share with the team.

## How to report/share out feedback

### Weekly reports

- Filter each sheet by the date range you're analyzing
- Add a second filter on the codes column for any cell that contains `quote`.
- Copy the quotes into the [Select Quotes sheet](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Appointments/User%20Feedback/2025%20Analysis%20-%20Select%20Quotes.docx?d=w2738630d47d64de68e05cef933b39cea&csf=1&web=1&e=mHnZM7) (2025 example)
- Share links to both the updated spreadsheet and Select Quotes document in the `#appointments-fe-meetup channel`. Note the dates of the updated date, and ping Kay, Kristen, and Robyn Singleton. 
- Add the links to the Medallia ticket and close it.

### Monthly IVC reports 

Add a section for the previous month to the [2025 monthly feedback deck](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/HealthApartment/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B1DFC1162-BA23-4198-B25E-FEEA23033455%7D&file=Medallia%20Feedback%202025.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true). Update the dates and copy in the relevant charts.

### Monthly MHV on VA.gov feedback spreadsheets

The MHV teams use a different process and format for analyzing user feedback. The monthly spreadsheets are in this folder: [MHV on VA.gov](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?newTargetListUrl=%2Fsites%2FHealthApartment%2FShared%20Documents&viewpath=%2Fsites%2FHealthApartment%2FShared%20Documents%2FForms%2FAllItems%2Easpx&id=%2Fsites%2FHealthApartment%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FMonitoring%2C%20Reporting%2C%20and%20Feedback%2FMedallia%20feedback&viewid=9384f3a8%2De3e8%2D4abb%2Db2ab%2D24cf305ccdac)

Copy the data into that sheet, following the provided format.

You do not need to add the universal codes. Just sentiment and other health tool.
