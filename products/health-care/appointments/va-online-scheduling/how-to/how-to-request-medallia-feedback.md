## How to Collect and Process Feedback

1. Contact Center will email the feedback to the address you provided.

2. Download the spreadsheet to your machine on the VA network. 

3. Rename the spreadsheet in the following format:
`VAOS Medallia [YYYY] Q[#] Week[##]` 
For example: VAOS Medallia 2023 Q4 Week 44

This naming convention lets us sort all the feedback files by date.

4. Scrub the feedback of PII/PHI. Read through every user comment and replace personal information with asterisks or number symbols.
   
Replace them with codes as follows
- Email addresses - PII_EMAIL
- Names - PII_NAME
- Social security numbers - PII_SSN
- Phone numbers - PII_PHONE
- Other identifying info - PII_OTHER

5. As you review, note any issues that may be new or indicate that something is broken. You'll email this information to the team in the last step.

6. Upload the scrubbed file to the [Teams user feedback folder](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FHealthApartment%2FShared%20Documents%2FAppointments%2FUser%20Feedback&viewid=9384f3a8%2De3e8%2D4abb%2Db2ab%2D24cf305ccdac). Check that it is named so that it can be sorted by date.

7. Share the file, including your notes of any potential issues that raise concern to  Simi, Jeff, Leah, Kay, Peter, Melissa, Ciera (using their VA email addresses).

8. If any issues that seem urgent show up, note them for the team in the #appointments-fe-meetup channel.
