## Rules of engagement
- Camera on - let's be a real audience for our presenters.
- Be present and ask questions if you have any. Safe space!
- If you're a presenter, have a visual. If you're not demoing an interaction or data exchange, screenshots or graphs are great too!
  - If you're reviewing a bug, explain the issue and how you found the fix. Include any additional learnings or related info that could be useful for knowledge-sharing.
