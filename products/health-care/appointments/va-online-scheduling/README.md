# VA Online Scheduling
VA online scheduling (VAOS) is a Veteran-facing healthcare appointment scheduling tool on VA.gov.

## About the Product

### Vision
Deliver a seamless and positive experience for any Veteran who wants to schedule an appointment online.

### User Problem Statement
A very small percentage of Veteran appointments with VA Medical Centers are scheduled online. Other avenues for scheduling appointments like phone, secure messaging, reminder letters, and return to clinic orders can lead to clerical errors, miscommunications, and a heavier burden for schedulers. These issues cause delays in scheduling care and are frustrating for Veterans.
