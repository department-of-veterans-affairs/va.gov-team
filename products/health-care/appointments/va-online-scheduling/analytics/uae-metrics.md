# UAE Metrics

## What 
- [UAE Metrics refers to an excel spreadsheet in SharePoint](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Appointments/Analytics/UAE%20metrics.xlsx?d=wc95ca18bba4a4913ba210545e72d2cc9&csf=1&web=1&e=40r3WI) that serves as a centralized database for UAE-wide metrics. E.g., AVS, Travel Pay, Appointments, Patient Check In. 

## Who 
- OCTO Health leadership (Robyn S., Kristen M., Kay L.) are accountable for its use and sharing upwards to the CTO
- Various UAE team members are responsible for adding the data on the **7th of each month** to the spreadsheet and ensuring the data points remain accessible, reliable, and accurate
- Various UAE team members are responsible for keeping the main PoC and backup PoC in the spreadsheet for each metric up to date to ensure timeliness of data to OCTO Health leadership

## How

- For Appointments metrics, responsible UAE team members will need accesss to specific DataDog reports ***and*** PII data ([How to request access to VSSC's Appointments scheduling report](/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/analytics/requesting-access-to-vssc-vaos-report.md)) (*Note: Requesting requires VA Network accces.*)
- Open [VAOS OKRs 2025 - GA4 (Source)](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/qXJSaTU9eOQ) (which is a temp location)
- Find and fill out the metrics on the **7th of each month** based on instructions and links in the Source column, if provided, of both tabs in the [UAE Metrics spreadsheet](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Appointments/Analytics/UAE%20metrics.xlsx?d=wc95ca18bba4a4913ba210545e72d2cc9&csf=1&web=1&e=40r3WI) (*Note: requires VA Network accces.*)
- When completed filling out the numbers at EOD on the 7th, reply in the Slack reminder thread that your metrics have been completed. 

## Slack reminders

- There's a reminder in #unified-appointment-experience in Slack at 9 a.m. ET on the 2nd of every month that the 7th of the month is approaching, which is when metrics are due and should be pulled on (because there's a lag in some data reporting)
- There's a second reminder in #unified-appointment-experience in Slack at 9 a.m. ET on the 7th of every month letting UAE team members know that metrics are due to be populated in the spreadsheet before EOD
