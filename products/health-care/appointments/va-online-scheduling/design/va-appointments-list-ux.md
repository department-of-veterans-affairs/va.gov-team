# VA appointments list UX [WIP]

The VAOS appointments list displays a summary of a Veteran's upcoming, past, and pending appointments.

## Confirmed appointments

Confirmed appointments are created when a Veteran direct-schedules an appointment through VAOS, or when a scheduler at a facility creates the appointment it in one of a few systems.

The VAOS appointments list answers these questions:

* When is my appointment?
* What's it for?
* Who's it with?
* How will I be attending it?

A Veteran can complete some tasks on these appointments

* Print my list, or individual appointments
* Add an appointment to my calendar
* Cancel my appointment

Confirmed appointments may be canceled, or occur in the past.

### Appointment modalities (how a Veteran attends an appointment)

Veterans most often attend confirmed appointments in person, but also have many telehealth options, and may attend over the phone. These are called out in the UI.

## Pending appointments

A pending appointment is created when a Veteran requests an appointment through VAOS - [more details can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/engineering/vaos_business_rules.md). Once requested, these show on the pending appointments list in VAOS. This list answers these Veteran questions:

* What appointments have I requested that haven't been confirmed?
* What kind of care did I request?
* Who did I request it from?
* Are any of my requests canceled, and if so, by whom?

The pending appointments list shows appointments that have been pending for 120 days. After that, these drop off the list, whether or not they've been resolved by the facility. Canceled pending appointments drop off this list after 30 days. 

A Veteran may cancel any pending appointment.

Veterans can access the check-in experience on the day of their appointments via their mobile phone. It shows a summary of their upcoming appointments for that day.
