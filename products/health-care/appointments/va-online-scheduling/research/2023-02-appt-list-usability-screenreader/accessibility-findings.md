# Accessibility Tools Utilized
`VoiceOver, iOS` `JAWs` `Talkback`

## Coverage

**Original study request:**

> (Primary) 12 participants that regularly use a screenreader

> (Secondary) A mix of advanced and beginner screenreader users.

- This research fulfilled 75% (9/12) of its original request. 
- Only 4 out of 12 participants were able to complete the session with their screen reader.
  - 2 advanced JAWS users
  - 1 begineer JAWS user
  - 1 advanced VoiceOver user

Given the limited amount of types of screen readers, any conclusive behavioral patterns cannot be determined locally in this study. 
We can, however, draw inferences, plan for future research considerations, and document caught accessibility issues.
