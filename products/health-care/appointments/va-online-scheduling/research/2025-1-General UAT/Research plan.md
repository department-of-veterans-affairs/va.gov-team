# Research Plan for General UAT, Appointments team, 01/2025 


Background
----------

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

The appointments team has redesigned appointment details pages for all appointment types. This includes Upcoming, past, canceled and requests.  

Also see [Product's initiative brief.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/appointment-details-redesign/appointment-details-redesign-initiative-brief.md)


### OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

* Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase ðŸ“ˆ

* Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

Decrease ðŸ“‰


* Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

* MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

* MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
* MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

* Maintaining my emotional health
* Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring


* MTM: Taking care of my health
* MTM: Managing my declining health
  
## Research Goals	
1. Evaluate how effectively Veterans navigate the appointments tool.
2. Validate the usability of actions and tasks in the appointments tool.
3. Evaluate how Veterans understand the information provided to them.

### Outcome
This research will provide insights into how effectively Veterans can navigate the appointments tool, complete key tasks, and understand the information presented to them. These findings will inform design refinements, ensuring the tool is accessible, intuitive, and meets user expectations. The learnings will be used to prioritize improvements, validate design decisions, and guide the development of a more user-centered, efficient, and inclusive experience for Veterans.

### Research questions

**Navigation - Evaluate how effectively Veterans navigate the appointments tool**
1.  How effectively can users, including those with screen readers (or voice control?), navigate through the app to locate and review appointment lists?
2. Can Veterans navigate to and from sections, such as the AVS or other tools using the secondary navigation or back links?
3. Does the navigation experience meet their expectations?

**Action/Task - Validate the usability of actions and tasks in the appointments tool**
1. Are Veterans able to complete tasks, such as scheduling appointments and requests, reviewing appointment details, canceling appointments, joining video visits, and adding appointments to their calendar, without confusion or error?
2. Do users experience any challenges when completing these tasks?

**Comprehension - Evaluate how Veterans understand the information provided to them.**
1. Do Veterans understand instructions for preparing for their visit?
2. Do Veterans understand the meaning of "Recent Locations"?
3. Is error messaging clear and helpful, enabling Veterans to recover from issues and proceed with their tasks? Confusing?


### Hypothesis
1. Hypothesis for navigation:
Veterans, including those using assistive technologies, will be able to navigate the app to locate and review their appointment lists efficiently without encountering barriers or confusion. Veterans will find the secondary navigation or back links intuitive and will successfully use them to navigate between sections.
2. Hypothesis for completing tasks:
Veterans will be able to complete key tasks (e.g., scheduling, reviewing, canceling, joining video visits, and adding appointments to their calendar) with minimal confusion or errors.
3. Hypothesis for comprehension:
Veterans will understand instructions for preparing for their visits. Veterans will correctly interpret the meaning of "Recent Locations" as places they have visited or scheduled appointments at.

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.


## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:TBD

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 90 minutes for AT users. 60 minutes for non-AT users. 
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 4
