## Research Goals

Evaluate a scheduling flow for booking an appointment at an Oracle Health facility, including selecting a provider during scheduling.

Test concepts for improving the scheduling flow, including:
- Providing an option to quickly schedule from previous appointments.
- Showing locations where the Veteran has scheduled recently first in the "choose a location" list.
- Better timing for displaying a message that the tool is not intended for urgent care.
- Test a concept for sharing important messages and tasks with Veterans.

Outcome:
This research will provide insights into whether the new features — such as scheduling from recent appointments, sorting by recent locations, and helpful alerts and reminders — make the process faster, easier, and more valuable for Veterans.

After this research is complete, we will:
- Improve the user experience for Oracle Health scheduling based on feedback.
- Choose which scheduling improvements are most valuable for the dev team to implement.
- Provide teams working on appointment notifications with the results of the study that show how Veterans responded to the notification workflow.

## Research Questions

**Oracle Health scheduling:**
1. What information do Veterans want when deciding between providers?
2. Is it clear that these are providers they've seen before?
3. What are their expectations around requesting an appointment with a different provider?

**Immediate care alerts:**
1. Is it clear to Veterans that the tool is not for urgent medical needs?
2. Do Veterans find the warnings about urgent medical needs necessary, helpful, and timely, or frustrating and unnecessary?
3. Is having the "I need immediate care" option helpful?

**Quickly schedule based on previous appointments:**
1. Does scheduling from previous appointments make the scheduling process faster and easier for Veterans?
2. Does scheduling from previous appointments add other value for Veterans?

**Recent locations:**
1. Is it clear that the list is sorted by locations they've visited recently?
2. Does the "Sort by recent locations" feature make scheduling easier for Veterans?
3. Does the "Sort by recent locations" add value?

**Notifications:**
1. Do Veterans notice the notification bell when it becomes active?
2. Are Veterans able to easily navigate to their notifications?
3. For each type of notification, is the content clear or confusing?
4. For each type of notification, is the CTA clear or confusing?
5. What do they expect the next step to be after clicking the CTA?
6. Do they distinguish between tasks that need their attention vs. their activity?

## Methodology 

For this usability study, we will use the moderated usability testing method. This approach involves live, one-on-one sessions through Zoom where a facilitator guides participants through a series of tasks using a prototype of the scheduling flow. The facilitator will observe participants' interactions, collect their feedback, and probe for deeper insights into their experiences.

**Location:** Zoom

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**Hypothesis 1:** As a Veteran, I can choose my provider when scheduling at an OH facility.
- Veterans will want to choose a specific provider for most types of care.
- Do their needs change between primary care and specialty care?
- Do their needs change between established care and new care?
- Veterans will want to choose a provider based on who has the soonest availability.

**Hypothesis 2:** As a Veteran, I can easily schedule at locations I've recently attended.
- Choosing from locations where they've recently scheduled an appointment will make it faster and easier to schedule.
- Veterans will appreciate and find value in the default "Sort by Recent Locations."

**Hypothesis 3:** As a Veteran, I can quickly schedule from previous appointments.
- Veterans will want a shortcut to schedule appointments similar to those they've had in the past.
- Veterans will have a distinct preference for scheduling using the past provider or clinic flow compared to the "type of care" route.
- Scheduling appointments similar to those they've had in the past will help Veterans schedule more quickly.

**Hypothesis 4:** As a Veteran, I need helpful reminders that the scheduling tool is not for emergencies in appropriate places in the process so that it is not an annoyance.
- Veterans will find these warnings necessary.
- Veterans will find these warnings helpful.
- Veterans will find that the alert is timely and appropriate.

**Hypothesis 5:** As a Veteran, I want to be alerted when appointment events happen so I know exactly what I need to do next.
- Veterans will be able to find their notifications without prompting.
- Veterans will understand how to review their notifications.
- Veterans will find their notifications helpful.
