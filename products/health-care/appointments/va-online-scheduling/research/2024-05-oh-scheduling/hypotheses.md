# Hypotheses and Tasks to test

We'll use these when developing the research plan. Our main goal is to test the OH integration. 


## As a Veteran, I can easily schedule at locations I've recently attended.

### Scenario to test

A Veteran chooses from a list of their recent locations when scheduling an appointment.

### Hypotheses

- Choosing from locations where they've recently scheduled an appointment will make it faster and easier to schedule.
– The Veterans will appreciate and find value in the default "Sort by Recent locations"

## As scheduling staff, I know what date a Veteran preferred to schedule their appointment

### Scenario to test

A Veteran chooses their preferred date from an improved date picker.

### Hypothesis

Veterans will be able to select a preferred date faster and more easily than in the current flow.

## As a Veteran, I can quickly schedule from previous appointments

### Scenario to test

When scheduling, a Veteran is offered the option skip directly to choosing a time by scheduling into previously attended appointments.

### Hypotheses

– Veterans will want a shortcut to schedule appointments similar to those they've had in the past. 
- Veterans will have a distinct preference to scheduling using the past provider or clinic flow compared to the "type of care" route.
- Scheduling appointments similar to those they've had in the past will help Veterans schedule more quickly. 

## As a Veteran, I need helpful reminders that the scheduling tool is not for emergencies in appropriate places in the process so that it is not an annoyance. 

### Scenarios to test

A Veteran encounters the urgent medical need warning: 
- When they use the sheduling tool for the first time
- When the reason for appointment includes sever or alarming signs and symptoms
- When they select " I need immediate care" as the type of care they need


### Hypotheses

- Veterans will find these warnings necessary
- Veterans will find these warnings helpful
- Veterans will find that the alert is timely and appropriate

## As a Veteran, I want to be alerted when appointments events happen so I know exactly what I need to do next

### Scenario to test

- A Veteran receives a new notification

- A Veteran reviews their list of notifications including:
    - They have received a new referral for community care
    - Staff has canceled their appointment
    - Others TBD

### Hypothesis

- Veterans will be able to find their notifications without prompting
- Veterans will understand how to review their notifications
- Veterans will find their notifications helpful


### As a Veteran, I can choose my provider when scheduling at an OH facility

#### Hypotheses 

Veterans will want to choose a specific provider for most types of care.
- Do their needs change between Primary care and specialty?
- Do their needs change between established care and new care?

Veterans will want to choose a provider by whoever has the soonest availability.
