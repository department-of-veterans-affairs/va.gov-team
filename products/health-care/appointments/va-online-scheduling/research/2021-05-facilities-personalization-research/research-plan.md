Facilities personalization research plan
=========================================

Goals
-----

Our overall goal is to improve completion of the VA facility selection step. We believe that Veterans see facilities where they currently receive care will be able to complete this step faster and more often than Veterans who do not.

Our research goals are:

-   Discover Veteran needs around facility selection when scheduling that will help us personalize this experience

-   Better understand how Veterans think and talk about facilities so we can use similar language and models.

-   Learn what Veterans know about the registration process.

### What product & team are you doing this research for?

This research is a collaboration between two products/teams:

-   Profile "My VA health facilities", Authenticated Experience

-   Facilities page, VA Online Scheduling

### Background

The VAOS (online scheduling) tool allows Veterans to make an appointment at all of the facilities at which they're registered, but Veterans are frustrated because being registered at a facility doesn't mean they are currently receiving care there. Veterans are still considered registered at facilities where they used to receive --- but no longer receive --- care, and at some facilities for reasons other than having ever been a patient. Therefore, Veterans see facilities in VAOS that they don't go to, and they do not understand why they are being asked to make appointments at facilities they don't go to. This has resulted in a considerable amount of complaints.

The Authenticated Experience MVP will add functionality to VA.gov profile to allow Veterans to set their facility preferences, which will in turn inform the list of options Veterans see when they use VAOS to schedule an appointment online. User goals, business goals, and assumptions are listed in the [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/preferred-facility/README.md)

The VAOS concept will present participants with the ability to save facilities where they regularly receive care, so they can quickly select those facilities when they schedule health care appointments.

### Our approach

We'll run an interview + concept test to get feedback from Veterans. 

Our goal for the interview is to learn how participants think about their facilities, and those they've been to in the past.

Our goal for the concept test is to get a better understanding of their mental model of their facilities, and test the usability and potential value of two workflows:

-   [Opt out of facilities in Profile](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/console/share/BX2JRZTUR2/621669675) - participants will review a list of facilities in the profile and be asked to remove facilities that they no longer go to.

-   [Opt in to facilities from VAOS](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/console/share/B72LX6SPTP/633532185) - participants will save a facility they select while scheduling.

We'll test each flow with half of our participants. All participants will be asked the same interview questions, and both flows will test:

-   A situation where the participant has set their facility preferences but we can't display the facility they selected

-   Navigation between the Profile and VAOS

-   Editing the list of facilities

This mix of generative and evaluative will help us:

-   Better understand Veterans needs and language around scheduling at facilities they prefer.

-   Make decisions about our approach to interactions that will support the experience plan that comes out of this research.

Hypotheses
----------

We believe that Veterans will understand that "saving" a facility in VAOS means they will be able to choose that facility more easily the next time they schedule.

We believe that Veterans will find value in being able to manually control which facilities they currently go to.

We believe that Veterans will find value in seeing which facilities they recently visited.

We believe that the language "My VA health facilities" will align with how veterans think about their facilities.

We believe Veterans will understand how to edit their list of facilities.

We believe that Veterans will understand why all of their facilities are selected.

We believe that Veterans who view the facilities list will understand what the facilities in the list represent:

-   If presented the context of VAOS

-   If they find the list organically

Research questions
------------------

-   How do Veterans think about facilities where they currently receive care? 

-   Compared to those where they are registered?

-   How often do Veterans go to different facilities for the same type of care?

-   Different types of care?

-   Are Veterans able to easily navigate the profile now that the menu doesn't stick to the top of the page?

-   Do Veterans understand why the facilities in their list are there?

-   Do they understand the impact of editing the list?

-   Do they understand the "My VA facilities" section outside of the VAOS context?

-   Is the information about each facility in the list sufficient?

-   Do Veterans understand how the facilities are sorted?

-   Does a Veteran see value in the ability to change the facilities where they currently receive care?

-   How might a Veteran expect to use facility information outside of scheduling?

-   Do Veterans expect to be able to change their current VA facilities while they're scheduling an appointment?

-   Will Veterans connect "Your VA health facilities" in VAOS with the same list in Profile?

-   Will Veterans understand why the facilities they select aren't showing and they have to call?

-   Would it be a better experience to surface facilities that don't offer online scheduling earlier in the flow?

-   What types of appointments do Veterans expect to be able to make if they click "schedule an appointment online"?

-   Do people encounter any usability problems or confusion when going from VAOS to profile?

-   If a person marks a facility as "saved" in VAOS, and then visits their profile, do they understand why their facility list has a facility marked as current and others are hidden?

-   If a Veteran leaves VAOS to update their profile, what expectations do they have for going back to schedule their appointment?

Participants
------------

We would like 10-12 total participants for this study. We will split these into two cohorts, where half of the participants will be shown a different workflow.

### Primary criteria

-   Veteran is actively receiving health care from the VA (i.e. has had an appointment with a PACT within the past year).

### Secondary criteria

-   Veteran has received VA health care from VA facilities in different states
    -   Screener question: Have you received VA health care from facilities in different states?
-   Veteran has used VA health care for 5+ years.

-   Follow the guidelines for inclusive recruiting:
    -   At least 1 woman
    -   At least 1 person of color
    -   At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
    -   At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
    -   At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
    -   At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
    -   At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
    -   At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
    -   At least one participant that has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.
-   If possible:
    -   Include at least one non-native English speaker 
    -   Include at least one person who uses assistive technology (AT), if your study can accommodate them; specialized keyboards, switches, and hearing aids are examples of AT that may be generally included

When?

We plan to start this research on Wednesday, May 26th. The prototype will be ready to test at some point on the week of the 24th.
