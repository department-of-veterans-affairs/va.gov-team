# VAOS/Profile Health Facilities Topline Summary

Prepared by: Liz Lantz (Authenticated Experience) and Peter Russo (VAOS)

[Research plan]() 

[Conversation guide]() 

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

The goal of this document is:

* To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Perceived Findings

### **Participants felt the majority of scheduling flow was intuitive and easy to use, and easily understood how to edit the list of facilities in their profile.**

* There were no major usability hurdles encountered consistently across our sessions.
* People understood the steps necessary to schedule a new appointment from the VA.gov homepage, and from the VAOS confirmation page.
* A couple participants didn't like having to select I need a different facility multiple times (addressed below).
* People understood how to edit their facility list in their profile.
* A couple participants commented the profile page had too much content (will dig into this and create a separate finding if data supports that)

### **The participant mental model around their facilities is focused on where they're currently receiving primary care. For the most part, they no longer associate themselves with facilities they have been to in the past.**

* Many participants talked about all health care starting w/ the PCP, and then going to other facilities via referral from their PCP. Referrals were common for speciality services, or if appointments were available sooner in another facility.
* The most common reason participants went to a facility other than where their PCP practiced is because they needed speciality care such as a CPAP clinic or acupuncture.
* Participants did not think it was relevant to see information about old facilities where they had registered in the past. They surmised it may be useful if they were traveling back to that area for some reason, but no one had an immediate reason they would need to see this information.
* Having access to old facilities in MHV caused one participant to erroneously send secure messages to the wrong provider - they confused the acronym PA with PR.
* Some participants expected that all VA clinics should be able to easily access their VA medical information, no matter their registration status or where they've received care in the past.

### **Geographic location is a primary factor for participants in scheduling and having access to health care.**

* During interviews at the beginning of the session, Veterans proximity to their home was a primary factor in choosing a health care facility.
* Moving was the only reason participants gave for changing their primary VA health facility.
* Participants expected to be able to edit their facility list by geographic factors other than home address; multiple participants talked about finding facilities based on their current location in VAOS and in their profile facility list. They felt this would be useful for travel.

### **Participants did not clearly understand that their facility list in their profile was based on where they were registered.**

* Many of the participants assumed the facilities were in their list because of proximity to their home address. When asked to describe the facilities they'd expect to see if it was based on their own information, they listed facilities near their home that they had never visited. This assumption also contributed to some people not understanding that the facility list was sorted alphabetically.
* A few understood the Seattle facility was in the list because the Veteran had previously lived there - but didn't think it made sense to see it today.
* When prompted to talk about their own facilities, no one expected they would see old facilities they had visited in the past.
* Most participants feel they can receive care at any VA regardless of where they have been in the past, and understand a brief registration process (scanning their VA ID card) will be required.

### Most participants saw value in being able to save facilities to limit their options in scheduling, sending secure messages, and for travel purposes.

* Some participants made positive comments about being able to do this while in the scheduling flow - need to revisit the notes.
* Some participants expected their facility choices to be reflected in their secure messaging options
* At least two participants mentioned they'd use this list to save facilities prior to travel to have them handy.
* One participant said they would absolutely not use this - talked about it being ridiculous to put the burden on the Veteran to keep track of this. (P9)

### The connection between the facility options in VAOS and the facility list in profile was clear to most participants.

* Most participants easily understood the relationship between the two lists.

  > "It gives me the updated list, I don't see the Seattle one anymore which I edited previously." - P2

* Two participants did not seem to aware they had left the scheduling flow when they went to profile.

* It made sense to participants when they saved a facility in VAOS, and then saw that same facility selected (and others deselected) in profile.

### Participants understood they needed to call to schedule because a facility didn't offer online scheduling, but it didn't make sense to everyone that some VA facilities could schedule online and others could not.

* Most participants understood the facility didn't offer online scheduling.
* At least one participant wanted to see this information sooner in the scheduling process.
* Multiple participants made comments along the lines of "in today's modern world, everyone should just get with the online program" (will find exact quotes)
* At least one participant thought they had to call because the clinic didn't offer the service they were trying to schedule.
* One participant wanted to see this information sooner in the scheduling process; they understood once they saw the information but were mildly annoyed it took that long.
* One participant stated they would've given up after selecting "I need a different facility" the first time; would not have tried it the second time. Instead, they would have tried to go to the clinic as a walk-in for the service. (P9?)

### Most participants did not experience any major usability hurdles navigating between VAOS and their profile.

* In both scenarios, the majority of participants easily found the links in VAOS to get to profile. Only one participant missed the "manage saved facilities" link on the VAOS confirmation page (will confirm this via recordings).
* Most correctly expected to get back to VAOS via the link at the top of the facility page in profile; one participant had a hard time finding this link. (Was this the same participant that missed it in the confirmation screen?)
* At least one participant expected to pick up in VAOS where they left off on the "Choose facility" page, but it did not cause a major frustration.
* A couple participants expected to be able to click the facility name in the Profile to start the scheduling process at that facility.

### All participants struggled to find their list of saved facilities in profile starting from the VA.gov homepage.

* We took participants to the VA.gov home page and asked them to find their list of saved facilities. All participants stated they would go to the appt scheduling link on the homepage to see that list again. 

  * This makes sense since that's where the test started.  

    > "I could see it my profile, but from what I've learned right now, I'd definitely go through there [schedule and manage health care appointments link]" - P2

  * We can't be certain where they might have looked if they hadn't first seen VAOS. P2 stated they would have start on their profile, but

* All participants had to be guided to the personalized menu; once exposed to options

  * Some participants expected to find facilities in My VA
  * Some participants expected to finding facilities in My Health
  * One participant (P10) expected to find their facility list in their profile

### Some participants had trouble navigating via the profile mobile menu.

* One participant did not see it at all.

* 2 participants struggled to find it but eventually did see it (need to confirm this via recordings; may remove this finding if it turns out only 1 person had this problem and only 1 person missed it).

  > "I just didn't notice it there. You know, profile - my brain automatically went to make sure my information is correct." - P2

### In VAOS and profile, participants expected to be able to manage facilities in their list by geographic radius.

* Some participants expected the "home address" dropdown to have an option to select based on a mileage radius from their current location.
* Some participants presumed that the list in their profile was based on a preferred radius (set elsewhere in their profile) based on their home address.

### In the VAOS facility list view, the content/functionality for the How do I remove a facility from my list additional info component didn't align with participant expectations.

* At least 2 participants expected to be able to select a facility via the radio input in the list, then click the accordion, and remove the list within that accordion.
* Another participant expected they would be able to search for a facility from within that accordion.

### Almost all participants shared a negative perception of calling the VA.

* Participants described calling as taking a long time and being inefficient. One participant described lining up multiple activities to do while on hold so they didn't get bored. Another stated:

 >"People die on hold when they call the VA. Not from anything but old age" - P1

* 3 participants stated they prefer to use secure messaging over calling:

  * One participant with hearing loss said it was frustrating to communicate over the phone.
  * One participant (with cognitive issues? Need to check) wanted written confirmation for appointments and conversations so they wouldn't have to worry about remembering things.
  * One participant stated that based on his previous experience, he would rather go be treated in the emergency room than try to call to make an appointment:

  > "If I can't do it on the app, or via secure messaging, I'll just go in as an emergency and have my [needs] attended." - P2
