# Research - a personalized facilities list

The completion rate for the facility selection page is 72% (as of April, 2021). This page shows every facility a Veteran has registered at, and may include many where Veterans donâ€™t currently receive care. We believe that if we surface only the facilities where the Veteran currently receives care, the resulting reduction of noise on the page will help Veterans find a facility more easily, and faster.

This research is a collaboration between VAOS and the Authenticated Experience team.
