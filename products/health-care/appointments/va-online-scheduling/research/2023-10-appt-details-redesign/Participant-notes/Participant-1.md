# Notetaker’s Notes - P1

Notetaker: Peter Russo

Notes: on a desktop/microsoft.

Notetaker’s note: update prototype to use the action link, and include the print button, and include the new breadcrumbs.

### 1: Upcoming In-Person Appointment

You know you have an appointment scheduled with Dr. Ralph Scott and want to know more information about it. How would you do that from here.

> Clicks details on correct appt. Scrolls through. 

I would do what I just did (Laughs).

#### Follow up:

What are your thoughts on this page?

On the current system - when I get notifications on my phone it doesn’t tell me what the appointment is - I have to hit “D” for details. And there are so many appts people have, they’re asking me to confirm and I don’t really know where I’m going without that info.

I can’t remember if it sends me/links me to an appointment. It would be nice if it said it was with “Doctor so-and-so.”

“Add to calendar” I like but I’ve had trouble with that on my Apple phone. It’s fine on my laptop or desktop, but on my phone it’s more difficult. I have to go through 4-5 steps to get it to add.

What other tasks do you notice on this page?

Maybe a reschedule button. The only option is to keep this one or cancel.

Things to watch for:

Can participant find where their appointment will be?

Can participant understand the information on the details page?

### 2: Pre check-in task

If participant cannot find the "Review your personal healthcare contacts"

Down at the bottom of this page, there is a link to "review your personal healthcare contacts" .

#### Follow up:

What do/did you expect when you clicked that link?

I never even noticed that. I don’t know what this would do. Is that who I’ve designated as…I have no idea what that is.

> Facilitator directs them to click

It seems a little odd. Maybe simplify it a little bit - Say “check your emergency contacts”, or “who can we talk to if there’s a problem.” Some people don’t have emergency contacts. If I could have listed my dog I would have. It was a stretch to find someone. Just something to be aware of.

### Things to watch for:

Does participant notice the link?

No.

Is the link percieved as a task?

No, they don’t know what it was.

Can participate find their way back from personal healthcare contacts page?

No, see next task for details.

3: Upcoming closed video appointment

You have a video appointment scheduled with Allison Carter next month. You want more information on the appointment, how would you do that from here?

A video appt? 

> Scans around all menus, page, hovers on VA benefits and health care. Somehow gets to appointments. Lands in pending request for a telehealth appointment.

I’m assuming that’s what I’m supposed to do?

F: Directs to find an appointment next month.

> Clicks correct appointment.

This is one thing I’ve seen before. Calling the facility is a pain in the behind. Getting ahold of someone in scheduling…good luck!

## Follow up:

What are your thoughts on this page?

I’m time conscious. Sometimes the providers are late and sometimes I’ll call them and they say they’re having a problem. And they ask to do a phone call. But I want to see them. I get stressed out if I don’t have the link sooner. I’ve never seen that where they’d add the link 30m before. Two days prior I’d call and say I didn’t get the link yet. Then they get frustrated with me.

(Notetakers Note: what happens today if they click a vid link very early? Like a day or two).

How would you get ready for this appoitment?

Get dressed early, brush my teeth. It’d be nice to put it in the calendar for that day, so I could just open my calendar, click the link, and I’m there. I rely on my personal calendar, not memory.

> Dog barks in the background. Looks at video appointment instructions on how to set up device.

One of the criticisms I have about govt sites - I know you have to give us all this info but it’s SO VERBOSE. For folks with attn span issues, TBI, etc, it’s a lot.

> Looks at prepare your visit section

I don’t believe this is preparing for my visit. This is a video visit. I don’t know. My emergency contact is not going to be on with me for my video visit, so that doesn’t make sense with me.

And the annoying thing about contact the facility... I wish there was a link there like in text messages - like an option to reschedule if I need  to make changes. There’s always gonna be somebody who’ll reschedule a lot and that’ll mess up the providers. But from my POV that’ll be easier. A lot of us show up early. Maybe they could send us a text and say “we have an opening, do you want it?” I love that, it’s nice that I can communicate with my providers  on a personal level. They’re comfortable that I’m not going to SWAT them or something.

#### Things to watch for:

Can participant find information on how to prepare for their appointment?

Yes.

Does participant understand how to join their appointment?

Not entirely.

### 4: Upcoming open video appointmnet

You have another video appointment with cardiology, would you find that appointment?

> Opens “VA appointment” instead of a video appointment

Why do you have directions? It’s a video appointment. I get it, it’s a template. I think “oh shit, am I supposed to be in person? Oh this is in person!! Duh.

> Goes back to appointment list and finds correct appt. Clicks back and forth between the different vid appts.

This one has “Join appointment”. That’s a big thing here. It has add to calendar, but this is in the past so….if this were the day, would this be 30 minutes before I’m going to join? Then why would I add it to the calendar?

This is confusing, what’s the point of adding to my calendar if I’m just going to join the appointment?

Looking at the instructions: When you join the appointment, it gives you a lot of this information already. And as Veterans, you better know this already.

> Reads through whole page

I don’t know what a screenreader is.

Closed captioning might be helpful. Some aren’t auditory learners, they’re visual. So I like that.

> Talks about connecting an external camera instruction

Unless you’re going to show me how to do that, this isn’t very helpful. And especially if you’re just about to join an appointment it’s too late. Maybe if this came a day ahead of time it would be more helpful. 

The print button - if I’m gonna join the appointment I don’t know why I’m gonna print it. Unless I’m keeping paper records. Doing that or “add to calendar would” stress me out way too much.

#### Follow up:

What do you notice about the appointment information?

#### Things to watch for:

Does participant notice the "join appoitnment" link before the other CTA's?

I missed whether she saw that or add to calendar first

### 5: ATLAS

You have a VA appointment scheduled for 2 pm on Wednesday the 14th and want to find out how to get to the appointment. How would you do that from here?

#### Follow up:

What do you notice about the appointment information?

This is a video appt and it’s got the “where to attend” section. I’ll be at home I think, or in my car. and I’ll use the code as provided at the site. Is that if I’m at the library or something? That’s confusing.

F: Explains what an atlas appointment is.

> Reads through all the data points; they’re clear except:

Preparing for your visit, again that throws me off. Audiology though - audiology over video? “Turn up the sound” (laughs) That’s where subtitles might be helpful. I mean it’s okay.

How are you to attend this appointment?

How would you make changes to this appointment?

I’d have to call them. I don’t have any choice, I’d have to call that phone number.

#### Things to watch for:

Does participant understand the missing information?

Does participant understand where to go for this appointment?

Can participant find the "need to make changes" information?

### 6: Phone appointment

You have a phone appointment with Nancy Portman and want to know more info about it, how would you do that?

> Finds appontemtn.

My phone has a blocker on it, and oftentimes if you get a govt or restricted number, it’s blocked. Luckily my providers know me and they’re like “i’m trying to call you from the office but i can’t” I have the blocker so I don’t get annoyed by robocalls.

Again, it’s contact your facility if you need to reschedule. You only have the option to cancel. I guess it’s for their convenience, which I can understand.

#### Follow up:

How do you attend this appointment?

What else can you do from this page?

Things to watch for:

Does participant understand how to attend this appointment?

### 7: Cancelation

You have a phone appointment with Nancy Portman and want to know more info about it, how would you do that?

> Easily cancels appointment. 

Then I have to call them and say “I need to reschedule because” I still need the appointment.

> Notices link to schedule a new appointment 

I didn’t see that before! I’d expect to see that on the other page. This flow makes sense, but it’d be nice to see that on the other peage so you could schedule a new appointment then cancel this appointment.

> Goes through the cancelation again.

Is it possible to have a “reschedule” option? I understand but again we’ve got aged veterans. Some are more computer savvy. I know enough to make myself dangerous. It would be easier than going through all the steps - maybe you could say cancel and reschedule. And if you had another thing that said that it would take you to the reschedule link.

#### Follow up:

If you decided that you no longer wanted this appointment, how would you go about canceling it?

Confirmation your cancelation: What would you expect to see if you hit "Yes, cancel appointment"?

Confirmation your cancelation: What would you expect to see if you hit "No, do not cancel"?

Appointment Canceled: What can you do from here?

#### Things to watch for:

Can particpant find the cancelation button?

Yes.

What does participant expect from canceling an appointment?

An option to reschedule

### 8: After visit summary

You had a podiatry appointment last month and want to review what was discussed in the appointment. Where would you go to find that information?

“Why is this scratched out?” 

> Clicks into canceled podiatry appt.

Oh cause the facility canceled it.

> I missed how she got here, but she clicks immediately into the after-visit summary.

That’s not what I expected. I usually have to go to Blue Button to get the information. Oh and vista imaging when you go outside for Community care you can’t get any of that information. You have to put in a request for that information. But all my stuff is there. Why isn’t all that scanned in so I can access that too. Have to fill out a release of information.

For the veteran to access my own information, it’s different than for the provider. The provider sends it through vista imaging. It’s in my file and I can’t access it.

Where to attend - could you change the tense? That’s confusing. And why do I need directions to somewhere I’ve already been.

Does this print button, print all of the details, or just this page? If it’s a past appointment, why is it printable, unless you’re keeping  a notebook?

#### Follow up: 

Tell me about the experience of finding that information.

Things to watch for:

Can participant easily find their after visit summary?

Oh yeah.

Can participant easily navigate back from their after visit summary??

Missed

#### 9: Appointment request

You made an appointment request and wanted to check on the status. How would you do that from here?

That’s a good question. I don't know where I'd go.

> Asked to look closer, finds Pending.

I don’t know what this [Pending] is. Is it the same as upcoming? Pending means upcoming to me. I’m going to be having them soon. 

F: Did you see the text under the heading?

I didn’t see that! I’m looking at the upcoming, pending, past links.

F: directs to select pending appt

> Reads everything closely. Reviews preferred date and time section:

Am I supposed to pick one of these? It’s not a link. Is telehealth supposed to be a clickable link?

F: Explains requests to participant.

I think I have, but I’ve not seen this. I usually end up having to call. Because they’ll say “you'll need to call your provider.”

It’s podiatry, but there should be two options - how do you prefer to attend only has telehealth. And why are you giving me directions if it’s telehealth? You should be telling me how I should prepare. And the phone number, is that to reschedule? And details you’d like to share, what is that?

And contact details, are those my details?

( Notetaker note, get rid of [] non demo data.)

### Follow up:

Tell me about the experience of finding that information.

Things to watch for:

Can participant find pending appoitments?

No

Does participant understand pending appointments?

No

Does participant understand the information on the details page?

No

10. Empty State

F: look at VA appointment

Do I know what kind of appt it is? It just says va appt? Where am I going, what am I doing?

> Looks at “who, what” sections

In school it was “who what where when” and this is what who - not for nothing (laughs).

> Goes to list

Why wouldn’t it say podiatry or…you know? I’ve had this come up where I’ve had to see where it is. I’ve had a number of appointments where it says “you have a VA appointment” but what is it?

> Goes to details page

It doesn’t say podiatry, with dr so-and-so. I have to go way down here to find out that it’s for foot pain. It’s stressful.

> Did not mention “...not provided” language.

F: Anything else of everything we’ve looked at?

This “upcoming” and “pending” I don’t like that. 

F: What would make more sense?

Hmmm veteran scheduled or client scheduled? Veteran wishlist? I don’t know what word you’d necessarily use - “Pending scheduling approval?” it's more wordy but it says what it is?

#### Post-Task Interview

Of everything you saw today, what was the most confusing, or challenging?

You’re dealing with huge ability ranges in terms of tech. Texting with me is very helpful because then you have a record.

What worked well?

First, I don't’ want to be hypercritical. I’m very thankful to have this system and have the VA as my provider. And the fact that the VA is putting in the time to make this more usable, I appreciate that.

What could we do better? 

The emergency contact thing, when you go into prepare for your visit, that’s major for me.

> Looks at footer menu

Who uses Flickr? Also there should be a big button for the crisis line. Also the twitter thing is a little outdated.

F: Last thoughts?

No, I think that covers it.
