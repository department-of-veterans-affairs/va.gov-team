### 1: Upcoming In-Person Appointment

You know you have an appointment scheduled with Dr. Ralph Scott and want to know more information about it. How would you do that from here.

Go to details it looks like (clicks on details)

> tell me about this

Its pretty straightforward. Tells you who its what what its for with an option to add to cal which is good. You can get directions which is good. You click and probably get a map.

If participant notices pre check-in, have them click "Review your personal healthcare contacts"Go ahead and complete any tasks on this page.If participant cannot find the "Review your personal healthcare contacts"Down at the bottom of this page, there is a link to "review your personal healthcare contacts" .

Cancel if you need to. Looks like you can review your personal healthcare contacts.

> what do you expect to do

Maybe tells you what to bring. Perscriptions, something that the doc needs you to bring.

> Tells to open

Next of kin or emergency contact if theres an emergency. Hopefully there are more records and not jsut this. (Notices option on left)

> is this what you expected?

Eh. Maybe a link within the link. Emergency contacts should already be there.

Thats the one thing. Unless you hit the back button, theres nothing that says how to get back to the appointment page. Id figure it out, but now I have to work for it. If I click the back button, will it actually take me back or will I lose my place?

### 3: Upcoming closed video appointment

You have a video appointment scheduled with Allison Carter next month. You want more information on the appointment, how would you do that from here?

(Clicks back to appts) Of corse I'd want to go back to the appts so ytoud wanna go back in ehre. hopefully itd be in here. Next month.

(clicks details)

ITS TO the point. time, date, what its for, who its with, then it gives you join details. idk how to set up a device but its there.

(not sure if dropdown is live or not)

> You can feel free to check it out.

(clicks drop down) I guess thats it. Its just there.

> You were expecting the link to be in that dropdown.

Yeah you would think so, yes. Not knowing if they email you the day before with the link.

> How would you get ready?

How to set up device. Makes sure everuthgin works and in a quiet area. Usually try to get there a few minutes early. It doesnt mention that. Zoom has updates you need to do before this. Glad I got there early.

> anything else youd like to see?

The link. If you need anything. Instructions on what you need. This is sleep medecine, might need records.

No, id call the clinic if I need to. The other one had a spot to cancel it.

(Searches and finds appt, clicks on details)

That looks better. Looks ike theres a link to join the appt. the other one didnt have that. YOu can addit to your cal if youre weeks ahead. It tells you who and what. Still nothing on there to cancel. So youd have to call to do that.

> what would the link do?

Id hope itd say youre here waiting for the host to join or allpow you it. if you get on there a few min early, youd be in a waiting room. I would hope

### 5: ATLAS

You have a audiology appt scheduled for 2 pm on Wednesday the 14th and want to find out how to get to the appointment. How would you do that from here?

Yep of course you have directions. Looks like you could hit it and open google maps for driving direcitons. People do that now on phones. I use a few apps for transportation. With trucking i use one that has stuff about low clearences.

(looks at how to join) computer code is here but doesnt tell you what site to go to. Where do I go? Zoom That other one had a link. this doesnt.

> So where would you go?

(rereads subtext) reading this, looks like you need to find an atlas location - whatever that is. Thats confusing. If you have an appt to go to there should be a person to do that with.

I hope thats the actual address or place I need to be, because it doesnt really tell me where I am going. Is there a room number, a floor, a building name? Because if its not with the VA hopsoital make sure its properly marked.

You have a phone appointment with Nancy Portman and want to know more info about it, how would you do that?

(Clicks back, opens correct appt., reads everything) Its got what its for, who, tells you the contact infor to reschedule or questions prior to that. Hopefully that phone number is the right number to call.

It says theyll call me. Might be nice to know what number they will be calling from. Esp in the days of telemarketers, dont want the number blocked. Maybe a "phone number will show up as..." There are too many people calling for insurance or whatever.

Reason why you scheduled the appt is here. And I can cancel

(No do not cancel expectation) send me back to appt list. Thats what I would hope

### 8: After visit summary

You had a podiatry appointment last month and want to review what was discussed in the appointment. Where would you go to find that information?

(Looks around at breadcrumb) Usually if its under here a lot of time you have to go into myhealth and go into manage my medical records and go to whatever was covered - blood tests results. I guess you can do past here. Thats a little different.

> go ahead check it out

Finds appt) hopefully if you click on details (clciks details and scans page). You hopefully can see your information here (avs)

> How was it finding htis?

It was okay. Past is so small and hard to find, It was tough to find it even when it was highlighted in blue.

### 9: Appointment request

You made an appointment request and wanted to check on the status. How would you do that from here?

Maybe pending? looks like maybe pending. Pending looks more like whats upcoming. Pending is whats already scheduled, so thats not very helpful.

Instead of pending, should say pending appointment request.

### 10: Empty State

You have a VA Appointment on January 10 at 2:30 and want to know more about the appointment’s details. How would you do that here?

Doesnt tell you what the appt is for. I see when, who is not available, what is not available. Doesnt say why I need to be there for.

> What do you image in happening to [what and who]

Yeah its just whoever is there when you get there will help you. Maybe first available when you show up. If it said "first person available" instead of "not available". Its just sort of vague
