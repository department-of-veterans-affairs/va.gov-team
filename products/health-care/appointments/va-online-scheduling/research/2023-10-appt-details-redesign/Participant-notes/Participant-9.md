## 1: Upcoming In-Person Appointment

You know you have an appointment scheduled with Dr. Ralph Scott and want to know more information about it. How would you do that from here?

Based on what you’re showing me I'd click details and see what dropped down.

> Clicks details for correct appointment

It’s got a lot of stuff on here which if I go for a routine follow-up - I have an eye clinic appt at my regular place in a week… 

> Goes back to list

…most of that info I already know and don’t need. But it tells me generally where it is, date and time, practitioner. It’d be nice if it said what floor it is.

**F:** Prompts to go back to details

Okay, purple bldg room 102. 

**F:** You’d like to see that on the page prior?

I made the appointment, I know what it’s for.

**F:** Prompts back to details page

> Returns to details.

I don’t need directions, you’ve already told me who it is on the front page, I know the address. It doesn’t bother me but I don’t need it. It doesn’t cost anything to put it in. I keep my appt information on the outlook calendar. I download it from wherever I get it and throw it on the calendar.

**F:** Prompts back to details page. Prompts to add to calendar.

Probably just this add to calendar. I’d absolutely use that. Then once it got into the calendar I’d modify it to remove what I don’t need. I’d have the date and time, the floor and room number and that would be it. That’s all I need.

**F:** Prompts to look at the bottom of the page

For an optometry appt I can't think of any of those that would be relevant. For some others maybe, but not here. Prepare for my visit, I don’t need that. Details I shared with my provider… 

**F:** Prompts to personal health care link

In order to prepare for an optometry visit, you only need to remember to bring your eyes and glasses. Other than that, I don't need to prepare.

**F:** Asks about other appointment types

What I would do with respect to the PCP is probably type up a Google Keep memo. I wouldn’t put it here because that’d mean I have to get into the system while I’m at the docs office, and the type of clinic I usually go to doesn’t have wifi or signal. So having it on this thing where I either have to use cell data - which I could do - or just make a little note to myself which I keep on the phone and I’m bringing up the notes while I’m sitting there, that doesn’t use anything. I have my shopping list in my Keep notes, but I wouldn't use it here.

**Follow up:**

- What are your thoughts on this page?
- What other tasks do you notice on this page?

**Things to watch for:**

- Can the participant find where their appointment will be?
- Can the participant understand the information on the details page?

## 2: Pre check-in task

If participant notices pre check-in, have them click "Review your personal healthcare contacts"

Go ahead and complete any tasks on this page.

If participant cannot find the "Review your personal healthcare contacts"

Down at the bottom of this page, there is a link to "review your personal healthcare contacts" .

This has nothing to do with that appointment. It just has a bunch of general stuff that you already know. Odds are my eye doctor isn’t gonna have to call those people. It’s got nothing specifically to do with the appointment that led to this. This is fairly generic and most of it isn’t going to change that often. If it’s wrong, I'd change it. I have no idea how, I'd have to figure it out. It doesn’t seem to offer me the option to click on change. I’d go back to the MHV home page and figure it out.

Nothing jumps off the page. None of these things are underlined indicated they are linking to anything. I wouldn’t even expect there’s a hidden link.

If we look under profile…none of that’s linked up. But if this was the real world and I had to make a change to this information I'd get it done in 45 seconds.

How do I get back? What happens with the VA interactive system is, if I back into a one-way dead end street, I just shut it down and start over. I’m not gonna fight with this thing. Rather than try to find the cute way to do it, I'll just start over. The old Microsoft cure-all is to shut it down and start it up.  I still don’t see a way to do it. I'd look for a link. If I found it I’d follow it. If not, I'd start it up again.

**F:** (Prompts to click secret link back to details page)

I’m still not at the top page. Oh, back to appointments, there it is. If you had that on the other page that would have been better.

**Follow up:**

- What do/did you expect when you clicked that link?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does participant notice the link?
- Is the link perceived as a task?
- Can participant find their way back from personal healthcare contacts page?

## 3: Upcoming closed video appointment

You have a video appointment scheduled with Allison Carter next month. You want more information on the appointment, how would you do that from here?

I’d go into details. It says what it’s for. It says sleep medicine. Again I'd be looking for where it is. And it doesn’t really tell me does it. The other one told me purple bldg, room whatever. This one doesn’t have the commensurate information. And it doesn’t tell me specifically what the location is. I’m ignoring the stuff I’m not interested in. Prepare for my visit - it’s an appointment I made. I’d like to have one more line of data. 

**F:** Prompts to look at header

Oh, I’m not used to video appts. Oh, use the link but we’re not going to give it to me. That is profoundly dumb. To say we’re going to do something, but not do it. Tell me the harm to giving me the link a year before the appt. The link won’t be live but I’ll know I have it. I’ll have it, copy it into my calendar. Knowing the VA they'll send me 1,2,3 nag-o-grams reminding me about the appointment, some of which may have the link. Even if I get a voicemail, almost invariably in a couple days I'll get a letter. I don’t think I’ve had one no-show in 10 years. The reminders aren’t for me.

Before I let the scheduler off the phone, because of the economics of my (missed) situation I'll schedule as much for one day as I can. So I read back all the information to make sure I have it right.

## 4: Upcoming open video appointment

You have another video appointment with cardiology, would you find that appointment?

I wouldn’t make a vid appointment with a cardiologist, because you can’t stuff a stethoscope through the screen. One of the things about design in general is that they think they know what’s best for the user. And I think, (talks about general design process).

**F:** Prompts to go to cardiology with Dr. Traeger.

> Looks through all the appts on that day. 

I’ve got a busy day.

If you really want to get seen close to your appt time, make an appt at 1 o’clock. In optometry if I get dilated (talks generally about why 1 o’clock is the best time.)

Join appointment, your appointment hasn’t started yet, use the link, come back tomorrow. There’s a (something) service on the internet, eventbrite, it doesn’t give you the link until right before the event. I want them to give me that information (Missed some here, I think about how it’s useful to have the URL in his calendar invite.)

**Follow up:**

- What do you notice about the appointment information?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does participant notice the "join appointment" link before the other CTA's?

## 5: ATLAS

You have an audiology scheduled for 2 pm on Wednesday the 14th and want to find out how to get to the appointment. How would you do that from here?

(Notetaker: skipped this section for time)

**Follow up:**

- What do you notice about the appointment information?
- How are you to attend this appointment?
- How would you make changes to this appointment?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does participant understand the missing information?
- Does participant understand where to go for this appointment?
- Can participant find the "need to make changes" information?

## 6: Phone appointment

You have a phone appointment with Nancy Portman and want to know more info about it, how would you do that?

**F:** Directs to phone appointment

Interesting, just as a matter of copy editing. Is Nancy Portman a doctor? Does Dr Trager have a first name? If you’re going to refer to someone a certain way, refer to them all the same way.

> Clicks into details.

The phone appointments are great. I don’t know what this Portman person does. If it were a cardiologist for example I wouldn't do that. If it were someone I could interact with without having them see or touch something that’s great. Phone is super for follow-up. Because even if I miss the call, if it’s with a practitioner who knows me they can leave a message and they’re done. Do I have to set up a separate phone appointment for that? How would I do that?

**Follow up:**

- How do you attend this appointment?
- What else can you do from this page?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does participant understand how to attend this appointment?

## 7: Cancellation

You have a phone appointment with Nancy Portman and want to know more info about it, how would you do that?

I like the fact that it’s a two-step to cancel. Sometimes you hit stuff by accident. I’m okay with that little fallback. I don’t need it, I don't make that mistake. I can see how easy it is to make that mistake, and how objectionable that mistake would be to make. I don’t have that problem. For some of my fellow veterans I can understand how that'd be nice to have.

**Follow up:**

If you decided that you no longer wanted this appointment, how would you go about canceling it?

**Confirmation your cancellation:** What would you expect to see if you hit "Yes, cancel appointment"?

**Confirmation your cancellation:** What would you expect to see if you hit "No, do not cancel"?

**Appointment Canceled:** What can you do from here?

**Things to watch for:**

- Can participant find the cancelation button?
- What does participant expect from canceling an appointment?

## 8: After visit summary

You had a podiatry appointment last month and want to review what was discussed in the appointment. Where would you go to find that information?

Two things; depending on who it was with I might have my own notes. What you really want, I know how to get into medical records and get into the Blue Button feature to get those. In My HealtheVet it says medical records. I’ve done it so often, it’s not a problem. 

> Notes the directions link

I’ve got problems worse than my feet if I can't’ remember where the appointment is.

**F:** Lots of prompting to get to After Visit Summary link in Past.

**Follow up:**

Tell me about the experience of finding that information.

**Things to watch for:**

- Can participant easily find their after visit summary?
- Can participant easily navigate back from their after visit summary?

## 9: Appointment request

You made an appointment request and wanted to check on the status. How would you do that from here?

Notetaker: He discovers and discusses pending appointments at the end

**Follow up:**

Tell me about the experience of finding that information.

**Things to watch for:**

- Can participant find pending appointments?
- Does participant understand pending appointments?
- Does participant understand the information on the details page?

## 10: Empty State

You have a VA Appointment on January 10 at 2:30

Notetaker: skipped for time.

**Follow up:**

What do you notice about the information given here?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does participant notice the missing info?

## Post-Task Interview

Of everything you saw today, what was the most confusing, or challenging?

What worked well?

I sort of like the fact that there’s a fair amount of white space on the page. A lot of folks seem to be operating with the concept that you’ve got to shove everything on the page. It gives me upcoming. I probably wouldn’t look for past appointments. What’s the difference between upcoming or pending? Somebody’s getting paid by the word? Pending could mean an appointment that you’re trying to get. Pending means it’s hanging. 

“Pending (3)”... podiatry - it doesn’t say or even imply - “these appointment requests haven’t been scheduled yet”. I don’t even know how to do that. If I call them up they’re not going to give me a pending appointment, they’re going to give me a specific date.

Then don’t put it on. I wouldn’t do that. I’ve tried to make a couple of appointments through the system and it’s just not
