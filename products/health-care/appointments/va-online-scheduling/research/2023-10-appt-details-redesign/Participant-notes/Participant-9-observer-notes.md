Observer: Melissa

**Appointment Details:**

- Melissa mentions that the page has a lot of information. While some details are necessary, the participant feels that for routine follow-up appointments, they already know most of the information and don't need to see it again.

- Melissa says the appointment list page should include information about the specific floor or room number at the Salem Veterans Hospital. They point out that knowing the floor would be helpful, especially for a multi-floor facility, and suggest that this information should be on the front screen along with other details like date and time.

- For the phone appointment, Melissa is not sure what the appointment is for.

- Melissa suggests being consistent with Dr. Names. Have all first names or don’t have any.

**Prepare for your appointment:**

- The personal health care contacts page:
    - “It's got nothing to do with that appointment” … “It's got nothing specifically to do with the appointment or the link that led to this.”
    - Navigation issues when they go to the personal contacts page. Can’t figure out how to get back so Melissa says she would just leave the website and start all over.

**Calendar:**

- Melissa correctly identifies the "add to calendar" feature on the details page.

**Video Appointment:**

- Referring to the Video appointment link area:
    - “That's that is profoundly dumb is to tell me that you're going to do something but then tell me but we're not going to do it.”
    - “Either do it or don't do it. tell me the harm. To giving me the link… A year before the appointment. “The link won't go live until it's ready to go live” But I'll know that I've got it. I know that I don't have to take an extra step. I don't have to call you up 30 min before my appointment. I can go 30 s before my appointment and I'll know that the link is there because guess what? I'll have copied it into my calendar.”

**Appointment Reminders:**

- “And of course, knowing the VA. They will send me one or 2 or maybe even 3 Nagograms reminding me about the appointment.”

**Seeing multiple providers in the same day:**

- Melissa mentions that she would schedule a handful of appointments to schedule on the same day.

**EventBrite:**

- Eventbrite doesn’t give you the link until right before the event. I hate that.

**Cancellation:**

- Canceled the appointment successfully.
    - “I like the fact that it's a 2 step to cancel.”
