# P8 Notetaker Notes

**Notetaker:** Peter Russo

## 1: Upcoming In-Person Appointment

You know you have an appointment scheduled with Dr. Ralph Scott and want to know more information about it. How would you do that from here?

Sometimes it’s hard to find things when you login. Usually I have to click on everything until I find it.

It says I have an in-person appointment with optometry. That’s good because sometimes I don't know who I'm talking to or where I’m going. It’s just a checkup.

> Issues with data loading.

If you can cancel, should you be able to confirm? Sometimes I get a text message that lets me do that. If I’m in there maybe you can say confirm, next to the print.

> Click cardiology with Dr Trager. This one doesn’t say Video - oh actually it does, in big bold print.

(Notetaker: I missed a bit here.)

> Reviews “How to join” instructions

The first paragraph is a little confusing. I thought they were just instructions for iPad or iPhone. I started to look further down for Android/computer advice. I didn’t think this applied to me because I’m not using an iPad.

F: Prompts to find the “join appointment” link.

F: Prompts to go back to the first appointment.

I didn’t see a phone number on another appointment I viewed. If I was having a problem joining an appointment I’d want that there. This phone number probably calls Dr. Scott or the blue team, though I doubt it goes directly to him.

Details I shared, review your personal health care contacts. It says prepare for your visit, but maybe since this is optometry, it’s my primary care doctor.

> Clicks link

Oh, it's My information. Okay.

> Reads page.

Oh, that’s good to know that you can do that. When you log in for video appts you have to put in your name and address so if you’re on a video call they know where to send 911 if you’re having an episode on your video. It’d be nice if they had something like that right in there. You could just push home address, and if this showed my home address as a point of contact it would already be in the system.

There should be an edit button. This is really just letting me look at what’s on file. It’s not letting me do anything. It says to call us, but that should be available in MyVA also. If there’s not an edit button here, then maybe where it says emergency contact then it should take me to that screen in My VA and let me do that. Because if I just edit it here, it might just be for this appointment, not my entire profile. If it was a link to take you to your record you could update it overall.

F: Prompts to find sleep medicine appt

I don’t see a way to go back to my appointment. How would I do that from here? So I'll hit the back button on my phone rather than on the screen. I’m not sure if it’s going to exit me or take me back to my appointment.

F: Prompts to click VA in the header.

## 6: Phone appointment

You have a phone appointment with Nancy Portman and want to know more info about it, how would you do that?

When I hit details it does say phone appt, and your provider will call you. It says primary care, checkup for foot pain. Says I can contact the facility. It’s a scheduling facility. Give me the Blue team and their phone number. Check-up for foot pain.

Oop it just kicked me out.

All the others say doctor - shouldn’t she also say doctor? Otherwise I might think it’s just a social worker or something.

In my head, I’m thinking if she’s my primary care, why doesn’t it say doctor.

> Reads need help

Questions about a technical issue and video call - actually, this is a phone call. I could call the clinic number for help with that.

## 7: Cancellation

You have a phone appointment with Nancy Portman and want to know more info about it, how would you do that?

I would go ahead and click cancel. 

> Reads through.

Should there be a- should one of the options be yes, reschedule? That would be valuable because I’m thinking I’m going to forget to schedule another appointment. So now I have to say “yes cancel” and go back to the beginning, I’m assuming? Then I have to go back to schedule an appointment. Then it’s going to ask me for all this information again. Or if I have a list it’d be easier here, if there was a cancel/reschedule option on that list you’re still having to go back to another screen and do it there. But if I'm older and more forgetful I'm going to sneeze and forget that appointment.

If I click yes it’ll probably say “yes” and give me an option to schedule

See, yes it is right there, it says canceled appointment. So hopefully if I click schedule it’ll all be in there. Maybe then it should say reschedule appointment. I'd expect all of these things to be repopulated.

**Follow up:**

## 8: After visit summary

You had a podiatry appointment last month and want to review what was discussed in the appointment. Where would you go to find that information?

Note: past is missing, F directs to click to blank space.

It doesn’t look like it’s connected to anything. I can select a date range. But that’s missing something.

So if I saw a past appointment I’d like an option to click on doctors notes or something.

They always tell me my notes will be there but they’re not uploaded.

F: prompts to open past appointment

This is nice. It did give me the summary when I clicked on view notes. The date was wrong on the first screen, but when I opened it it was a past appointment. When I clicked on that I could see everything I was asking for.

**Follow up:**

Tell me about the experience of finding that information.

**Things to watch for:**

Can the participant easily find their after visit summary?

Can the participant easily navigate back from their after visit summary?

## 9: Appointment request

You made an appointment request and wanted to check on the status. How would you do that from here?

Back to appointments, upcoming. It says I have several upcoming appointments. What was I asking for help with?

It looks like I had one on the tenth canceled. Apparently I have two different primary cares. It would depend on which one of them the appointment was with, so I’d click on that. I didn’t know you could request it online. It says start scheduling appointments. I usually request an appointment through messages. I look for the person and say I need an appointment. That’s how I usually do it because it’s easier than sitting for an hour on hold.

F: what would you expect under pending

Appointments I actually have coming up. It looks like I'm on upcoming but some of them have been crossed out. So it looks like pending are actually valid.

> Clicks pending

Ohhhhh so these are ones I've requested but haven’t been scheduled yet. And it has canceled requests, like on the other screen.

(Notetaker: missed a bit here.)

Oh I can cancel it, it doesn’t ask me if I want to reschedule it. There’s no edit option. I thought it was upcoming appointments, not requests for appointments. Something else would be good - did I put in this request or did one of my doctors?

**Follow up:**

Tell me about the experience of finding that information.

**Things to watch for:**

Can the participant find pending appointments?

Does the participant understand pending appointments?

Does the participant understand the information on the details page?

## 10: Empty State

You have a VA Appointment on January 10 at 2:30

Provider not available? Oh but it says a check-up for new glasses. I’m guessing this is for optometry. The other appts said they were for optometry and with a doctor. I’m confused about this one; why don’t they have a provider? If this was to pick up my new glasses for that other optometry appointment maybe it should say pick up or something like that. I could understand the tech isn’t listed. It seems incomplete. Because it’s not like the other optometry appointment. It does have where to go, and what phone number. Not having the actual provider isn’t a big deal, it seems like you’re going somewhere that’s not optometry for glasses. Maybe this is like one of those community care referrals and that’s why it’s not available? But it should state that it’s CC but it doesn’t.

## Post-Task Interview

Of everything you saw today, what was the most confusing, or challenging?

There’s a lot of empty space. You can start scheduling, upcoming pending, I didn’t see canceled until we were in the pending screen. And I'm not sure if that meant requests or appointment was canceled. There’s no chance to edit your information once you’re in there. We touched on a lot of things.

What worked well?

Being able to see the info from the past appointment, that was great. 

What could we do better?

I think the contacts thing, like if there was a link right on the upcoming page. You could have a review here instead of clicking on one to see if one is right or not.


## 3: Upcoming closed video appointment

You have a video appointment scheduled with Allison Carter next month. You want more information on the appointment, how would you do that from here?

> Reviews appointment page

I don’t see the link so I must be here too early. Will it show up at some point? Would it say something though because I'm outside the 30 minutes? Should it say come back or something? Right now it seems like it might not just appear - if I just sat here would it show up. Maybe it should say come back close to your appointment.

Oh, and it does have the phone number on this one too even though it’s a vid appt. I don’t remember seeing that on the first one we tried. But it’s here now if I need help.

**Things to watch for:**

Does the participant notice the "join appointment" link before the other CTA's?

## 5: ATLAS

You have an audiology scheduled for 2 pm on Wednesday the 14th and want to find out how to get to the appointment. How would you do that from here?

It says I have a vid appointment at an atlas location. I don’t know what atlas is or how to get to that. If I go further down it says an address and I can click for directions. That doesn’t make sense. It’s a video appointment, why should I go to an address? It should have a  link for the atlas location, not a building location.

F: Explains atlas

Oh, if they don’t have computer access. So if I don't have computer access, how am I seeing this?

Oh, it says use this code to find the computer provided at the site. But if I don’t have a computer, do I get this code mailed to me? That’s just what’s going through my head right now. I don’t know where to get the code if I don't have the computer.

Oh, and I have a blank box again. It should say print but it’s missing.

F: If you had any questions and you needed to ask someone how would you do that. It says you can contact scheduling with this phone number. Or I can find my health facilities number by calling that number.

> Reads through need help

Wouldn’t joining the video be the same as technical issues? I feel like I have too many people to call to get help. Because if I can't connect, that's a technical issue in my head. I don’t know which number to call. And every number I've called at VA I’m on hold for at least a half an hour.

> F: What phone are you on

It’s a Samsung Galaxy only a year old. Android. Samsung galaxy.
