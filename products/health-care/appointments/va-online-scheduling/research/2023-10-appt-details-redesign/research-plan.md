# **Appointments Details Redesign - Research Plan**


Background
----------

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

The appointments team has redesigned appointment details pages for all appointment types. This includes Upcoming, past, canceled and requests.  

Also see [Product's initiative brief.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/appointment-details-redesign/appointment-details-redesign-initiative-brief.md)


### OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

* Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase ðŸ“ˆ

* Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

Decrease ðŸ“‰


* Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

## Research goals



1. Testing changes in details page content
2. Testing hierarchy of details page information
3. Evaluating the use of buttons and links. 
4. Testing changes to the cancelation flow 


### Outcome

We will use the findings to:



1. Make any necessary changes to finalize the appointment details designs.
2. Make any necessary changes to finalize the new cancellation flow.


### Hypotheses



* **Cancelation**:
    * Participants will be able to cancel their appointments easily.
* **Details Pages:**
    * Participants will be able to find their appointment information easily.
* **CTAâ€™s**:
    * On an upcoming appointment details page, participants will find the secondary buttons before finding the join appointment CTA. 


### Research Questions



* **Cancelation:**
    * Do Veterans know how to cancel their appointment?
    * How would Veterans expect to cancel an appointment? 
* **Details page:**
    * Do Veterans know where to go for their appointment?
    * Do Veterans know how to prepare for their appointment?
    * What do Veterans expect to do on the details page?
    * What is the first action veterans take on an appointment details page.
* **CTAâ€™s:**
    * What is the first action veterans take on an appointment details page.
