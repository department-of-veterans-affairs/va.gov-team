# **Appointments Details Redesign - Research Plan**


Background
----------

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

The appointments team has redesigned appointment details pages for all appointment types. This includes Upcoming, past, canceled and requests.

### OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

* Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase ðŸ“ˆ

* Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

Decrease ðŸ“‰


* Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
