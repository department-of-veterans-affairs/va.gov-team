# Conversation Guide: VAOS Usability September 2019


- Link to InVision Prototype


# Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauren and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling doctor's appointments.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** 

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

START RECORDING

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"**

## Warm Up

**What are the different ways that you know of that you can schedule an appointment with a VA doctor?** 

- If Veteran DOES mention VAOS/online scheduling: 

  - **Have you ever used this service?**

  - **What kinds of appointments have you booked online?**

  - **How was that experience?**

  - **To your knowledge, what other health care specialties or appointment types can you book online?**    

- If participant DOES NOT mention online scheduling: 

  - **Has your provider or anyone at a VAMC ever told you about online scheduling at VA?** 
  - **Would you ever consider booking a VA appointment online?** 
    - Why, Why not
  - **What types of appointments or health care specialty types would you expect to be able to book online?**

- **I'd like to call your attention to the option, "Manage your care." What actions do you expect that you could take if you clicked on that button?**

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.
