## Intro - 5 minutes


Thanks for joining us today! My name is Peter, and I have some colleagues on the line who are observing and taking notes. We're looking to improve our tool that lets Veterans schedule appointments through VA.gov. Today, I'd like to go through a prototype of an online scheduling tool to get your thoughts on it.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 40 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a demo tool**  Some areas of the demo will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 


Warm up questions
----------------

How do you schedule health care appointments at VA? Over the phone, online, etc.?
- Why do you use those methods?

Usability test intro
--------------------

Thank you!

Now I'd like to get your thoughts on the demo tool I talked about earlier.

As I mentioned, some areas of the demo tool will be clickable, and some will not. Some things may not work as expected. If anything catches you by surprise, please let me know as we're going through the tool.

We'll walk through sharing your screen. Then I'll send you a link to the demo tool.

-   First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?

-   Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.

Now I'm going to have you share your screen, and then I'll send you a link to a prototype so we can look at that together.

* Use chat to send user [link to prototype](https://va-scheduling.invisionapp.com/console/share/8B35XJ0ST3/823651604). 

* Talk participant through screen sharing so they can share their screen.

As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.


**If can't share**

-   Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok? [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**After prototype is open**

Thanks!

What we're going to do is run through a series of tasks in an imaginary scenario. As you're going through these tasks, it's most helpful if you say what's on your mind. Your thoughts and feelings will help us make this better for all Veterans.

## First Task: Complete an appointment request

To start, talk me through this page. What do you see here?

Now I want you to use the demo to schedule an appointment. You'll be scheduling a primary care appointment at Evanston VA, at the earliest available date. If you forget or get stuck in the process just let me know.
