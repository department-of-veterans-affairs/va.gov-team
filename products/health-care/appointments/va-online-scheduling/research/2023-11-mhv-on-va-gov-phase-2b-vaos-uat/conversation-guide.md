## Introduction (5 minutes)

- Thanks so much for joining today. My name is ____________, very nice to meet you. I'm here with my notetaker ______. Today we're going to ask for your feedback on the appointments section of VA.gov. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the site for Veterans in the future.

- Before we begin: Today we're going to ask you to login to VA.gov and test some features using your own account. We'll be asking you to share your screen, which means we'll be seeing your appointments, and potentially other data. We won't be using your personal health information for the study, and will redact it from any recordings or transcripts. Given that, do you feel comfortable proceeding?
   - If Yes, continue to next question
   - If No: I completely understand. We hope you'll join us for future studies. Do you have any questions or concerns for me before we end the session?

- Thank you, I appreciate that. Next, I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. Do you feel comfortable with having observers listen in on the session?

_(If the participant agrees, let observers join. Each observer should come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off.)_

- There are a few things I'd like to mention:
    - There are no right or wrong answers, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the mobile website and make it work better for everyone.
    - There’s no expectation to provide any personal information. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
    - This entire session will take no more than 60 minutes. I will keep an eye on the time and try to keep us moving along so that we don’t go over. 
    - The format of the session is that we’ll talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where I’ll ask you to login to your VA.gov account and share your screen. 
    - Finally, is it ok if I record the screen and the audio during our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to to make sure our notes are accurate. The recordings will be destroyed after we do this. 
    - **While we are so very grateful to have you here and get your feedback, the number one priority is making sure you feel comfortable in this session so if for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**
- Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?
- Great! Any questions before we continue?
- Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. 

_Start recording._

- Is it ok if we record this session?
