### Starting the session:

- Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:

## Introduction (5 minutes)

- Thanks so much for joining today. My name is ____________, very nice to meet you. I'm here with my notetaker ______. Today we're going to ask for your feedback on the appointments section of VA.gov. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the site for Veterans in the future.

- Today we're going to ask you to login to VA.gov and test some features using your own account. We'll be asking you to share your screen, which means we'll be seeing your appointments, and potentially other health information. We won't be using your personal health information for the study, and will redact it from any notes we take. Given that, do you feel comfortable proceeding?
   - If Yes, continue to next question
   - If No: I completely understand. We won't be able to continue this session today but I do hope you'll join us for future studies. Do you have any questions or concerns for me before we end the session?

- Thank you, I appreciate that. Next, I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It's completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. Do you feel comfortable with having observers listen in on the session?

_(If the participant agrees, let observers join.)_

- Could the observers come off camera for a second and give a quick intro?

- Before we begin, I want to give you some background on how today's session will go:
    - We're going to ask you to test out some features on MyHealtheVet and ask how they work for you. This will involve sharing your device's screen, which we'll run through in a minute.
    - There are no right or wrong answers, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. 
    - There's no expectation to provide any personal information that you don't want to. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
    - This entire session will take no more than 60 minutes. I'll keep an eye on the time and try to keep us moving along so that we don’t go over. 
    - Finally, we would like to record the session. We use this as backup in case we need to refer to to make sure our notes are accurate. The recordings will be destroyed after we do this.
       - Given that, is it ok if I record the screen and the audio during our session today?
          - If NO: Not a problem, I may just stop you at points to confirm what I've seen. 
    - While we are so very grateful to have you here and get your feedback, the number one priority is making sure you feel comfortable in this session so if for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.
 
- Do you have any questions about that?
   - If NO and Recording OK: Great! I'm going to hit the record button now.
   - If NO and Recording NOT OKAY: Great! Let's get started with a few questions.

_Start recording._

- Is it ok if we record this session?

## Backup plans

If they don't want to show their private information, they can turn off screen share and talk us through the navigation process.

If that doesn't work, we can open a staging user and share our screen, but this should be a last resort since it doesn't give us great data about how this works in their context.

## Emergency Exit Strategy

_If we need to exit the session for any reason, use the following:_

We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
