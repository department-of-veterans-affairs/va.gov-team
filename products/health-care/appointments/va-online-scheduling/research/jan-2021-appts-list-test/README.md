# Appointments list usability study

The VAOS team is redesigning the appointments list to:
* Make it easier to scan and find appointments in the list
* Make it clearer which appointments are in person, over video, and over the phone
* Help Veterans distinguish between confirmed, cancelled, and pending appointments
