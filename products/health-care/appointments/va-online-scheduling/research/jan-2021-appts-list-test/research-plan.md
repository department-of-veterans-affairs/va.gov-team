# Research Plan for VAOS Appointments List, January 2021

## Problem statement
As a Veteran who uses VA online scheduling, I want to be able to manage all my appointments from a single place which includes preparing for upcoming appointments, printing specific details about appointments, reviewing past appointments, and rescheduling appointments.	

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

VA online scheduling displays all of a Veteran's upcoming VA and Community Care appointments. This list of appointments can become very long making it difficult to distinguish between appointments. This problem was identified during the [Express Care research in July 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/july-2020-user-research/2020-july-VAOSR-EC-research-report.md).

We believe that Veterans will get enough information from an "thumbnail" view of their appointments, organized by month, to plan ahead for their appointments at a high level, as long as they can easily get the details for their individual appointments. This belief is based on the success of similar appointments work done by the VA Mobile team, as well as the success of a partial test of this functionality during the [Community Care research in December 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/oct-2020-cc-provider-discovery).


## Research questions

**Static Landing Page**
- Do users find the information on this page helpful?
- Can they easily start managing their appointments?

**Home Page/Appointments List**

- Do users understand that they can click the thumbnail view to get to the detail page?
- Does the thumbnail information help them scan the appointments list?
- Can they distinguish between appointment types?
    - Video appointments
    - Express care
    - Phone appointments
    - Canceled appointments
- Can they their find appointments that aren't in the upcoming list?
    - Past
    - Requested
- Do they understand what the requested appointments are?
- Can they easily find/understand the date/time for their appointments?
- Can Veterans easily navigate between an appointment and the appointments list?

**Rescheduling**
- Can Veterans easily reschedule an appointment?

## Hypotheses

- Veterans will easily be able to find appointments they need.
- Veterans will understand they can click an appointment to get more details.
- Veterans will be frustrated that the type of care is not listed shown.


## Method	

1.	What method of research are you planning? 	  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	

This will be a remote moderated usability test with high-fidelity prototypes. This will let us test that the interactions make sense and the information is presented clearly.

## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)	

Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?

**Primary criteria / Must have**

5 Veterans who have VA health care

**Secondary criteria / Would like to have**

- Representative of all branches of the Armed Forces
- An even split of men and women
- At least one person in each of the following age brackets: 18-30, 31-50, 50+.
- At least one participant to have a disability rating of 30% or greater.

We will ask for Perigean support in recruiting.

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 

We plan on running this research between Wednesday January 20th and Tuesday January 26, 2021.

Each session will be [TBD] minutes.

Availability:

| Date      | Available time                   |
