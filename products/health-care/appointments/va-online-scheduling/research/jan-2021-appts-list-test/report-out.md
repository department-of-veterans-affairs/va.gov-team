## Participant demographics

5 participants:

* Veteran, Female, White or Caucasian, 45-54
* Veteran, Female, White or Caucasian, 35-44
* Veteran, Male, 25-34
* Veteran, Female, White or Caucasian, 55-64
* Veteran, Female, White or Caucasian, 55-64

## Results summary

All participants joined the session and worked through the prototype on mobile devices.

All were able to complete most of the tasks we tested with ease, and often did so without any prompting. See task-level details on the table below. This gives us high confidence that this feature will be usable by most Veterans.

**Tasks key**
- 4 - success/full understanding
- 3 - could complete/understand with some time
- 2 - could complete/understand with more time
- 1 - did not understand/couldn't complete
- 0 - Skipped

**Task notes**
1. Most users didn't specifically call out the Express Care/Phone appointment before clicking into a detail view, and we moved on with the test before confirming they had seen it. It might be worth reviewing these appointments in future research with Express Care users.
2. "Missed" - we weren't able to record P8 so I couldn't confirm if they understood appointment requests
3. P8 assumed all the calendar options were unavailable because they were all gray - none were the lighter "unavailable" gray. It might be worth exploring whether this is a more widespread issue in future research.

## Results detail

Note that while a small study like this works well for validating usability, broader "opportunities" listed below should be further researched and validated before action is taken.

### Participants easily navigated the prototype

All participants joined on a mobile device, most on a phone and one on an iPad. All were able to easily:
* Find the main CTA on the static landing page
* Navigate and understand the thumbnail page
* Open a detail page from the thumbnail 
* Find and navigate the appointment type selector dropdown

One participant was able to do the above while they were making coffee.

**Quotes**
>  I like the way the appointments are broken into a bubble. Before it used to be a table and it was written out.  I like that the appointments are in order and I can just click on it to see what it is. And then see it is a phone appointment instead of searching through 3 pages to see I have appointments. - P3

>  I like that Express Care here has a phone and that tells me it is a phone appointment and this other one tells me it is a video appointment so I don’t need to drive for it - P3

>  I typically print things out and carry it to the appointment so I would do that. If you need to reschedule or cancel I can do that here so that’s really good - P8

>  I like how it is a monthly thing, I like how clear it is, video conference only, that’s good.  It tells you who you are going to see, what its for. - P9

### Appointment requests continue to create confusion

Most users had some level of difficulty understanding the appointment requests section, and one user couldn't find it without help, even after opening the dropdown. Some indicated that they were confused by the word "request" in that option. (When prompting the participant, we avoided saying that word directly so as not to cue them.)

Most users wanted to see more information about the status of the request. Specifically, whether a scheduler has viewed the request, and if so, whether they have started processing it. Participants reported that they will call their facility if a request sits for too long. One participant wondered if they could change the request to a video or phone appointment to get seen sooner.

While participants were able to navigate through the three requests displayed, it wasn't clear that appointment requests were in order of date requested, as that information isn't shown.

**Recommendations**
* Make the "Requested" title more specific. "Pending" or "Pending request" might be better.
* Add a note to the requests list explaining that they are in order, with the oldest requests at the top.

**Opportunities**
* Add clarity around the status of requests. Veterans are calling facilities to find out if their requests are being processed, so even knowing if it has been reviewed could be helpful in reducing call volume. This would likely benefit both Veterans and schedulers.
* Consider allowing users to change a request to a video and phone appointment, as alternative options to canceling and rescheduling.

**Quotes**
> It would be nice to see if someone on the other side said they saw \[the appointment request\]. If I requested and they haven’t responded just show me that. - P2

> \[Looking at the list of appointment requests\] Primary care is at the top because everything goes through primary care and specialty would be in ABC order or when the appointments are. This is February. It must be in ABC order; they must be in alphabetical order. - P3

> This \[request detail\] page doesn’t tell me anything because it has only been submitted. How do you know they even looked at it, there is no indication. I would have to call the clinic to see if they have my request and if I would have an appointment. - P3

> After I request the appointments I would go check on them to see if the requested appointments were approved. If they weren't I would call or email telling them I scheduled via the software and haven’t heard anything so please give me a call. That happened today, I am going back today to pick up a handicap plaque. I messaged them and asked if it is ready. No one called to tell me it was ready. 
 - P5
 
 > Like the first one \[Looking at the Express Care request\] that says it is a request. Is that what you are talking about? So I don’t know when It was requested and how long I had to wait but they were going to follow up on Wednesday if I had an appointment or not.  I have to keep the entire day available because they don’t tell me anything here. -P8
 
> \[Looking at an appointment request detail\] It doesn’t say when they will contact me so I am waiting around and leaving the 18th and 19th open. It would be nice if they say they will contact me in 24 hours or 2 business days. This leaves it open ended. - P8 

> I think from the start when requesting it should be an option. If it isn’t an appointment that they can do by telehealth then they need to say that, otherwise you should have that option at the start. - P8

> You asked for something that was not confirmed, I was looking for confirmed not confirmed. So logically I though it would be under requested but most won't think that way. I would figure out the puzzle but it wasn’t clear. I am looking for confirmed or not confirmed or pending. - P9

### Veterans plan future appointments by looking at past ones

Most participants indicated that they often review dates of past appointments to plan and schedule future appointments - planning a yearly physical, for example. They also initially underestimated how far back they'd like to see past appointments. Most decided that seeing apointments one year or more back would be helpful, though some noted that they have certain recurring appointments every five years.

Some participants refer to their records of past appointments to find facility contact information. One suggested they have used their appointment history to explain to their provider that new symptoms started after their last appointment.

**Opportunities**
* One step toward personalization might be to surface CTAs to schedule recurring appointments, like yearly physicals, on the home page.
* Consider providing a list of recent health care providers, and allow Veterans to schedule new appointments with them, saving the step of choosing a Type of Care or facility.

**Quotes**
> If I need to schedule my yearly physical or get blood work I would look at my personal calendar. I know it's been longer than 3 months. - P2

> A lot of times they ask when they saw me last and I can pull \[this past appointments list\] up and tell them I saw them December 31 and this started two weeks after I saw you. - P3

> Usually I just need the date. If I need to call I can get \[clinic contact information\] off of the past appointments. I only use it for the contact information and date. I don’t use it for much else. - P8

> I just think it is important to know when I have a CAT scan for my lungs, if I knew I needed a mammogram yearly and I hadn’t heard from someone. Like the eye doctor, how often you should go. It gives you a snapshot when you went if you need a follow up or if nothing else was needed. It doesn’t need a lot of details but just a snapshot. - P9

### The ability to reschedule and cancel appointments online empowers Veterans

Participants were excited about the ability to easily cancel and reschedule appointments without an additional phone call to the provider.

Participants reported that seeing who canceled an appointment, and when, would help them make better choices around providers. One gave the example that, if a facility keeps canceling their appointment, they may decide to go elsewhere. Another noted that they don't want to be "dinged" by the system for canceling an appointment when the provider canceled it, and they will call a facility to correct that error when it happens. 

In general, participants wanted more clarity into the process. For canceled appointments, they asked for some direction as to the next steps if the scheduler canceled it: will the doctor follow up, or should the Veteran? For rescheduled appointments, a clear indication that it has been rescheduled would help, no matter who rescheduled it.

One participant noted that they want a confirmation before the reschedule is complete, so they can change their mind if they make a mistake.

**Recommendations**
* Add a confirmation screen before rescheduling is complete.
* Add a temporary indicator to the appointment thumbnail showing that the appointment has been rescheduled.
* Add instructions to canceled appointments explaining how to reschedule. 

**Opportunities**
* Consider adding a reschedule option to canceled appointments, to make this process easier when a scheduler cancels a Veteran's appointment.
* Consider adding information about who canceled an appointment, and when, to the canceled appointment detail.
* Explore ways to communicate that an appointment has been canceled or rescheduled, both in VAOS and notifications to the Veteran.

**Quotes**
> It's happened where all my appointments were cancelled for a month and a half. If it's cancelled by me that’s one thing but if it was cancelled by them I would expect a physical call and reschedule on their part. - P2

> I schedule around work - like going in late or leaving early. If I take a day off and they cancel it I am SOL. Trying to reschedule it is a bit of a pickle. - P2

> I had a provider that constantly cancelled appointments. I had no way to track how many times he cancelled it and it allowed me to go to community care for the specialties because he kept cancelling. If you can track who cancelled them that gives the Vets more power in case they have an issue with a provider cancelling the appointments. - P3

> Cancelled appointment should tell you who cancelled it and when you click on it, it tells you. There are times that appointments are cancelled and I don’t know who did. It is nice that they have you cancelled it so I can think back to see why I cancelled it. Or if I click it and it says the VA cancelled and gives a date and number. - P3

> COVID-19 is a strange time, if I cancelled it or not notifying them, there's a place that you can cancel but I have seen that in my record it says Veteran failed to make it. Like I have been dinged - I don’t like having blemishes \[on my record\]. - P9

> Sometimes they cancel and never call back. This is very clear. - P9

> On the other ones it tells me that I cancelled and to call. Was the follow-up done, was it rescheduled, or does it need to be rescheduled, or was it resolved? If you click it there should be more information, like what and why. - P9

> I hope to reschedule it doesn’t take you to a year out but to the next available appointment. - P3

> \[Rescheduling like that\] was wicked easy. What I have been doing is 10 times harder than that. You either need to call or text them of canceling then go through the process of scheduling. 

> So it says it has been rescheduled. The one thing that normally misses is the screen asking if you are sure you want to change the appointment. This was so easy to hit it didn’t give me an option to confirm. - P5

> \[After rescheduling\] This is very cool. We don’t have that capability now. Normally I have to talk to a human that does not have any appointments available at this time. I have rescheduled, I am in more control of my life rather than a clerk. - P9
    
### Static landing page
All participants quickly found the main CTA. Most skimmed the content of this page, then clicked the CTA without prompting. Most skipped past the COVID notification at the top, with some commenting that they ignore it because they see it everywhere on the VA site.

**Recommendations**
* In earlier research we found that the number of alerts on this page was confusing. Recommend reworking the first part of this page so there are fewer alerts, and the main CTA is closer to the top, followed by general information about this page.
* Move the questions into accordions, in their own section, to aid scannability.
* Revisit the language around appointment requests. Align the language used here with that used when completing a request. (Also see [Appointment requests continue to be confusing] in this report.)

**Quotes**
> Let me reread it. I am guessing I can make an appointment or request one here. I am not sure. - P2

> The first time I read this but now I just click on the blue button. Most of the time on the VA if it is in blue you can click it and get somewhere else. - P3

> Every page starts with COVID stuff but no one reads that anymore. - P3

> I was confused that it says it may be faster to schedule over the phone. If it displays here why should I then go to the phone? I don’t know why it would be faster to do it on the phone when normally the phone system doesn’t work too great. - P8

> There is a lot of FAQ’s but they never seem to be my questions. - P8

> I think it is simple to use, the only thing I would get hung up on is finding this link to get started. Hopefully, it is prominent on the site. - P8

> It does a lot, benefit eligibility, disability, when I first started I thought it was appointment only but it has a lot going on. This is good. - P9

### Appointment reminders are inconsistent
Most users reported some issue around the volume of notifications (including text, email, phone, and paper) they receive from the VA. Sometimes there are too many, sometimes none, and often it varies based on the provider.

The content of the notifications they receive is generally helpful, though one user reported that sometimes the phone numbers are incorrect.

Most users track their appointments across multiple systems: desk calendar, email, digital calendar, etc. Some create additional reminders for their appointments. Others rely on a calendar they review daily.

**Opportunities**
* We are planning to research scheduling notifications to understand how we can improve these in VAOS. During this research keep in mind all the systems Veterans use, along with what the VA sends and when, and how Veteran communication preferences are tracked.

**Quotes**
> I have Outlook on my phone and I track it there. I have reminders two weeks out and the day of. It tells me what time I need to leave. And I have it written on the desk calendar. - P3

>Last month I had an appointment and I got \[no notification\]. I almost forgot but my phone reminded me. The clinic is three hours away. 
The Veterans I help \[with transport\] are in their 80’s. It's a two-day trip; we take them there for their appointments and drive back the next day. - P3

> Before COVID you would get the post card a month prior, or a call or text/email. You would have one of these ways. Now due to COVID you get nothing, too much or just one email. - P3

> Text message reminders are fine if it's maybe one the week of, and one the day before. But sometimes I end up getting 15 texts that are all the same message and makes me confirm or cancel it.  It just gets very annoying after awhile. - P3

> I had an exam and I logged in and saw it was cancelled but never got notification. I only saw it was cancelled because of the website. I could have went. It has happened before and I have driven to the appointment and they had cancelled it on a Monday morning and did it on the website. - P5

> I get anxiety that I will be late but they are always late anyways so its when you get there you get there. I try to leave early to get there early. Then they take my blood pressure twice because it is high when I get there. Every time. - P5

> I am old school and I call \[to schedule my appointment\]. I usually leave a message and call back but normally they wont call back so I have to call again so I need to learn to \[schedule online\]. - P8

>  I write my appointments on a desk calendar and usually they send me an email confirmation so I keep the email so I can access the appointment details.  I am very non-technical. I used to fly airplanes but when it comes to this I am old school. - P8 

> They are good at texting, calling and cards in the mail. I got an email the other day that showed my appointments so it’s like whatever works for you I guess. - P9

> If I didn’t talk to \[my provider\] since a few months back it may be a good time to reach out to them. I have had that issue before, I have to call mine, she doesn’t check in on me. I told her so to. - P9

>   I do a combination, if I want an appointment I may use secure messaging to talk with the doctors, once I have an appointment I have the hard copy and an iPhone reminder. - P9


### Booking notes language wasn't clear

We were surprised that few participants directly asked to see type of care in the context of their appointment. From [previous research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/oct-2020-cc-provider-discovery#participants-need-specific-information-to-identify-and-prepare-for-their-appointments) we believed this would be a pain point. Some participants noticed that “Primary care” was mentioned in the booking note, and commented that they were happy to see that information, not realizing that’s what they would have entered had it been their appointment. Our hypothesis is that they still found value in seeing type of care, and weren't clear that it wasn't present because of the nature of the static prototype used in the study.

Along with the booking note, most Veterans showed some confusion when looking at the information they would have entered, such as time preferences on requests, or contact information.  

**Recommendations**
* Revisit the language used to describe appointment information the Veteran provided. Separate this from the facility-provided appointment information to make it easier for the Veteran to separate. 

### General scheduling feedback
Veterans also provided general feedback about their scheduling experience. Many of these build on themes we’ve heard in earlier research. While VAOS can't solve all of these issues, it's helpful to understand the overal Veteran experience.

A couple of recurring themes:

* Some participants wanted to see any other information to help them prepare for the day of the appointment, such as if labs/fasting would be needed.

* Some participants reported that the process for getting travel pay reimbursed is tedious. They have to put in a reimbursement request after every trip to an appointment , and the wait times for reimbursement were long.

* As we've heard in previous sessions, wait times for requests can be very long. And creating a request through VAOS is slower than calling, which has caused them to use VAOS less.

* More than half of the participants were aware of VAOS on some level, but don’t use it because of issues scheduling in the past. Specifically, some mentioned their  facilities were not available for online scheduling.

**Opportunities**
* Look for ways to integrate travel pay reimbursement into appointments.
* Research whether any facilities are using waitlists to successfully move people into appointments faster.
* Consider options to catch if a Veteran's facility isn't available for online scheduling sooner in the scheduling process.

**Quotes**
> It's 'hurry up and wait' in the military from bootcamp to waiting for appointments. - P2

> I would hope \[to get a call back from a request\] within a day but the earliest I've gotten a call back was maybe 2 days. - P2

> Some appointments I can schedule using myhealthevet.gov. Others I have to call like ten thousand times to make an appointment. Others they just make for me and send me a card and tell me I am there. - P3

> The biggest problem is you call and it keeps ringing especially for the specialty clinics - you can spend 3 days on the phone trying to get an appointment. It's not their fault they are understaffed and overworked. I understand that because I work with Veterans. - P3

> I used to take my appointment summary to the VA and they would \[put in the travel pay reimbursement\]. But now I have to scan it and redo it and wait for it to be rejected and appeal it and it takes almost a year to get paid. They reject it regularly. - P3

> I have been waiting a month for a rotator cuff tear. You have to wait for the community care permission which takes a month then wait for the space. It needs to be streamlined, there are too many ways to fail. - P3

> I have used this page \[VAOS\] before. It is how I have scheduled appointments but the place I go doesn’t have many appointment available. And since COVID you can't make an appointment. When you try to schedule online they make you call to schedule. - P3

> I needed an appointment within 6 months and that was last February and I was just seen last week. By the time that they see the request and get it in the computer it is already 6 months out. - P3

> Say I had an appointment Monday but I have class. I would say I need to reschedule but they tell me there’s no time within the next 3 months. I would not have a choice to take it because I was supposed to be seen. You would have to call every day to see if there are openings for the next day. It would be nice if you put something on here to be put on a waitlist and out your dates. If your name is at the top they could slide you in and be seen.

> Every department has 5 different numbers and most just ring. I don’t have an issue with the VA just the administration. There are too many numbers and connects that go nowhere. - P5

> The VA does block scheduling, it doesn’t matter when your appointment is. If you get there at 8 you get seen first. It's when you get there is when your appointment is. All that does is make Veterans angry because they have an appointment at 10 but don’t get seen until 11:30am. - P5

> Travel pay should be automatic, they know where Veterans are coming form they have our address. I mean how else are we supposed to get there, transport? I want a one stop shop instead of logging into multiple government websites. - P5

> When I tried to \[schedule with VAOS\] in the past it didn’t work for me. I wasn’t allowed to do it, maybe its where we are and they weren’t ready for the software. I just email the department instead and tell them I need to follow up and they either call or email me back. - P5
