## Background

The community care preferences page in the VA Online Scheduling app (VAOS) has a high dropoff rate<sup>1</sup>. On the current page, if the Veteran wants to enter a specific health care provider, they have to open the Facility Locator tool, manually copy the information there, and paste it back into the preferences page on VAOS. 

Our hypothesis was that if we improve the provider selection experience by allowing Veterans do find providers directly in VAOS:

*   The dropoff rate on that page will improve
*   Schedulers will have an easier time processing community care requests

In addition to community care provider selection, we briefly tested changes to the appointments list on the VAOS home page in anticipation of future work in this area.

## Methodology

We conducted 8 60-minute remote moderated sessions over 8 days, where we tested a prototype of the new provider selection flow and appointments list. We asked eight Veterans questions about their current experience scheduling health care appointments and their understanding of community care. Then we asked them to navigate through the clickable prototype of the VAOS app. 

## Participants

Not all of the 8 participants were able to conduct all portions of the proposed research. The end of the test, which focused in detail on the appointments list, was dropped from most sessions. But all Veterans gave us feedback on the provider selection features and the overview of the appointments list.

Most participants were familiar with scheduling appointments through MyHealtheVet or over the phone. All except one were familiar with community care.

In the findings section, the shorthand for participant response rate is:


*   Some = 2-3 (25-38%)
*   Half = 4 (50%)
*   Most = 5-7 (63-88%)


## Notes

1. 78% of Veterans abandoned the app on the community care preferences page between October 1 and December 3 2020
