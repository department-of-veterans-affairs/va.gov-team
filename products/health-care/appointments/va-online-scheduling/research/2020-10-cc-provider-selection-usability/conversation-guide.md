## Intro - 5 minutes   

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Peter Russo and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We have a team working on improving a tool veterans can use to request health care appointments. Today, I'd like to hear about your experience with requesting appointments, and go through a prototype of this tool and get your thoughts on it.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [one hour].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
    
*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

- First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?

    - Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.
    
**If phone:**
- OK great. When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?

- First I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the arrow that says "Share content" and hit "share screen". Select that button. You should be prompted with an option to share "Zoom" and then "Screen". Then select "Start Broadcast". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.

- Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application.

- Great, now I can see your phone screen! We are going to use this prototype in our session today. I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments.

**If can't share**
- Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
[Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a couple of warm-up questions.

1. Have you ever scheduled your VA health care appointments online?

* If *YES*
    * Can you walk me through the steps you take to schedule an appointment online? 

* If *NO*
    * Thank you, that’s helpful to know

2. Today we're going to be testing a process for requesting a community care health care appointment. We know not all Veterans are aware of, or eligible for, community care, but it's helpful for us to talk to Veterans who have used community care as well as those who haven't. Are you familiar with community care?

* If *YES*
    *  In your own words, tell me what you know about community care.
    *  Have you gone to a community care provider?

* If *NO*
    * Have you heard of VA Choice? 
    * After we're done, if you want to learn more about community care, we can ask our recruiting team to send you some additional information. Would you be interested in that? 

## Section 1: Start an appointment

Now I'm going to have you share your screen, and then I'll send you a link to a prototype so we can look at that together.

* `Use chat to send user link to prototype.` [Prototype link](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/VDZB8MN48AZ)

* `Talk user through screen sharing so they can share their screen.`

As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
