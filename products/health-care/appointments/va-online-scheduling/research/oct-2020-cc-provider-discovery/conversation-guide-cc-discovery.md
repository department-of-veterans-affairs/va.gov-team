## Intro - 5 minutes

- [//] In your introduction I recommend that you spend a bit of time reviewing some of the functions of Zoom, and where they can find the chat function. It may be helpful to have them go through the process of clicking on the link to your prototype in zoom before you get started, so your flow is not interrupted with logistics.       

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Peter Russo and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We have a team working on improving a tool veterans can use to request health care appointments. Today, I'd like to hear about your experience with requesting appointments, and go through a prototype of this tool and get your thoughts on it.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [one hour].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
    


*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a couple of warm-up questions.

1. Have you ever scheduled your VA health care appointments online?
[//]: (Recommend specifying VA health care appts versus ANY appointmentment.)
* If *YES*
    * Can you walk me through the steps you take to schedule an appointment online? 
    [//]: (Recommend asking them to talk you through how they do it to understand if they are talking about what you think they're talking about.) 

* If *NO*
    * Thank you, that’s helpful to know


2. Today we're going to be testing a process for requesting a community care health care appointment. We know not all Veterans are eligible for community care, but it's helpful for us to talk to Veterans who have used community care as well as those who haven't. Are you familiar with community care?

* If *YES*
    *  In your own words, tell me what you know about community care.
    *  Have you gone to a community care provider?

* If *NO*
    * Have you heard of VA Choice? 
    * After we're done, if you want to learn more about community care, we can ask our recruiting team to send you some additional information. Would you be interested in that? 

## Section 1: Start an appointment - x minutes

Now I'm going to have you share your screen, and then I'll send you a link to a prototype so we can look at that together.

* `Use chat to send user link to prototype.` [Prototype link](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/VDZB8MN48AZ)


* `Talk user through screen sharing so they can share their screen.`

As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

`Start Task 1 when screen is shared`

### Task 1 - Home Page general impression

* Our first task today will be to have you request an appointment through the VA Online Scheduling website.

* First, take a look at this page, scroll around. Tell me what this page is for and what you think you can do here. Share any thoughts, questions, or things that you find confusing or helpful. 

* Is the information on this page what you expect it to be?
[//] What are you looking to answer with this question? This is really vague. Recommend revising.  

* Today, I'd like to ask you to schedule a general check-up with a primary care provider. How would you start from this page?
[//] Veterans have a pretty strong continuum of care, so the concept of "with someone you haven't seen before" will be hard to understand. I also generally avoid "imagine' language in convo guides with veterans and just give them direct tasks. 

### Task 2 - Choose type of care

* `Starting from: Choose the type of care you need page`

* In your own words, what is this page asking you to choose?

* Is the information on this page what you expect it to be?
[//] What are you looking to answer with this question? This is really vague. Veterans will not have expectations about something they have not seen before. Recommend revising.  

If needed:
    * What other information would be helpful at this point in the process?
    * What are your options if your type of care isn’t listed?

* Before they tap “Continue”: What questions do you have on this page? 
[//] Recommend using "what questions do you have?" instead of "Do you have questions?". Veteran participants tend to be "pleasers" and may choose not to ask a question to keep the flow moving. Acknowledging that they probably DO have questions gives them the space to ask them. 

* If they haven’t clicked “Continue” : Continue scheduling your appointment.

### Task 3 - Choose where to receive care

* `Starting from: Choose where you want to receive care`

* In your own words, what is this page asking you?

* Is the information on this page what you expect it to be?
[//] What are you looking to answer with this question? This is really vague. Veterans will not have expectations about something they have not seen before. Recommend revising.  

* Follow up questions if needed:
    * Do you feel comfortable making the choice at this time?
    * Do you want more information about community care?
    * What other information would you need to make a choice? 
    
[//] Recommend not combining 2 questions into one. 

* Watch for:
    * How do they describe community care? 
    [//] I do not think you'll be getting that info with these questions. You WILL get questions they have about the choice between VA and community care.  

    
* Prompt: Schedule your appointment with a non-VA provider.


### Task 4 - Select an appointment time

* `Starting from: Select an appointment time`

* In your own words, what is this page asking you to do?

* Is the information on this page what you expect it to be?

* Prompt: Schedule your appointment for November 19th.

## Section 2 - Choose a provider

### Task 5 - Add a provider

* `Starting from: Initial provider selection screen`

* In your own words, what is this page asking you to do?

* Thinking about your previous experiences scheduling health care. How have you approached your search for a doctor? 
* What's important to you when searching for a health care provider?

    
* Follow up questions if needed:  
    * What questions do you have about this page?

    * If lost: click Add provider

### Task 6 - Choose a provider from a list

* In your own words, what is this page asking you?

[//] What are you looking to answer with this question? This is really vague. Veterans will not have expectations about something they have not seen before. Recommend revising.  

On the previous screen, you told me that ___ and ___ were critera you use to find a new provider. Are you seeing that information represented here? 
    * IF no: What is missing? 

If needed:
    * If you were searching for a health care provider for an appointment, would this be a useful way for you to find them?
[//] The phrasing on this question is priming them to say this is useful. Recommend revising.     

* What questions do you have about this page? 
    * What additional information would you want to have to continue?     
    
Watch for:
    * 'How' do they expect to look up providers - do they look for names/locations first?

### Task 8 - Remove a Provider

* `Starting from: Two providers added screen`

* Thinking again about how you have chosen health care providers in the past:
    * How does this differ from the way you have searched for a provider?

    * What do you think will happen when you complete this appointment request with two providers added?
