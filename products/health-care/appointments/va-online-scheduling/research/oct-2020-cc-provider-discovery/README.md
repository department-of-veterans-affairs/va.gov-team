## Background

The community care preferences page in the VA Online Scheduling app (VAOS) has a high dropoff rate<sup>1</sup>. On the current page, if the Veteran wants to enter a specific health care provider, they have to open the Facility Locator tool, manually copy the information there, and paste it back into the preferences page on VAOS. 

Our hypothesis was that if we improve the provider selection experience by allowing Veterans do find providers directly in VAOS:

*   The dropoff rate on that page will improve
*   Schedulers will have an easier time processing community care requests

In addition to community care provider selection, we briefly tested changes to the appointments list on the VAOS home page in anticipation of future work in this area.

## Methodology

We conducted 8 60-minute remote moderated sessions over 8 days, where we tested a prototype of the new provider selection flow and appointments list. We asked eight Veterans questions about their current experience scheduling health care appointments and their understanding of community care. Then we asked them to navigate through the clickable prototype of the VAOS app. 


## Participants

Not all of the 8 participants were able to conduct all portions of the proposed research. The end of the test, which focused in detail on the appointments list, was dropped from most sessions. But all Veterans gave us feedback on the provider selection features and the overview of the appointments list.

Most participants were familiar with scheduling appointments through MyHealtheVet or over the phone. All except one were familiar with community care.

In the findings section, the shorthand for participant response rate is:


*   Some = 2-3 (25-38%)
*   Half = 4 (50%)
*   Most = 5-7 (63-88%)


## Findings and recommendations


### Participants value personalization, availability, and location when choosing a Community Care provider

All participants were able to easily open the provider list and add multiple providers.

All participants wanted the list of providers to be more personalized. **The top request was to be able to schedule with providers they have seen in the past, or a specific provider they had researched/heard about.**

At the same time, some participants indicated that if they need routine care or urgent care they would be less picky about the provider. In these cases, availability is more important; they want to get into the appointment as quickly as possible. 

**For both cases, appointment availability was top of mind.** Most participants wanted to know how soon they could see the provider, or if the provider was available on specific dates. 

**Some participants expected that the date they entered into the calendar would be tied to the provider selection**, believing either that the providers shown were only available on those dates, or wondering why the calendar didn’t show after the provider was selected. But most expected that availability was not reflected in VAOS, and that they would need to call providers directly to get this information.

Some participants saw value in the ability to select multiple providers if it allowed them to see a doctor sooner. 

Participants liked knowing a provider’s distance, but **some wanted to see the provider list in alphabetical order so they could find someone who they already knew - either an existing provider, or one they had researched**. Also, most preferred seeing providers in the context of the list over the map. The map view only showed one provider's information at a time, where participants wanted to quickly scroll through the list to find a specific provider. Participants reported that they would find the map most useful for finding their way to the clinic on the day of the appointment.

**Most participants said they would spend time researching providers before reaching this step**, googling review sites to get a sense of the provider’s reputation. Some participants also mentioned they would like to see the provider’s gender, whether or not they accept VA billing, and if they were a doctor or physician’s assistant.

>   It says you can request 3 primary care providers but I would want to see my normal doctor that knows things about me, not different ones. - P2

>   It's hard to schedule with the same doctor even if you have seen them before. I would want to add someone I have seen before. - P3

>   If this is me getting a new doc, finding a provider is part of the process, annoying but part of it. If I just need care I shouldn't have to find my doctor. My expectation would be different for the two appointments. - P10

>   I don't want the VA to pick for me because I haven’t researched and I prefer to pick who I see - P2

>    Some doctors may not have anything open until February and one may have one by next week. Picking a doctor then their availability would be better. This seems hard to me. - P9

>   This is putting in my preferred doctors and dates but if it is urgent I would need to know who has the soonest availability - P2

>   If they gave me a list like this I would go on Google to see the reputation of the doctor. This is just a random list and doesn’t say much about anything. - P1

#### Recommendations



*   **Consider researching a provider-first approach** to the VAOS workflow that would support two paths for Veterans scheduling appointments; those who are returning to a provider, and those who want to find someone new.
*   **Let Veterans choose to make appointments based on those they have scheduled in the past**, using the same provider and type of care.
*   Validate that schedulers would be able to speed up the process of finding care if they had three provider options.
*   **Consider moving the calendar** to later in the request process, or removing it entirely for community care appointment requests. (Preliminary results from the community care scheduler research shows that schedulers aren’t looking at this data, though a round of follow up questions is needed to validate this).
*   Consider adding gender, job title, and some indication that the provider is VA approved to the provider list. These are nice-to-haves.
*   Focus on the list over the map for surfacing providers.


### Participants don’t trust the appointment scheduling process

All participants described problems with scheduling appointments in the past that caused them frustration with appointment scheduling, including long wait times, inconsistent messaging about appointment status, and appointments being cancelled or changed without a clear reason. **While it’s out of VAOS’ scope to solve all of these problems, it is worth noting them to help identify opportunities where we can clarify expectations.**

Turnaround time for booking an appointment was a major concern. **Most participants expected that scheduling online should be faster than scheduling over the phone.** One said that they would expect a phone call from a scheduler 30-45 minutes after requesting an appointment. 

Participants also reported frustration around slow or inconsistent communication. Some examples include:

*   Many appointment confirmation letters that come well after the appointment has been scheduled 
*   Notifications that aren’t updated when the appointment has changed
*   Lack of notification when an appointment was cancelled were a few examples mentioned

As in the [July Express Care research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/july-2020-user-research/2020-july-VAOSR-EC-research-report.md), **some participants did not understand they were requesting an appointment** until close to the end of the prototype. When they did realize this, they were frustrated, indicating that they would prefer to schedule over the phone because it’s faster.

#### Quotes

>   I am wasting my time. If I am going to fill this out and it tells me they will contact me. It makes more sense for me to call them and see what they have instead of filling out all of this then getting a “yes we have it” or “no we don’t.” - P11

>   Sometimes the community care will text but if it is the VA they send a secure message which isn’t updated for like 2 days. - P1

>   When I scheduled online (through MHE) - they give you 3 days of options, time screen, then no one gave me a call back. Then out of the blue they called me and they left me a message saying they noticed I wanted to schedule it. I had her number and went through the same thing then maybe 4 days later I was able to talk to her and told her I need to renew my prescriptions. - P5.

>   Schedule online? No, typically I end up calling the local clinic. I switched VA locations a year and a half ago. The new location is more up to speed with electronic things but the previous was the weeks for a response to secure messaging. - P10

>   This doesn’t even tell me when the VA will contact me, what if it was urgent like me being in pain. I have to call 911 or go to the ER. I don’t even know when the VA will call me. - P2

>   If I am scheduling online I would like them to send the change to me, I would make the assumptions that I wouldn’t get a call or letter notifying me. - P3

#### Recommendations: Set better expectations around appointment requests and availability

*   On the entry pages, **communicate the value of requesting an appointment over VAOS vs. over the phone**. Explain the choices simply, and lay them out as distinct alternatives.
*   **If possible, provide a rough estimate of the time** it is expected to take for common scenarios, like a scheduler following up on an appointment request, or completing a scheduling request online vs. over the phone.
*   Consistently **notify veterans when an appointment has changed** across all touchpoints (email, text, online services.). Use the same language everywhere the notification is shown. 


### Participants need specific information to identify and prepare for their appointments

All participants were able to find and review the list of appointments on the first screen of the prototype. We were not able to test drilling down into an appointment as this part of the test was dropped due to time constraints.

Date and location (either physical or online) was most important to participants. **The name of the facility or clinic would help them plan ahead leading up to the appointment.** Most reported that department information would be helpful as well; Veterans who have mobility issues need to know how far they will have to travel once in the hospital, as even an extra flight of stairs can add significant time getting to an appointment.

Finally, **type of care is necessary for differentiating appointments from one another.** Some appointments are scheduled months in advance and, in a long list, type of care is the best way to differentiate these. Some participants indicated that the doctor’s name was not helpful at all, and one who works in healthcare told us that many Veterans don’t know their doctors name. 

#### Quotes

>   The VA in my city has multiple clinics and hospitals. If I have 3 appointments in one month I wouldn’t remember where to go or what it is for. - P3

>   Is it a video meeting, private doctor, or hospital? There’s no other information beside date, time, and name of person to be seen. - P4

>   The type of appointment is important so you know what to be prepared for because some can be in the same area but others you may need to get lab work so it is good to know why you are there. - P11

#### Recommendations

*   Display date and time, facility name, and **type of care** in the appointment cards. Let users drill down for detailed location, departmental and other information.


## Notes



1. 78% of Veterans abandoned the app on the community care preferences page between October 1 and December 3 2020
