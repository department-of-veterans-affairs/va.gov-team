# Research Plan for VAOS Community Care Discovery, October 2020

*Problem:* As a veteran, I would like the VAOS app to automatically find community care providers closest to my residential address and auto populate the providers I've selected into the VAOS provider fields so I don't have to manually enter or copy-paste this information.

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

	This research is for the VA Online Scheduling (VAOS) team.

2. Background 	

	VAOS allows veterans to request health care appointments at VAMCs or with providers in their community if the veteran meets certain eligibility requirements. 	We expect that veterans use VAOS to find a health care provider and request their first appointment. Then they will schedule follow-up appointments directly with the provider.
	
	Currently, veterans who want to use a specific provider have to first find them in the Facility Locator tool, copy the provider's contact information and paste it back into the scheduling tool.
	
	Additionally, the [Express Care research study of July 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/july-2020-user-research/2020-july-VAOSR-EC-research-report.md) found that veterans struggled to find appointments in the current UI.

	The provider selection prototype is designed to support the following goals:
  	* Help veterans request community care appointments by letting them search for providers directly in VAOS.
  	* Help Veterans choose whether to go to a VAMC or find a provider in their community
  	* Make it clear to Veterans that they can opt out of choosing a provider.
  	* Decrease the amount of time it takes veterans to schedule a community care appointment when selecting a provider.
  	* Help veterans find their requested appointments.

3. Research questions:
	* Do veterans understand the difference between community care and VA care
	* Can veterans easily find providers?
  	* Is it easier to find providers on the map or list?
  	* Is it clear what skipping the step of adding a provider means?
  	* Are there other ways veterans expect to be able to find a provider?
  	* Can veterans find their requested pending appointments?
  
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?
  	* Veterans will be able to understand the difference between VA care and community care.
  	* It will be easy for veterans to choose a provider.
	* Veterans will clearly see the value of selecting multiple providers.
  	* Veterans will be able to easily find appointments they requested and scheduled.
	
## Method	
1. What method of research are you planning? 	

	This is a remote, moderated usability study. We'll ask participants to go through a clickable prototype.
  		
2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?

	Having veterans complete tasks in a clickable prototype will help us understand how easily they're able to find the information they're looking for, and gain insight into how they would go about looking for information they can't find. The presence of a moderator will allow us to ask follow-up questions and guide the participant through the tasks.
	
## Participants and Recruitment	
1. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
