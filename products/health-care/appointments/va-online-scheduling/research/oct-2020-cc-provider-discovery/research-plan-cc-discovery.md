# Research Plan for VAOS Community Care Discovery, October 2020 [DRAFT]

*Problem:* As a veteran, I would like the VAOS app to automatically find community care providers closest to my residential address and auto populate the providers I've selected into the VAOS provider fields so I don't have to manually enter or copy-paste this information.

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
	This research is for the VA Online Scheduling (VAOS) team.

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

	VAOS allows veterans to schedule health care appointments at VAMCs, or with providers in their community if the veteran meets certain eligibility requirements. Currently veterans communicate their preferred providers by finding them in the Facility Location tool, copying the provider's contact information and pasting it back into the scheduling tool.

	The provider selection prototype is designed to support the following goals:
  	* Help veterans schedule community care appointments by letting them search for providers directly in VAOS.
  	* Help Veterans understand their type of care options, whether a VAMC or Community Care.
  	* Make it clear to Veterans that they can opt out of choosing a provider.
  	* Decrease the amount of time it takes veterans to schedule a community care appointment when selecting a provider.
  	* Help veterans find their pending appointments.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

	* Is it easy to understand the difference between community care and VA care
	* Can veterans easily find providers?
  	* Is it easier to find providers on the map or list?
  	* Is it clear what skipping the step of adding a provider means?
  	* Are there other ways veterans expect to be able to find a provider?
  	* Can veterans find their requested pending appointments?
  
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?

  	* Veterans will be able to understand the type of care options presented.
  	* It will be easy for veterans to choose a provider.
  	* Veterans will be able to complete the scheduling process without outside support.
	
## Method	
1. What method of research are you planning? 	

	We're planning on doing a remote, moderated usability study. We'll ask participants to go through a clickable prototype.
  		
2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?

	Having veterans complete tasks in a clickable prototype will help us understand how easily they're able to find the information they're looking for, and gain insight into how they would go about looking for information they can't find. The presence of a moderator will allow us to ask follow-up questions and guide the participant through the tasks.
	
## Participants and Recruitment	
1. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

	* 5-8 Veterans
	* Generally matching the typical demographic breakdown of veterans
	* Familiarity with community care is not required
	* To ensure inclusivity, we request at least one participant that has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism, and Vertigo. Other conditions may be autism, aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-

1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

**TBD**

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)	

We will ask Perigean to recruit veterans for this study.

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.)

**TBD**

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

**TBD**

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

< 1 hour

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.

**TBD**

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?

**TBD**

## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker**
