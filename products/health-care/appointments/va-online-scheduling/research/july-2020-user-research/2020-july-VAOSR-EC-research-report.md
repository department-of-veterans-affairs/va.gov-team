# VA Online Scheduling: VAOSR and "Express Care" Research Report

## Research Process

### Research focus

This user research and usability test focused on two products under the health care and scheduling umbrella, under development by the Digital Experience and Product Office (DEPO) at VA: VA Online Scheduling Request (VAOSR) and Express Care.

#### VAOSR

The VAOSR MVP has been in production and live on [VA.gov](VA.gov) since March 2020. Since it's launch, the tool has provided users the ability to submit feedback as well as captured data through Google Analytics. From these data sources and based on the timing of the tool being accessible to users, DEPO's team determined another round of user research and usability testing with Veterans was necessary. 

This research, in July 2020, focused on areas in the experience that we determined (through the aforementioned analytics and user feedback) are confusing or need iteration. Additionally, we wanted to collect general feedback and requests from Veterans for additional feature considerations for VAOSR, to be implemented in the future. This feedback from Veterans about feature requests is also helpful to validate current assumptions about DEPO's VAOSR product development backlog, to ensure the product is being designed with users, not for them. 

#### Express Care

In [May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/express-care-research/2020-may-research/express-care-research-report.md), DEPO conducted user research and usability testing for a new care offering - Express Care. The research focused on understanding when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent", "immediate", and "now" through VA digital channels. This previous research also allowed us to learn from Veterans if they were aware of and would seek urgent, same-day, Telehealth care from VA for a COVID-19 screening, if they were experiencing symptoms.

The research conducted in July 2020 aimed to iterate on what we learned in the previous research study, in order to build and launch a product, immediately, on [VA.gov](VA.gov), incorporating feedback provided by users in the initial round of research, as well as new features and considerations from stakeholders. 

### Research methodology

For this study, we conducted remote moderated usability research and usability testing. Veterans were asked questions related to their current habits around scheduling medical appointments with VA providers. Next, Veterans were directed to a specific page on [VA.gov](VA.gov) with content about scheduling appointments online. From here, Veterans were asked to interact with VAOSR by logging into their accounts on [VA.gov](VA.gov), granting them access to the tool. Veterans were asked their opinion about their account and the information presented upon logging in and accessing their appointments page and navigating through the information. Finally, Veterans were asked to schedule and cancel an appointment using the tool, if possible and as necessary. 

After familiarizing with VAOSR, Veterans were asked general questions about Express Care, which were the same as the previous round of research ([May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/express-care-research/2020-may-research/express-care-research-report.md)). Veterans were shown and asked to interact with a mid-fidelity, clickable prototype of the Express Care concept for [VA.gov](VA.gov). This research primarily focused on feedback around changes made to process of making an Express Care request and the content presented when doing so. 

### Who we talked to

DEPO conducted 15 60-minute remote research sessions over nine days. Not all users were able to conduct all portions of the proposed research. The majority of Veterans were able to complete the research in full (9; 60%). However, some Veterans were unable to log into their account on [VA.gov](VA.gov) to access VAOSR, either due to system outages or personal account access issues. 

Towards the end of the research effort, an update was made to the Express Care prototype. As a result, one (7%) Veteran tested a revised prototype for Express Care. Additionally, questions were also added to "Section 0: Warm-up questions", in order to learn more about Veterans' mental model to apply to the appointment scheduling/request flow. Two Veterans (13%) were asked these questions and were not shown the Express Care prototype.

A full breakdown of participant session coverage and their demographics are below:

* 9 (60%): Full research (VAOSR and Express Care v1)
* 1 (7%): VAOSR only
* 2 (13%): Express Care v1 only
* 1 (7%): Express Care v2 only
* 2 (13%): VAOSR only and additional scheduling questions

## Findings & Recommendations Overview

### Findings 

**Overall, both VAOSR and Express Care were well received by most of the Veterans who interacted with each product, respectively.** Taking into account the fact that there were several Veterans that only interacted with one or the other and/or different iterations of the Express Care prototype, both products were generally usable and made sense to Veterans. Only one Veteran who interacted with the Express Care prototype did not understand the concept. 

However, there were a number of significant challenges presented in both experiences. **Veterans expressly stated that had they not been participating in a research session, able to ask questions, and had someone to provide assistance and guidance through either a hypothetical task or a task they were interested in completing, that they would have given up attempting to use the respective tool, opting to call their provider to complete the task, or more realistically, given up entirely.** 

In addition to, and likely contributing to their difficulty in completing their tasks, Veterans struggled significantly with understanding both VAOSR and Express Care, conceptually. **Most notably, Veterans stated a significant frustration upon initiating scheduling a request in VAOSR, only to learn and/or realize after interacting with VAOSR that the tool does not *actually* complete the scheduling request. Veterans indicated this to be especially frustrating since content throughout VAOSR and on VA.gov referred to the tool consistently as a self-scheduling option.** _(Note: Self-scheduling is an option in VAOS, however currently that option is disabled due to COVID. Even when enabled, the option to self-schedule is limited based on site configuration.)_ Likewise, when interacting with the first version of the Express Care prototype, Veterans read the service warning and consent information as what Express Care *could*  provide, rather than the alternative. 

Despite this frustration, 10 of the thirteen (3 participants did not interact with VAOSR) participants stated they would utilize VAOSR in the future to attempt to request/schedule an appointment with their VA medical provider in the future, now that they are aware of the option (none of the participants who participated in this research previously used VAOSR or were aware of this tool on VA.gov).

**To summarize, Veterans were content overall with the product improvements, indicating that a self-service option was by-in-large preferable to their current method for scheduling an appointment, even though VAOSR did not result in a scheduled appointment, today. Additionally, of those participants who interacted with Express Care, most were extremely interested in utilizing this service,** not only during the current pandemic, but under ordinary circumstance when in need of treatment, rather than seeking an appointment from a VA medical provider, or going through private insurance, as VA often takes too long and isn't timely enough for treatment of a common cold, for example. 

## Research Findings & Recommendations

In the section below, findings and recommendations are explored in greater depth, citing specific improvements, broadly as well as specific recommendations for the respective products, VAOSR and Express Care. 

#### Content

> "The more I answer here the less the person that calls will ask. That way they don't need to call, so I can do it all on the computer." - *Participant 10*

> "I don't read all the text....If I were doing this, I don't know if I would get to this spot because its all the way down there." - *Participant 12*

> "I can't make routine appointments, but I can make an urgent appointment. Only requesting appointments online. That's what it says. Isn't that where I am already at?" - *Participant 15*, referencing COVID warning on scheduling screen 

**Content presented the biggest burden to all users.** Veterans indicated excessive trouble understanding, parsing through, and comprehending the information presented to them. For both experiences (VAOSR and Express Care), **Veterans indicated not only was the amount of content a burden, but the variation throughout the content used to describe the same information difficult for them to manage.** 

Content about scheduling on [VA.gov](VA.gov) and throughout the tools and services on the platform are designed with Veterans. However, Veterans repeatedly expressed concerns in these research sessions about their constraints when interacting with the information online, due to a variety of factors, often including (but not limited to): PTSD, effects of combat-related injuries or conditions, technical ability, and/or age. **Additionally, Veterans said that there is too much, albeit helpful, content, which contributes to and creates a sense of overload when they were interacting with both VAOSR and Express Care.** For example, Veterans said the content on the subway map page for Express Care was important, made sense, and they understood that for emergency situations, they should proceed. This emergency content made several users think Express Care is intended for emergency care, despite reading a description of Express Care on the previous screen and identifying it as not for emergencies.  

Further confusion and frustration was created by content for Veterans when interacting with VAOSR, in particular. **The content advertises the tool as an online scheduler, however, in most cases, Veterans can only make appointment requests in VAOSR. Veterans did not see a significant value in using VAOSR over their current method for scheduling an appointment (i.e. - calling the scheduling line or their provider's office directly, contacting their provider using Secure Messaging, or using MyHealth*e*Vet), due to VAOSR mostly enalbing appointment requests only, not an actual appointment scheduling tool.** Most participants recognized a discrepancy in the terminology used for the tool they interacted with to "Schedule an Appointment" on [VA.gov](VA.gov). Throughout the process, as the users interacted with the tool and periodically read through the content, they began to recognize that they outcome would not be a scheduled appointment, but an appointment request. 

***Recommendations:*** 

- VAOSR and Express Care content must be audited and tested with Veterans for consistency of voice, tone, and vocabulary throughout the products.
- VAOSR and Express Care content must be audited and tested with Veterans for readability and comprehension.
- VAOSR and Express Care content must be audited and tested with Veterans for understanding, accuracy, and consistency of information throughout their experience.
- VAOSR and Express Care content must be updated to include critical information to allow Veterans the information they need to make informed decisions.  
- VAOSR content must accurately describe VAOSR and the actions the tool allows the Veteran to accomplish both in promotion and throughout app flow.
- Express Care content must be updated to reflect process for requesting this appointment type.

****Note:*** **all Veterans during these research sessions said that it was unusual for them to spend as much time as they were reading content. Some also acknowledged they would likely give up or not get as far along in the process as they did had they not been in the research session.** If this were the case, they said they would give up and call their provider's office or the scheduling line to complete their request. 

#### Context

> "They were cancelled for me. I didn't cancel them." - *Participant 11*

Similar to content, providing context shapes a Veteran's understanding of the product or service they are interacting with and that experience determines their desire to use it in the future. Context comes through in the form of wayfinding, information, repeated and recognized patterns, and features that are developed closely alongside of the user. In this study, Veterans were asked to provide their opinions and feedback about the information provided on appointment cards about upcoming and previous appointments, how their appointments were displayed in their appointments list, the statuses of these appointments, and other indicators they may or may not have noticed or identified. Additionally, Veterans were asked to provide feedback about categorization and filtering of information on their appointments within their account, how the current format served them, and how it may work better. 

**All participants who were asked about appointment cancellations (60% total participants) said cancellations functioned as anticipated, were able to find this option, and were able cancel their appointment (if they chose to do so) with ease. However, there was significant concern expressed about *who* and *why* their appointments were cancelled.**  

Additionally, Veterans indicated dissatisfaction with the information presented on appointment cards when viewing upcoming and past appointments. **Participants said, much like the scheduling process, confusion when viewing a number of appointments in their account and attempting to discern which appointment was which.** 

***Recommendations:***

- **Iterate on appointment card design to include additional details about each appointment, to include: date, provider, location, type of care, status, type of appointment.** 
- Consider reducing the size of each appointment cards, displaying imperative information in list view, with more details displayed upon expansion.
- **Make indicators, such as color and icons more prominent and recognizable throughout the system.**
- **Iterate on appointment page to include sorting and filtering options when viewing appointment lists, based on additional details incorporated into appointment cards (date, provider, location, type of care, status, type of appointment).**
- **Add additional details to appointment cards for cancelled appointments, to include: who cancelled the appointment, the reason for cancellation, and when the appointment was cancelled.**
- **Incorporate vaccinations, preventative treatments, and other appointments and treatments covered by the VA (non-VA medical providers), into appointment lists.**

#### "Scheduling an appointment" flow (VAOSR)

> "I thought they would already know who I see, like when picking the location." - *Participant 10*

> "I like that in addition to primary care there is a lot of special stuff....I figured primary care would be there, but the options are really good. When I see these options I am encouraged." - *Participant 12*

> I would say its not worth it an ideal with my issue because who knows how long I will be on hold for. When I have time and potions I would call. - *Participant 12*

> "Going through this scheduling set up might reduce time on the phone. ...For how big the VA is I am happy with this ability. ...I like it more than I don't." - *Participant 12*

> "Basically for this kind of an appointment I am better off calling because it says they will call me back for an appointment. When I get the appointment right away, but doing this way it says they will contact for me for an appointment. It doesn't make sense. ...I might as well pick up the phone and make my appointment because at least I have it [scheduled] right then." - *Participant 14*

**Overall, Veterans navigated the "scheduling an appointment" flow with ease.** However, several encountered significant problems with aspects of the process, most notably: selecting a location, choosing a type of care, providing details about their appointment, selecting a date/time and submitting their request. 

**The most difficult points in the process and the step that most participants said they would have given up with the task was choosing a location. Every Veteran participant that interacted with VAOSR (12; 80%) had more than one VAMC affiliated with their account and 100% of these Veterans struggled to select the location where they wanted to schedule an appointment.** 

***Recommendations:***

- **Reevaluate process for the request an appointment flow to align with a user's mental model.** Focus areas should include: selecting an appointment type/type of care, choosing a location for the appointment, utilizing existing appointments as templates to pre-fill a new appointment request, incorporating logic to reason for appointment to narrow down type of care/appointment, based on medical necessity. 
  - See [Rescheduling (and scheduling) options](#rescheduling-and-scheduling-options) for additional considerations.
- Conduct additional user research to validate changes made based on this round of user research.
- **Consider reordering types of care list and/or provide a definition of each type of care listed. Many Veterans struggled to select the appropriate type of care based on their need, defaulting to primary care.** 
- **Iterate existing design for VA location-selection process in VAOSR.** Alternatively (ideal), reevaluate the overall process for the request an appointment flow to include additional ways to select the location of an appointment, such as type of care, provider, and visit type.
  - Concept: Simplify the process of selecting a location by including the city and state of the facility in the initial list.
  - Concept: Allow Veteran to set a preferred facility/location in their profile, which will be the default location selected in the appointment request flow.  
  - Concept: Use search functionality to allow Veteran to search for the location to request an appointment at. Example search parameters may include: city, state, facility name, or zip code. It may also be helpful to allow Veterans to search for a facility based on their provider's name, selecting the location based on their care team.
- **On calendar selection page, add "next" button at bottom of calendar. Consider dynamic content for "next" button, replacing "next" with the following month name, for additional context.**
- On calendar section page, provide content defining "AM" and "PM" to inform the decision a Veteran makes. For example, if an AM appointment is anything prior to noon, the calendar page should clarify. 
- **Iterate on design of reason for appointment request to include different/more specific options based on the type of care selected at start of request flow.** 

#### Rescheduling (and scheduling) options

> "It was easier than what I thought...It was easier than making the appointment, it was easier to cancel it." - *Participant 14*

**When performing tasks related to cancelling appointments, most Veterans testing VAOSR identified a need to be able to reschedule appointments more easily.** The current tool only allows for cancelling appointments, which must be rescheduled by going through the full request an appointment flow again. Additionally, many Veterans cited that their primary need for medical care are recurring and/or annual visits, which precludes them from using alternative scheduling methods, beyond scheduling appointments they need in person at their previous appointment. 

Veterans specifically identified a gap in the scheduling tool's functionality to allow them to request an appointment with their existing provider or based on previous appointments. Incorporating the ability to schedule an appointment based on previous visits or utilize past appointments as a template for future scheduling requests would make VAOSR a viable option to many more Veterans seeking an appointment. 

***Recommendations:***

- Create, test with Veterans, and implement the ability to reschedule and/or request a new appointment based on an appointment the Veteran already has scheduled/had in the past.
- Redesign the request an appointment flow to allow for more flexibility and dynamic ways to schedule an appointment, including using upcoming and past appointments as templates for new appointments and to reschedule cancelled appointments.
