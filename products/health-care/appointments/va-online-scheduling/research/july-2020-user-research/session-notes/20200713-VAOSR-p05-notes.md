## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I recordmy screen the audio as we talk today?** 
  >Yes. 

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 
  >I call, currently I guess just talk to my PMC. I just call them. It is just annoying because with eh VA you can’t just call your doctor like the normal doctor. At the VA you call then it transfers to a nurse that doesn’t answer and they might call in a few days. I have had to deal with this all today. I am supposed to have on in DC at 8am on Wednesday but no one communicates the VA is all jacked up. 
- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online?  
  > You know recently someone sent it to me and I am assuming it is through myhealthevet but I have not used it. 
  - If NO:
    - What would convince you to try it? 
      > If it is easier then actually communicating to the people. It would eb something if it were easier. IF we had pertinent information, there are limits on myhealthevet and I don’t even know which is which. They will send reminders and at the end of the day I wont even know what is happening. 

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments
Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information: 
  > It looks like schedule and view VA appointments online. Where is this on the VA.gov site and how do I even get to this point honestly. I have been on the Va site. Most of the time I go to ebenefits or myhealthevet directly. I can’t even tell you when I have gone to va.gov for something other than general information on the VA. 
  - Last time you entered va.gov: 
    > I don’t know months ago. Easily ,maybe even more than that. I defiantly have not been there. This I a military page and it is the ebenfits and myhealth evet. That is my military stuff and that’s it I don’t even see va. 
  - Follow up questions: 
    - Have you seen this page before? 
      > I have not seen this page. It used to have a ridiculous amount of information and use to only be information. It is more streamline now. 
    - What do you think about this page?
  - Can you log in to your account from here? 
    > So you can sign in with the DS login
- Follow up questions, once logged in:
  - Can you see where you the appointments. 
    > Here I can view, cancel, or schedule an appointment so I can click here I imagine. 
  - Have you seen or used this tool before? 
    > Never in my life. 
  - Can you tell me what happened? 
    > I have an appointment on Wednesday and its not even on here for the 15th at 8am. This was an appointment setup last week for in persona at Walter reed. My complaint was that I never received anything for the appointment but she verified that it is correct so my question is where is my appointment. Again when someone called me, no one has ever called for it and these appointments for tomorrow are all for Wednesday. They just made theses this morning when I talked to them. This is part of the VA’s problem. I have confirmation but no information for the appointment, I was supposed to get information but I have not yet. They just told me about them today and those look right. I can join the session right from here, this is much more friendly but there is a lack on information. Like whom is the video connect with. I don’t see anything that would tell me, do you. It just ells me how to access it and that it is a video connect and to confirm it. Others have a bit of information but I have no idea who it is so I would have to search who that is so I know what appointment it is. I can see it is video connect with Holgun but who is it with. I think it is coming but it would be chiropractor. Please tell me who I am with because look at all of these. Unless I know them like my PMC but like Holgun I don’t know who that is. I know the ones I went to but I don’t know theses. I would like to know who the appointment is with and I would like to know who the appointment is with. It gives you no information. This on has the July 16th email, it came today at 144 am. It says Martinsburg but doesn’t provide anymore information but the other ones confirming appointments and they don’t tell me anything. It shows that the system but does not have the information. This one again it is not there and it is from the VA.  That right there is the biggest problem and the distrust because I would miss my appointment if I trusted the system I would have missed that appointment and that would be a problem. Some of them if you miss they will stop paying your compensation. 

## Section 2: Appointments list
We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 
- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page.
  - What do you think of this page?
    - Prompts:
      - What information can you find here?
      - What do you like about it?
      - What don't you like about it? Is there anything that you find confusing?
  - Most important information for trust: 
    > That the appointment is on there and its not, that would be number one. Even though I received information from the VA today its not on there and whose Holgun, is he with my neurologist or counselor. I don’t know. The actual department would be needed information. 
- [Appointment list] Let's take a look at the appointment list.  
  > I would imagine if it is there it would be confirmed. It seems redundant that it is there and in the past appointments. I guess if there is a different status such as planned or confirmed. 

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today?
  - If YES: 
    > I would like to get a prosthetic appointment for my leg to get a show insert. 
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you do. You may be able to cancel the appointment using the tool. However, some locations don't allow for cancellations online. If this is the case, our team will help you with the cancellation after this session if that is ok with you. 
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment? 
  - Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
    > Yes I guess. I assume they are facilities I have gone to at some point or that are in the area I am. I was stationed in sandier and I don’t have a reason to go there not. The other ones are where I am not and one is in NY and the other one I have no clue where it is. I don’t have an amputation and they would ask why I am there because I have both of my legs. They might not let me get what I need done there. I could get in there in a week, I can see my primary care for like a month. Is this up to date, I would hope it would be but when they called me a few days ago they could have me come in during august so why can’t I be seen prior
    > Reasons I have a new medical issue. Click telehealth. They can call me whenever. Then review appointment is a snapshot of the appointment and what it looks like. Look at that it is pending. 
  - Makes sense to you that it was to request an appointment: 
    > Yes but then my questions would be if you are looking at the appointments you have the confirmed ones but what is the purpose if you don’t see the pending. Yes I see it. Maybe it would be in line with the date verse at the end. 
  - Why isn’t it in line: 
    > It is not confirmed but due to having the colors it can just be in line. I have PTSD. If I am frustrated I would just think the VA sucks. If I have 10-15 appointments confirmed I will never see that. 
  - Do you see a way to filter it: 
    > No
  - How would you like to view them: 
    > By date would be the most obvious, location or by provider are other ways to sort them. Date is good, less is more when it comes to veterans so it being in line makes sense. It being at the bottom doesn’t make sense. So yeah. 

## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel today?
  - If YES: 

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype
Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:
- Have you heard of "Express Care"? 
  > NO
  - If NO: 
    - What do you think it might be? 
      > Getting care quickly. Getting care on the same day health care apparently. 

Now we're going to look at a prototype: [Express Care Prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens)
- [EC landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
- Imagine you want to make an appointment to be seen for a bothersome cough *today*, how would you make an appointment for that?  
  > I feel like you can request the express care screening.  This is one of those informational pages if you’re going to kill yourself call this or if it is an emergency call this. 
  - Is that what you expected to happen? 
    - Why / why not?
- [EC request / consent landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011177) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > There are a lot of words.
  - What might make it easier: 
    > Just like again I have to understand it is not just millennials but it might be important for the older veterans but is seems unnecessary information but I could see it being needed for individuals not computer savvy. 
  - Bold letters make sense: 
    > Sure. 
  - What would you do: 
    > this is tell them that I can use express care if it is reading it in this formation. It is not the easiest, maybe bullets on the side like over on how to get help for emergencies. I guess what you can use it for over here may be the easiest since you are asking right here what you want to do. I want to request a screening, tells us about your health concerns. Then you are finished. 
  - Appointment pages as before: 
    > I guess again the same deal. Maybe an idea of what your express care and like these I had prior. It shows you what is escalated or in progress. Maybe I have to see a specialist or if in progress I am in the appointment now. I feel like if it is escalated it is still in progress because I need more assists. I don’t know what in progress is unless I am still at the appointment or if it is an ongoing thing but that would be a different appointment. 
  - Other feedback: 
    > Other than express care no. Is express care an appointment today like I get to talk to someone today. I guess, yes but I don’t know. It seems like it is a virtual ER or setting me up to go. I would need to know where I would do this like call me at tell me where like DC. I guess I don’t know what express care really is with the VA because I have never heard of it. 

## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes
- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov?
  - Why / why not?
- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were inneed of an appointment, today?
  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus?
- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  
  > Nope, it seems pretty straightforward. It is nice I can see the appointments but the problem is that it is missing and it doesn’t give me the confidence to use the system and that I will not miss an appointment. 

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
- If YES: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
