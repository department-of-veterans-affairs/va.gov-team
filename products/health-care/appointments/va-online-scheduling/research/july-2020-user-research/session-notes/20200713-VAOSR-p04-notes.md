## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**  
    > Sure, yeah. 

*Start recording.* 

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I recordmy screen the audio as we talk today?** 
  > Yes. 

## Section 0: Warm-up questions
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 
  > Usually they schedule them for me so I go to my yearly appointment unless there is a problem. I would usually call my VA office and they schedule the appointment for me.
- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of yourVA providers, online? 
  > No
  - If NO:
    - Have you ever considered scheduling a VA appointment online? 
      > Sure, if I knew how. 

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments
Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

  > I see schedule view va appointments, track prescriptions, few lab results and order hearing aid. My last appointment was online so I am familiar with this. 
  > Virtual: I would guess but because of COVID they are just doing online.

    - Have you seen this page before?
    - What do you think about this page?
- Can you log in to your account from here? 
  > If I remember what my account is. (Attempts login with ID.me) it is redirecting me to the site now. Now it wants me to login but I don’t know my login ID. I have used MyHealtheVet to login.

      - What did you come here to do?
      - Were you able to accomplish that task?

## Section 2: Appointments list
We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 
- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page.
- What do you think of this page? 
  > Just upcoming appointments, past appointments. That’s about it. 
  - What don't you like about it? Is there anything that you find confusing? 
    > It looks fine to me; it is pretty self-explanatory. No, it looks fine. 
  - Is there anything that you think may be missing? 
    > No this I just my yearly appointment I go to so, then past appointments. Yeah pretty self-explanatory. 
- [Appointment list] Let's take a look at the appointment list. 
  - Prompts:
    - What do you think about the order of your appointments? 
      > It just looks like it is in chronological  order so its fine to me. 
    - Can you find past appointments on this page?
    - Are you able to change how your appointments are sorted? 
      > I don’t believe so I think it is just chronically.
  - Would you want to: 
    > No it looks fine to me. 
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today? Umm not really. 
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you do. You may be able to cancel the appointment using the tool. However, some locations don't allow for cancellations online. If this is the case, our team will help you with the cancellation after this session if that is ok with you. 
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment?  
  > Yeah the tab right here. Click it. 
- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > Just asks what type of care I need (reads list). 
    - What do you think of this page? 
      > It looks pretty much like everything is there. 
      - Prompts:
        - What information can you find here?
        - What do you like about it?
        - What don't you like about it? Is there anything that you find confusing?
        - Is there anything that you think may be missing? 
          >Yeah maybe primary care should be broken down more. Say like podiatry or something like that. Maybe primary care is broken into 4 categories such as like podiatry, I am not a good case because I don’t have much wrong with me. They have eye on there. Maybe blood test or something like that, lab work, or lab work education. I read my own blood tests even fi the doctor tells me so maybe some education on blood tests. 
  - *Select a location page*
    - If a user is registered at 2+ VAMCs, ask: do you recognize these locations in the list? Do you know what it means? 
      > Yeah I have two options, I don’t know what Bruce cater is but the other one I have been two. 
      - Why do you have two options: 
        > I don’t know, I normally go to my local on in Palm Desert so maybe you can’t do appointments online there. I normally just call in. It is in Miami FL and I was there about 20 years ago. 
      - Is the name one that resonates with you: 
        > yeah that is the hospital. 
      - Location helpful: 
        > Yeah. Definitively. Yeah. Maybe have that in the original clicking.  
      - What are the other locations: 
        > One is Blythe, Loma Linda, and Redlands. I have not been to Blythe before. 
      - Difference in clinic and Hospital: 
        > Not really but I assume hospital is the bigger one. I would pick the Jerry Petties Memorial Hospital. *Keep clicking.* Basically gives a day and time to pick for the appointment, it just has July and august but I assume I can go down farther. It proves three dates to pick, August 10th. 
      - What is the Am vs PM appointment: Morning vs afternoon.
        > Times: Am I assume is 8 to 12. PM is probably 1 to 4. 
      - Anywhere it tells you here: 
        > No. 
     	  > I selected three dates now Then it asks why I need the appointment (reads choices). *Requests an appointment for mental health. Clicks continue.* It is self-explanatory and easy. Provides options (reads options) chooses Video connect the way things are now.  It provides contact information and best time to call along with my email. It provides the review of my appointment requests, the dates I select. I can either request it or cancel it. 
      - Since you chose telehealth, does it make sense to pick it at that time: 
        > Yes I have done one before and it is helpful.
      - Provided the option earlier or later since you had to pick a location: 
        > No I think it is good where it is at. 
        > It says it has been submitted and I would probably get an email or call asking me which day I wanted. 
  - Other feedback: 
    > No it is easy and self-explanatory. 

## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel today?
  - If YES: 
    - Great, let's try to cancel it.
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you want to cancel and walk through the process OR cancel the appointment request you made if you don't need it.
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment? Yes I see the tab to cancel so you see show more option: 
  >Yes
  - Helpful: 
    >Yeah, just basic contact information.  
  - Walk me through how you'd cancel this appointment
    - Click cancel, what happens? 
      > I would click the cancel appointment tab. I expect a popup page asking if I actually want to cancel it. Yes cancel this appointment. Your appointment ahs been canceled. It is pretty easy. 
  - If can cancel online:
    - What do you think of this? Really easy and self-explanatory. 
  - Do you see it still: 
    > Lets see if it changes now, It is still showing up there but shows cancelled. 
  - How do you feel: 
    > That’s fine, I don’t have a problem with that.
    > Information it shows cancelled and turned red, helpful: Yes definitely. 
  - Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? 
    > No it is pretty self-explanatory. 
  - Now that you see the different status; can you talk to me about the different status they have and if they make sense: 
    > I think the green is confirmed and the red for cancelled is good. It is easy to tell what it is. 
  - How about where it says cancelled or confirmed along with the information: 
    > Pretty self-explanatory.
  - Anything else that would be helpful: 
    > No not really. 
  - Past appointments information: 
    > Yeah pretty much the same.  Maybe for the complete, what kind of appointment it was. Maybe if it was general health, specialty. Something like that. I have a few here. A few completed, a few cancelled. This provides more information, primary care, I had a produce and it is easy to remember what it is. It is pretty easy to remember what they were. 
    - Did you notice it says va appointment: 
      > I think it means it is an appointment at the VA.
    - Expect it to say anything else: 
      > Not really, it has the location and that helps me. 
      > If it says community care would that stand out to you: Yeah, it has here minor procedure, check in, the doctors names. It is pretty self-explanatory.
    - Help to see it a VA appointment or community care appointment: 
      > Yes, definitely.
  - Other thoughts: 
    > No, it looks fine.  

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype
Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:
- Have you heard of "Express Care"? No I haven’t. 
  - If NO: 
    - What do you think it might be? 
      >Probably something you don’t need to go to the ER but need an appointment quick. I assume the VA can’t get you in so you need to go somewhere else. 
      - Where might it be: 
        > I don’t know I have been trying to find out and no one at the VA seems to know.
    - Prompt, if needed: do you think it is for an in-person or virtual appointment? 
      > Probably in person but with COVID probably an online thing.
    - Telehealth with VA how was it schedule: 
      > it was one of my yearly appointment and they told me it would be teleconference.
      - Experience: 
        > it went fine. 
      - Would you do it again: 
        > Sure, yeah. If you have more serious injury I can see where the problem would me. 

Now we're going to look at a prototype: [Express Care Prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens)
- [EC landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > I see the new appointment and request Express care screening. 
  - Does it clarify: 
    > Yeah a little bit. 
  - What would happen: 
    > I would submit the request and then a phone call would be made to schedule. 
- Imagine you want to make an appointment to be seen for a bothersome cough *today*, how would you make an appointment for that?  
  > I would click request an express care screening. Then wait for the instructions there.  So if it is life threatening call 911 if it a serious problem go to the ER or continue with express care. 
  - What are you seeing here, does it make sense: 
    > Yeah, it looks fine. 
  - Would you continue form here: 
    > Sure. 

- [EC request / consent landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011177) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > So it says submit request from 9am to 11am then a va provider will call and assess you then recommend next steps and not all screenings will lead to an appointments. 
  - Response from request: 
    > yes. 
  - What now: 
    > Request a screening. 
    > It is asking me about my condition. I have a cough without shortness of breath, it has something pretyped so that’s what I got. Contact information and email. 
    - What do you expect: 
      > Wait for the VA to give me a call back. 
    - Would you get a call today: 
      >Yeah I should. 
  - Phone screen meet expectations for urgent telehealth appointment: 
    > Yeah. 
  - Do you notice anything different with you express care tab form the other: 
    > No just the colors are blue and yellow vs red and green. Blue is probably pending and yellow submitted in the past. 
    - Anything here that says it: 
      > NO but there is an escaladed ,and in process, submitted.
      > Submitted means I am waiting for a call back, escaladed awaiting for a doctor and in progress is me getting care for the problem.
