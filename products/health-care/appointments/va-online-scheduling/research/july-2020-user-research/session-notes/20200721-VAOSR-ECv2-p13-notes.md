## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
  
    > That’s fine with me.   
  
    *Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?** 

  > Yes Ma’am. 

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 

  > I schedule with my PMC after each visit. The way things are with COVID is it really messed up but I normally schedule my next appointment with my doctor at the time. 

  - Phone or in person at the pervious appointment: 

    > in person at my pervious appointment. 

- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your
  VA providers, online? 

  > No Ma’am I haven’t done that yet. I have heard of it through DAV and I hear of people doing that online but they run into problem. I have not myself personally tried it yet. 

  - If NO:

    - Anything preventing you: 

      > I mostly use my health insurance than the VA because I ran into cancer treatment with the VA and my health is more important than the few dollars that the VA pays. 

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments

- If YES:
    - Great, let's try to schedule it.
  - If NO:
  
  - No problem! Let's pretend that you do. You may be able to cancel the appointment using the tool. However, some locations don't allow for cancellations online. If this is the case, our team will help you with the cancellation after this session if that is ok with you.

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype
Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:

- Have you heard of "Express Care"? No
  - If YES: 
    - What is it? 
    - Have you used it?
  - If NO: 
    - What do you think it might be? 
    
  > That you can get your appointments quickly and to a standalone clinic.
  - Prompt, if needed: do you think it is for an in-person or virtual appointment? 
    
      > I would think probably virtual. 
  
- Have you done any Telehealth appointments with VA? 
  
  > I have had one with my cancer surgeon and to show the improvement on my ear but that was the only time. 
  
  - If YES:
    - How did you schedule your appointment?
    - Was it with someone on your PACT?
    - Can you tell me a bit about your experience? It is pretty good; I think the doctor made the difference. 

[Now we're going to look at a prototype: [Express Care Prototype - v2](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/BVY4QCOJM4U)

- [EC landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/BVY4QCOJM4U#/screens) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.

  > (Reading page). 

  - Imagine you want to make an appointment to be seen for a bothersome cough *today*, how would you make an appointment for that? 

  - Is that what you expected to happen?  

    > This is confusing on how it is worded. It says schedule for a new appointment then schedule for a new express care request and you have to do it within a certain time and going through the VA healthcare provider then wait for their call. It doesn’t provide a number at all

  - Who would call: 

    > Well it sounds like I need to start the phone conversation then wait for them to return my call.

    - What makes you think you need to call: 

      > Well right here, create a new express care request. (reading page) That means I have to start it and if I start it then shouldn’t I have to make the first call. That is what I am thinking from what I am reading that’s what I think.  

  - What would happen if you click the button: 

    > How express care works (Reading page), I thought it said call between 1-5pm but now it is saying in the morning. It is contradicting now what it said because now it is saying they only take requests in the morning. They are trying to make this complicated. Tell me what to do, that simplifies it. 

  - One the previous page it sounds like you are reaching out to your providers, do you still feel that way based on the next screen: 

    > The way this is going everything is telling me to contact my VA provider or my primary care. Basically. 

  - Is this something you would continue with if you needed help: 

    > I have been in the VA healthcare system since 98 and things were simpler than. I know COVID messed things up so people want to go virtual. I understand that but why complicate it with 15 different steps to achieve one goal which is get an appointment. I think that is what frustrates a lot of veterans I have been working with the DAV for 15 years and the main complaint is that it is difficult. Everything goes through your PMC and without them it just doesn’t work. My issues with hem after talking to the PMD is that the doctor puts in the requests it may take 2 days, weeks, or months. I had cancer and my PMC from the VA put in the request that afternoon, I watched them do it. It was oral cancer, do you know how long it took them to reply, three weeks before I received a phone call form the VA. In the meantime I went on my own and my ENT doctor did the biopsy and confirmed.  Had surgery scheduled before the VA even called me. Let the PMC be in controls they know everything about the patient in front of them and that’s not the way its currently working. I don’t know why but it's not. 

  - Any VA provider not yours from the VA, would you think differently about this: 

    > I don’t know how I would feel about that because most of us like to have one PMC that we can depend on to watch out for our health. When dealing with the VA if you tell a veteran not to use their PMC and just to use one. Which one will see you, they don’t know you or anything about you because what’s on the computer. Now if your PMC makes you an appointment with a specialties and that’s done virtually I can understand. But for me 1 PMC or in the case of the VA PA or nurses or something. Us as veterans should be able to depend on the PMC to make the appointments for outside care form their abilities. It would reduce confusion, anxiety, and frustrations. It may put more work on the PMC, I don’t know exactly how that would work. 

  - Getting help with an urgent help like a cold, sinus infection something like that, how would you feel: 

    > I would still feel better, this is all set up to do it virtually not just make a call. At least I don’t see a number to call, if I were to come here I would look for the number to call, where is it. 

    > *Clicks on express care if you could get help for these.* 

  - Would it be clear if it weren’t already that you would be called by a provider: 

    > That’s what it looks like but see there again it is all done virtually. Another word a lot of veterans are in a rural area and we have a lot of Vietnam veterans and are not familiar with computers. I am not up on computers but I know some of my friends have never even owned a computer so if they needed care they would need to go to the DAV and use the computer on their own. We are not staffed or paid by anyone. There are veterans that we know of that don’t know about virtual correspondence as all. I tell the veteran if they have any issues that need attention call this number. On this here it is all set up virtually and then set it up and wait for them to call. If we have those veterans and there are a lot that don’t have computers. If they submit it on the computer and how long will it take to get one. Where will they get the call, they aren’t at home. If it takes 2 hours for them to call the veterans are they supposed to sit there for 2 hours.  After 17 years I have learned and listened, we are in a different type of culture due to the area. It is different for us than those in NYC. We are unique in the rural area; we still have over 17 thousand veterans in this area.
