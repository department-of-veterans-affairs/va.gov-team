## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

  - **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I recordmy screen the audio as we talk today?**
    > Yes

## Section 0: Warm-up questions
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 
  > I have the app and I go into there and set it up. 
  - Name of the app: 
    > VA Launch Pad. 
- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online? 
  > I know I can call the clinic itself to set up the appointment. I think you can do it through ebenfits but I haven’t tried that yet. 
  - If NO:
    - Have you ever considered scheduling a VA appointment online? 
      > No nothing preventing me but the app on my phone opens and goes right there. There are connectivity issues with benefits and the va so it takes longer. 

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments
Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information.  
  > I see the va.gov URL. It has talk to the veteran crisis line, the search and contact information. VA appointments and when you go down there’s a blue button that says go to the appointments
  - Follow up questions: 
    - Have you seen this page before? 
      > I have seen it and knew it was there
    - VA appointments through here: 
      > I have looked for them to confirm that it worked and they were there. 
    - Expect to go back here once logged in: 
      > I though we were come back to the back. 

## Section 2: Appointments list
We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 

- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page. 
  > I don’t have any scheduled right now; I have to do that and my past appointments show up. This is actually pretty simple I see the scheduled appointments and it has the upcoming along with past appointments and is easy to navigate. 
  - Does that look correct: 
    > Yeah. 
- [Appointment list] Let's take a look at the appointment list. 
    -What do you think about the order of your appointments? 
      > They are right in order on in April then may. 

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today?
  - If YES:
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment?  
  > Yes the dark blue with the line under it. I clicked on it. 
- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > It says choose the type of care you need. Okay, primary care. Okay. 
  - Have you seen this page before?
- [go through each page of the flow]
  - *Select a location page*
    - If a user is registered at 2+ VAMCs, ask: do you recognize these locationsin the list? Do you know what it means? 
      > I do. The one I need to schedule is not listed.
      - Is it possible that it might be part of one of these: 
        > We moved from Dallas so I might need to update it. I have gone to all of them at one point. They are quite away aways actually. It sounds like I need to update something. That’s the thing the app comes right up with it.
      - Have you heard of it: 
        > It must be the one in little rock I didn’t know it was called that. The others have the cities listed and that one has the name.
      - Help if it says hospital or clinic: 
        > yes I know the difference I chose this one because it is closer and easy to get to due to less traffic. I see it now.
      - If it said that in the list: 
        > I would have known it right away to know I go to that one. 
      - If I weren’t here what would you have done: 
        > I thought maybe my address was wrong so I would ensure it is correct and that sort of stuff. I wouldn’t have chosen that one. 
    - Time and date good for you: 
      > yes so far. 
    - Review: 
      > Alright it says the appointment request ahs been submitted. 
  - What are you seeing there: 
    > I have upcoming appointment primary care and date/time still to be determined with the address and phone number along with the preferred time. 
    - Is that helpful: 
      > yes. 
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? 
  > Once I knew the regional I knew where I was going and the step by step process was easy. 

## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel today?
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you want to cancel and walk through the process OR cancel the appointment request you made if you don't need it.
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment? 
  - Walk me through how you'd cancel this appointment: 
    > It right there to the right is says cancel the appointment
    - What do you expect: 
      > the request for those dates and a new screen would come up so I can review and make sure it is cancelled. 
    - Click cancel, what happens? 
      > This asks me if I want to cancel and the choices are yes cancelling this appointment and cancel take me back. I will just go back.
  - If cannot cancel online:
    - What do you think of this? 
      > It looks like it might have you make a new appointment
  - Still be in the account: 
    > No I would expect it to be canceled when you click it the second time. 
  - Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? 
    > It was straightforward. 

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype
Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:
- Have you heard of "Express Care"? 
  > No not really. 
  - If NO: 
    - What do you think it might be? 
      > Maybe teleconference type thing. 
    - Prompt, if needed: do you think it is for an in-person or virtual appointment?
- Have you done any Telehealth appointments with VA? 
  > Yes I have done two.
  - If YES:
    - Can you tell me a bit about your experience? 
      > The doctor was really good. To be honest I thought I had a better ear from the doctor when in person. It just seemed like the feedback to questions, she was more tuned if I was there because of distractions. I was very pleased with the teleconference. 

Now we're going to look at a prototype: [Express Care Prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens)
- [EC landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > I would click create a new appointment. 
  - What do you see on here: 
    > The two dark blue bars stand out, one create an appointment, then requested express care. Then three tabs, upcoming , past ad express care appointments. 
- Imagine you want to make an appointment to be seen for a bothersome cough *today*, how would you make an appointment for that?  
  > Express care would be for that, sooner rather than later. This talks about if there is an emergency then my eyes go to continue with express care. It has how to use it and how it works then it goes to request the screening.
  - Process make sense to: 
    > yeah. 1,2,3 it explains it and what to expect.
  - What would happen if you requested one: 
    > That someone would call. 
  - Confusing or doesn’t make sense: 
    > No it makes sense. The pages are clean and easy to navigate. I would say easier to navigate because others have to many popups. This one is clean and straightforward.
  - Different for screening and appointment: 
    > Yes the screening would qualify me for something such as a specialist or something they can do over the phone if it isn’t serious.  
  - Continue: 
    > Click yes. Submit the request. Then my contact information , phone number and email address. Then request screening. It has successfully submitted the express care request and I can view the request. 
  - Is that what you expected to happen?  
    > Probably give me a page that sums up what I have selected. 
- [EC confirmation screen](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011179) Do you think you will get a call back today?
  > I think I would, yes. 
  - Probe: Does "request a phone screening" meet your expectations for making a same-day, urgent Telehealth appointment? 
    > Yeah actually it does and it makes perfect sense to. 
- [EC screening view](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422133094) What do you think will happen if you click "View Express Care Screening"?
  - *After going to EC Appointments Page View* Probe: Is this what you expected to see? 
    > Yeah it looks exactly as I thought it would. 
    - What is different about the appointments: 
      > One is in progress, submitted and escalated. That’s what comes out when I see it. 
    - What do they mean to you? 
      > Escalated sounds like it needs to be seen by a specialty and in progress is something that has been diagnosed and probably will come to a solution and the last one is waiting for a call for the express 
- (Optional) Is there anything else you'd like to share about this? 
  > No I would probably, if the login were difficult, use this over the app.

## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes
- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov? 
  > Yeah now that I know where it is at because I can use my CAC
- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today? 
  > I think I would I like the concept. 
  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? 
    > Absolutely. 
- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  
  > No, I am pleased I learned something I don’t know. I know how to maneuver though it now.
