## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not 
  testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I  welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo 
  tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let 
  me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** Sure
    *Start recording.*
- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**  Yes

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 

  >Actually I had some issues with skin cancer and I has a growth sent it via secure messenger on myhealthevet and my primary doctor shared it with the dermatologist and it has happened the past few days. I had also gone on to myhealthevet and schedule them that way to. 

- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online? 

  >I am. 

  - If YES:

- Normally how you do it: 

  >It varies, often times follow up appointments are schedule for me based on the appointment I go to and I have recurring appointments that take place once a year that automatically get updated. 

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments

Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-
care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information. 
  >This is pretty much what I do now so login and scheduling I am familiar with the how you can manage your healthcare, eligibility. A lot of this is what I am familiar with, most of it I go straight to signing in and making the appointment. I don’t pay attending because I know I can use it and my facility is okay. 

 - Can you log in to your account from here? 
   > Yes right there. 	
   - Follow up questions, once logged in:
     - Have you seen or used this tool before? 
       > It says it is sending an email to john.medve@me.com. Its not one of my addresses. 
     - Have you logged into va.gov prior: 
       >Yeah, I have logged on. I don’t go through VA.gov I go straight to myhealthevet. I think this is one issue I have with va.gov is that it is a good portal to get into for applying but once you are a patient it is easier to go straight to myHealtheVet so va.gov is a middleman in the process. 
     - Have you signed in with ID.me before: 
       > No because I use either DS logon, I know I signed up for it a while ago but once I got myhealthevet it was easier for me to use that as the logon. Again there’s no sense to go bath through va.gov
     - Did you expect to be back here: 
       > Yeah, I wasn’t sure where it was going. 

## Section 2: Appointments list

We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 
- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page. 
  >The appointment that I scheduled for Monday isn’t there. I don’t know how far they go out with future things because I know I have appointments that aren’t happening for awhile in Martinsburg. On the past appointments,  all of these cancelled ones I am not sure how data is for this. They were cancelled for me I didn’t cancel them. When I logged in before they put me as a no show. There were to sessions, one was a prescreen so when I went to the COBC I signed in but somehow it didn’t register I had made it for the appointment. It covered me for the nurse station but didn’t register me for the appointment but I attended the appointment.  The system made them separate appointments for the same encounter. If they’re looking at it then it will ;look like there are more no shows and that a veteran did not show up which was not the case. It would be helpful if it says canceled by provider. I work at the VA. The deal as they go into the data base there are the ones that are cancelled by the doctor and then by the patient and no show. How many of those are like mine, I signed in for the first but it didn’t prompt me to sign into both. You will not get a clear view because data is being entered incorrectly. For that appointment I got a letter saying I was a no show for the appointment and resources are tight, I was thinking I was there so why are you blaming me. That’s why I signed up for its VA healthcare because I work for the system I can raise the BS flag and confirm or deny it is working how they say it does. When you get a letter you begin to question the efficiency of the organization. 

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP

Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today?
  > Like I said I have the dermatology on Monday. We will just do primary care. 
  - If YES:
    - Great, let's try to schedule it.
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you do. You may be able to cancel the appointment using the tool. However, some locations don't allow for cancellations online. If this is the case, our team will help you with the cancellation after this session if that is ok with you. 
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment?  
  > My question is that I am seen at the COBC at Fort Detrick and its under this one. 
- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  - What do you think of this page?
    - Prompts:
      - What information can you find here?
      - What do you like about it? 
        > It is pretty straight forward.
  - Would you think just to click into it: 
    > Perhaps something like Martinsburg and associated COBC or something so it is clear this would pop down. This is all initiative. 
  - What if you wanted a time in November: 
    > *Clicks next.* I think a next at the bottom also so if you are scrolling down. All I see is July then I scroll down to august. If that’s not what I want I may continue instead of clicking next for the next month. I have to move a few times.  *Clicks my reason isn’t listed here* and adds details into te box. Type of appointment is telehealth. Picks morning to be called. *Clicks request appointment*. All of that is pretty clear. When you get the email if you can download it to your google calendar.  
  - What would happen next: 
  > Once it is confirmed it should show up on my appointments and I should get an email noting the appointment. 
- What from here: 
  > Unless I had something else to do, I would either just end or it might be helpful if it said view appointments of  a box asking if you need anything else. If not then you just end the session. 
- Did you notice the different: 
  > I know it is pending and it is not confirming. I would be able to add it to my calendar and just be ready to go. 
- How do you think you will be informed that it has been scheduled: 
  > I normally get an email, that’s why it has my email when I do the appointment so it can send it to me. 
- Expect it to be scheduled: 
  > I think it would be scheduled within 24 hours. 
- What if it weren’t: 
  > I would go back in and I would send a secure message to my primary physician and say I scheduled this but it hasn’t shown up. I would not call the 1800 number. Right now I am on my work laptop 
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? 
  > I don’t think so, not on the appointment page. I think these are initiative. 
  
## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP

Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel today?
  - If YES: 
    - Great, let's try to cancel it.
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you want to cancel and walk through the process OR cancel the appointment request you made if you don't need it.
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment?  
  > Right here,
  - what do you expect the cancellation to occur: 
    > I would expect when I click cancel something that tells me am I sure that you want to cancel if you click yes then it is cancelled. 
  - Walk me through how you'd cancel this appointment
    - Click cancel, what happens? 
      > That worked as I expected it to. 
  - If can cancel online:
    - What do you think of this?
    - Were you able to complete cancellation? 
      > It shows me red and that it has been canceled. I had not noticed the green on confirmed and red on the cancelled. That is a good visual.
  - Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? 
    > I don’t think so. 

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype
Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:
- Have you heard of "Express Care"? 
  > It will allow me to schedule emergency visits. 
- What type of care: 
  > I don’t know. If you are having  chest pain or have an injury that you can go there and do the care like in community care type appointments. 
  - Prompt, if needed: do you think it is for an in-person or virtual appointment? 
    > I think now adays you would have the option to choose. 
- Have you done any Telehealth appointments with VA? 
  > I have been called and then have a few phone appointments 
  - If YES:
    - How did you schedule your appointment?
    - Was it with someone on your PACT?
    - Can you tell me a bit about your experience? 
      > It was fine it was a follow up. I was going to go in but then COVID started so I asked to do it virtually. The PA called and we had a conversation, it was pretty seamless. The biggest difference is that they weren’t able to take vitals or check you. That’s what you lose by doing it via phone. 

Now we're going to look at a prototype: [Express Care Prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens)
- [EC landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > I have a few options, new appointment for sustainment care or routine appointments then express care it is for something that needs to be seen today. It is for express care but not an emergency. To me that doesn’t make sense, if I need it today then it is probably an emergency. 
- Imagine you want to make an appointment to be seen for a bothersome cough *today*, how would you make an appointment for that?  
  > Click on request care request. It tells me if it is life threatening to call 911 and if I have a mental health issue I probably need to call 911. It cannot provide emergency care. I think the term express care, again I am having the challenge of difference between express and emergency. If I did that I would look for it to be of the issues that are listed as emergency rather than calling another number for the symptoms listed here. 
  - Is this what you would use it for express care: 
    > yes because it equate it to I need it now, not I have a had a cough and its Saturday and want to be seen. I almost think that to put this under the other appointment button. Verses another option because that is how a patient would look at it, it’s how I would look at it. A year ago I was having a heart attack and I didn’t know I was having it so I called the va nurse line and described it and told to come in. That’s when they discovered it, if I would have gone here I would have needed it immediately so I had come to the website then find out that it does not meet the criteria I need to go somewhere else. If we are going to give people options then making sure that there is an explanation or button for emergency. Either someone call right back or connects you to directions to go to either the community or the VA health center. 
  - Is that what you expected to happen? 
- [EC subway map](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/424141776) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
  - Based on your task: making an appointment to be seen for a bothersome cough *today*, would you continue with this request? If it was last year , no. We will pretend it is for this. 
- [EC form screen](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011178) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  > Now you have gone from a express care button then you have to make your request between 9 and 11. I think we are getting into less transparency upfront and I don’t know how you fix it if you are of the zone for that day, if there would be a way when you click on the button at 12 there is a message that tells you we are unable to do it today but the earliest is tomorrow. 
  - Do you think you would still submit or something else: 
    > Yeah, that’s why I was going to the bottomed. Does it link with the capacity at the facility if there are a routine appointment open today, is that an option. Like we can’t do it today but you can see your PMC tomorrow. Or do a telehealth option for someone to call you back.
  - What from here: 
    > (reading page), I assume this is the most common issues that popup because they let it go then need to be seen because they are dying. Contact information verified. From my perspective this covers things I had an issues with in the past and might want to do it. 
  - Now it has been submitted what do you think: 
    > Truthfully, a bit underwhelming because at this point I am not sure if I will get my issue resolved. If I am outside of the window then, is it that I still get a call between 1-5. I am not sure at this point. Itis 150 now and if I need that I would be waiting to get a call within the next 3 hours. If the true thing is that I get bumped to the next day I don’t know that. 
  - What would happen if you missed the call: 
    > If I miss the call then it is on me or there should be multiple ways. I get texts, called, and emailed. If I miss it I would be upset but I think that is on the patient. 
- [EC confirmation screen](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011179) Do you think you will get a call back *today*? 
    - Probe: Does "request a phone screening" meet your expectations for making a same-day, urgent Telehealth appointment?
- [EC screening view](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/42213309
  4) What do you think will happen if you click "View Express Care Screening"?
  - *After going to EC Appointments Page View* Probe: Is this what you expected to see?
    - Why / Why not?
  - Probe: Did you notice the different statuses? 
    - What do they mean to you?
- (Optional) Is there anything else you'd like to share about this?

## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes
- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov? 
  > Well again I go straight to myhealthevet. As long as that is an option I do not see the point to go to va.gov. 
  - what would make it preferred: 
    > if they took away the direct line to myhealthevet. I look to manage my care and to me va.gov is more about getting people signed up for ebenfits and serves. Once you are signed up for healthcare then everything is done within MyHeatheVet. 
- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were inneed of an appointment, today? 
  > Yeah, I think so. Again it tells you want to do if you have an emergency once you get in but one the first page it needs to be more transparent for routine and what express is verse emergency. Maybe three buttons, routine, express care non- emergency then emergency so you can click it and get advice on what to do. 
  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? 
    > Yeah. 
- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or Express Care that we have not yet covered today?   
  > I think for express care that is a perfect link with telehealth, I don’t know if we are able to behind the scenes to have PA, nurses or doctors that are a call center situation so when you click it you are immediately sent to someone that you can see on video to explain it and get more help or a call back immediately to triage. To me that would be a better set up and more helpful. None of this touches on, this is good for VA centers, but we have the community care as well.  If you can’t be seen then you are able to get care in the community can that be integrated in some way? Again for my heart attack we drove an hour because I was concerned if I went to the emergency room I would have to deal with he issues of sorting out the payment rather then going to the va and being sent from them. I think a lot of veterans are in that situation because they did the process wrong when they did it wrong when needing help and ended up being charged. 

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site  and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
- If YES: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 
Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
