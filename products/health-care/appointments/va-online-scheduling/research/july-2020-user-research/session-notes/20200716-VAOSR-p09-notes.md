# Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

  - **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I recordmy screen the audio as we talk today?** 
    > Yes

## Section 0: Warm-up questions
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 
  >I usually call in so I call into the appointment line. 
- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online? 
  > I do know that you can do it but I never really tried it. The feature is in myhealthevet but I have never used it. 
  - If NO:
    - Have you ever considered scheduling a VA appointment online?
    - What would convince you to try it? 
      > Yeah now that I think of it, it might be more convenient but I never thought about trying it. I have made a few appointments this week and I called because I felt like I needed to talk to someone with the calendar. Doing it online you wouldn’t have any wait times. Maybe this morning I will be able to see what it can do. 

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments
Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information.   
  > I am looking at the left hand side with options to go other places. We are in schedule and view appointments.
  - What type of information is here: 
    > So it shows me where I can schedule, view, or cancel the appointments. It provides a tab to sign in or create an account. Below that it provides information about how the tools can assist in my healthcare. The button will let me use my normal sign in when I am on myhealthevet. 
  - Follow up questions: 
    - Have you seen this page before? 
      > Not this page but VA.gov
- Can you log in to your account from here? 
  > Logs in through myhealthevet.
- Follow up questions, once logged in:
  - Have you seen or used this tool before? 
    > It is asking me to verify so I will get a text. It just arrived. It looks like I am logged in now.
    - Can you tell me what happened? 
      > It brought me back to the same page. I see where I can go to my va appointments, it’s the appointment tool. 

## Section 2: Appointments list
We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 

- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page. 
  > So I see upcoming appointments, one is for video connect today, another is one for November. The one for today is a teleconference. I have never been to this page before. It looks lie it is self-explanatory. I am looking at my appointment today. It tells me that I can join the session from this page and there are options to cancel it or add it to my calendar. The same thing with other appointment. I am looking to past appointments to see what is there. Everything is self-explanatory. 
   - Is there anything that you think may be missing? 
     > No, actually being able to get the directs or phone number are features I was not aware that I could access through here so that is good to know. 
  - Enough information: 
     > I think it might be helpful if for example it had the name of the doctor that I have the appointment with. That would help. 

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today? I was going to call in to schedule a podiatry appointment. 
  - If YES:
    - Great, let's try to schedule it.
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment?  
  > This list makes me wonder if it is comprehensive for the specialty care so it says continue so it may provide more options. Let’s say I don’t see anything that  says podiatry, I see audiology. I get eye appointments but it may be in continue. I see eye care there. I don’t see anything that indicated podiatry. 
  - What would you do in this case: 
    > I think I would see the need help here so I might call in like I would have otherwise. 
  - What do you think about that: 
    > I think it would probably lead me to do what I would’ve without coming to this site. This is an extra step where I could have just called in like normal.
  - More difficult for you: 
    > Yes. I don’t have any other in mind appointments but it will show you another one I have a dermatology appointment in November but I don’t see the option to schedule it here to but I can book one with my PCM then cancel it.
  - Have you seen this page before?
- [go through each page of the flow]
  - *Select a location page*
    - If a user is registered at 2+ VAMCs, ask: do you recognize these locations in the list? Do you know what it means? 
      > I only recognize the San Diego VA, I don’t where the others are do you know what the names mean or have any meaning to you: I just assume they are a regional hospital at some location. It could be anywhere; I just don’t have an idea. I could google it and let you but other then that I have no idea. The Matsunaga is probably in Hawaii. I would pick the San Diego VA. 
      - If you didn’t want would you do: 
        > I would hit the box for the san Diego box and hit continue. I hit that and it says there are no PMC appointments at this location so I don’t know. I can’t go anywhere here. I would go back. I get all of my care at the Ocean side clinic and it is close to my home. I don’t feel like I can go any farther so I would be done. 
- Were you able to complete the task?
  - Why / Why not? No. 
    - What would have made you able to schedule your appointment today? 
      > It would provide the ocean side clinic as an option. I would be able to click that and be able to select my provider and then it would then open up a schedule with available dates and times. Then I would be able to schedule myself. 


## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel today?
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you want to cancel and walk through the process OR cancel the appointment request you made if you don't need it.
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment? 
  > Yes I see on both appointments there are a little tab at each appointment box. There is the appointment and there is the cancel appointment.
  - Walk me through how you'd cancel this appointment
    - Click cancel, what happens? 
      > It would open up and give me one more chance to make up my mind then a tab to initiate the cancellation. 
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? No, that’s it. 

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype
Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:
- Have you heard of "Express Care"? 
  No I haven’t but I was just reading there and it looks like if you have a nonemergency you can get a quick consult or have questions answered. 
  - If NO: 
    - What do you think it might be?
  - What do you expect: 
    > It has clear instructions here. You can submit the request and have certain times when you can do it. I can click the tab to request an express care screening and it would start the process. 
    - Prompt, if needed: do you think it is for an in-person or virtual appointment?
- Have you done any Telehealth appointments with VA? 
  > I have had multiple. 
  - If YES:
    - How did you schedule your appointment?
    - Was it with someone on your PACT?
    - Can you tell me a bit about your experience? 
      > It has been really good, I am impressed. It is a commute for me to go to the clinic where I would normally have it and being able to do it by telehealth it saves me 1.5 hrs. and I can check in online. I prefer this. 
- Imagine you want to make an appointment to be seen for a bothersome cough *today*, how would you make an appointment for that? 
  > I think I would try an express care screening. 
  - Do you expect to talk to someone right now as you go through the process: 
    > I  would expect there would be a time slot that I could pick or I could get a call back between certain hours today. My first thought would be there would eb open times that I could select that worked for me. 
- [EC request / consent landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011177) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > This is showing me information and how to get help for emergencies. I don’t have an emergency right now I would continue by hitting the blue button. It has con I use it. 
  - Was it clear that the first page was a warning: 
    > Yes but I recognized it and since I don’t feel like I am crisis I blew past it to get to where I need to be. I like this page because it have 123 steps and the hours I can request. I know I have to do it between 9-11 and if its after that time its to late. The provider will call me between 1-5pm. It would be 1-5 in my time zone, then I would get an assessment when I get the call back. After reviewing it, it provides choices(reads page). 
- [EC subway map](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/424141776) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
  - Based on your task: making an appointment to be seen for a bothersome cough *today*, would you continue with this request? 
    > I would check yes and click continue. Now it allows me to submit the screening request. It provides choices that I can explain what is going on with me, it is a cough without shortness of breath. I checked that, (reading page). I think I would be able to fill in my appointment now then I would request the screening. Sometime between the provided times I would get a call back.
    - Why / why not?
    - Do the options at the bottom make sense?
- [EC form screen](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011178) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
  - Probe: You have a bothersome cough, which option would you choose? 
  - What do you think will happen once you submit this form?
- [EC confirmation screen](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011179) Do you think you will get a call back *today*? 
  > Yes
  - Probe: Does "request a phone screening" meet your expectations for making a same-day, urgent Telehealth appointment? 
    > Yeah, that was smooth and easy. I don’t remember seeing anything that it would be a telehealth. I think it might just be a regular phone call instead of a zoom call or regular va telehealth appointment. 
    - What from here: 
      > Since it has me viewing my express care screening, I think it would show me what I selected and maybe contain the additional information such as the time that the call will come back. I see others that I have made. 
- [EC screening view](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422133094) What do you think will happen if you click "View Express Care Screening"?
  - *After going to EC Appointments Page View* 
  - Probe: Is this what you expected to see?
    - Why / Why not?
  - Probe: Did you notice the different statuses?  
    > Yeah it looks like I have options to go to a few places, upcoming, past, and express care. Then on this page I can request another screening. Create a new appointment like we tried before. I think if I click the upcoming appointments it will show the two I have. 
  - Expect to see the express care mixed into other visited: 
    > No it looks like there are separate tabs. I see the upcoming and past and then express is a separate tab. I wouldn’t expect to see it, if I looked at the past appointments it wouldn’t be the express care. 
  - Different status: 
    > I did notice that when I first came here. The one we did is submitted. Then one with escalade, it provides information that a provider will contact me and the last one is in progress and this was one that was not escalated but a provider will contact me. The skin lesion or rash may be more serious and moved to a more serious level. Whereas the other is more routine. Either way I will be contact by a provider. 
  - Different term then progress that would make more sense: 
    > I think that if you had more information on the phone when the express care information on what escalated means expedited whereas in progress is more routine due to working in different time frames. 
    - What do they mean to you?
- (Optional) Is there anything else you'd like to share about this?

## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes
- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov? 
  > I think I will and I like that it is easier to cancel an appointment this way instead of calling in with the amount of time it takes to talk to a scheduler. If I were to make a primary, eye or ear appointment I might give it a try. I wish the oceanside clinic was a popup but we hit that roadblock. For the departments that did not show up, I just want to know it wouldn’t be a waste of time when I could have just started my calling in. 
- Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus?  
  >Yes, I would. 
- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  
  >I think it is available today, if I were to ask for it today or in the future I could go online and do that. 
  - What type of call will it be: 
    > I see the note if I need to talk to a provider I need to contact the contact center and if it is more serious I need to call 911. The second step we went through that, I am looking at the note. That is a bit confusing because it may not be a member of your team, the abbreviation is confusing. Step three (reading page), it doesn’t say if my call back will be a call or a video. What we care doing now that we are able to see each other it just makes it better. 
  - Does a screener make sense: 
    > I think it does because it creates the right expectation. Someone that has a problem they may have other expectations other than this. This is for screening and assessment that is the most appropriate for the issue you have. The screener based on what you tell them you need to go in or it needs to be escalated or call 911. The idea would be a screening and I guess there needs to be more clarity. In the military medical center there is a 214/7 nurse line so you have the medical need met. Whereas a screen could not be certified but is trained to pass it on to a provider or nurse.  It would be great if it were a video call and you could just show them on camera then, that would be a great feature and the other question is if I am having an audiology appointment issue with the hearing aid. Would it be an option to call the line to tell them the issues. Then they would have me moved up for the scheduling an appointment.
