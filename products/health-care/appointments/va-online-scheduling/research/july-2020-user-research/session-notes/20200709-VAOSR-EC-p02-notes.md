## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
    *Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

  > Yes, that’s fine.

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments?
  > I call. 
- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online?
  - If YES:
    > You know I downloaded the app for that, but I have not used it. Oh, that’s the prescription refill app, so maybe I didn’t download the app. But I do prefer to do things online because it’s easier for me. I’ve seen it, but haven’t used it.
    - Have you ever used this/these methods before?
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience?
  - If NO:
    - Have you ever considered scheduling a VA appointment online?
    - What would convince you to try it?
      > Sometimes I get confused, I have a head injury, and it can be overwhelming. I’m hesitant, but it would be very convenient for myself and my husband as well. 
      
## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments

Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information. 
  > First off is a corona virus note. Then it says schedule and view appts online. View, schedule, or cancel. Please sign in or create an account. How can va appt tools help me manage my healthcare, ways that you can use it, like scheduling canceling, that kind of stuff. Am I eligible to use the tool. All these must be true, with some things to look at. Must have my healthe vet acct, etc. info about how do I know if my facility uses online scheduling – available at all except for the following. What type can I schedule online, there’s a link to scheduling. can I schedule outside of va? No. or through secure messaging? will my info be protected? 
  - Helpful?
    > It is, in fact, quite a bit that would be helpful.
  - Follow up questions: 
    - Have you seen this page before?
    - What do you think about this page?
- Can you log in to your account from here?
  > Yes, sign in or create an acct. 
  > Keeps losing network connection
 - I don’t think it’s you, and I don’t think it’s your network. Let’s pivot to the prototype.

      - Were you able to accomplish that task?

## Section 2: Appointments list

We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you 
haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 
- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page.
- What do you think of this page?
  - Prompts:
    - What information can you find here?
    - What do you like about it?
    - What don't you like about it? Is there anything that you find confusing?

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP

Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today?
  - If YES:
    - Great, let's try to schedule it.
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you do. You may be able to cancel the appointment using the tool. However, some locations don't allow for cancellations online. If this is the case, our team will help you with the cancellation after this session, if that is ok with you. 
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment? 
  - Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
    - What do you think of this page?
      - Prompts:
        - What information can you find here?
        - What do you like about it?
        - What don't you like about it? Is there anything that you find confusing?
        - Is there anything that you think may be missing?
  - Have you seen this page before?
- [go through each page of the flow]
  - *Select a location page*
    - If a user is registered at 2+ VAMCs, ask: do you recognize these locations in the list? Do you know what it means?
    - If a user is registered at 1 VAMC, ask: does this option make sense to you? Do you know what it means?
- Were you able to complete the task?
  - Why / Why not?
    - What would have made you able to schedule your appointment today?
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?

## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP

Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel today?
  - If YES: 
    - Great, let's try to cancel it.
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you want to cancel and walk through the process OR cancel the appointment request you made, if you don't need it.
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment? 
  - Walk me through how you'd cancel this appointment
    - Click cancel, what happens?
  - If cannot cancel online:
    - What do you think of this?
    - What would you do next?
  - If can cancel online:
    - What do you think of this?
    - Were you able to complete cancellation?
  - Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype

Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:

- Have you heard of "Express Care"?
  - If YES: 
    - What is it? 
    - Have you used it?
  - If NO: 
    - What do you think it might be?
      > Well, I think it would be quick access for more emergency situations or urgent.
    - Prompt, if needed: do you think it is for an in-person or virtual appointment?
      > Right now, I kind of expect everything to be virtual. I guess it would depend on what your urgent need was. If it was medication, that could be a phone call. 
- Have you done any Telehealth appointments with VA?
  - If YES:
    > I do my telehealth with my mental health provider that is in a different state. I used to go into the VA where they had it set up in a room and you could use a computer. I’ve done it at home with an ipad and telephone.   - Prior to pandemic? At home, yes. I used to have to use their room to do it.
    - How did you schedule your appointment?
    - Was it with someone on your PACT?
    - Can you tell me a bit about your experience?
  - If NO:
    - Have you considered it before?
    - What would convince you to try it?

Now we're going to look at a prototype: [Express Care Prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens)
- [EC landing page] Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  > You can manage schedule or view. There’s a blue button to make a new appt or request an express care screening. I don’t have any upcoming, but it has upcoming, past, express care tabs. Really tiny print – might be an issue if the print is so tiny. 
 - Prototype not made for mobile.
   > You can submit a request and receive a phone screening, phone video or in-person follow-up. Explains what it’s really for and what you can do.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
    > It makes sense.
- Imagine you want to make an appointment to be seen for something *today*, how would you make an appointment for that? 
  > There’s a blue button for request an express care screening, so I would click on the blue button. It says how to get help for emergencies, tells you what to do if it’s serious or life-threatening, reiterates that it does not provide emergency health and gives some examples of those. 
  - Is that what you expected to happen? 
    > Yes, it is.
    - Why / why not?
- [EC subway map] Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
    > I think it’s very clear bullets for details, pretty good actually.
  - Based on your task: making an appointment to be seen for something *today*, would you continue with this request?
    - Why / why not?
- [EC form request screen] Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  > Can I use express care, tells you what for. This is good that it tells you you can still use it if you don’t have a primary care physician. 
  - If no pcp, then what?
    > Appt would be made with a doctor or one of the nurses would call you back.
    > The provider who calls you may not be a member of your team. That would be okay with me. 
    > Asks if you want to request a screening and gives three options, continue from there.
  - Which option?
    > I would request a screening. It gives you a bunch of options, coughing, flu-like symptoms, headaches, musculo-skeletal pain, eye issues, urinary symptoms, kind of covers everything doesn’t it? And then you share phone and email so they can contact you. Does it autofill? It would be cool if it autofilled, but not necessary. 
    > Oh, I have to select a symptom, provide additional details, contact info, request screening.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
    > Yeah, I like that, though some other vets may not understand that those circles, you’re supposed to choose one, or that it’s just information, you know what I mean?
  - What do you think will happen once you submit this form?
  - Prompt if necessary: Does "request a phone screening" meet your expectations for making a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment?
- [EC confirmation screen] Do you think you will get a call back *today*?
  > Yes, it says request in the morning and you’d get same day call back. 
  - What if you specify a "best times for VA to call" window?
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this?
  > Seems to be pretty easy to use, so it’s definitely something that I would use, now that I realize that it is really easy. 
- How confident are you that you would get a call?
  > Totally confident that I would get a call. 
- What would happen if you didn’t get a call?
  > Probably never use it again and call the VA and not be happy about it.
- Imagine that you missed the call, what do you anticipate would happen?
  > I would assume that I’d have to go through the process again since I missed it, or that a screen would pop up and offer me a chance to reschedule it.
- Do you think you’d have to wait until the next day?
  > I would assume that I would have to wait until the next day since this is not urgent care.
- How many attempts would VA make to contact you?
  > I would assume just the one attempt, and that if you missed it, you would have to redo the process. It would be cool if they would call twice, but then people might choose not to answer and it would take up a bunch of time that it shouldn’t.
  > My only question would be about notes because this should go into your medical file.
- Would you consider an express care visit like this, assuming you got the call, had the screening, imaging I’m your nurse or someone who calls you, would you consider that the same thing as having an appt?
  > For minor stuff like that, absolutely. It would be time-saving for the doctor and myself to get something I need quickly.
- Would you expect to see any other information on this page as you scroll down?
  > No, I think that covers everything cause you can look at the past stuff too. 
- Imagine you’re looking at the rest of your appts list, would you expect that express care would show up on there
  > I think so, if I had an express care appt, I would expect it to show up on my list.
- For how long would you expect it to remain on your appts list? Submitted or occurred?
  > I think it would remain like your other stuff that you’ve had appts for, so for however long those kinds of things are on your record. If you have an issue that don’t realize is a serious issue but then a year from now you need to be able to look back, it should be there. Establishes, maybe it’s a minor thing or a symptom or something larger, so you’d want that info to remain. Would be helpful for staff, doctors, too. Sometimes they find things in the notes that the patient doesn’t realize is important.
- Would you comeback to this page while you were awaiting your call, to monitor the status?
  > Um…if I thought I had missed it, it would be good to be able to come back here to see if I missed it. 
- Imagine you did miss it, what would it say on here?
  > I think it would say call missed, and then give you the option and information that you could schedule it for the next day right then, or indicate that you’re not longer interested in the appt. because there’s no need.
  > Seems to be very user friendly.  - 
- Any other thoughts?
  > I think it’s a pretty simple tool. Very helpful. If I have a simple need, this would be great. Or to get a referral. That would be great.

## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov?
  - Why / why not?
- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were inneed of an appointment, today?
  > Yes.
  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus?
    > It is, actually. That would be really good. Sometimes you need to doctor to talk you down from the ledge! You’re okay!
- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  
  > I don’t. I just think this is a really good thing. For patients and doctors. To clear up some congestion.
