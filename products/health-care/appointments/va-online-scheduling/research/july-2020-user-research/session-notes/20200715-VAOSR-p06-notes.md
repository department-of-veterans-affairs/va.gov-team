## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
  > Absolutely.

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**  
  > Yes I am. 

## Section 0: Warm-up questions
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 
  > I use myhealthevet. 
  - If YES:
    - Have you ever used this/these methods before?
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience? 
      > It is usually really good. I think it has a lot of stuff in there that can be trimmed down. Sometimes it is easy to find things but others it is harder but generally a good experience. 
      - Troublesome or difficult to do: 
        > No off hand, no. 

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments
Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information. 
  > I can see the menus and everything else and scheduling the VA online stands out. It looks slightly different and actually how I schedule it I normally use secure messaging to talk to the provider so I can say I have done it this way.
  - Follow up questions: 
    - Have you seen this page before?
    - What do you think about this page? 
      > For me personally there is a lot of information I wouldn’t pay attention to or I would go in and do what I need to. You have view and schedule appointments, health tools and if I am eligible. If you are myhealthevet you should be able to use it. There is a lot of information on this page that doesn’t have to be here.
  - Read through it: 
    > If I came here I would go right to the view/schedule appointments, I don’t think I would look at the rest of the page. 
    - Let’s do that: 
      > Okay sign in and schedule. I have used all of the sign in options. I would normally use ID. Me because it is the easier. It goes through the authorization. Is that going to send the code to my phone. 
    - You have used iD.me: 
      > Yes. The code just came in. That look awhile. 
    - What did you expect: 
      > I am logged in now and I assume that it would have taken me to scheduling page. 
    - Anything different here: 
      > No, not really. 
    - Anywhere you can get to appointment: 
      > You can go to your va appointments. I think the color changed to blue, it was green before. You have the popup before and I think it may look a little differently. I sometimes find those annoying, I do not need it. I am going to VA appointments now. 

## Section 2: Appointments list
We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 
- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page. 
  > I have not, no. 
  > I have scheduled an appointment, upcoming appointments, past appointments, and it provides a timeframe to look at. This is pretty good; it is easy enough. It is easy to read and not hard on my eyes. 
- What do you think of this page? 
  > This is nice and easy to read.
    - What do you like about it? 
    - What don't you like about it? Is there anything that you find confusing?
    - Is there anything that you think may be missing? 
      > No I think it is good, I can look at my appointments and past appointments. This page is good. 
- [Appointment list] Let's take a look at the appointment list. 
  - Prompts:
    - What do you think about the order of your appointments? 
      > It goes with the most recent and goes down. It is easy to read and self-explanatory. I like that it has the phone numbers for the clinics and its good to have. 
  - Information for each appointment: 
    > It has the address, directions if you need a map I am not sure what it will show. Yeah it brings up a new page with a map on there, that is easy enough. I think it brought it over one of my pages. The map is easy enough, that’s fine and I like it. I wouldn’t be using a map but I think it is something others might like to use. 
  - Anything else you’d want: 
    > Past appointments is just history and I don’t use it for much. I have occasionally looked at it but I wouldn’t be using it to much. 
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? 
  > I like it. It is easy to read and I think that page is fine. 

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today?
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you do. You may be able to cancel the appointment using the tool. However, some locations don't allow for cancellations online. If this is the case, our team will help you with the cancellation after this session if that is ok with you. 
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment?  
  - Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
    > I see my hearing guy so audiology and speech so we will go with that. This is straightforward, it is nice and clean. You can schedule appointments with different areas. I have been to all of these at one time. 

    > I would go with providence because I go there the most. Now it stopped me, appointments are only available the certain places. I would go with new bedform. I know new bedform, I haven’t been there but I know where it is.  

    > The calendar is nice and clean. It is a calendar look so you can see the days, I would pick 24th of July. I don’t see November there. Okay yes November is there. I wasn’t looking for that but I will pick November 11th in the PM. Reason for appointment is easy to understand I would go with Routine. Now it wants me to put a reason for the appointment, hearing aids need adjustment. You have the urgent medical need call 911, the VA is big on that so that’s fine. 

    > Type of appointment, I don’t remember seeing these before. I can go either way; I will go office visit. It has my number and I can change that if needed, when to call and my email address. 
  - Scheduling the appointments: 
    > Yes it is straightforward to me. It gives me a summary of what we just did. (reading page). I would review it to ensure my information is correct then request the appointment. They are reviewing the request and will call when they are ready. It will not eb in appointments because it’s not scheduled yet. I don’t know because I only see the appointments there. 
  - Let’s take a look: 
    > Okay it has been scheduled. 
  - What do you see now: 
    > The information, add to calendar, and cancel appointment then show more,. It tells me the reason and goes over contact details. I can cancel if I want. Those are all good. 
  - Different statuses: 
    > What do you mean different status. Let me see. I didn’t even see that Melissa. Okay, Yupp I do see it. The one appointment next year is confirmed but the appointment today still needs to be confirmed. I said it wasn’t schedule then I thought it was but now I realize it is still pending
  - Helpful: 
    > Definitely. Now that I see it there it is. 
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? 
  > No it has the address and I like that. I normally know where I am going but it has the address, phone number and the option to cancel the appointment. I think there is plenty of information on there. 

## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel today?
  - If YES: 
    - Great, let's try to cancel it.
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you want to cancel and walk through the process OR cancel the appointment request you made if you don't need it.
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment? 
  - Walk me through how you'd cancel this appointment You can cancel appointment; it is right there.
  - What do you expect to happen: 
    > I imagine since I am canceling the appointments that it would be cancelled. I know scheduling needs to be confirmed but cancelling should just canceled it. 
    - Click cancel, what happens? 
      > The popup is a good idea so it comes up (reading page) It is a reminder to the veteran to make sure they want to do that. Click Yes and Click continue. 
      > I notice one this page now that the appointments on the page have a green line and the cancelled one has a red line so I imagine that it will still show up but the red line is a reminder that it has been canceled. I think it is a good idea and it’s a reminder. 
  - If can cancel online:
    - What do you think of this? 
      > It was easy enough. 
  - Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? 
    > The only thing I see on the bottom, I don’t know if it is new because I have never done the video connect. I don’t know if it is new or has been there forever. The page allows you to leave feedback but I don’t know who it will go to. Myhealthevet I like and va.gov I like. 

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype
Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:
- Have you heard of "Express Care"? I don’t believe I have. 
  - If NO: 
    - What do you think it might be? 
      > Express care it seems like it can be an easy appointment or answers to health questions or va related questions. 
    - Prompt, if needed: do you think it is for an in-person or virtual appointment? 
      > Initially I would think it would be virtual since that is the way we are going now days. 
- Have you done any Telehealth appointments with VA? 
  > I have not done it with the VA but I have with my private doctors. 
  - If NO:
    - Have you considered it before? 
      > It is possible one appointment I had with a neurologist. I don’t think I need to go in and see them but that appointment is to get my meds adjusted. I think some appointments can be done on telehealth.  I know its not the va appointment but I video my doctor and he spent more time looking at his computer so I could have done it on the computer. 

Now we're going to look at a prototype: [Express Care Prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens)
- [EC landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > Well on the top it has talk to the crisis line, there are a lot of veterans in crisis so they might notice that. We have va appointments, express care screening. That is different then the past page. Then we have all appointments and it is different then the last. It is straightforward an easy to read. There isn’t to much information on the page and easy to read. 
- [EC request / consent landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011177) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > That is straightforward and makes sense. 
  - Is that what you expected to happen? 
    > You request the appointment between 9-11am then receive a call because 1-5pm. If I make it in the morning I will hang around the house or my phone waiting for someone to call me. 
    - Why / why not?
- [EC subway map](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/424141776) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the 
information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
  - Based on your task: making an appointment to be seen for a bothersome cough *today*, would you continue with this request? 
    > Click on request an express care screening. (reading page) Once again information to talk to someone is there. That makes sense, that is fine. 
    - Notice is outside of the window, what do you think will happen:  
      > I would think there should be a warning that says you may not get a call back but then get a call on the next business day.
    - What if it doesn’t allow you: 
      > If it doesn’t allow then it should provide a warning that you need to do it tomorrow but if it is serious you should go get care. I get sinus infections a lot so I could wait for then to call. I would continue with express care. 
      > It lets you know when you might want to see someone. I am just reading through the page now. It is just telling me what it told me on the first page, can I use it is new but how it works, I understood that form the first page. Whether it is needed there as well I don’t know. Express care screening, now this throws me off. Is it a screening or am I requesting an appointment with a provider. 
    - What do you think: 
      > I guess on number three explains it, they will screen you prior to scheduling an appointment. 
    - If talking with a nurse would it be a screening or appointment: 
      > it depends on what they are asking. It could be an appointment; it is hard to say it really depends on what they are asking. I would consider it as an appointment. I have spoken with a PA outside of the VA and a lot of the times I need to refer you to the doctor so yes I would request the screening. Submit the request, I would go for cough with shortness of breath. Now I would confirm my contact information. That is good then go ahead a request the screening. (reading page) I am not sure that the blue button, view express care screening. 
  - Can you tell me how the process went: 
    >it was easy, it is something I would use. I do get a lot of sinus infections and don’t need to go to the office or the VA so I have no problem doing it this way. 
  - What will happen from here: 
    >I don’t know what the blue button is but I would expect someone to call between 1 and 5pm. 
- [EC confirmation screen]((https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011179)) Do you think you will get a call back today?
  - Probe: Does "request a phone screening" meet your expectations for making a same-day, urgent Telehealth appointment?
- [EC screening view](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422133094) What do you think will happen if you click "View Express Care Screening"?
  - *After going to EC Appointments Page View* Probe: Is this what you expected to see? 
    > Express care, it looks like it is bringing up the previous express care appointment. There are orange ones and a blue one. I don’t know what is going on here. 
    - When looking at real appointments with the colors or status: 
      > Yeah that was straightforward because it was red and green. 
    - Why / Why not?
  - Probe: Did you notice the different statuses?  
    > Yeah that is a little different. Submitted it the most recent, escalated. Now that I am reading it is making more sense. The colors didn’t help. The skin lesions or rash tells me someone need to look at it. Read or weeping eye, once again someone form the VA will contact me. The top on is submitted so some will definitely call me. The button tow someone will call me but I just don’t know when. I don’t know if it but with the red and green was obvious . here it maybe need to be explained. We should use green as the top when it is good to go, yellow being a warning but they aren’t there yet. 
  - What if it were in with upcoming or past appointments: 
    > It wouldn’t bother me; they are all appointments regardless of express care or person to person care. It makes sense to me. 
  - Additional information:   
    > highlighting between in person and express care if they are mixed it. It should be obvious that the ones will be a phone appointment and others are in person. 
- (Optional) Is there anything else you'd like to share about this? 
  > No, this is good. Personally, I like the pages that are easy to read and understand. I don’t like a lot of information out there. I have a friend that is disfunction and he wouldn’t be using this with his issues. I think a lot of veterans have issue with too much information.
  - What would you want: 
    > Basically what I am doing, what I am trying to do, the appointment and where it is. It was enough information for me to get to my appointment and I understand where it is. Same thing here, just enough information for me to know what it is, where it is and how to get to it. 

## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes
- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov? 
  > Yeah the question I have VA.gov opposed to myhealthevet. Are they trying to get away form myhealthevet. That is fine with me I have been on va.gov before and have looked at it, I have found good information and have no problem doing it all from one site provided it is secure. I use secure messaging so you want to ensure it is secured. With the government there are too many sites. I would rather one place to do it all. 

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today? 
  > Absolutely, that’s a good questions because one issue I have with eh VA is when you try to get an appointment it could be a month or two. Like a sinus infection I want to see someone before a month. 
  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? 
    > Yeah. Definitely, obviously the questions they’d ask is the same ones they’d ask in person. 
- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  
  >No, personally I like online schedule. I am adapted to the computer so I like using it for things like this.  

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Thanks! 

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
- If YES: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
