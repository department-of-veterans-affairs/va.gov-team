:thread: 1: I think the major thing is really that VAOSR isn't a scheduling tool 

- VAOSR is an appointment **request** tool
- no where in DEPO's flow does it say who or when you'll get follow up. **THIS WOULD BE A HUGE WIN! (and since it's just content, easy-ish)**
- communications from the VA are haphazard, at best: emails, letters, calls do happen, but inconsistently
- (not in the report, but worth keeping in your :brain: ***VA is dependent on USPS for communications and delivery of medical services.\*** delivery of services to Veterans will be greatly impacted by changes being made by political folks, **which makes it even more important to communicate the process of using tools like VAOSR consistently, correctly, and accurately.**Consider: What happens if the veteran misses the call? how do they reach back out?
- Regardless of service era, some Veterans will never be interested in using online tools/services. This is related to personal preference, injury, tech ability, and awareness of online resources (for both scheduling and medical visits).
- Irregardless: Rural Veterans, especially, have limited data coverage/tech access.



:thread: 2: the VA ecosystem is so vast and experiences differ based on your VA.

- this is something we've heard before, which makes it even more important to shaping the online VA experience
- Research sessions with Veterans have taught us that no one VA experience is alike, it depends where you live, how much you use your VA services, what relationship you have with VA (you = Veteran)
- It doesn't matter what the online experience is like if it doesn't deliver the services as the Veteran expects/experiences IRL.

:thread: 3: despite untrue name and differing experiences, Veterans (in research sessions) said they would use the tool in the future, even if its not what they anticipated or expected
