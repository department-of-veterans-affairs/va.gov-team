## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Peter, from the VA Online Scheduling team and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about managing appointments in MyHealtheVet. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **I will ask you to log into MyHealtheVet and share your screen during this session.** We won't be recording this session. We will be taking notes to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, but we will not use any of your medical information as a part of this study. And none of the information we do use will be attributed to you directly.
- Do you have any questions for me before we start?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at MyHealtheVet, I have a few questions to start us off:

- How do you manage your health appointments, VA or otherwise? Like rescheduling or canceling them?
- How do you keep informed about changes to your appointments?
- What other tools do you use, besides MyHealtheVet, to keep track of or manage your appointments?

## First Task: Review MHV appointments list - 15 minutes

Next, I'd like you to share your screen so we can see how you manage your appointments in MyHealtheVet.

_Once screen is shared_

Great, I can see your screen. Now, could you show me how you access your appointments in MyHealtheVet?
- If they're not sure, confirm they're a MHV user.
- If they don't use MHV or don't know:
   - Do you ever check your Benefits on VA.gov?
     - If no, switch to alternate
     - If yes, switch to task 2  

**Steps**

- Sign in (this will be specific to the user)
- Click [View my VA Appointments](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/appointments)

**Alternate**
Since we couldn't look at MyHealtheVet, I'll show some screenshots of it just to have a reference point. I'll share my screen.

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session?
