# Research Plan for VAOS Appointments Usability 


## Background

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

The VA Online Scheduling team has worked to evaluate the usability of the existing appointment list. A redesign of the appointment list was created based on the [feedback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/2022-appts-list-usability/research-findings.md) during Veteran research sessions. The usability of the redesign was then tested with Veterans and the findings were incorporated in updated designs. The VA Online scheduling team now seeks feedback from Veterans using screenreaders to validate the changes made to the appointment list for low and non-sighted Veterans. 

Also see [Product's initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/appointment-list/product-outline-appointment-list-2022.md).

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase 📈

-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an after visit summary, a print functionality on the appointment list page, and ease of navigation with updated breadcrums.
-   
Decrease 📉

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it.

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

-   MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

-   MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
-   MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

-   Maintaining my emotional health
-   Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

-   MTM: Taking care of my health
-   MTM: Managing my declining health

Research goals
--------------

The goal of this research is to twofold: verify that logged in Veterans are able to utilize recently added features (UAT) and also to understand their mental models as they navigate through Appointments with the updated navigation and UI chanages (Usability). 

Goal 1: (UAT) Verify that logged in Veterans are able to utilize recently added features.
- 
- 

Goal 2: (Usability) Understand their mental models as they navigate through Appointments with the updated navigation and UI chanages. 
- 
- 
### Outcome

We will use the findings to:

- Validate breadcrumb and URL updates.
- Validate the changes to the navigation descriptive back link.
- To validate the print button design or make iterations based on feedback.
- To understand and validate assumptions around the current facility/clinic selection process for direct scheduling.
- To understand and validate assumptions around the current provider selection for Community Care appointments. 
- Validate the After-visit summary is populating with user data as expected. 

### Hypotheses

When logged in Veterans are in the appointments feature on VA.gov:

-   They will be able to navigate their appointments as expected.
-   They will be able to print a list of their (upcoming, pending, past) appointments. 
-   They will be able to find the information they need to attend/join their appointments.
-   They will be able to find and review their after visit summary


Method
------

We'll run a moderated usability test on the appointments list redesign.

This test will include 2 versions of the appointments list:
-   Mobile
-   Desktop

### Location

Remote, over Zoom.
