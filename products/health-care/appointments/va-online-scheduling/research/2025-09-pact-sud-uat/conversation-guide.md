# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about making updates to health care information.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. How often do you schedule appointments online?
2. Can you tell us what your experience was like the last time you scheduled an
appointment online?

Today, we are going to have you go through several scheduling scenarios. We will ask you to give your thoughts as you go.

Please note, if you go all the way through, you will end up scheduling an appointment. So, unless you actually want that appointment, we will not have you actually click for the last step.

Since the interview is about health care appointments, please know that your comfort is very important. If at any point you feel uncomfortable discussing something or completing a task, just let me know. We can pause or stop the session at any time.

Okay, now I will have you log in to your VA.gov account. Once you are logged in, please share your screen. And please make sure that anything else you don’t want me to see is not up on your screen.

## First Task: [Schedule a primary care appoinment] - 10 minutes

Imagine that you want to schedule a primary care appointment. Use the screen to
navigate and schedule that appointment. As you go, please “think out loud” through each step explaining why you click where you click and anything else that you are thinking. For example, if there is anything visually you like or if anything is confusing, let us know. We may ask you questions along the way.

- Possible probing questions:
  - Why did you click there?
  - What do you think about the information displayed on this screen?
  - **Reminder for moderator to stop the user after the Calendar page**

**Follow-ups After Task Completion:**
- On a scale of 1-5, 1 being very challenging and 5 being very easy, how did you
find it to select a clinic for a primary care appointment, and why?
- Does your primary care office have physician assistants or nurse practitioners
available to meet?
    - If yes - have you ever met with one of them?
- Go back to the clinic selection page.
  - How did you know which clinic to select?
  - Do you recognize any clinics? If yes, what’s your experience with the
clinic?

assistant vs. physician/medical doctor/MD?

unsure which option to choose - Ask: How would you make
this list easier to choose from?
    - What do you think about the connection between clinics and types
of care?

# Post PACT task questions - 10 minutes

Have you ever heard of something called “PACT” or “Patient Aligned Care Team” or
“primary care team?”

**If yes:**
- Can you tell me who is part of your primary care team and what are their roles?
- How does knowing your primary care team assignment change how you select
care, location, or clinics?
- What information about your primary care team do you wish you saw during
scheduling?
- Does the idea of seeing information related to your primary care team in the
scheduling flow make you feel more confident in your choice of clinic? Why or
why not?
  - Probe: What could increase your confidence even more?
 
**If no:**
No worries – PACT stands for “Patient Aligned Care Team.” It’s a team of VA
clinicians—including your primary care provider, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, social worker, and pharmacist—who work together to manage your care. Think of it as your own dedicated healthcare team.
  - Does that definition make sense to you?
  - What about that idea seems helpful—or confusing—to you?
  - How do you imagine this team would fit into scheduling your appointments?

What questions do you have about how your primary care team might change where or
when you book care?

## Fourth Task: [Schedule a Mental Health Appointment] - 10 minutes

For this next scenario, we are going to imagine that you have concerns about unhealthy use of drugs or alcohol and that you’d like to schedule an appointment to discuss this.

**Let participant get to type of care page before asking the question below**

Before you navigate, tell me which appointment type you are considering selecting and why.

**If they don’t say mental health: ask them to explain their thinking and then direct them to mental health and ask:**
  - What types of care do you think are included in mental health?

**If they say mental health, follow-up with:**
  - What types of care do you think are included in mental health?
  - Are there other appointment types you considered before settling on mental
health?

**Navigation**: Okay, now could you please show me how you’d do that here? As you go, please “think out loud” through each step explaining why you click where you click and anything else that you are thinking. For example, if there is anything visually you like or if anything is confusing, let us know. We may ask you questions along the way.

  - Possible probing questions:
    - Why did you click there?
    - What do you think about the information displayed on this screen?
    -   **Reminder for moderator to stop the user from clicking the final
button to schedule**

**Follow-up After Task Completion:**
While on the sub-type page:
  - What do you think about how these mental health appointments are organized?
  - How do the descriptions provided compare to what you expected to be included
in mental health?
  - How would you describe the difference between the first two types of mental health care? 
  - Go back to the first list of appointment types. If you were creating a list of appointment types, what changes would you make so it’s easier for someone to
find the right kind of care?
  - If they don’t mention mental health; specifically probe about the mental
health care type
  - I’m now going to show you an image of another way we could present mental
health appointments. [Show user side by side images - option 2 and 3.](https://www.figma.com/design/HnExAM5SGNXzUlv9yRS87t/Working-File-%7C-Appointments-FE?node-id=6162-8257&t=PaavUKlSUUIOXwCj-0)
  - When you compare the list you originally saw (shown on the left) to a different list (shown on the right), which list do you prefer for scheduling an appointment related to unhealthy use of drugs or alcohol?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Before getting to the sub-groups, note what the participant expected to see.]
> - [Does the sub-types screen match their expectations?]
> - [Is the participant confused about SUD being a subset of mental health care
type?]
> - [Where (if at all) did participants note confusion?]

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


# Emergency Exit 🚨
