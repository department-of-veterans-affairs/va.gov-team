# Research Goals
Veterans schedule and manage their appointments in various ways, that include in person, by phone or online through the VAOS portal. A veteran can log onto VA.gov and enter the VAOS portal to schedule, request or cancel an appointment as well as view upcoming, past or pending appointments. The focus of this research was to validate the design change decisions, to improve Veterans overall experience with VAOS appointment management.
[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

The purpose of this research is to: 
1. Evaluate usability and value of the appointment list redesign.
2. Test a concept for changes to the appointments details page.



# Research Questions

1. Evaluate usability and value of the appointment list redesign.
- Can appointments be found by:
  - Date/Time?
  - Modality?
  - VA vs CC?
- Do the type of care and provider name make sense in the list?
- Does “Pending” and “Past” language make sense?
  - Are Pending and Past appointments easy to navigate to?
- Are the details pages easy to navigate to?
- Can participants easily understand the meaning of modality in the appointment list - do they understand where they need to be?
- Do Veterans need a physical print “button”?
- What would Veterans do next after viewing their appts in the list?
2. Test a concept for changes to the appointments details page.
- Is the information on the details pages:
  - Easy to understand?
  - Easy to scan?
- Does the back button on the details page make sense?


# Methodology 

We ran a moderated usability test on the appointments list redesign.

# Key Findings
1. **All participants (10 of 10)** were able to **scan through the appointment list** by date, time, status, and type of care. 
- Many participants wanted the reason for their appointment to be displayed on the appointment list. 
- Participants expressed an interest in access to secure messaging from the appointment list. 

2. **Several participants (4 of 10)** struggled to **differentiate between modality** icons - specifically the types of video appointments.

(Note: Outcomes would have differed if details pages were consistent with appointment list items.

3. **The majority of participants (8 of 10)** reported that they **would not print** their appointments from VAOS. 
- **All participants (10 of 10)** reported using other **digital methods** to manage their appointments. 

4. **Most participants (9 of 10)** clicked on the **past appointments** link without assistance from the facilitator. 

- **The majority of participants (8 of 10) did not click on the correct appointment** when asked to locate their **most recent** appointment. 

5. **All participants (10 of 10) found the details pages easy** to navigate and the information easy to find. 
- Participants wanted **phone number ext, providers name, help number** and **“join now”** button added.
- Some participants noted that the **only two CTA’s were to cancel or reschedule** with no other options. 
- Participants wanted to know the reason for canceled appointments. 

6. **Most (9 of 10) participants used the back link** to navigate to the previous page.

# Details of Findings and Recommendations

## 1. The appointment list was easy for participants to scan for information.

All participants (10 of 10) were able to scan through the appointment list and identify the following: 
- **Date** - What day the appointments will take place and are grouped by. 
- **Time** - What time the appointment will take place
- **Status** - Is the appointment canceled?
- **Provider** - Who is the appointment with?
- **Type of care** - What is the appointment for? (ie: primary care, sleep medicine, mental health)

   _“Looks like my [type of care] appointment is at [Date] and [Time]. It’s pretty explanatory and looks fairly simple. I see one appointment here has been canceled since it’s lined out, appointment with [provider].”_  
   
   -Participant 15  

4 participants wanted the reason for their appointment to be displayed on the appointment list as a way of reminding them what the appointment was for. This comment came prior to viewing appointment details, which lists the reason for the appointment (if provided) there.

<img width="1017" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-14 at 11 09 57 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92750161/195913279-a4c30e75-701c-4c30-8bde-66bc46cc9145.png">

The above image shows the details page with additional details that the Veteran had provided when scheduling the appointment.

## 2. Some participants did not understand modality. 
A number of participants (4 of 10) struggled to differentiate between the different modality icons. When asked to read through and interpret an appointment on the appointment list, one participant assumed that the building icon (for video appointment at VA) was a prototype error. At least 4 participants reported that they had never heard of a video appointment that took place at a facility.

**Note:** The primary focus of this study was the appointment list. The prototype only showcased a select number of details page types. The participants may have had a different experience if when they clicked on an appointment, the information on the details pages matched that of the appointment they clicked on. Four participants clicked on the details for a video appointment at a facility and were routed to a video appointment at home, giving them no additional information on how a video appointment at a facility would be conducted. Outcomes may have differed had the details pages been consistent with appointment list items. 

   _“I don't know why that [appointment] video is showing a building. On the second, it shows a camera and this one's a building. So that's a little confusing.”_
   -Participant 15  

   _“I see this video appointment with a VA device. I'm not sure what that would be. I guess if they gave me a device in person at [medical center]. So it's a video appointment, but I'd have to go to [medical center] to use the video?”_   
   -Participant 7  
   
**Recommendation: Simplify the usage of modality language.**

Revisit the language and iconography, indicating where a person should attend their appointment. There was confusion around the appointment modality. Simplifying this will help mitigate confusion and give Veterans a more clear understanding of where they need to physically be for their appointments. 

<img width="863" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-14 at 10 03 20 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92750161/195902380-4357586a-fbdb-4302-95b6-2b6ac8758bac.png">  

## 3. The majority of participants would not print their appointment list. 

Most of the participants (8 of 10) reported that they would not want to print an individual appointment or list. When asked what they would do alternatively, all participants (10 of 10) reported using these digital methods to reference their appointments:

- Three (3 of 10) participants said they use email to reference their upcoming appointments. 
- Six (6 of 10) participants reported that they use their digital calendar to reference their appointments. 
- One participant said they take a photo of their appointment and keep it in their phone to reference their appointment. 
 
   “I get emails and I save those rather than print it.”  
   -Participant 5  

   “No, I don't [print] cause when I go they usually give me print out, and when I get home I just put it in my [digital] calendar.”  
   -Participant 15  

**Recommendation: Do not include "print all" link on appointment list**

Because the majority of participants reported that they do not print their appointments, consider leaving the print link out of the appointment list.

**Recommendation: Include an "add all to calendar" link to the appointment list**

With the majority of participants reporting that they used their digital calendar as a way of managing their appointments, Adding a link to "add all to calendar" on the appointment list would save Veterans time and minimize the number of clicks to add multiple appointments to their calendar. 

## 4. The order of past appointment list is confusing. 

Participants were asked to find their most recent appointment and most participants (8 of 10) clicked on the first appointment at the top of the list. This suggests that participants would expect to see their most recent appointments displayed at the top of the list and their older appointments to follow. 

<img width="277" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-11 at 1 33 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92750161/195192806-6811986d-a6d1-4ab0-9206-587b9ede8dfa.png">

The above image shows the current order for past visits - oldest to newest.

**Recommendation: Change past appointment list order**

We suggesat reordering the past appointments list, showing the most recent appointments at the top and oldest appointments last. This change would make it easier for Veterans to navigate their past appointments.

## 5. Details pages were easy to navigate. 

All participants (10 of 10) successfully navigated to the details pages. They reported that they were easy to read and the information was pertinent. When asked what could be improved on, there were a variety of answers:

- Phone number extension - There was concern that calling the facility number would put them into the VA phone system and that a direct extension to the clinic was important.

- Provider name -  The list view showed the provider name, but was not listed in the details pages. 

- A help number - There is a VA-wide help number, however participants were concerned that if something specific to the appointment were to happen (ie: video connect issues, phone number discrepancies) a direct help number would be helpful. 

Two participants struggled to exit the details pages, noting that the only two options were to cancel or reschedule the appointment. It is speculated that they either did not see the back button, believed the appointment to be a modal that they would need to close or exit out of, or were under the impression they needed to select one of the two options at the bottom.

For canceled appointment details pages, (4 of 10) participants wanted to know why their appointment was canceled. 

**Recommendation: Change Details page CTA's** 

Reconsider the CTA buttons at the bottom of details pages.

## 6. The back link was easy to find and use

100% of participants using a desktop computer (5 of 5) used the back link on the page to navigate back to the previous page. 80% of participants using a mobile device (4 of 5) used the back link on the page to navigate back to the previous page. One participant navigated back to the previous screen using the back button on their device.

**Recommendation: Replace breadcrumb with back button upon entry to VAOS.**

There are several page sequences within VAOS that require users to move through specific steps. The breadcrumb does not include any navigation point within those sequences within VAOS, only the entry point.
We suggest adding a back link in place of the breadcrumb on the past and pending appointment list pages as well as all of the details pages. Doing so will provide Veterans with a more consistent and simple way to navigate online scheduling. This is also recommended throughout the scheduling flow in VAOS. 


# Additional Insights

### 1. The term pending was confusing for some participants.
Some participants (4 of 10) were unable to locate “pending” appointments without intervention/assistance from the facilitator. After further explanation, they were all able to find the pending appointment, suggesting a discrepancy in naming. When asked how they interpreted the word “pending”, some (2 of 10) participants thought they were upcoming appointments, while one believed a pending appointment would mean an error in scheduling. 

**Note**: In previous studies, the term “requests” caused confusion for participants. Bother “pending” and “request” are potentially problematic.

### 2. Need a way to search or sort through past appointments. 
participants were successful (9 of 10) in finding and clicking on the past appointments link. When asked to locate a specific appointment on the past appointments list, several participants wanted a way to filter or search through those appointments, by various data points. 

**Note**: The date filter was not included in the test and will need to be added. 

### 3. Access to secure messaging
Participants want a way to message their provider at various times throughout the scheduling process, including while managing appointments. . 

### 4. Small text
At least one participant with low visibility expressed difficulty seeing the links in the details pages.

# Next Steps

The next steps in this process are as follows:
1. Engineers to build a proof of concept for appointment list designs. 
2. Update appointment list designs based on findings and recommendations from this study. 
3. Create a screen-reader usability test using a low-code prototype
4. Make changes to details page designs based on findings and recommendations from this study.
5. Further testing on details page usability. 

# Further research needed

All requested demographics were met and no further testing will be needed for this study. Design changes and further testing will be conducted for design change recommendations for details page.
