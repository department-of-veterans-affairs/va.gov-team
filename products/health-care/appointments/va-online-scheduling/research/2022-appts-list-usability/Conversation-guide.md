## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ciera I will be walking you through this session today. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appointment list on va.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

Thank you! 

As I said, today you will be interacting with a prototype of the design. In order to do that, I’ll need you to share your screen.

I’ll walk you through the process of sharing your screen, then I'll send you a link to the demo tool.

* First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?

* Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.

Now I'm going to have you share your screen, and then I'll send you a link to a prototype so we can look at that together.

* Use chat to send user [link to desktop prototype.](https://www.figma.com/proto/JpGM8LGBCqAlL8qh3DmFk8/Home-Page-Redesign?page-id=1160%3A65447&node-id=1334%3A68885&viewport=-1066%2C-1078%2C0.05&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=1334%3A68885&hotspot-hints=0&hide-ui=1)

* Use chat to send user [Link to mobile prototype.](https://www.figma.com/proto/JpGM8LGBCqAlL8qh3DmFk8/Home-Page-Redesign?page-id=1160%3A65447&node-id=1334%3A70134&viewport=-1066%2C-1078%2C0.05&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=1334%3A70134&hotspot-hints=0&hide-ui=1)

* Talk participant through screen sharing so they can share their screen.

As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

#### If can't share

* Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok? [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

#### After prototype is open

Thanks!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
