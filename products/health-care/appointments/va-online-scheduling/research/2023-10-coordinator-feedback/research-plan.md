# Research Plan for MHV and MVH Coordinator Feedback

## Background
See Research Strategy: Collecting Feedback from MHV Coordinators on Health Applications


## Research Goals

### Outcome
* Learn what scope of the appointments process MHV and MY VA Health Coordinators help Veterans with.
* Learn about any common issues they face when helping Veterans schedule appointments, and finding new health care providers.  This will help inform our approach to provider-based scheduling. 
* Build connections with these Coordinators to get future feedback.

### Research questions

Where do Coordinators help Veterans the most across the journey of an appointment? Some areas to ask about:
* Finding facility
* Finding a provider
* Scheduling an appointment, whether new or follow-up care
* Finding their way to the appointment
* Navigating a facility
* Checking in
* Talking to their doctor
* Checking out
* Understanding next steps for care
* Filing for travel pay
* Understanding their after visit summary

What areas do they help in the most? What help do they provide?

Of the areas that are most important to us, what are the biggest pain points?
* Finding and enrolling in a facility
* Finding a provider
* Scheduling an appointment

If they are a My VA Health Coordinator, what unique problems do they run into?

How would they prefer to be involved in conversations in the future, and are they willing to give us regular feedback on features?

## Methodology

Weâ€™ll interview a group of MHV Coordinators and a separate group of MVH Coordinators. These will be scheduled for an hour.


## Timeline
TBD (tentatively November 2023).
