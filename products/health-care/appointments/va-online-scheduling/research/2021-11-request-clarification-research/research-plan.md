VAOS Requests Discovery - Research Plan
=============================================

Background
----------

### VA Online Scheduling

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans to request and schedule health care appointments if they are logged into VA.gov. It is one [channel](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/design/scheduling-channels-touchpoints.md) Veterans can use to schedule appointments.

### Problem

We've heard in previous research and user feedback that Veterans are generally confused by the concept of appointment requests in VAOS:

[2019 VAOS research](department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/2020-07-vaos-mvp-and-express-care-user-research/2020-july-VAOSR-EC-research-report.md#findings>)

[2021 appointments list usability test](department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/2021-01-appts-list-test/findings-report.md#appointment-requests-continue-to-create-confusion>)

### Assumptions

We believe that:

-   Veterans don't see a distinction between a request for an appointment and a self-scheduled appointment
-   It isn't clear when an appointment becomes a request in VAOS
-   The language "request" doesn't clearly explain what an appointment request is
-   Veterans don't know where to find information about their existing appointment requests

### OCTO-DE Objectives

[OCTO-DE objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) this research supports:
-   Increase: Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov
-   Decrease: 
    -   Call center volume, wait time, time to resolution
    -   Time to successfully complete and submit online transactions


Research Goals
--------------

1.  Learn how appointment requests are confusing to Veterans
2.  Validate concepts for reducing that confusion.

### Outcome

We'll use these findings to make appointment requests easier to understand.

### Research questions

-   How are requests confusing Veterans during the scheduling process? When viewing their appointments on the VAOS home page?
-   What value do Veterans find in appointment requests?

### Hypotheses

We believe that requests are confusing _during scheduling_ because there is no indication when a self scheduled appointment becomes a request. If we clearly show when this transition happens, and offer alternative options to making a request, Veterans will be able to make choices about how to schedule their appointment that better fit their needs.

We believe that, once an appointment is requested, Veterans expect to see them listed with their existing appointments. If we call out their alongside other appointments, Veterans will be able to more easily understand what requests are, and how to find details about them.

Method
------

To get a better understanding of why Veterans are confused by the current state of requests, we'll run a usability test with participants, focusing on:
-   Requesting an appointment.
-   Finding their appointment requests.

### Location

Remote, via Zoom.

### Research materials

-   [Conversation guide](conversation-guide.md)
-   [Prototype](https://va-scheduling.invisionapp.com/console/share/EW35S0RT8V)

Recruitment
-----------

### Recruitment approach

We will use Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research.

### Recruitment criteria

10-12 Veterans with VA health care established at facilities.

**Primary criteria**

- Veteran has received VA health care.
- Must be able to join via a desktop or laptop device. This test does not support mobile devices.

Pilot Date/time is TBD

### Research sessions

This study will start on or after Monday the 8th of November, 2021.

### Length of sessions

Sessions will be scheduled for 1 hour.
