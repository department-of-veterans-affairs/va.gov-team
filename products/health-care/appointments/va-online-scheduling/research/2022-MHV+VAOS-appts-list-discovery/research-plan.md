# Research plan for VAOS and MHV appointments list discovery

## Background

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans to request and schedule health care appointments if they are logged in to VA.gov. It is one [channel](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/design/scheduling-channels-touchpoints.md) Veterans can use to schedule appointments.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
* Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase 📈
* Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

Decrease 📉
* Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran Journey
Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up
* MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself
* MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
* MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots
* Maintaining my emotional health
* Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring
* MTM: Taking care of my health
* MTM: Managing my declining health

## Research Goals	
During this study we hope to learn: 
* What Veterans find helpful and/or what's confusing in the current iteration of the appointments list in both MHV and VAOS.
* What Veterans who are familiar with MHV find confusing when viewing their appointments in VAOS.

We also hope to validate a design path for the VAOS appointments list.

### Outcome
The VAOS team will use this research to identify anything lacking in the VAOS appointment list. Based on this we will develop designs to improve the content and interactions of the appointment list.

We will also validate a concept for a more condensed desktop view of the VAOS appointment list. This early feedback will help us decide how to rework these designs.

### Research questions

* What information do Veterans need in an appointments list to make it useful?
* What will be confusing when transitioning from the MHV appointments list to VAOS?

### Hypothesis

Veterans largely use the MyHealtheVet appointments list to understand and manage their health care appointments. We believe, as more Veterans transition to VAOS to do the same tasks, they may be confused by content and interactions that are different between the two lists.

## Method	

First, we'll run a **contextual inquiry** by asking participants to access the MHV appointments list and VAOS appointments list, and observe how they use those features.

Then we'll run a **concept test** by showing participants a concept of the VAOS home page on desktop and asking them questions about how this might change their experience.

### Location

This will be a moderated remote study, over Zoom.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

Perigean to recruit Veterans for this study.

### Recruitment criteria

12 Veterans who are active users of MyHealtheVet.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

Participants must be active users of MyHealtheVet appointments:
- **Screener question (yes/no):** Have you logged in to MyHealtheVet to view your appointments in the last 6 months? 
- **Screener question (yes/no):** Are you willing to sign in to My HealtheVet during this study so our research team can learn how you use this tool? We will not record any of your personal health information; the focus of this study is to learn how you use this tool.
Participants must answer yes to both questions to qualify for the study.     

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

Please aim for the targets below to recruit a representative sample of Veterans for this study. Each number represents the minimum number of Veterans to recruit for (based on 12 participants).

- At least 6 Veterans aged 55-64
- At least 6 Veterans who have a cognitive disability
- At least 3 people of color
- At least 3 Veterans living in rural areas
- At least 3 Veterans with no degree
- At least 3 Veterans with an Other than honorable discharge
- At least 3 Veterans of immigrant origin
- At least 2 women
- At least 1 Veteran who identifies as LGBTQ+
