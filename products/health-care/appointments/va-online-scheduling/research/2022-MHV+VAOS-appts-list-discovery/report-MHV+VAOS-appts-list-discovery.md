# Research Goals

In 2021, the VA Online Scheduling (VAOS) and MyHealtheVet (MHV) teams collaborated on a gap analysis between the two product's appointment lists. The goal was to examine whether the VAOS appointments list was providing the same information and value as the equivalent list in MyHealtheVet. 

This study is a follow-up to that gap analysis. The goal for this research is to identify anything participants find lacking or confusing in the VAOS appointment list, in comparison with the same list in MHV.

From this research, we will determine what changes are needed to the VAOS list beyond what was  identified in the gap analysis.

We plan to validate the findings from this concept study with usability research.

# Research Questions

* What information do Veterans need in an appointments list to make it useful?
* What will be confusing when transitioning from the MHV appointments list to VAOS?

# Methodology 

We asked participants to access the MHV and VAOS appointments lists and provide feedback on how those two lists met their needs, by comparison.

We then showed participants a concept redesign of the VAOS appointments list and asked them questions about how this might change their experience.

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Veterans largely use the MyHealtheVet appointments list to understand and manage their health care appointments. We believe, as more Veterans transition to VAOS to do the same tasks, they may be confused by content and interactions that are different between the two lists._

_Likely true_

Most participants were confused that there were two similar places to view and manage appointments that required separate logins.

Also, participants were confused by the clinic name. For context, the MHV list offers one piece of data that the VAOS list does not: the "patient-friendly clinic name". However, this data is often an internal code familiar to the facility. One participant described it this way: "when you mix military and medical jargon you get something wacky."

We saw participants cull different information from this name: type of care, modality (how they attend, whether over the phone), and clinic location. But the actual information provided was different depending on the facility and the participant.

Aside from those points, participants were generally able to understand and use both lists. They noted challenges and positive features from both which are covered in detail under Key Findings.

# Details of Findings 

## What will be confusing when transitioning from the MHV appointments list to VAOS?

### Most participants were confused that there are two different sites that list their appointments

When asked about the most confusing aspect of all appointment lists they saw (MHV, VAOS, and the concept), 6/9 participants said it was that there were two sites that do the same thing but require an additional login.

> "I hate that when I clicked on schedule an appointment, I must go to another site to log back in. It should be on one page." - P6

> "The log-in process is frustrating because you are already logged into MHV and when you need to schedule an appointment why would I need to log in again?" - P10

> "Why would I go through the whole process of navigating here if [MHV] has everything I need?" - P12 

### Clinic names confused participants

7/9 participants found the clinic names in MHV, and in the concept, confusing. 

4/9 said it would be better if they were called the same name as is used at the facility. They indicated they would expect to use the clinic name to:
* Understand what the appointment is for.
* Differentiate their appointments.
* Find their way at the facility.

Participants indicated that these needs could also be met by providing "type of care" and better clinic location information. The next two findings address these needs.

> "I happen to know where this is, but I don’t know if this clinic name (also called: WPB PACT) would be very helpful. I know it is also called the Red clinic so that name would be more helpful than the name provided." -P7

> "You should have the Section of the Clinic (Clinics inside Clinics). In one building you will have multiple Clinics for different services (Lab/Physical Therapy/Primary Care), I just need this to tell me why I am going there." -P2

> "Clinic names just tells you what kind of appointment is going on, and what I might need for the appointment." -P3

### Some participants were confused to see unfamiliar facilities when navigating from MHV to VAOS.

When scheduling online from MHV one screen asks Veterans to choose from facilities where they are registered. This directs Veterans to scheduling portals for sites that don't use VAOS.

<img width="878" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 8 43 10 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2536801/155178493-b442db89-b737-4cdf-99aa-c6c7f3130db8.png">
*MHV's list of sites scheduling options.*

We've heard in previous research<sup>1</sup> that these facilities are often unfamiliar to Veterans, or simply nowhere near their current location, as they may have visited them once and not known they were being registered.

Note: While we didn't see it in the study, VAOS also asks Veterans who are registered at Cerner facilities to choose from all their registered facilities. This repeated question may add another step and potentially more confusion when navigating from MHV to VAOS.

> "I wish they would remove the old clinics that I no longer go to off this list." - P5

> "I am not sure why [Facility name] is on there; that is 4 hours away." - P12

## What information do Veterans need in an appointments list to make it useful?

### Participants wanted to be able to easily differentiate appointments in VAOS

Date and time was the first piece of information participants used to differentiate their appointments. After that, they reported that the following information would have been helpful:
* 7/9 Type of care
* 4/9 Clinic name - as it is called at the VA facility.
* 2/9 Whether the appointment was for, or connected to, labs. 

> "I would want to know what type of appointment it is right upfront. A lot of vets are getting care outside of the VA, and I would want to see that at the first glance" - P5

> "The clinic names under the Medical Center name needs to be clearer because I have no idea what any of those letters mean. I want to know what clinic the appointments are with." - P11

> "This one [VAOS list] does not tell me that this is for lab work, as in the first [MHV] list it told me that this appointment was for lab work. It told me exactly what it was for. The Clinic Name states that it is the Laboratory. It just needs to be the same across the two." - P12

> "Under the Medical Center Division, it does not tell me what clinic or what the appointment is about. Now I must find out because I do not know what appointment that clinic is for." - P10

### Participants wanted to be able to easily understand how they will attend, and find their way to their appointments

Participants first wanted to know *how* they would attend the appointment. Along with the 8 participants who were excited to see clear modality information in the concept, 4/9 asked for clearer information about whether the appointment is in person, over the phone, or over video.

For in-person clinics, the top requests were:
* 4/9 Clinic name - as it is called at the VA facility
* 4/9 Medical center/division name
* 3/9 Floor number 
* 3/9 Room number

For video appointments, 4/9 wanted to see a link to log in to the appointment.

Additionally, 2/9 wanted to see instructions about how to check-in, or what to bring to the appointment.

> "Where it states the clinic name under the Medical Center it needs to have friendly clinic names and the exact location of the clinic. Radiology, Women’s Clinic, Dental Clinic, and Red Clinic. I know I can go and there are signs that tell you where to go that most people can find it, but it makes it easier when you walk in the building you have an idea of where you are going." - P7

> [Notices MHV detail says appt is for In-person, Telehealth, Phone] - "That's confusing. Is it all three?" - P2

>  [Looking at past appointments] "If anything, it is not very clear on where it took place. Like in-person or a phone call. It is not something I would look at and know if I went in or if it was a phone call. Not very many details on what each appointment was about." - P11

> "There is a standardized naming process and there is also a patient-friendly name, but on here it seems it is either the standardized name or it may have both names. That's frustrating to patients who may not understand the name. It needs to be the 'patient-friendly' name so they know where they are going. Clinic Profile Team who lists the clinic names that are provided by the clinics. The wayfinding for Veterans is not the best when it came to this list. The fact you can not see where you are supposed to go is the problem." - P3, who is familiar with the scheduling process from the facility side as well as being a Veteran.

### Participants wanted tools to help them contact their provider

The top requests from participants included:
* 5/9 Phone number and the direct extension to the clinic would be helpful, so they could avoid navigating the call center phone tree.
* 5/9 Provider name, and potentially a way to contact them.

Some participants indicated that they would use this list in conjunction with secure messaging, by identifying a provider, then sending them a message.

> "I never use [the main number for the facility]. I have the clinic extensions in my phone contact list and a couple of nurses’ stations in there also." - P12

> "I would like it if you could secure message your provider from this list. I do like that you have a contact number for the providers under the details page. Just being able to send a message to your provider based on this appointment, or their clerk to see if there is any more information I may need for the upcoming appointment would be helpful." - P10

## Will the proposed concept address Veteran data needs, and address any potential gaps between VAOS and MHV?

### Almost all participants responded positively to the proposed concept

8/9 participants had a strong positive reaction when asked for their first impressions of the concept. They were especially happy to be able to clearly see the modality of the appointment.

Participants also had positive reactions to the information layout, and the minimal content on the page (compared to MHV).

> First thing I see are the icons to connect by video, phone, office visit. I like the fact that the icons jump right out at you. That’s the first thing I notice. - P1

> "This looks great, a grid, like the MyHealtheVet list" - P5

> "Dates are easy to scan, like on the 21st we have potentially four appts" - P3

### Some participants found the word "Pending" confusing in the concept

4/9 mentioned some confusion, thinking it was indicating upcoming appointments, or not sure what it meant. 

It wasn't clear how many of our participants were familiar with the concept of appointment requests, but we heard that at least some were not.

Additionally, this may have been due to an error in the concept. The upcoming appointments were actually dated as if they had occurred in the past, so some participants thought "Pending" indicated their upcoming appointments.

> "Pending - what does pending mean?" - P2

> "I am not sure what pending could be, unless it is an appointment you have tried to make, and you are waiting for the clerk to approve your appointment." - P10

# Additional Insights

## Participants said they don't use the MHV appointments list often; when they do, it's generally to validate that the appointment is properly booked

5/9 participants said they don't use the appointments list much. No participant indicated that they used the list on a daily or weekly basis.

Participants said they use the appointments list to:
* 5/9: Verify that their upcoming appointments are properly scheduled by VA
* 3/9: Check if they have upcoming appointments
* 2/9: Check against their personal calendar to make sure they're not double-booked
* 2/9: Use past appointments information to plan for annual appointments

# Recommendations

### Provide clear information that answers basic questions about appointments in the list

Based on this (and previous) research, we believe the following information would be the ideal summary of a single appointment. Symbols indicate whether VAOS currently has the ability to display data for all appointment types:
* ✅ Always available
* ⏺ Sometimes available
* ❌ Not available

**When is it?**

     ✅ Date, time, timezone, weekday

**What's it for?**

     ⏺ Type of care
     ⏺ Provider name
     ❌ If labs are needed

**How will I attend?**

     ✅ Modality (in person, telehealth, etc.)
     
**Where will I attend?**

In person: 

     ❌ Check-in clinic name
     ❌ Room number  
     ❌ Building name, number 
     ⏺ Medical center or facility name
   
Video at VA: 

     ❌ Check-in clinic name
     ❌ Room number  
     ❌ Building name, number 
     ⏺ Medical center or facility name
   
Video at ATLAS: 

     ❌ ATLAS facility name
     ✅ ATLAS facility address
     ✅ Access code
   
Video via GFE:

     ✅ Short summary of how to join
   
Video at home:
   
     ✅ Short summary of how to join
     ✅ Link to join appointment
   
Phone:
   
     ✅ Short summary of how to join
 
**Has it been canceled?**

     ✅ Status showing if canceled

Note: VAOS defines the data, or content displayed for these data points:

* Modality
* Status showing if canceled
* Short summary of how to join


### Build on the proposed desktop and print layout

Participants responded well to the new concept. Given that, we feel comfortable using that as a basis for our next iteration and running a usability test on the result.

The greatest value in the updated concept was showing clear modality information. We recommend keeping that and the overall layout while adjusting the other data based on our earlier recommendation in this report.

We also recommend reviewing the Pending appointments language when testing the updated prototype, as this was a potential source of confusion for our participants.

### Review the Cerner offboarding interaction when navigating from MHV to VAOS

Currently, both MHV and VAOS provide users the option to schedule through different portals when they are registered at Cerner facilities. Consider moving this functionality entirely to VAOS as a way to reduce duplication and simplify the scheduling flow.

Also, note the work started in VAOS ticket [34234](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vaos---productdesign-5fff340c2d80a4000fb6f69c/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/34234) to help simplify this list, and the work to personalize this list (ticket [26442](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/26442)). 

### Advocate for clear clinic names

We do not recommend adding the current code-like clinic names to the appointments list at this time. These names are inconsistent and confusing, so they don't  provide value to Veterans who aren't versed in the clinic's internal coding system.

We do recommend technical discovery to surface clearer clinic name data. 

We also recommend running discovery with facilities to better understand what value the codes provide schedulers, and discover if sources of clearer clinic information exist.

### Consider providing a path to Secure Messenger from the appointment list.

Participants reported that they often follow up with their providers after they review their appointments. Consider providing a simple path to the secure messaging tool from the appointments list. 

This could benefit if the context of the provider is maintained, or the appointment from which the message originated. This may mean opening a message directly to the provider, or including information about the appointment in the message body.


# Next Steps

* VAOS will share findings and recommendations with the MHV team.
* VAOS will work with the team's PO and stakeholders to determine how to best advocate for clearer clinic names.
* VAOS will work with stakeholders to determine the best way to communicate modality information
* VAOS will validate the situations where the type of care can/can't be shown
* VAOS will run discovery to see if it's possible to surface:
    * Lab information or details 
    * Clearer clinic name and location information
    * Facility campus map or location pages
* VAOS will design a concept for a secure message flow that allows Veterans to directly message their providers.
