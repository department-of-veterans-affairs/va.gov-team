## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
  > Sure

*Start recording.*

  - **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I recordmy screen the audio as we talk today?**
    > Yes

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 
  > Yes. Generally to ignite it I make a call to my clinic. 
- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online? 
  > Yes I am but I do believe somewhere in my past I tried to make an appointment and I could not. I believe it may have been due to my location and the location didn’t have the ability to make the appointment online 

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments
Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information.  
  > I see the COVID information there and I move along schedule and view va appointment, more information about COVID. What caught my eye is the fastest way to make an appointment is to call. To view or make an appointment I would go ahead and sign in to make an appointment.
  > Sign in to va.gov, I have both of these. I will use myhealthevet. Try this I think this will work. Yeah. Okay, it is asking me to receive a code because I have another tab. It will text me because I have my phone right here. Again COVID stock message, schedule and view the appointment. I think this is where I came from. Once I had already seen  the page and digested the information I expected to go to the va appointments tab like I selected.  
- Have you seen or used this tool before? 
  > NO. I have to tell you I am 100 percent sure, here we could not make appointments online. I am 99.5 percent sure. Anything about making appointments online is new to me. Viewing appointments I could do. 

## Section 2: Appointments list
We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 

- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page. I am able to schedule an appointment. 
  > I can select the upcoming and past appointment . past appointments is good that you can view them.
  - If you wanted to look at what is of interest: 
    > I wanted to know not only when but if they were carried through or cancelled. A lot of the time they were canceled and it is good to note that they were canceled due to COVID instead of me because I don’t want to have the discredits of having a series of cancelled appointments on my sheet. 
  - Enough for you: 
    > No, I want to know who cancelled. In this case I know who did it because they called me, the VA cancelled. I want to have the ability to point to the appointments I did or didn’t cancel. It is probably a good next level; it is not the highest need for me but if I had a second it is why. Can I say I was sick on that day or was it because I forgot the appointment. In other words I am not being faithful to my appointments.
  - What if it is reschedule: 
    > That is cool but I want to know it. Like the VA called and he is on active duty and won’t be back for 3 months. 
  - Upcoming appointment: 
    > I can go back and look at history because I will log it in my brain when I have questions. Upcoming I can see what is on deck for me and if it is active or canceled so I can see what is ahead.
  - Correct to you: 
    > I know the canceled one is correct, this one here for August 25 with Dr. Gerwig I don’t think that is correct. Let me think for a second. I apologize I just had the VA replace a hip for me so there has been a lot of appointments and medical tasks I had to do. I would say this information I am looking for in this format, is it the same on myhealthevet. Okay. If it is then yes this is correct. I have to make a call to my physical therapy this week to get that set up but they don’t have anything in there for me. What I am looking at to the best of my knowledge is accurate. 

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today? 
  > The diabetes eye clinic would need to be reschedule, actually I need to schedule for podiatry. 
  - If YES:
    - Great, let's try to schedule it.
  - Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
    > I would click schedule an appointment. (reading page) I would have to go with primary because they are part of my regular care. Clicks continue. 
  - Have you seen this page before?
- [go through each page of the flow]
  - *Select a location page*
    - If a user is registered at 2+ VAMCs, ask: do you recognize these locationsin the list? Do you know what it means? 
      > I recognize them but none of them are mine.
        - What do you mean: 
          > I go to Rochester clinic here where I live. Buffalo is our hospital and the other two are a bit father. I would opt for buffalo because I want to go to my facility. Its not there. Let’s try Bath, the Rochester Calkins VA clinic. 
        - What would you have done: 
          > No, well I would have done the trail and error but if I don’t know computers I would be lost because I do not see the clinic. If I were not computer savvy there is a fear of messing something off or going somewhere where they will be lost.  I am lucky I was able to do trail and error testing. 
  - *Select a date/time page*    
    > These are available dates to schedule the appointments(reading page). So this is prompting me to select three dates. I am not totally happy with.
    - What aren’t you happy with: 
      > When I want to schedule an appointment I want to schedule it. I don’t want to mess around and pick dates that I may have to wait a few days to see if that date will work for me. I want the date; I want the response now. I might have something in the background that needs its feedback. It will have me pic the dates and ill have them and wait a few days to find out. 

    > I have selected the dates and will continue. 
  - What will happen if you pick another date: 
    > it allowed me to pick a 4th and 5th and 6th. Maybe its just per month. I guess I can pick whatever I want. I will undo these. 
  - Continue:  
    > Choose a reason. Routine for me. It is routine . I would click continue. Choose type of appointment- office visit for podiatry. Then continue. Confirm contact information. Call at any time but selects only morning. Clicks continue. 
  - Do you think it is for a scheduler they would be able to schedule you based on information provided: 
    > No. I don’t know where we defined podiatry. Or did we. I think you had it in mind. I am not sure we specifically said podiatry. I can’t remember if I specified podiatry but I think it falls under general. It is possible if I go back to this link. I wonder if I will take me back to where I was. I ad selected primary care and no where it says podiatry. Maybe this is where I should specify it is for podiatry. I miss took what they were asking I thought they would ask me later on but I should have said it is a podiatry appointment. It has to be more specific. 
  - What would have helped you know to provide more details: 
    > Maybe additional verbiage that says what are you coming in for and lists the departments, like podiatry, optical. What is it. 
  - Review: 
    > Those are the dates, there is what I put in to why I am coming. How to be seen yup, it will be in office. Live and in person. What is call afternoon. I don’t know what that means. I requested appointments in the morning and this call afternoon I don’t know where it is coming form and I don’t think it is in my instructions. I am wondering what that is about. 
  - Do you see edit: 
    > what will that do: it will have me edit contact information. Ah, there’s the call afternoon. Alright. That’s me, I didn’t pick that up. I am cool with that. Although again it’s just me because I am weird. When I pulled in the information I picked noon to 4. Afternoon wasn’t what I was looking at . I was focusing on the time slots. When I get over here and it says call afternoon I wonder where it is coming from. To me maybe I would extend it to how they have it. Or if they just copied the text and put that in your contact details. 
  - How do you feel about the information: 
    > Good. A little bit hopeful that podiatry will recognize as why I am coming. Otherwise fine. 
It has been submitted and they will contact me to schedule the first appointment. I am on hold to hear back about this date and god help me if I have something critical I have to wait for this. 
  - What do you expect to happen: 
    > I expected I would make an appointment on the fly and I am placing information in and I will still get a call. The appointment will not be made until I get the call. I do not have the precision but at least I have an idea. 
  - What would you do now: 
    > If I am done making the appointment I would go to view appointments.
    > There’s my cancelled, there’s my confirmed, and there’s the pending. 
  - What do you think about the information: 
    > Good. I know what is active and what is not. The canceled and confirm stands out. I am really focusing on that, not all interested on what it is just when it is right now. The information is completed and it is at my clinic, its has directs and the reasons for the appointments. The information that is there I am happy with. It gives me what I need. 
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?

## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment?  
  > Yes right there. 
- Walk me through how you'd cancel this appointment. 
  > I am glad to see that they are calling me to attention here and asking me again if I really want to cancel it. Sometimes we hit things I didn’t want to. I know I can cancel it if I want but I don’t need to so I am cool with what I have. 
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? 
  > Yeah. You know let’s say a few days ago but after I made it and I am in here looking at upcoming appointment. My canceled one is cool it would be nice to know who canceled it and my confirmed is cool because I have the option to cancel if need. You have to realize I am an old guy and I made it a few days ago. It is pending and the time and date is to be determined. If I am supposed to be waiting on a call I might be reminded. I forgot what I ate for breakfast already. Doing this a few days ago it is confusing, I don’t know what I am waiting for. 
How soon would you expect to get a call: Realistically 1 to 2 days but I can’t say that will happen. I really am thankful for the VA and what they have done for me but I have seen things that could, should, or would only take 1 day to take 5-6 days. Stuff happens. I think it has to be nailed down and I think 1-2 days is a maximum. 
  - How would you want to be notified if you hadn’t heard from a scheduler: 
    > Well the beaty of secure message you don’t have to go through making calls. With secure messaging the efficiency is bult in. it might allow people to get through these fast and response within 1 or 2 days. I know not everyone uses it but if they would respond to a voicemail at least. Between email, texting, and smartphone functions there are ways to get the message out efficiently without leaving untold messages. Long winded answer I rely on secure messaging and I thought it was more out an urgent way of communication then what it is. 

## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes
- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov? 
  > Absolutely. It is a great tool. It would be nice but it is not a perfect world. The va has done so many great things, it is great things and the VA has been great to us. If it gets better that is all the better but again I take my comments not at criticism. 

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Thanks! 

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
- If YES: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
