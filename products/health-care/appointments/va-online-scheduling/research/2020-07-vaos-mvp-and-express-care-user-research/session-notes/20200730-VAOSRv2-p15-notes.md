## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**
  > Yupp that’s fine I give permission. 

## Section 0: Warm-up questions
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- Why do you make medical appointments? 
  > Whatever I have that is service connected or yearly physicals or have something that needs checked out I guess. 
  - Follow up:
    - Is this a recurring appointment?     
      > That is a correct statement, a yearly physical and a sudden illness. 
      - Is this appointment that needs to be in person?     
        > I think it depends on what type appointment it is, some can be a phone call or video conference others need to be in person. Something are not possible to do on the phone. 
    - What do you want in person: 
      > I think if you are taking medication and need a refill it can be done over the phone but if I have a back problem I need to go in so they can do it hands on. They are professionals that can check how it hurts. They can gage it over how much it hurts so I don’t think it would work over the phone. 
    - Do you think this could be a conversation over the phone/video chat?
- Rank the importance of the following considerations when you are making an appointment (alternative phrasing: When you need to make a medical appointment, what’s most important to you?) 
  > Timeliness and if you are calling someone should answer it in a timely manner. If I can get someone on the phone then I can do it on the computer. 
  - Other: 
    > As far as who I get to see and where or the time frame. I think the number 1 concern for me is time, I don’t mind who I see either a nurse, MD, or PA. I don’t have an issue going to the VA or off site because you want it to be seen as soon as possible to get rid of the worry and get it fixed 
  - Seen as soon as possible so you care treated and getting care that is needed: 
    > That is a fair statement, it is how I think. If there is something wrong I want checked to make sure. 
- What do you call the place that you go for an appointment? 
  > The VA. I am in Battle Creek so it is a VA hospital here. 
  - Other names, same place for care: 
    > I do. Like nicknames or how I make fun of the VA. Yeah I use to say I am going to the VA, I am retired so if I were going to the doctor I would go to the doctor. When talking to my wife I would say VA or if I am going to the Doctor I would say doctor. My PMC at the VA is a Nurse practitioner.
    - Heard the other names: 
      > Sure, but I work with a lot of vets so we just say I have another VA appointment today. It is never I have a doctor’s appointment because we assume its not at the VA.  
- If you could wave a magic wand and change how to make a VA medical appointment, what would you change? 
  > As far as scheduling an appointment I have never had an issue getting an appointment. My experience with the va has been good I have not had a problem. The only process that sucks is the referral process. I went to the VA and I got a referral to a cardiologist, the referral went well but once they sent the really they never called me so I used Tricare sand got everything done prior to the VA calling me. Here you can get an appointment the same day everyone is friendly. The referral process needs to be better. 
  - Probe: What is the ideal way to make a VA medical appointment?
- On average, how much time does it take for you to make an appointment? 
  > 5 minutes, it’s pretty fast.
- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 
  > When I go for my physical they just put me out another year. I don’t do it often. My friend using the online with the blue button. I just don’t go a lot but I have done it both ways. I don’t have a preference. 
  - In person after an appointment: 
    > Yes and if I were sick I would just call to make it
  - Ever online: 
    > I have done it on the back end online and the doctor sends me a message. 
- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online? 
  > I haven’t because it is just so easy to do. 
  - Easy to do the ones already done: 
    > Just calling is super easy. The online system works but it is hard to get there. Like to login to the system, you have to fine you login information. Its just not easy. 

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments

Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information.   
  > First think I would do is closing the Covid update. Okay I closed it. Every site has it so it is distracting. I would need to sign in for an appointment. 
  - What does it mean: 
    > I can’t make routine appointments but I can make an urgent appointment. Only requesting appointments online. That’s what it says. Isn’t that where I am already at. I would argue that it would be confusing since I am already here., I guess I can’t call anymore. 
- Look through the page, what is it for and what would you do: 
  > I would come here to see my upcoming appointments or schedule the appointment. I would use this instead of calling. 
  - Follow up questions: 
    - Have you seen this page before? 
      > Yes I have
    - Can you log in to your account from here? I can click sign in. 
      > The green box. 
    - Information helpful or unclear: 
      > What does it mean that you are scheduling one that using online scheduling. It’s not all facilities? 
      - What does it mean: 
        > I need to know if my facility uses it or not.
        - Do you see information that may help with that:   
          > Yeah that next one which isn’t helpful because its not mine. 
          > Why wouldn’t that be at the top. I don’t know maybe put you can make it online if you are at one of these facilities. I came here to make one online so if I read all this and I am like great let me create an account and verified it then I see this and my place doesn’t do it. 
      - Locations are the only ones that can schedule: 
        > I can see expect the following. 
      - If just glancing through, what would be easier: 
        > I think it needs to be bigger or reword it. It automatically seems like these are the only locations that you can online schedule with. What does non-va appointment, like community care. 
    - Information helpful : 
      > I don’t think its not helpful but it seems like there’s a ton of information, I just want to make an appointment. I would just like to have a box to click and make an appointment. I think this is a lot so people won’t read it and it has sign in or create an account so I would just sign in. 
    - Its not saved like before: 
      > On my computer it is saved. It is so complicated so I need to look for it to save it. All of my passwords are saved on my computer. I use my computer and its just saved on there. Let me see if it is on my work computer. 
  - Follow up questions, once logged in: 
    > It changed from green to blue.
- Have you seen or used this tool before?
  > I have.  
  - Can you tell me what happened?
  - What did you come here to do?
  - Were you able to accomplish that task?

## Section 2: Appointments list

*Participant received an unable to connect and failed warning when trying to login into myhealthevet. Tried to go to VA.gov and received an error that says this site cannot be reached.* 
*Worked after multiple attempts.* 

We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 

- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page. 
  > Shouldn’t I have appointments here because I know I have one coming up. Maybe its to far out. It is probably for December. It is probably January of 2021. This only goes out for what? 

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today? To schedule an appointment. 
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you do. You may be able to cancel the appointment using the tool. However, some locations don't allow for cancellations online. If this is the case, our team will help you with the cancellation after this session if that is ok with you. 
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment?  
  > Right here. Just like Primary care. 
- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  > It is an interesting list and it is alphabetical but do we have many people for amputations. I would argue that people normally do Primary care and Pharmacy. Is there actually an appointment for the Pharmacy, like to pick up your medication. 
  - Have you seen this page before?
- [go through each page of the flow]
  - *Select a location page*
    - If a user is registered at 2+ VAMCs, ask: do you recognize these locations in the list? Do you know what it means? 
      > I know where most of them are, these other two I am not sure but I imagine one of them being Detroit. I don’t know the Wy one. 
    - Why do you think it is there: 
      > It would be my guess that it is the closest to my home of record. August is available. It must be 24 hours, am or pm. I haven’t picked a time yet. Routines, and we just book here. First I am confused as why you have an appointment at the pharmacy. 
      - What might it result in: 
        > You would get your medication; wouldn’t they just send it to your house unless they aren’t allowed to send it through the mail. 
    - What if you had a question or needed change something: 
      > My guess it wouldn’t be from the pharmacy it would be the doctor. Wouldn’t you call the doctor. 
    - You would pick the doctor: 
      > I would just call them; the way this is organization I would do the ones that people need the most then have something that breaks down the others. Like what’s used the most then have the less used on later on. How often do people call to make an appointment for sleep meds, is there a huge difference between mental health and social work. 
    - If a user is registered at 1 VAMC, ask: does this option make sense to you? Do you know what it means?
  - *If user ends process, indicate where and why*
    - Why weren't you able to complete your task?
    - What would have made you able to schedule your appointment today?
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?

## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes
- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov? 
  > I think I would, it is just so easy because of where I am at. If I had to wait on the phone for a long time I would definitely use this. 
  - Why / why not?
- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or Express Care that we have not yet covered today?   
  > I think it is good to have but it seems complicated. Like I said I don’t know my passwords that’s why I don’t do it and the amount that had to be read in the beginning. I don’t know the average age of people that use the website, are we trying to get older or younger veterans, I don’t know how much easier that would be. 

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
- If YES: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 
Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
