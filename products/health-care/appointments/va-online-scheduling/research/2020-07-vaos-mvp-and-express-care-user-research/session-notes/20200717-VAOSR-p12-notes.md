## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not 
to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next 
question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not 
testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet 
Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I 
welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo 
tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the 
prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your
actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let 
me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions 
  accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and 
  none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with 
    me recording this session once more.**  

    > sounds good. 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record
  my screen the audio as we talk today?** 

  > Yes. 

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 

  > I try to do it through the phone or if I go to an appointment.
- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online? 

  > I have never tried it but I know you can use the website.
  
  - If NO:
    - Have you ever considered scheduling a VA appointment online? 
    
      > Talking to you is making me more curious. Apps are always easier. 
    - What would convince you to try it?

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments

Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information. 

  - Follow up questions: 
    - Have you seen this page before? 
    
    > I have seen it, yeah I have.

  - What do you think about this page? 
    
      > I see the schedule place, I see the Covid thing, Then I like that it is colored coded because I don’t read all of the text, it would be nice if the button was at the top because it’s the reason why I came to this page. If I were doing this, I don’t know if I would get to this spot because its all the way down here. 
    
      - Locations list, what do you assume: 
    
      > I would’ve assumed ineligible. I would assume everyone else was good. I guess I would look at this and ask myself if it is even worth it because of all of this stuff, I just want to make my appointment. It is due from transferring from Active duty to Veterans and the loops they made me go through. I like the green, the simple covid thing but when I see you can only request an appointment online then see how I know my facility uses online scheduling is good that you can do it everywhere besides these three. All of the other stuff I don’t know, maybe if you have the more questions link then it would take you to the other questions. Part of the reason I would wonder if I should go through with it is because of all of this information. If I could just click through and make my appointment then have this is there is an issue that would be better. 
    
  - Follow up questions, once logged in:

    > I usually use the DS login if I can. I look up here to see that I am logged in.

    - Anything based on the page: 

      > You mean below. Yeah I had to look up there because I won’t know. It would be cool if it took me somewhere that it shows what I have already. Are you familiar with Tricare. I like it shows the graph ring, then you know it is you. Data visuals, such as physicals, follow-ups . it would be nice to have something like that. This looks like it is more stuff. 

    - Anywhere to access things: 

      > I see the bar on the left and it looks like more. I like that I can pay the co pay here, I like the benefits but the format looks like the regular page. 

    - Expected to go straight to that page: 

      > yeah. 

## Section 2: Appointments list
We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 

- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page. 

  > I like the button colors; I know it will work or I have faith it will work. It is really simple I like that. 

- What do you think of this page?

  - Past appointments tab: 

  > Yes. 

  - Anything missing: 

  > I went through my separation stuff and I guess it is not on there.

  - How long ago did you separate: 

    > 2018

  - You’ve seen va medical providers for disability claims, any for other medication concerns: 

  > I have been in for vaccines and I thought that would show up here. 

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.

Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today? 

> I could think of something.

  - Upcoming appointment: 

    > I would have gone for my physical but I have stayed away due to covid. 	

- If YES:
  - Great, let's try to schedule it.
- If NO:

  - No problem! Let's pretend that you do. You may be able to cancel the appointment using the tool. However, some locations don't allow for cancellations online. If this is the case, our team will help you with the cancellation after this session if that is ok with you. 

- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment? 

> I think I will be able to schedule primary care appointments and if I had a follow up for a specialist I feel like I could schedule that to. I like that in additional to primary care there are a lot of special stuff. It is related, I figured primary care would be there but the options are really good. When I see these options I am encouraged. I like there is a weight management program. I need to update my eye prescription.  
  
- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 

  > I like that it has the number to call if it does not work. I like it breaks out the differences, how cool is this. 
  > No locations for optometry at this time. 
  
    - If this were the case, what would you do: 
  
      > Honestly, I would just look at this and see the number to call. I would say its not worth it and deal with my issue because who knows how long I will be on hold for. When I have time and the patience I would call. 
  
  - *Goes back to schedule primary care:* 
  
    > There we go. Okay, mental health ahs to work. There we go. 
  
  - Have you seen this page before?
- [go through each page of the flow]

  - *Select a location page*
    - If a user is registered at 2+ VAMCs, ask: do you recognize these locations in the list? Do you know what it means? 

      > I know the VA clinic; they are the VA medical centers. I am in Alexandria so I see fort Belvoir and its nice I don’t have to go to DC. I didn’t know they had the smaller spots. I like this. 
      > I have three days to pick. I will make it later in case. 

  - *Calendar view*

    - What if you wanted an appointment in October:  

      > This is pretty easy. 

    - Easy to see the next button: 

      > yes. 

  - *Scheduler call form*

    > They are going to call me back. It would be nice to see the actual available times unless it is an emergency then you’d call. 

  - *appointment type/details*

    > For any: I guess for mental health or have an appointment confirmation instead of making a call. I just don’t want to talk to anyone. I have no issue finding the months, I like that.
    > Going through this scheduling set up might reduce time one the phone: I do, at least I know they will call me and pick the time. For how big the VA is I am happy with this ability, I like it more then I don’t. 

    > Reason would be a routine.Make sense: Yeah. One other thing as an example because I do a lot of scheduling online with Tricare, you select the priority of your appointment request. Option for urgent within 24 hours, routine. If that was possible, even a check box. If it is urgent, I would expect an emergency call 911. If it is physical pain or mental health I would like to be seen sooner rather than later. This stuff down here will always be here. 

    > How to get access to help immediately: I know about this down here because you get it when you separate but I know there are is a middle ground between urgent and emergency for mental health. Maybe you are struggling and don’t want to call the hotline. The abilities are to cope are being tested and need to get in for an appointment. Maybe something to highlight it to move it to the top. Maybe veterans are good at prioritizing that.

    > Expect to see the same options for all types of care: I would expect it to have a different button of a physical then a routine appointment. If it is an eye appointment, a different select for an eye appointment and an eye issue. It had something for covid then it should have symptoms just in case if you have covid symptoms. This box is good because you can put in your issue. I don’t know if someone will read it or add another due to it not matching one of those.

  - *Type of appointment:* 

    > this is interesting I though telehealth would be a separate thing. A call would be nice to if you don’t want to drive in

  - Does it make sense to ask now: 

    > I would place it prior to scheduling because you can narrow it down. It could present different options. If you try to do a call you are probably busy. If it were telehealth I figured it would be select an appointment window. I think having a call between the appointment is redundant if it is a telehealth. Maybe you are a veteran of an older war may not be familiar  with his and preference different.

    > Want this for all appointments: With COVID I don’t know. I expect it all to be like this, on Active duty they are doing virtual PHA’s, health assessment. Reserves are doing that to so you can the regional center and they will do it because they are trying to limit interaction. I would be surprise you could do a phone call for amputation call. It is nice if you have questions and need clarification for care steps or if you ran out of supply. I am surprised but in a good way. 

    > I like that my contact information is filled in for me. I am only reading this because I am doing the study with you.

  - Real world experience, would you read it: 
    No. 

  - What would your reaction be to this: 

    > I would put in the required stuff; it depends what else would be asked. I am not averse to having to fill things out. 

  - Does it make sense what the information for:

    > I understand this is information that they contact me at my best time. I would hope  would get a call between 8am and 12pm.
    > View details, yes. (reading page). I Yeah I like this run down it is nice. 

  - Doesn’t make sense or is good: 

    > I know to review it due to the title; I like the reminder. I like how it is bold then regular it is easy to read so I would hit request. 
    > I like the title and the green check is good. I know I will get a call. I like how it has the address; I don’t know if I would get one but I would like an email with eh follow up of what I requested.
    > That you made the request: yes and with the address so I don’t need to look it up again and the number of the clinic is good instead of the 1800 number. 
    > Information here: I like it, it is what I expect to see when I login. Here is my stuff, I know imp rending because its yellow. I know I am waiting but it is in process. If I don’t have an email I can come here for the address, number, and directions. I wish it worked for the other things such as the physical or mental health. 
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?

## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel 
today?
  - If YES: 
    - Great, let's try to cancel it.
  - If NO:

    - No problem! Let's pretend that you want to cancel and walk through the process OR cancel the appointment request you made if you don't need it.

- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment? 
Right there.

- What do you expect: 

  > It will say either are you sure then take be to confirm and let me cancel. Then if it is mental health here’s some numbers just in case. It would also be nice if I wanted to reschedule that I wouldn’t have to cancel I could reschedule because I might have written a lot in the box. Then I am done. I get confirmation and that’s straightforward. Then it shows cancelled. I know it is canceled because it is red. 
  
  - Any feedback: 
  
  > Is there a way to ever make this go away. I don’t care I was just wondering. 
  > I think this is a friendly user interface. Overall it is pretty good. 
  
  - Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype
Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:
- Have you heard of "Express Care"? 
  
  > No. 
  
- If NO: 
  - What do you think it might be? 
    
    > Maybe like in the civilian world.
    - Prompt, if needed: do you think it is for an in-person or virtual 
      appointment? 
    
      > I would think it was in person at like a minute clinic. 
  
- Have you done any Telehealth appointments with VA? 
  
  > I have, not at the va but I have before. 
  
  - If YES:
    
    - Can you tell me a bit about your experience? 
    
      > I tried to get on when I had the flu and they called me the next day at 4 am it was terrible. At work I did one and it was very quick. It was easy, it required a follow up but it was really quick. 

Now we're going to look at a prototype: [Express Care Prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens)
- [EC landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 

> I like that it is simple, that is what I want. I see the request express care and I read it and it is what I thought. I like this. I wonder if it is a triage or can they right a prescription. I like how all of my stuff is here to, maybe with a new option there. There is a lot less text then the other pages before. 


- Imagine you want to make an appointment to be seen for a bothersome cough *today*, how would you make an appointment for that? 

  > Today I would click the express care because it sounds like I can do It virtually and I would wonder if the cough were due to covid so I would try to do that to be a good person.  

  - Is that what you expected to happen? 
    - Why / why not?

- [EC request / consent landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011177) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 

> I know this will always be there (call 911 thing), I guess I like the reminder that you don’t need a referral, I like how it breaks it down. I work in healthcare now. I don’t have any of these so I would continue. 

  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
  - Is that what you expected to happen? 
    - Why / why not?

- [EC subway map](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/42414177
6) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the 
information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.

  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
  - Based on your task: making an appointment to be seen for a bothersome cough *today*, would you continue with this request? I would continue. 
- Why / why not?
    - Do the options at the bottom make sense?
  
-  Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 

  > I would read this because I don’t want to waste my time  because I am sick. I like that you don’t need it to be assigned. I haven’t been sick much so I haven’t need healthcare besides the regular stuff. I know you have to be updated to get appointments so I’m happy I don’t need to deal with that. I like the 123. I have to submit it during 9-11am during the week. It is a short window. Then they call between 1-5pm, that is interesting. (reading page). I like that you could get a prescription over the phone if I had a cough they could prescribe it. They may recommend a follow up, I hope they would facilitate it. It makes sense to me. I hope I can get it within that time 


  - what would happen: 

  > if I were feeling crappy I would go to a minute clinic and pay out of pocket. I would continue with eh request. It is nice you can narrow it down so I can let them know what is going on. 

  > I guess there’s no other because they are limited.  I like this a lot I would totally do this. 

  -  [EC confirmation screen](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/422011179) Do you think you will get a call back *today*?

    - Probe: Does "request a phone screening" meet your expectations for making a same-day, urgent Telehealth appointment?

- [EC screening view](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens/42213309
  4) What do you think will happen if you click "View Express Care Screening"?

  - *After going to EC Appointments Page View* Probe: Is this what you expected to see?

    - Why / Why not?
  - Probe: Did you notice the different statuses?  

    > I know I am good here and I know these are being worked somehow. When I see the symbol I think there is a warning or something not downright. Maybe a different symbol but I like how I know. The only other thing I can think of is a dropdown to explain what it means or a summary of the call I had with these people and I like it is all here in one spot. 

    - Make sense express care is on its own: 

      > Yes, I can also see it falling into past appointments as well. I would I manage if it is escalated  form express care there is a physical in life appointment that would cause a normal appointment. If it is in progress I don’t know what that means for express care. I either have the call or I am waiting for it. 


## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes
- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical 
  appointment using VA.gov? 

  > Yea . 

  - Why / why not?

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in
need of an appointment, today?

  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were 
experiencing symptoms of coronavirus?

- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or 
Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 

- If YES: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
