## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Why do you make medical appointments? 
  > I make appointments because I am ill usually.
  - Follow up appointments: 
    > Yes. 
  - Follow up:
    - Is this a recurring appointment? 
    - Is this appointment that needs to be in person?
      > They use to be until the last few months. 
    - Do you think this could be a conversation over the phone/video chat?
      > I think some  of them could have been video chat.
      - Given option to choose that, would you have selected it: 
        > Yes I live in a rural area and the closest va is 30 minutes.
      - Just a follow up you don’t need to go in:      
        > Yes. That is the only thing that concerned me was I had my yearly checkup done but I didn’t have my yearly tests. 
- Rank the importance of the following considerations, when you are making an appointment (alternative phrasing: When you need to make a medical appointment, what’s most important to you?)
  > In the summer I like morning appointments and in the winter I try to do later appointments because we get a lot of snow and the roads aren’t always cleared in the morning.
  - Location or provider (who you are going to see):
    > Some of my providers are 200 miles away so it is nice to have the option as a phone call or video chat. 
  - Type of care (like a specialty or primary care, or optometrist):
    > I would have to do that in person like my gastro person I like to do that in person. If it is a follow up I don’t mind a call. If it is specially I have a few that I do telehealth but I still go to the va to do that. 
  - Date/time
  - Type of visit (in person, video, phone)
- What do you call the place that you go for an appointment?
  - Probe: Hospital, site, location, clinic, doctors office, provider, etc.
    > I just the Iron Mountain VA. It is the VA hospital
    - Do you go to a site or clinic: 
      > A satellite clinic not normally because they are farther away then the hospital. Yes I have went to a clinic when I stayed at my sisters. 
    - Do you every say you’re going to the doctors: 
      > Not usually.
      > My dad was 90 years old and had such a bad though form the VA 50 years ago. He thought that once you go into the VA doors you won’t come back out. It has changed a lot over the years. I have had good experiences and bad experiences. On my own I called my PMC and told them I needed an MRI and was in surgery two weeks later. Its not always good. 
- If you could wave a magic wand and change how to make a VA medical appointment, what would you change?
  - Probe: What is the ideal way to make a VA medical appointment?
  > I would hopefully get in sooner, I can never get in soon enough. They are booked so far out it’s like why even bother. You can go to urgent care but it’s not all that good, the hospital here isn’t that good. We don’t have that good of healthcare here. I am an advocate for my health care but what about the older generations that just take the doctors word for it. A majority of people that go to the VA don’t advocate for their healthcare and that’s what bothers me about the VA. My brother in law has had the same PMC and the last few years at my VA I have had 10 different PMC and they have all been PA’s not MD’s. I know it is hard to staff VA hospitals but I don’t know the alternative. 
  - Main point of contact on your team or who you go and see: 
    > Yeah for the primary. It is like your family doctor that you see all the time and when they are changed almost every 6 months it is discouraging to have to  go through your medical history each time. My son tells me to get a doctor outside of the va. I don’t know if it’s because I am lazy or that they have all the information and its free. I don’t have to worry about a co-pay or being able to afford the prescriptions. I have Medicare as well but I have been going to the va so long it is like a way of life
- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments?
  > Over the phone 
  - On average, how much time does it take for you to make an appointment?
    > 10 minutes. I don’t have the problem with the amount of time to get it scheduled but who knows when it will be made for. 
  - Do you know that it is confirmed or is there a follow up: 
    > They send me a letter. It is confirmed on the phone. I know if I make an appointment on the phone I have that appointment. 
- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online?
  > I looked into the online scheduling but the few times I did it, it wasn’t working out for me. I have a lot of specialists and I think I couldn’t make it. Then I tried making one with my provider and it was so far out. I called and had one sooner. 
  - If YES:
    - Have you ever used this/these methods before?
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience?
  - If NO:
    - Have you ever considered scheduling a VA appointment online?
    - What would convince you to try it?
      > I would try it again.

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments

Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you  haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information.  
  > It looks easy to get through. Just about everything can be found here and it looks a lot nice than myhealthevet. It looks easier with the stuff on the side (reading tabs). It is easier to access. This is really helpful; everything is on here. 
- Can you log in to your account from here? 
  > Yes. I don’t know if I have it on my computer, I have it on my phone. Like my passwords and everything.
  - How do you think you would sign in: 
    > I would it the sign in. I am so bad with passwords I have everything saved. 
  - Follow up questions, once logged in:
    - What did you come here to do? 
      > I expected to come back to this page.
    - Do you see somewhere for your account: 
      > it says schedule and view your appointment. 
    - Were you able to accomplish that task?  

## Section 2: Appointments list

We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 
- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page. 
  > I have seen something like this but not exactly this page. 
  - On my HealtheVet: 
    > Yes.  
    > It is straightforward, upcoming appointment, past appointment, and schedule appointment. 
  - What do you think of this page? 
    > I like it, everything is right there and they have it to the end of the year. I can schedule and view. 
  - What don't you like about it? Is there anything that you find confusing? 
    > I don’t think so
  - Is there anything that you think may be missing? 
    > I don’t thing so.     
  - Do all your appointments look to be accounted for? 
    > Yes. Everything is accounted for. 
  - Details on appointments: 
    > All of the information is there, names, contact information. 
    - Looking at July 31st, do you know what that was for: 
      > yes that is the one I canceled on Thursday and they did on it on Friday.
    - Details that would be helpful to have: 
      > everything is on there. 
  - Sort/order: 
    > They are sorted by date and that’s good.
    - Another way to sort: No none at all. This is the easiest to look at see what you have coming up. 
  - Can you find past appointments on this page? 
    > Yes.
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? 
  > I guess not missing because they weren’t appointments. I had to go in for a flu shot, I was in urgent care. It would be nice if they were on there. 
  > I also had outside appointments that were covered by the VA, it would be nice if they were there. One was a mammogram, is that considered community care. I went because they messed up on the urgent care because they said they would cover anything associated with it. 
  - How do you think they’d be put into the list: 
    > Probably as past appointments because they paid for them so that means they are aware of them. What I have came to find out is that the left hand of the VA doesn’t always know what the right hand is doing. This is what I see but if my doctor goes in do they see the same thing for my past appointments with past providers. That is what concerns me. 
- Other feedback/questions: 
  > Nope

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP

Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today? No I don’t think I have anything. 
  - If YES:
    - Great, let's try to schedule it.
  - If NO:
  - No problem! Let's pretend that you do. You may be able to cancel the appointment using the tool. However, some locations don't allow for cancellations online. If this is the case, our team will help you with the cancellation after this session if that is ok with you. 
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment? 
  > Yes. 
- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > I would say eye care. I would think of what I need first. 
  - Any other ways of making an appointment: 
      > On the phone. 
    - When you call what do you say: 
      > I call the general number and ask for mental health, pharmacy. I ask for the type of care I need. 
    - For example, something from this list? 
      > Yes. 
  - If a user is registered at 2+ VAMCs, ask: do you recognize these locations in the list? Do you know what it means? 
    > Yes.
    - All familiar: 
      > Yes
    - All facilities you have been to: 
      > Yes
    - Current?: 
      > No. Some I haven’t been there in a few years. The first one is where my specialists are and the second is the one I go when I am at my sons and the third one is where I normally go. 
  - What if you wanted an appointment in November: 
    > *Clicks continue first, gets error. Then clicks next at the top*. 
    > I am in November. 
    > Yeah they just basically for this kind of an appointment I am better off calling because it says they will call me back for an appointment. When I call I get the appointment right away but doing it this way it says they will contact for an appointment. It doesn’t make sense. Instead of going through this to wait for them to call me I might as well pick up the phone and make my appointment because at least I have it right then. This has happened before that’s why I don’t do it online. I cannot make the appointment right here. 
  - From this information on here how soon do you think you’ll get a call for a confirmed appointment: 
    > Who knows because I wet to the Hospital with hip pain. He said you must have fell. After 3 more visits to express care I made my own appointments and had emergency surgery and the day I came home from the hospital they called me for the consultation so that’s kinds of what I expect from them. I have had some bad luck. It seems when you get a good provider they are gone in 6 months. Lately with COVID if I call a department when I could talk to someone , you have to leave a name and number for a call back. 
  - How would you look at the appointments: 
    > Click view appointments. 

## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP

Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel today?
  - If YES: 
    - Great, let's try to cancel it.
  - From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment? 
    > *Click canceled.* 
    > That was easier than what I thought. It is great that it shows up right away without them making the appointment. It was easier then making the appointment, it was easier to cancel it. 
  - What did you think of the process: 
    > it was easy. 
  - Like that it prompts you and confirms: 
    > Yes. I like that. I click buttons I am not supposed to. 
  - Scheduled appointment for November 4th, you can’t make it at 10 but can at 12, how would you reschedule: 
    > I don’t want to hit cancel. I would call the main phone number to change the time. 
  - When you clicked cancel dd you remember what it said: 
    > I am not even sure. (reading text), okay that makes a lot of sense I should have read it.  
    - How do you feel about that: 
      > Personally if I were waiting months for an appointment I would keep the appointment. I know how hard it is getting an appointment. I would be afraid that if I canceled the appointment it would take me farther out to get in. if I cancel it completely and only want a two hour time for that day they may tell me they don’t have another appointment for 3 months. 

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype

Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:

- Have you heard of "Express Care"? 
  > No, they had an easy access clinic. 
  - If NO: 
    - What do you think it might be? 
      > Like urgent care. 
    - Prompt, if needed: do you think it is for an in-person or virtual: 
      > It would be either

## Section 4: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov? 
  > Yes because the VA id only open certain hours so if it 8pm and I remember I can get on here to do it. Sometimes they’ll transfer me and the phone will ring forever. This would stop that. 
- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or Express Care that we have not yet covered today?   
  > No I don’t think so. 

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 

- If YES: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
