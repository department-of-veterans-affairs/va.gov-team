## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions 
accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**
  >Yes

## Section 0: Warm-up questions
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments?
  >I usually call in on the phone.
- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online?
  - If YES:
    > Um, what is that link that I use…something relay health. I’ve gone through relay health before to do that. I think that was it, relay health.
    - Have you ever used this/these methods before?
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience?
       > Just getting access to it was, I’m not ging to say it was difficult, but from what I remember it referred me to other links I could use so it was a matter of making sure, I’ve used my ??? (cag?) (cack?) and it would take me to different links so I had to make sure I was registered with different links to be able to navigate to be sure I could schedule my appt. 
  - If NO:
    - Have you ever considered scheduling a VA appointment online?
    - What would convince you to try it?

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments
Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information. 
  > I’ve seen this page before, I went on this years ago when I was using this for my son’s education. This, coronavirus, of course is new. Haven’t seen that before. I haven’t been on this in years. Schedule a VA appt tool…okay. Okay, you can schedule a VA appt, I don’t remember all these being on the page.
  - Follow up questions: 
    - Have you seen this page before?
    - What do you think about this page?
- Can you log in to your account from here?
  > Yes, right here. (hitting reload to log in) Ok, that didn’t work…um… let’s see…trying to see if this is…um…if that ain’t the password, let me try something else…yeah, I have to do the whole reset and remember password user and ID, I think with these sites I used my cag/cat/cack (???) card.

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today?
  - If YES:
    - Great, let's try to schedule it.
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you do. You may be able to cancel the appointment using the tool. However, some locations don't allow for cancellations online. If this is the case, our team will help you with the cancellation after this session, if that is ok with you. 
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment? 
  - Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
    - What do you think of this page?
      - Prompts:
        - What information can you find here?
        - What do you like about it?
        - What don't you like about it? Is there anything that you find confusing?
        - Is there anything that you think may be missing?
  - Have you seen this page before?
- [go through each page of the flow]
  - *Select a location page*
    - If a user is registered at 2+ VAMCs, ask: do you recognize these locations in the list? Do you know what it means?
    - If a user is registered at 1 VAMC, ask: does this option make sense to you? Do you know what it means?
- Were you able to complete the task?
  - Why / Why not?
    - What would have made you able to schedule your appointment today?
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?

## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel today?
  - If YES: 
    - Great, let's try to cancel it.
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you want to cancel and walk through the process OR cancel the appointment request you made, if you don't need it.
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment? 
  - Walk me through how you'd cancel this appointment
    - Click cancel, what happens?
  - If cannot cancel online:
    - What do you think of this?
    - What would you do next?
  - If can cancel online:
    - What do you think of this?
    - Were you able to complete cancellation?
  - Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype
Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:
- Have you heard of "Express Care"?
  - If YES:
    - What is it? 
    - Have you used it?
  - If NO: 
    - What do you think it might be?
      > With what’s going on today, I’m assuming it’s that you call in and get advice from a doctor or a nurse for whatever situation you’re going through, they give you advice online or over the phone.
    - Prompt, if needed: do you think it is for an in-person or virtual appointment?
- Have you done any Telehealth appointments with VA?
  - If YES:
    - How did you schedule your appointment?
    - Was it with someone on your PACT?
    - Can you tell me a bit about your experience?
  - If NO:
      > No, not with VA, no.
    - Have you considered it before?
        > Yes, if it’s an option sure. Beats driving into DC.
    - What would convince you to try it?

Now we're going to look at a prototype: [Express Care Prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens)

- [EC landing page] Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  > Click on all these links? (no)
  > Emergency submit request…you can submit your request through your provider…Ok, I’m looking at where it says you can submit your request M-F, between 9 and 11, and you’ll receive a phone screening that same day, between those hours? That’s quite interesting because of the number of Vets that call in, but I guess it depends on how many Vets call in during that two hour time frame. That could be quite a feat them trying to get you answers back in that time period and accommodating everybody. I was on a call with the VA the other day, and a lot of Veterans were on and they weren’t able to accommodate all of the questions and had to cut it off. What if they can’t get to you that same day, what happens, because of the volume of people that might call in? And is the info they give you going to be accurate, or is this something they give you without doing much research to get the proper diagnosis? 
  - Would be comfortable using this?
    > During this time, yeah. But I’m an in=person type person, I like to do things in person when it comes to my health, so I’d rather go in. I had a situation where I had a sore on my back and I sent in pictures and he told me what to do, and if I needed to go in, I’d go in. Depends on what’s going on with me.
  - What if they couldn’t get back to you in the time stated?
    > I think they should let people know, you communicate that with people, let them know. Could results in folks filing complaints.
  - How would you like to be informed?
    > That they’re not going to get back to you? I gues they could send an email cause if they can’t get back to you on the phone they won’t be ablet o call and tell you that. So when they realize, they could send an email or extend the time to respond or follow up to the people. 
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
- Imagine you want to make an appointment to be seen for something *today*, how would you make an appointment for that? 
   > Call in and wait for them to respond back to me.
  - Do you see anywhere to intiaiate that on here?
    > You can submit request 9am – 11am, request screening.
  - Is this something you would call in to to make a request?
    > Im assuming you’d use this link right here. 
  - Is that what you expected to happen? 
    - Why / why not?
- [EC subway map] Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
  - Based on your task: making an appointment to be seen for something *today*, would you continue with this request?
    - Why / why not?
- [EC form request screen] Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
    >(reading from screen) Didn’t expect some of this stuff – major bleeding, trauma, chest pain, shortness of breath, that’s a 911 call or you go into your nearest emergency room. Sudden headaches or vision loss – definitely won’t be able to use a hotline if you have vision loss. I thought it would be something more like I don’t know like me, with the sore I had on me. Simple stuff, this stuff looks like major stuff that a phone call or logging onto a link won’t take care of. But there are just suggestions or what they want you to use the express link for. 
  - You tell me – is that what it’s saying?
    > I just had to go with its suggestions, but to me these are pretty severe things, and at time people follow these links to a T, but you shouldn’t sit and wait for someone to call you back. They might have to rethink some of these suggestions and come up with something different to put on there. 
    > A cold, that would fall within the realms of using this, to get info about a cold, put the request in and wait for someone to contact you to tell you what to do.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
  - What do you think will happen once you submit this form?
    > (reading screen) Oh this makes sense now (reading list of health concerns for using Express care). So what happens if something happens in the afternoon?
  - What do you think?
    > We can only accept requests in the morning, so I’m assuming you’d call 911 or in some instances there is a nurses’ hotline or go to the ER.
    > I just don’t like the time restrictions on this, that’s providing something is going on with them during that time, and then you have to wait a long time for someone to call you back. 
 - What would you prefer?
    > For the things like they mentioned, me, myself, I know me if you add my age to it, I would take OTC stuff is one of these things was going on with me. If you’re older, any symptoms like that you have would need to be seen right away, they can’t sit around and wait for someone to contact them, they need to be seen as soon as possible. 
 - What would you do next?
    > Next I would select next and continue, request a phone screening.
    > Tell us about your health and they have all this stuff you can select.
    > What if you have more than one situation going on? 
    > What would you do if you could click more than one or if you had multiple symptoms?
    > Select one and wait for a call back and then let them know what else is going on with you. If I have more than one thing going on, I’ll let them know. But some doctors say you came in with this one thing that’s all we can see you for. 
  - Prompt if necessary: Does "request a phone screening" meet your expectations for making a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment?
    > Are you able to type in more information once you select, or you just select on thing? Are you able to explain more? (yes, not in prototype). Would you be able to add additional symptoms in the box? I would if you can’t select more than one item at a time. It should be open to select more than one item at a time. 
- [EC confirmation screen] Do you think you will get a call back *today*?
  - What if you specify a "best times for VA to call" window?
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this?

## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes
- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov?
  - Why / why not?
- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were inneed of an appointment, today?
  > Yeah, as long as I had more options to use it, and it’s not time restrictive especially for reporting. I think the time should be open to anytime cause sometimes you can’t wait for that time to put in information on what’s going on with them, something could happen after 11am, and then they have to wait until tomorrow or go to the ER without getting feedback on your situation. 
  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus?
    > Um, yeah. Yeah, I would. If I think I was experiencing some symptoms, but eventually I’d like to go get looked at or tested. 
- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  
  > No.

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research 
session? 

- If YES: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 
  > Yes
