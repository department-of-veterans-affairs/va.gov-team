## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of youractions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

    > Yeah. 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?** 

  > Yes. 

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 

  > I call and schedule. 

- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online? 

  > Yes, through myhealthevet or secure messages.  I have done it twice. 

  - If YES:

    - Have you ever used this/these methods before?

    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience? 

      > When I do the secure messages it goes back and forth of when I want an appointment and they’ll send the available dates/times and then I see which one works and they schedule it then it comes back. It is an exchange of 5-6 times. I only use it if I have a problem getting through on the phone. I wish it were something like scheduling using something more interactive when I can see their availabilities online like making a hair appointment. 

## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments

Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-
care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)

- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information. 

  > It says schedule and view va appointments online. On the left hand there are more options of what to do such (reading list). This is neat, it is a consolidated list instead of having to go to more than one screen. It is more user friendly not just for me but for senior citizens that are not as computer savvy. 

  - Did you expect to come back here: 

    > no, if it looked different it would have let me know that I am in there. It looks like the same page but now has the option to schedule the appointment. I like that te prior screen shows what you are able to do from the site but once I logged in I would go to va appointments. 

  - Follow up questions: 

    - Can you log in to your account from here? 

      > (Signs in using myhealthevet.) I was just on there, let me double check. 


## Section 2: Appointments list

We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 

- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page. 

  > Just read the page that let me know it may look different. It looks like a popup and then a screen behind it. Okay that worked. It looks different now is it supposed to look like this? 

  > *signing in again* This is what happened before, click. I have seen it before. 

- What do you think of this page?

  - Prompts:

    - What information can you find here? 

      > I like that the option is shown in blue so it is easy to find. Then the upcoming and past appointments. I like how it is easy to read, the time/date and information in there. When you do in the portal it looks coded and it is hard to read. It has the directions and number to change or chancel the appointments. Those are the past appointments because our clinic is not currently scheduling. I am able to customize how far back we can look. That is neat. If you are trying to remember when you saw the doctor you can sort through it. 

    - Are you able to see the doctor form the information you see here: 

      > yeah and added feature would be if you were able to sort by date, provider, or facility. Things like that but this is good. It is easier to read than I have previously seen. 


## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP

Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today? 

  > I will make my mental health one. After I talk to the provider they don’t do their own scheduling. You have to talk to the desk or call. 

  - If YES:
    - Great, let's try to schedule it.

- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment? 

  - Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 

    > This looks like a standard list that shows for everyone. I will give this a try. 

    - What do you think of this page?
      - Prompts:
        - What information can you find here?
        - What do you like about it?
        - What don't you like about it? Is there anything that you find confusing?
        - Is there anything that you think may be missing?

  - Have you seen this page before?

- [go through each page of the flow]

  - *Select a location page*

    - If a user is registered at 2+ VAMCs, ask: do you recognize these locations in the list? Do you know what it means? 

      > Yes. There are 6 facilities listed, I recognize 5 of them but the George E Wahlen I don’t, I don’t know if I have been there before. My primary is Martinsburg one. This is huge that it provides you the option of which on you want to go to so that is great. 

    - If a user is registered at 1 VAMC, ask: does this option make sense to you? Do you know what it means? 

      > It allowed you where an appointment can be scheduled at the facility. 

      - Main VA list then clinic: 

        > yes. Now that I am reading it, it says where you are registered at. I didn’t even ready that. I was just looking at the options and clicking the option. Now that I see if I would have read it I see that it shows where I am registered. I like that it explains that some care is not available. Maybe the font for the sentence to be bolded to set it apart it may prompt me to read it. The same thing when I clicked the medical center I did not even read it,  just looked at the list to pick one. In that sense it is logical.

  - *Select a date/time*

    > It is neat that it shows you a calendar. If that same thing with hat one. If the sentence is longer. It is like trying to get a plane ticket. I almost overlooked the up to three days. It sounds simple but it is fantastic that it is a calendar. Sometimes it’ll just say the dates like in excel and you have to find out what day of the week it is. We are accustomed to a calendar. Then you pick am or pm and I like that. I have never been asked that or when my availability is so you are not at the mercy of the facility. So right there it’s kind of froze up, there was a popup that can up and I am looking for the continue. I like it ahs the red bar maybe it should be a little thicker. I had to scroll up to see that you are only allowed to pick 3, maybe a popup so I see it. All I saw was the thin lin. 

    - Is it clear what am and pm is: 

      > I am guessing a morning appointment, if it said above the box indicate a morning or afternoon that would help. Myself I kind of guest it. 

    - Is it okay that it is not specific times: 

      > yeah if it had time ranges that would be even better. They probably can’t show you the exact time that is open so I like the option of morning or afternoon. 

    - Appointment beyond august: 

      > No. Now I do, there is the next button and you can go even farther out. What would be helpful for me since it is new, if they can’t list September under it, after the second month above the continue button have the choose the following month to move the box. It is good where it is at but it would be great if it were near the august month as well. 

      > I like choosing why I need the appointment, the more I answer here the less the person that calls will ask. That way they don’t need to call, so if I can do it all on the computer. It is weird that they ask more detail, at first I thought they would already know who I see, if it were to show the provider I see like when picking the location. I was unsure the format so I just put the individuals name. Then click continue. I like how this is set up and the free text box. Initially I did not see the continue so having to scroll down it is almost like it is hidden. It may be due to a laptop with a smaller screen the next button is hidden. The type of appointment is good. I put it in my comments because I wasn’t sure. If this could be on the previous screen with the reason. Contact information is good that it auto populated because they have all of my information so that is a huge help. I like that it has evening 4-8, normally you feel like you are at the mercy of the provider with no consideration of the veteran having a job so doing a time block is fantastic. The recap is good, all on one screen to verify the information it is great. I like to review the appointment details. How my eyes follow the instructions, the request of metal health appointment, it seems duplicated because it says it below as well. Maybe the same size and bold it says please review and complete the request. It would prompt me to review and submit the request. The wording on the last sentence needs work but it might just be a place holder. Maybe take the sentence that has the edit sentence at the bottom with a back button. I misread it; it makes sense now.

  - Is that what you expected: 

    > yes, the green bar in the box tells me it is completed and went through. It provides the confirmation that it has been submitted and a scheduler will contact you to make the appointment. It says it is pending and you can request another one. 

    > Okay, its yellow. I guess read is cancelled and I like it is yellow because it is TBD. When will this be available. I didn’t even know that it would provide customizable options. I think that the screen and the options that were on there months ago were not user friendly. When someone says do it online I’m like yeah I tried that before. Maybe an advertisement like when you go to the TSP website about we’ve listened to the feedback and improved the website.  Click here to try to schedule your new appointment or something like that, I didn’t know it was on here and I didn’t know it would have bene this easy I would have done it awhile. If I knew it was this easy I would have gotten the care I needed already instead of having to call and be put on hold. This is easier and more streamline. 

    > It looks like it is pending because of the yellow boarder, it looks like the read with the stream and this has the yellow banner it is almost like the streetlight that says it has been schedule, received or canceled. This prompts me that it is pending. I like the boarder and like it has the yellow. If te banner for the yellow was a bit thicker it might be better for the older generation. If it was more yellow like your shirt, the whole block was yellow or a full yellow banner. 

- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?

## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP

Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.

- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel today?

  - If YES: 
    - Great, let's try to cancel it.
  - If NO:

    - No problem! Let's pretend that you want to cancel and walk through the process OR cancel the appointment request you made if you don't need it.

- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment?  

  > I see it now, initially I didn’t see it but I see the button there. It is a bit hidden; it is at the very bottom. If it is an appointment option, I glazed over it because it is by the main number, if it had a boarder that would be better.

  - Walk me through how you'd cancel this appointment 

    - Click cancel, what happens?

  - If cannot cancel online:

    - What do you think of this? 

      > I would think another menu would come up to ask if you are sure you want to cancel. Then it provides the confirmation. It is good that it provides you the information. 

    - What would you do next?

## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov

  > Absolutely. Calling and having to do it, this is better. What would eb even better, instead of just select 3 dates, picking 5-6 for the whole week. It could be the whole week instead of just the three if that makes sense. If they don’t have the available time during those dates I would have to go through it all over when I could tell them I have the whole week open. 


- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  

  > No I think this is good I like it a lot. As a veteran that is familiar with myhealthevet I wish it could be advertised better like on FB. Like mental health during COVID showing the new user interface to make it easier to make the appointment. Most veterans say that they don’t want to call because you go through the extensions and go on hold. Even then you are on hold and can’t get the scheduler so I spent 25 minutes and didn’t even get an appointment. This is like a secret that needs to get out more. 

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 

- If YES: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
