## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling VA medical appointments online. I am going to ask you a series of questions, then we'll take a look at VA.gov's online scheduling tool and a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*
  - **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I recordmy screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments? 
  > Usually by phone or in person
- Are you familiar with any ways to schedule an appointment with any of your VA providers, online?
  - If YES: 
    > I tried in the past but it didn’t work and not all depts. are available, I attempted a couple times and either I couldn’t figure it out or the system wasn’t working right, so I continued by phone
    - What website?
      > My healthe vet – online scheduling and canceling, tried to do that, but somehow it just didn’t work.
    - Have you ever used this/these methods before?
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience?
  - If NO:
    - Have you ever considered scheduling a VA appointment online?
    - What would convince you to try it?
## Section 1: Schedule and View VA Appointments
Next, we're going to take a look at a webpage on VA.gov, it's ok if you haven't seen it before, we'd like to get your feedback on it.

**ASK VETERAN TO START SHARING SCREEN**

Go to: [Schedule and View VA Appointments](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)
- Take a look at this page and tell me what you see. Talk out loud as you are looking through the information. 
  > It just explains to me how to I go about scheduling my va apt online, and I do have an account, so I just log into it? Basic information, what are the benefits, options, if my VA is capable of the online scheduling, I guess I don’t see my va on here, maybe this is one?
  - Is this information helpful?
    > Yes, helpful, a lot of info and you have to look further to see if this information applies to you.
  - Is this something you would ordinarily read through?
    > Depends on how my brain is working, this is too much information.
  - Follow up questions: 
    - Have you seen this page before?
      > Yes
    - What do you think about this page?
      > Well, it’s quite easy to understand, just log in and do, and I did that in the past, but it didn’t work somehow. 
- Can you log in to your account from here?
  > Yes, I log in with my healthe vet. (pause) yeah, I’m in. this is the same page we were on earlier? Looks like the same page we were on earlier. Go to my va appts?
  - *Assist if cannot find log in button*
  - *Click button once logged in*
- Follow up questions, once logged in:
    - Have you you seen or used this tool before?
      > No, I’ll usually go through my healthe vet.
    - Can you tell me what happened?
    - What did you come here to do?
    - Were you able to accomplish that task?

## Section 2: Appointments list
We're going to take a look at your Appointments list. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before. We want to get your feedback on it. 
- Talking aloud, tell me what you see on this page.
- What do you think of this page?
    > This is my next coming appts, I can click on this to I have a bunch of coming appts. I can cancel, there’s a cancel option but no reschedule option. 
  - Would you expect to see a reschedule option as well?
    > Yes, because if I can cancel there should be a reschedule option after that. 
    > click on the cancel button
    > I can try to cancel my GI apt. I have an option to cancel the appt or change my mind. 
  - What do you think of this process?
    > It tells me if I choose to cancel I have an option to create a new appt. Have to cancel first and then reschedule. Should I try rescheduling it? 
  - In order to reschedule you’d have to cancel.
  - Prompts:
    - What information can you find here? (on cancelled appt card)
      > very basic, doesn’t have the direct line for the clinic, just the main line
    - What do you like about it?
    - What don't you like about it? Is there anything that you find confusing?
    - Is there anything that you think may be missing?
      > Looks like everything is there.
    - Pending appts?
      > I don’t have any requested or pending appts. All are confirmed.
- [Appointment list] Let's take a look at the appointment list. 
  - Prompts:
    - What do you think about the order of your appointments?
      > Easy to see what’s coming up next in line. I wish they would have the location of the clinic, if it’s a new appt or new clinic, I wouldn’t know where to go.
      - Elaborate?
        > Would be nice if they just list location within it – meeting number, room number. 
    - More specific location info?
      > I know they send me a letter with location information, but I don’t always read the letter in detail. 
    - Information in the letter is different than what is here?
      > Yes.
    - Can you find past appointments on this page?  
      > Yes, I see them. 
    - Is that helpful?
      > Yes, it is. I can look back on what I’ve had and know when to schedule the next one. 
    - Are you able to change how your appointments are sorted? Change how you’re viewing your appts?
      > I like to keep it two separate lists, one past and one upcoming so you can focus on one thing at a time.
    - Are you able to modify or filter the way you view them?
      > It’s okay the way they have it this way, in this order.    
  - Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page? Anything you didn’t like or want to change?
    > Wouldn’t change it, fine with me, easy to see. 

## Section 3: Scheduling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to use the tool to schedule an appointment. Don't worry if you don't need to schedule an appointment today. Our team will make sure that any request or appointment that is scheduled as a result of this session is cancelled immediately after this session.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to schedule today?
  - If YES:
    - Great, let's try to schedule it.
      > Podiatry, where do I choose? Podiatry is not on here. 
  - Sounds like what you were looking for is missing.
    > And rehab is not on here. 
    > Quite a few clinics missing from here, so…
    > I could schedule eye care.  
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you do. You may be able to cancel the appointment using the tool. However, some locations don't allow for cancellations online. If this is the case, our team will help you with the cancellation after this session, if that is ok with you. 
 - Sounds good, let’s try that. Do you recognize the locations that are in that lists there?
   > Some of them yes. 
 - Is that list confusing to you at all?
   > I wish the VA wouldn’t just give the name of the city not name it after somebody. Makes it hard to know where they are. 
 - Are you registered at two centers?
   > I believe I am, yes. I believe the Montgomery va. I don’t know how grand junction got in there, I have no idea where grand junction is. 
 - If you only saw grand junction or a location that you’re less familiar with, what would you do?
   > I wouldn’t do anything. I can’t schedule where I can’t go. 
   > I don’t see anything until December.
 - Do you see a way to change the calendar?
   > It only gives me the next month option, and that’s the most. I can try August and see how it works. 
 - What do you think about the process of filling out the request form so far?
   > Seems easy enough.
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to schedule an appointment? 
- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  - What do you think of this page?
    - Prompts:
        - What information can you find here?
        - What do you like about it?
        - What don't you like about it? Is there anything that you find confusing?
        - Is there anything that you think may be missing?
  - Have you seen this page before?
- [go through each page of the flow]
  - *Select a location page*
    - If a user is registered at 2+ VAMCs, ask: do you recognize these locations in the list? Do you know what it means?
- If a user is registered at 1 VAMC, ask: does this option make sense to you? Do you know what it means?
- Were you able to complete the task?
  - Why / Why not?
    - What would have made you able to schedule your appointment today?
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?
  > Easy to follow, easy to understand. 
  > I wish they would list all of the clinics that I have been to so I could reschedule my appt. 
  > This is new to me, but I like it. Very convenient. Sometimes I forget to call during the working hours, so this is easy because I can do it at a moment’s notice.

## Section 4: Cancelling an appointment using VAOSR MVP
Next, we're going to try to cancel an appointment using this tool.
- Before we start this task, is there an appointment you wish to try to cancel today?
- If YES: 
    - Great, let's try to cancel it.
  - If NO:
    - No problem! Let's pretend that you want to cancel and walk through the process OR cancel the appointment request you made, if you don't need it.
- From this page [online scheduling tool], do you see anywhere to cancel an appointment? 
- Walk me through how you'd cancel this appointment
    - Click cancel, what happens?
  - If cannot cancel online:
    - What do you think of this?
    - What would you do next?
  - If can cancel online:
    - What do you think of this?
    - Were you able to complete cancellation?
  - Is there anything else you'd like to share about this page?

## Section 5: Express Care Prototype
Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few questions:

- Have you heard of "Express Care"?
  - If YES: 
    - What is it? 
    - Have you used it?
  - If NO: 
    - What do you think it might be?
      > You don’t have to wait a long time for an appt?
- Prompt, if needed: do you think it is for an in-person or virtual appointment?
    > I think it could be virtual.
- Have you done any Telehealth appointments with VA?
  - If YES: a couple because they shut down the VA
    > Some are fine, saves me time driving to the VA, but some appts have to be in person. One of my appts didn’t work out well. 
    - How did you schedule your appointment?
    - Was it with someone on your PACT?
    - Can you tell me a bit about your experience?
    - Would you do it again?
      > Yes, but not for everything.
  - If NO:
    - Have you considered it before?
    - What would convince you to try it?

Now we're going to look at a prototype: [Express Care Prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens)

- [EC landing page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/U9XQMY2GS5V#/screens) Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. 
  > This must be a new thing because I’ve never heard of Express care screening. 
  > You need help right away, like with cold or flu, you don’t have ot wait weeks or walk in and not be seen. This way you can be seen that day, either virtually or whatever. 
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
    > Yes
    - Did you notice the time frames?
      > Yes, I think this works very well for things that aren’t urgent but need a quick appt.
- Imagine you want to make an appointment to be seen for something *today*, how would you make an appointment for that? 
  > I can go online and put in an express care request. 
- Is that what you expected to happen? 
  > This emergency care is different than express care. Explaining to you what symptoms mean you should go to the ER.
  - Why / why not?
- What is confusing?
  > I looked again, not confusing. Before you make the request, make sure you don’t need to go to the ER instead. 
  > When I first looked, kind of threw me off because I was expecting express care, but once I looked again, I see that it was about reasons to go to the ER.
  > The big bold letters threw me off. Saying if you have these issues, contact the ER, if not, continue with express care. We don’t read the little letters, we read the big ones. 
- [EC subway map] Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
  - Based on your task: making an appointment to be seen for something *today*, would you continue with this request?
    - Why / why not?
- [EC form request screen] Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
    > This makes sense, can I use Express care? – then my mind is on how to use express care. 
    > Screen two, they will call me to confirm. Pretty straightforward. There’s nothing confusing about this page, very easy to understand. Should I try to schedule the request, or just cancel? 
  - What would you do from here?
    > If I had cold or flu, I would want to request a screening. I would click on yes I want to request a screening. 
    > I have a list of symptoms I can choose. There’s no little box to type in my symptoms, so I have to choose the ones that are closest, that most relate, but would be nice to have a little box to type in symptoms that are not on the list. 
  - What do you think will happen once you submit this form?
  - Prompt if necessary: Does "request a phone screening" meet your expectations for making a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment?
    > Yes, but there should be more options. But it’s very easy so far. 
- [EC confirmation screen] Do you think you will get a call back *today*?
  > If I submitted within that window, yes, I would expect a call back. 
  - What if you specify a "best times for VA to call" window?
- Is there anything else you'd like to share about this?

## Section 6: Closing Interview - 5 minutes
- In the future, will you continue using or try to schedule a VA medical appointment using VA.gov?
  > Definitely.
  - Why / why not?
    > Its more convenient. I can do it online any time. 
- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today?
  > Definitely. 
  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus?
    > Um, of course. I would be helpful.
- Do you have any comments or questions about Online Scheduling or Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  
  > No, it’s very simple. I learned a lot and I hope the system will be 100% working soon.
