## Background

With VAOSR MVP in prod and live since March 2020, it's time to perform another user research and testing with Veterans.

This research should focus on areas in the experience that we know (through analytics and user feedback) are confusing or need iteration. Additionally, we want to collect general feedback and requests from Veterans for new VAOSR considerations in the future. 

## Some starting research questions:

1. What's impacting 'type of care' dropoff? (15.5% dropout rate on this page in the VAOS flow)
   - Does 'Type of Care' offerings meet Veteran expectation for online scheduling
2. What's impacting the high dropoff rate of Veterans on the 'Facilities' page?
   - 21% of users drop out of the Facilities page
   - 14% of that 21% of users drop out after receiving the "Your facility does not support online scheduling"
   - We have received multiple some user feedbacks that Veteran is not seeing the right facility/provider
   - One hypothesis: that users are confused by the new Parent Facility and Child Facility name selection for picking a VAMC and a specific child Facility. Old VAOS displayed location (city, state) then had user pick the facility name they were familiar with. 
3. Why are we seeing 10% dropoff rate on 'Select a time/date' calendar page? Is there UX/interaction issues or confusion? 
4. Appointments list - appointments listed first in ascending order with date furthest away at bottom of list. Then we show the 'requests' in alphabetical order. Received some feedback on this sorting/statuses. 
5. Past Appointments - this is a new feature - we want to see if it's meeting Veterans' needs. 
6. Cancellation - are Veterans having issues when trying to make cancellations? Are they expecting something additional when they try and cancel?

7. General feedback on new experience 
   - Do Veterans hit certain roadblocks in their scheduling experience in new VAOSR? What are those roadblocks?
8. Feedback on Express Care prototype

## Areas we know need attention:

- expanding 'reason for appointment' text box from 150 characters (already have user story for this)

## Questions / outside scope of this specific research:

7. Are Veterans expecting additional methods for communication in VAOS?
   - Example is in-app messaging to Schedulers and/or providers. Previous version of VAOS had a very limited 2-way messaging feature limited to 2 messages to scheduler. 
   - Specifically, if they have questions about specific appointment
   - Verification of notifications of appointment - email, phone, text 
8. Telehealth / video appointments - issues/expectations for these appointments through VAOS?

9. Login and tool instructions - a few Veterans have expressed that the login experience and the VAOSR tool instructions are confusing/hard to understand.
