# Research Plan for [UAE Team, OH direct appointments scheduling and requesting in VAHB app, TBD]

## Background üèóÔ∏è
	
Currently, Veterans can only view their appointments on the VA Health and Benefits (VAHB) app. In contrast, the Appointments tool on VA.gov enables logged-in Veterans to schedule and manage their appointments. The UAE team aims to enhance the VAHB app by introducing the ability to schedule appointments, beginning with facilities that use Oracle Health (OH). This research supports an initiative to expand appointment-related functionality within the VAHB app, empowering Veterans to more easily schedule, request, and cancel appointments directly from their mobile devices. 

<!-- Note from PR: Jenny, canceling OH appts is a separate initiative. You can probably pull that (or lmk if I'm wrong and we're testing OH cancelation as part of this) -->

### OCTO-DE Priorities

`Objective 1:  VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

`Objective 2: OCTO‚Äôs platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.`

> - **Key Result 1:** 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.

<!-- Note from PR: Jenny, I'm not sure if these OKRs can be accomplished by this project. Especially Objective 2, KR 1 seems out of scope.  -->

## Research Goals ü•Ö	

### Goals

`1.` **We want to evaluate how effectively and efficiently Veterans can schedule, request, and cancel with facilities that use Oracle Health within the VAHB app.**

`2.` **We want to identify pain points, usability issues, and unmet expectations for scheduling, requesting, and canceling with facilities that use Oracle Health within the VAHB app.**

`3.` **We want to understand Veterans' mental model and expectations related scheduling appointment.**
  
### Outcome

---

**This research will uncover what works well, where Veterans encounter friction, and how they mentally approach scheduling appointments. These insights will guide the team in making informed, user-centered design decisions that enhance the appointment experiencein both the VAHB app and the VA.gov web platform.**

### Research questions

`Goal 1: We want to evaluate how effectively and efficiently Veterans can schedule, request, and cancel with facilities that use Oracle Health within the VAHB app.`
1. Can Veterans successfully schedule, request, and cancel appointments with Oracle Health facilities using the VAHB app?
2. How much time, how many taps/steps, and how many errors or reversals does it take Veterans to finish each task?
     <!-- Note from PR: Jenny, this is measuring a few different things, it might be good to break it up. Also, it'd be good to see what your perspective is on these - what's a good vs. bad result?. For example, more taps/steps isn't always bad if the information is clearer. -->
3. Do Veterans feel confident that their appointment actions (scheduling, requesting, canceling) were completed successfully, why and why not?

`Goal 2: We want to identify pain points, usability issues, and unmet expectations for scheduling, requesting, and canceling with facilities that use Oracle Health within the VAHB app.`
1. At which screens, fields, or decision points do Veterans encounter confusion, delays, or errors while scheduling, requesting, or canceling?
2. Where does the current flow, content, or feedback fall short of what Veterans expect when completing these tasks?
3. Which aspects of the experience create frustration, anxiety, or distrust, and why?

`Goal 3: We want to understand Veterans' mental model and expectations related scheduling appointment.`
1. How do Veterans decide to make an appointment when presented with available providers and scheduling options (online, request, and call)?
2. What details (e.g., provider name, last appointment date) do Veterans expect to see at each step to feel informed and in control?
3. How do Veterans think the overall appointment scheduling process ‚Äúshould‚Äù work, and if previous experiences shape their expectations and how?

 <!-- Note from PR: Jenny, in general I think there are too many things to measure packed into a few of these - see Goal 2/item 1 for example. To meet that goal, you'll need a list of each screen, field, and decision point, and for each you'll need a method to measure confusion level, delays, or errors. I'm assuming you mean user errors and delays, since the system errors and delays are largely in control of the prototype. A usability test of a Figma prototype is likely not robust enough to handle that level of measurement detail. I'd recommend simplifying these. One thing that may help is to make sure each thing you're measuring is tied to one of your hypotheses. -->

### Hypotheses

---

1. At least 90 % of participants will successfully schedule, request, and cancel an appointment on their first attempt without facilitator assistance.
2. All participants will complete each task quickly; a few may back-track or abandon the scheduling flow before finishing.
3. At least 85 % of participants will rate their confidence in task completion as 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale.
4. The highest friction will occur on facilities selection and providers selection screens, due to personal needs and preferences.
5. Some participants will expect more content around features and functionalities that won't be available, such as type of care and providers they can't schedule with.
6. Most participants will prefer to schedule with a provider on the app now, instead of requesting and calling.
7. Participants will expect to see providers and their availabilities at the same time to help them choose who and when to schedule their appointments. 

<!-- Notes from PR:

- For 1: when you say "without facilitator assistance" it might be helpful to clarify that. They may have questions in general - does answering those count as assistance? Or just helping them when they get completely stuck?
- For 2: How fast is "quickly"? Need a way to measure this. Also "a few may back-track" is a separate hypothesis.
- For 4: How will you measure "friction"?
- For 6: Maybe change this to "Most participants will indicate a preference for scheduling through the app over requesting or calling". That focuses it on the modality vs. how they schedule (with a provider). Also, it would be good to ask them their preference both before and after they see the experience.

## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è
	
- Semi-structured interviews: Ask participants questions before starting the tasks, and ask follow up questions during and after tasks to understand their decision-making, and thought processes.
- Usability testing: Assign participants clear, representative tasks and observe their interactions with the tool ‚Äî measuring success rates, error patterns, and feedback ‚Äî to evaluate overall usability and identify areas for improvement.

## Recruitment üéØ	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*


### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 


### Recruitment criteria

- `Veterans:` **10**
- `Caregivers:` N/A
- `Dependents:` N/A
- `Total:` **10**

<!-- Note from PR: Jenny, I would recruit for 18 and aim for a minimum of 12 -->

### Primary criteria (must-haves)

- `All participants must have a MHV account and have used it in the past 12 months.`

<!-- Note from PR: Jenny, include the criteria `All participants must be registered at an Oracle Health facility` since you're asking for that in your screener q's -->

#### Screener questions
1. In the past 12 months or upcoming 12 months, did you or do you have appointments at any of the following facilities? (Yes/No) (If no, Disqualify)
  - Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington
  - Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center in Walla Walla, Washington
  - VA Central Ohio Healthcare System in Columbus, Ohio
  - Roseburg VA Health Care System in Roseburg, Oregon
  - VA Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center and Clinics in White City, Oregon
2. Have you used My HealtheVet to view or manage your appointments? (Yes - 5 /No - 5)
3. Have you used VA Benefits and Health app on your phone? (Yes - 5 /No - 5)

<!-- Note from PR: Jenny, shouldn't q2 be Yes - 10? Otherwise it negates your primary criteria doesn't it? If they have an MHV account, they will know because they have used it -->

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)

- `At least 4 participants with a cognitive disabilty`
- `At least 1 who lives in a rural area`

**Screener questions**
1. Do you find it difficult to remember or learn new things, focus on a task, or make decisions? (We ask this because we want to make sure that our tools work for people who live with challenges like these.) - Yes (looking for 4 participants)


## Timeline üóìÔ∏è
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**
