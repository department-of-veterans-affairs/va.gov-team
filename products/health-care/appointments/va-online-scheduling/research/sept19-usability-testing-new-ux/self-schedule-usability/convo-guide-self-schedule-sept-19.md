# Convo Guide: Self-Scheduling Flow VAOS

LINK to Prototype: 



# Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauren  / Alex, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling doctor's appointments.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability or knowledge. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
  - If needed: **We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.**
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"**

## Warm Up

*Looking for:* 

- *Does the user know the concepts of clinics?* 
- *Do they know the name of their own clinic?* 
- *Are they conflating MHV with VAOS?*

------

#### Do you have a primary care doctor who you see at VA?

- *If YES, ask the following and skip the next question.* 
  - **How do you schedule appointments with that doctor?** 
  - **Do you see the same doctor every time, or do you go to a care team?**
  - **Does the word "clinic" sound familiar to you?** 
    - *if yes:* **Do you happen to know the name of your clinics at VA?** 
- *If NO: Continue to next question*

#### Have YOU ever scheduled a VA health appointment online? 

- *If YES*: 

  - **Can you tell me how you did that?**
  - **What type of appointment did you book online?**

- *If NO:* 

  - **Has your provider or anyone at a VAMC ever told you about online scheduling at VA?** 
  - **Would you ever consider booking a VA appointment online?** 
    - Why, Why not?

  

## Task 1: Self-Schedule a Primary Care Appt (Rigid)

*Looking for:*

------

#### 1. I would like you to schedule a new appointment with your primary care doctor in the Green Clinic on October 9 at 2pm. Again, as you're doing this, please talk aloud about what you're choosing to click on and why, and any questions that you have.
