Research plan for VAOS appointments list screenreader usability test
=============

Background
----------

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

<!-- Explain why we're doing this iterative research process - what we want to accomplish, at a high level, with this redesign -->

The VA Online Scheduling and MyHealtheVet teams worked together to identify gaps between scheduling features in the two products. They completed an analysis [to identify gaps](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/HealthApartment/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B24A0A2A8-279E-42D1-B0E4-3C1C8EF5D5F5%7D&file=MHV%2BVAOS%20Gap%20analysis%20recommendations.docx&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.MAIN.SEARCH&ct=1656340079030&action=default&mobileredirect=true) between the two products. Then, the VAOS team [tested a design concept](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/2022-MHV%2BVAOS-appts-list-discovery/report-MHV%2BVAOS-appts-list-discovery.md) that would meet the needs identified in the gap analysis.

<!-- ^^ Add info about the usability study you completed -->

The VAOS team also wants to evaluate potential changes to the appointment details page content and navigation.

<!-- ^^ This doesn't really connect to anything that introduced it. Maybe move to the beginning of this section, and add the other goals of this work. -->

Building on those activities, this research will evaluate:

-   The screenreader usability of the redesigned appointment list

<!-- ^^ This doesn't need to be a separate bullet since there's only one item -->

Also see [Product's initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/appointment-list/product-outline-appointment-list-2022.md).

### OCTO Objectives

<!-- Check the OCTO objectives, are there any specifically about access? Or that a screenreader usability study would address? -->

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase ðŸ“ˆ

-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

Decrease ðŸ“‰

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

-   MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

-   MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
-   MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

-   Maintaining my emotional health
-   Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

-   MTM: Taking care of my health
-   MTM: Managing my declining health

Research goals
--------------

Test screenreader usability for appointment list redesign proof of concept

<!-- ^^Testing is what we're doing, but it's not the goal. We want to make the appointments list easy to navigate for screenreader users -->

### Outcome

We will use the findings to:

-   Finalize designs and update the appointments list.Â 

<!-- We will finalize the designs, but the outcome should be a list that's easy for screenreader users to navigate. -->


### Hypotheses

<!-- "The appointment list screenreader" I'm not sure what you mean here. Maybe "When a Veteran uses a screenreader to navigate the appointments list"? -->
The appointment list screenreader will:
-   Effectively deliver necessary appointment information to the Veteran.
-   Deliver information to the Veteran in appropriate order.
-   Be easy to navigate.

<!-- ^^ Rewrite these from the perspective of the Veteran; what will they be able to do? -->

### Research Questions

<!-- These questions are all focused on usability. If you want to get at value, maybe add one at the end like, "have you/would you ever use this tool to manage or view your appointments?" -->

**Evaluate screenreader usability and value of the appointment list redesign.**

* Does the information for each appointment make sense?
* Can Veterans differentiate between appointments?
* Can Veterans navigate to Past appointments?
* Can Veterans navigate to Pending appointments?
* What can Veterans navigate from the appointments list?

<!-- The last bullet doesn't make sense to me, maybe flesh that out a bit -->

Method
------

With screenreader participants only, we will run a moderated usability test of the appointment list. 

### Location

Remote, over Zoom.

### Research materials

For moderated usability test 
- [Conversation guide]() TBA

- [Staging Link]() 


Recruitment
-----------

### Recruitment approach

Perigean will recruit 5 total participants for this study.

<!-- Double this, or make it 12. We can close the study once we get 5. -->

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria**

-  5 participants that regularly use a screenreader.


<!-- Other studies have struggled to find screenreader users. Write a specific screener question Perigean can send along when they're recruiting folks. I would look at what other studies have done, and list specific screenreader tools. -->

**Secondary criteria:**

- At least 1 veteran with a cognitive disabilty
- At least 1 LGBTQ+ Veteran
- At least 1 Native Veteran

We will ask for Perigean support in recruiting and taking notes.

<!-- We'll be lucky if we get 5 screenreader users. I'd remove all the secondary criteria (just say "none") -->
