- [ ] Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study


### Day of the session

- [ ] Start a thread in [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) 
- [ ] Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/observer-guidelines) to your observers. 
- Note to observers in thread: 
    - [ ] You do not need to change your name to "observer"
    - [ ] I will ask the participant if we have their permission to invite observers. If they don't want observers present, I'll let you know in this thread.
    - [ ] If they agree, please join with video on, introduce yourself, and then go back on mute with video off.

### Starting the session
- [ ] Mute your Slack notifications.
- [ ] Make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- [ ] In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- [ ] Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants.

- [ ] When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:

## Introductions - 5 minutes

### When the participant joins:

- Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ciera I will be walking you through this session today. [Notetaker] Is also here to take notes and make sure I don't miss anything.

- Today we're going to talk about managing appointments on VA.gov, and how that experience works when using a screenreader. 

- I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. If it’s ok with you, I’ll have them join. 

_If no_ In the [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) let observers know that the participant does not want them observing. 

_If yes_ Thank you. I'll admit them now.

 - [ ] Let observers join with their video on. Each observer should come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off.

A few things I want to mention about how today's session:

    - There are no right or wrong answers, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the appointments feature and make it work better for everyone.
    
    - There’s no expectation to provide any personal information. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
    
    - This entire session should take about 90 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
    - We’ll talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where I’ll ask you to open a link on your device,and share your screen with us. 
    
    - Finally, is it ok if I record the audio of our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to something you said. The recordings will be destroyed after.
    
    - **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. Any minutes you spend with us are valuable today. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**
* Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?
* Great! Any questions before we continue?
* Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. 

_Start recording._

* Just to confirm, is it ok if we record this session?

## Participant Tech Setup

Next, I want to get our tech set up.

- **We like to use transcription to improve our notes. However, this Zoom setting turns on Closed Captions in Zoom, which can be a problem for screenreaders. Would it be disruptive do have Closed Captions on?**

   - If no, turn on transcription.

- Would you prefer video on or off?
  
- What device are you using to attend the session today?

- What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

- Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

You will be interacting with a prototype on the web. In order to do that I'll need you to navigate to a link, then log in with a test user.

    - I have a link to the tool I'll ask you to navigate using the screenreader. **Would you prefer that I send that in the Zoom chat, to your email, or by another method?**
    - If another method, confirm their contact number/email address.
    - Send user [Staging Link]() 
    - Send user Login credentials
    
- Now I'm going to have you share your screen, and then I'll send you a link to a prototype so we can look at that together.

- If participant can share their screen, walk them through screen sharing.
    -  [Screenreader Screen Share Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/screen-reader-checklist)
    -  Make


### If they can't share their screen

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have you "drive" and verbally walk me through what you are doing. Does that should alright?


### If they can't share their audio
????

### After prototype is open

Thanks!

We're going to run through a series of tasks related to managing your health care appointments at VA. As you're going through these tasks, it's most helpful if you say what's on your mind. Your thoughts and feelings will help us make this better for all Veterans.


## Task 1: Find the appointments list.

Say you wanted to find out what health appointments you have scheduled for the next month. Show me how you would find that from here.

## Task 2: Log in to VA.gov

PROMPT: Next, you'll need to login using a test user. I've sent the test user login credentials to (your email/phone/the chat)

#### Things to watch for:

- Where do they struggle to navigate to the appointments list?

## Task 5: Understand Pending Appointments
Tell me about some of the appointments you have requested.

**Follow up:**

    - If no longer needed an appointment and wanted to cancel one of these requests, how would you do that from here?

### Things to watch for:

## Emergency Exit

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.
