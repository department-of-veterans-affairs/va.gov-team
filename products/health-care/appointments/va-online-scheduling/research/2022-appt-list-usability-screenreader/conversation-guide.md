# Conversation Guide 

- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in 
Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/observer-guidelines) to your observers. 

Note to observers in thread: 
- You do not need to change your name to "observer"
- I will ask the participants permission for observers. If they don't want observers, I'll let you know in this thread.

### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:

## Introductions - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ciera I will be walking you through this session today. [Notetaker] Is also here to take notes and make sure I  don't miss anything.

I also have some colleagues in the waiting room who would be interested in observing. They won't be speaking during the session, just taking notes.

_If no_ In the [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) let observers know that the participant does not want them observing. 

_If yes_  Thank you. I'll admit them now.

    - Admit observers. Make sure they are muted.

Today we're going to talk about managing appointments using a screenreader on VA.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour and a half.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

Start recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Tech Setup

Before we continue, I want to check if you're comfortable with a few things:

- **We like to use transcription to improve our notes. However, this Zoom setting turns on Closed Captions in Zoom, which can be a problem for screenreaders. Would it be disruptive do have Closed Captions on?**

   - If no, turn on transcription

- **Would you prefer video on or off?**

- I have a link to the tool I'll ask you to navigate using the screenreader. **Would you prefer that I send that in the Zoom chat, to your email, or by another method?**

     - If another method, confirm their contact number/email address.
     - * Send user [Staging Link]() 
  
  
- What device are you using to attend the session today?

- What type of screenreader are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

- Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

Thank you! 

## Task 1: Open link to staging and share

You will be interacting with a prototype on the web. In order to do that I'll need you to navigate to a link, then log in with a test user.

I’ll walk you through the process of sharing your screen, then I'll send you a link to the prototype.

Now I'm going to have you share your screen, and then I'll send you a link to a prototype so we can look at that together.

* If participant can share their screen, walk them through screen sharing.
    * [Screenreader Screen Share Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/screen-reader-checklist)

As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

#### If can't share

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have you "drive" and verbally walk me through what you are doing. Does that should alright?

#### After prototype is open

Thanks!

We're going to run through a series of tasks in an imaginary scenario. As you're going through these tasks, it's most helpful if you say what's on your mind. Your thoughts and feelings will help us make this better for all Veterans.

## Task 2: Log on to VA.gov

I’d like you to go to a test website and log in. I've sent the login credentials to (Your email/phone/the chat)

Use Login.gov to sign in 
* Email address is [TBA] 
* Password is [TBA]

## Task 3: Find the appointments list.

Now can you navigate to your appointments?

**Follow up:** Tell me what that was like for you? 

#### Things to watch for:

- _Can participant navigate to appointment list?_
- _Does participant know what page they are on?

## Task 4: Navigate between the list and details pages

How would you find more information about one of these appointments?

**Follow up:** 
   - Before going to the details page, did you understand what the appointment was? 

#### Things to watch for:

- _Does participant know when appointment takes place?_ 
- _Does participant understand modality?_

## Task 5: View Pending Appointments
You want to check the status of an appointment you requested. How would you do that from here?

**Follow up:** What are your thoughts on this page?

#### Things to watch for:

- _Does the participant click the “pending” link?_
- _Can the participant find a pending appointment?_
- _Can the participant find the time requested?_
- _Does participant understand pending appointments?_

## Task 6: View Past Appointments
You want to check appointments that have already occurred. How would you do that?

#### Things to watch for:

- _Can participant find the “past” link?_
- _Does participant understand past appointments?_

## Post-Task Interview

- Does anything you saw today reflect how you manage your health care appointments? 

- Of everything you saw today, what was the most confusing, or challenging?

- What worked well?

- What could we do better?

## Thank-You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.
