# [WIP] Research Plan for Oracle Health Scheduling UAT and Interviews, Appointments team, 01/2026

Background
----------

The goal of the MHV appointments tool is to allow Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their health care appointments, no matter which health care system they are in. The appointments teams are working to integrate health care appointment functionality from [facilities that use Oracle Health EHRM systems](https://digital.va.gov/ehr-modernization/ehr-deployment-schedule/).

Currently the appointment tool can display these appointments. This effort will test functionality being built that will allow Veterans to schedule appointments into the Oracle Health EHRM.

This functionality has been previously tested and run through the Collab Cycle. This will test the live functionality with actual user data.

Also see [Product's initiative brief.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/2025-oracle-health-scheduling/oracle-health-scheduling-initiative-brief.md)


### OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

**Increase 📈**

- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

**Decrease 📉**

- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

* MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

* MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
* MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

* Maintaining my emotional health
* Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

* MTM: Taking care of my health
* MTM: Managing my declining health
  
## Research Goals	

1. Validate Oracle Health scheduling functionality.
2. Identify and report any issues with the feature.

**Stretch Goals**
- Better understand a user's mental model around how they choose providers

### Outcome

The learnings from this study will be used to improve Oracle Health scheduling tools, and inform other research around how Veterans choose their providers when scheduling.

### Research questions

**UAT**

- Are participants able to easily complete all of the scheduling scenarios?
- Are any scenarios difficult to complete?
- Are any features missing that are critical to scheduling an appointment?

#### Stretch questions

**Mental model**

- What information and considerations are important to participants when choosing a new provider?
- What information and considerations are important to participants when scheduling with an existing provider?




### Hypotheses


## Methodology	

User acceptance testing (UAT)

- We will start with an an interview to understand participants' mental model around scheduling with a provider
- Then we will ask them to test key scenarios. These are listed in the [test plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/2025-oracle-health-scheduling/test-plan.md#main-test-scenarios)

### Location
Remote, moderated, on Zoom. [TBD - switch to Teams? if that's secure enough.]

### Research materials
Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

- OCTO will recruit a minimum of 6 trusted users for this study
- OCTO will manage scheduling these sessions

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria**

-  6 Veteran participants who can schedule and request appointments at VA Central Ohio Health Care System

**Screener question**

Are you registered at VA Central Ohio Health Care System [TBD - Assuming we're only testing with folks registered at Columbus so we can work with staff there to cancel any scheduled appts/rquests]

## Timeline

- Research plan reviewed and approved by OCTO no later than 1/14/25
- Scheduling at OH features in prod ~1/14/25

### Prepare

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: January 15th-31st [Final datepending soft launch of scheduling features]

### Length of sessions
45 minutes. 

### Availability

	
## Team Roles	

**Please list the names of people in each role.** In the Slack study channel, send an email and primary phone number for the moderator. Send emails only for the notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker.
