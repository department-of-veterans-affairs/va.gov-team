# [WIP] Research Plan for Oracle Health Scheduling UAT and Interviews, Appointments team, 06/2025 

Background
----------

The goal of the MHV appointments tool is to allow Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their health care appointments, no matter which health care system they are in. The appointments teams are working to integrate health care appointment functionality from [facilities that use Oracle Health EHRM systems](https://digital.va.gov/ehr-modernization/ehr-deployment-schedule/).

Currently the appointment tool can display these appointments. This effort will test functionality being built that will allow Veterans to schedule appointments into the Oracle Health EHRM.

This functionality has been previously tested and run through the Collab Cycle. This will test the live functionality with actual user data.

### OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

**Increase ðŸ“ˆ**

- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

**Decrease ðŸ“‰**

- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

* MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

* MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
* MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

* Maintaining my emotional health
* Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

* MTM: Taking care of my health
* MTM: Managing my declining health
  
## Research Goals	

Goal 1: Ensure a Oracle Health scheduling meets user needs. 

Goal 2: Validate Oracle Health scheduling functionality.

Goal 3: Identify any issues with the feature before release.

Goal 4: Understand Veterans' mental model and expectations related to scheduling an appointment with their health care providers.

### Outcome

The learnings from this study will be used to improve Oracle Health scheduling tools, and inform other research around how Veterans choose their providers when scheduling

### Research questions

**Mental model**

- What information and considerations are important to participants when choosing a new provider?
- What information and considerations are important to participants when scheduling with an existing provider?

**UAT**

- Are participants able to easily complete all of the scheduling scenarios?
- Are any scenarios difficult to complete?
- Are any features missing that are critical to scheduling an appointment?


### Hypotheses


## Methodology	
User interviews and user acceptance testing (UAT):
- We will start with an an interview to understand participants' mental model around scheduling with a provider
- Then we will ask them to test key scenarios. These are listed in the [test plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/2025-oracle-health-scheduling/test-plan.md#test-scenarios)

### Location
Remote, moderated, on Zoom. 

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials â€“ including this plan â€“  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.


## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:TBD

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 90 minutes for AT users. 60 minutes for non-AT users. 
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 4

### Availability
