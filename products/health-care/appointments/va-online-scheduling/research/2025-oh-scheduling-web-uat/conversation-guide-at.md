- [ ] Step 3


### Day of the session
- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in 
Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).



### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Introductions - 5 minutes

### When the participant joins:

- Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa I will be walking you through this session today. We also have a Peter here to take notes and make sure I don't miss anything.

- Today we're going to talk about managing appointments on VA.gov, and how that experience works when using a screenreader. 

- I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. Is it okay with you if they join us? 

_If no_ In the [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) let observers know that the participant does not want them observing. 

_If yes_ Thank you. I'll admit them now.

 - [ ] Let observers join with their video on. Each observer should come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off.

There are a few things I want to mention about today's session:

   - There are no right or wrong answers, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. We just want to hear your thoughts, so that we can improve the appointment features and make it work better for everyone.
    
   - You will be interacting with your VA.gov account today. We would like to enable the updated appointments feature and have you browse it. This means anything you do here could affect your account, but we will not be asking you to make any changes today. We will want to look at your appointments list, so we may see your upcoming appointments and history. We won't share this with anyone outside of the session.
   **Just to confirm**: Would you be comfortable sharing this information during this session? If not, that is completely fine.
       - If no: would you be comfortable with logging in and describing what you see?
    
   - This entire session should take about 90 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
   - We’ll talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where I’ll ask you to open a link on your device,and share your screen with us. 
    
   - Finally, is it ok if I record the audio of our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to something you said. The recordings will be destroyed after.
    
   - **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. Any minutes you spend with us are valuable today. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**
* Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?
* Great! Any questions before we continue?
* Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. 

_Start recording._

* Just to confirm, is it ok if we record this session?

## Participant Tech Setup

Next, I want to get our tech set up.

- **We like to use transcription to improve our notes. However, this Zoom setting turns on Closed Captions in Zoom, which can be a problem for screenreaders. Would it be disruptive do have Closed Captions on?**

   - If no, turn on transcription.

- Would you prefer video on or off?
  
- What device are you using to attend the session today?

- What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

- Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

You will be interacting with your VA.gov account today. We are going to enable this new feature on your account for this session. Just know that this is live and while anything you do here could affect your account, we will not be asking you to make any changes today.
    
- Now I'm going to have you share your screen so that we can go over it together.

**Would you prefer that I send that in the Zoom chat, to your email, or by another method?**
- If another method, confirm their contact number/email address.
- Send user [Link](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments) 

- If participant can share their screen, walk them through screen sharing.
    -  [Screenreader Screen Share Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/screen-reader-checklist)


### If they can't share their screen

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have you "drive" and verbally walk me through what you are doing. Does that sound alright?


### If they can't share their audio

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA?
- If yes: what is your disability rating?
- If no, skip to question 2.
2. 

## Task 1: Log in to VA.gov

And just to confirm, are you okay sharing your health appointment info during this session?

#### Things to watch for:

- Where do they struggle to navigate to the appointments list?
- Was any part of the task easy?

## Task 3: Understand an upcoming Appointment and then cancel it

PROMPT: Tell me about some of the appointments you have coming up. Select one. What does "Prepare for your appointment" mean and what would you expect to be there? 

Now we are going to cancel this appoitment. 

**Follow up:** 
- If they didn't navigate to the details page during the initial search: 
    - If you needed to contact someone about one of these appointments, how would you find that information

### Things to watch for:

- Does participant understand when appointment takes place? Especially for days with multiple appointments
- Do they understand where it will take place?
- Do they understand how/the modality?

## Task 4: Navigate to Pending Appointments
You have requested some appointments that the VA hasn't confirmed yet. Can you find those from here?

**Follow up:** What are your thoughts on this page?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant click the “pending” link?
- Can the participant find a pending appointment?
- Can the participant find the time requested?
- Does participant understand pending appointments?

## Task 5: Understand Pending Appointments
Tell me about some of the appointments you have requested.

**Follow up:** 
- If they didn't navigate to the details page during the initial search: 
    - If you no longer needed an appointment and wanted to cancel one of these requests, how would you do that from here?

### Things to watch for:
- How did they talk about requests? Have they experienced them before?

## Task 6: Navigate to Past Appointments
You want to check appointments that have already occurred. How would you do that? 

#### Things to watch for:

- Can they find the “past” link?_
- Does participant understand past appointments?

## Task 7: Understand Past Appointments and AVS
What would you expect to find if you clicked on a specific past appoitment? Select a past appointment and tell me what information you find. Can you tell me what the after visit summary is?
Is there anything missing? 

## Task 8: Schedule an appointment
You would like to schedule an appointment, how would you go about doing that? Go ahead and schedule an appointment. 

Choose a location:
What do you think "recent locations" means?


## Task 9: Add an appointment to calendar
Go ahead and add this appointment to your calendar, how you would you do that and what would you expect to happen?

## Task 10: Join a video visit

## Post-Task Interview

- Does anything we went over today reflect how you manage your health care appointments? 

- What tools do you use to track and manage your appointments.

- What are some of the easiest-to use online tools for scheduling and managing appointment?

- Thinking about all your scheduling activities (not just for health care) do you prefer to schedule online, over the phone, or some other way?

- Of everything you saw today, what was the most confusing, or challenging?

- What worked well?

- What could we do better?


## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
