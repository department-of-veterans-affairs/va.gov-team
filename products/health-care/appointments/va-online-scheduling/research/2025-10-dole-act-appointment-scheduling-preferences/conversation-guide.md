## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tim/Nina] and [Tim/Nina] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about making updates to health care settings.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

  - **If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - **If yes:** Admit observers.

Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

*(If applicable)* You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

* [Record answer here]

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans' experiences? One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

* [Record answer here]

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

**Start recording.**

After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

* [Record answer here]

Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

## Task 1: Past experiences with a VA staff scheduler/self-scheduling on VA.gov - 10 minutes

We are going to be interacting with a prototype during this session. But before that, I’d like to ask you a few questions to better understand your past experiences and your needs in regard to VA staff scheduling an appointment for you.

- Can you tell me about the last time you talked to a scheduler to make a VA appointment?
- Why did the scheduler make the appointment instead of you using the self-scheduling tool on VA.gov?
- Was the appointment made for you in real-time while interacting with the scheduler?
- If not, how were you informed of the scheduled appointment details?
- Have you ever submitted an appointment request online?
- Did the scheduler call you afterwards with additional questions or did they have enough information from the request to schedule without contacting you again?
- What did you like or dislike about a VA scheduler making the appointment for you?
- What information do you wish the scheduler would have had before scheduling an appointment for you?
- How would you like to relay this information to staff?
- How would you improve the overall experience when scheduling appointments with staff?

Great, thank you for the very helpful insight. Now we’re going to move on to the prototype; the prototype simulates an experience on VA.gov, where I’ll be asking you questions while you navigate through it.



## Task 2: Find a preference from the My VA landing page - 20 minutes

**Note to moderator:** Use Prototype A MY VA landing page for this task.

Now, I'm going to send you a link to the 1st of the 2 prototypes in the Zoom chat. Since this is a prototype for testing purposes only, it may not work as you may expect even though it may look like the actual VA.gov website; and just a reminder, this will not affect any of your VA information.

I've just sent you a link in the chat. Please open the Zoom chat, click on that link, and then share your screen. But please don’t click on anything just yet.

**Moderator Note:** Help participant with the prototype if necessary. If the participant is unable to share their screen, then share your screen and follow the participant’s instructions [mobile screen sharing instructions](#).

**Scenario:** Can you show me where you believe you would go to [insert sub-group here].

- **sub-group 1a:** “…select your preference for a male or female provider.”
- **sub-group 1b:** “…add your preference on how you want a scheduler to contact you to schedule a medical appointment.”
- **sub-group 1c:** “…specify what day and times you prefer to have your medical appointments.”

Please think aloud as you’re moving through this prototype and explain your thought process. I may stop you from proceeding while you navigate to ask you questions before you proceed to the next screen.

**Moderator Note:** The participant may take several different paths through trial and error to get to scheduling preferences.

- Why are you choosing “X”?
- Why did you believe you would find it in that section?
- What other preferences would you expect to find there?
- Is there anywhere else that you’d expect to find these preferences?

Move on to task 3.



## Task 3: Scheduling preferences – 15 minutes

**Note to moderator:** Ask the participant to click on the VA logo to start this task on the Scheduling preferences page.

Next, please click on the VA logo located at the upper left corner of this page.

Similar to the last time, please think aloud as you read through this page scrolling down to the end, and back up again—but please don’t click on anything just yet.

- Can you describe the main purpose of this page?

**Note to moderator:** Ask participant to open each card for all 3 sections and ask the following questions for each card (all 6 preferences):

- Under “X” preferences, “X?”, before you select anything, what do you think the purpose of this preference is?
- What do you expect to find when you click edit?
- Go ahead and try to update that preference.
- Would you add, delete, or change anything about this preference?
- How do you expect the VA to utilize this information? What workflows do you expect it to impact?
- Do you believe letting VA know this preference would be helpful, not helpful, make no difference, or don’t know how it will help you interact with VA?
- Do you think this preference should apply to all medical appointments or would you make different decisions based upon each appointment or type of care?
- Would you expect to find this preference on any other section on VA.gov?

**Note to moderator:** Now move on to asking participants about the overall page.

- What’s your overall impression of the scheduling preferences page?
- Would you add or remove any preferences?
- If you could change one thing about this page, what would it be?
- If you had any questions about updating these preferences, what would you do next? Who would you contact?

Okay, thank you for that. We’re done with all of the questions, and you can stop screen sharing.



## Consent to Use Video Clips

- Do you have any questions for me before we close this session?
- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
  - [Record answer here]

## Thank-You and Closing – 5 minutes

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!



### Emergency Exit

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.
