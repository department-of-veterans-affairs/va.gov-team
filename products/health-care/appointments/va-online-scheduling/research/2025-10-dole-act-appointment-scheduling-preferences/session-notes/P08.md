Intro - 5 minutes 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tim/Nina] and [Tim/Nina] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about making updates to health care settings. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you: 

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. 

 I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA.  

If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know. 

I know Perigean asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session? 

If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom. 

If yes: Admit observers. 

Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.) 

Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth 

(If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits. 

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.  

After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. 

Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

[That’s fine] 

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?  

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image.  

Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products.  

These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed. 

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? 

[Absolutely] 

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. 

➡️ Start recording. 

After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording. 

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

[Yes] 

Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? 

[Yes] 

 

Task 1: Past experiences with a VA staff scheduler/self-scheduling on VA.gov - 10 minutes 

We are going to be interacting with a prototype during this session. But before we get to that, I’d like to ask you a few questions to better understand your past experiences and your needs in regard to VA health care appointments. 

 

Can you let me know about your most recent experience with a VA scheduler when you were setting up an appointment? * I’m part of the Houston Area VA sysytme and moved here form St.Louise system and seen a huge difference. You wait on the phone up to 30 minutes to schedule. Often times they answer after 5 minutes, but then they put you on hold and that hold tends to be an eternal hold. 

 

What information do you believe would be useful for them to have for you when scheduling your appointments without you * They would already have my number, my last 4, my name. 
*Being able to see referrals.

What does self-scheduling mean to you? 

 

What does help with self-scheduling mean to you? 

Would you like to self-schedule VA appointments or do you preferer help when scheduling and why? 

How would you improve the overall experience when scheduling appointments with VA staff? 

 

Great, thank you for the very helpful insight.  

 

 

Task 2: Find a preference from the My VA landing page - 20 minutes 

 

Note to moderator: Group 1 starts Task 2 after Task 1 is completed, then moves on to Task 3 after Task 2 is completed.  Once participant opens prototype link, instruct them to click on T2 to go to the MY VA landing page. 

 

Note to notetaker: Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature. 

 

1. Now, I’ll send you a link to the prototype in the chat located at the X and have you click on it and share your screen. But don’t click on anything else until I ask you to do so. 

2. Since this is a prototype for testing purposes only, it may not work as you may expect even though it may look like the actual VA.gov website; and just a reminder, this will not affect any of your VA information. 

3. Okay, now that you’ve shared your screen, click on T2. 

 Note to moderator: Help participant with the prototype if necessary. If the participant is unable to share their screen, then share your screen and follow the participant’s instructions mobile screen sharing instructions. 

 

4. Scenario: Can you show me where you believe you would go to…[*To schedule an appointment, what I’m looking for is something with appointments and where I can manage. I’m looking to see where I can make an appointment. I would think that I would click on manage appointment and maybe be contacted via email. I don’t see it here. I was hoping for an area to modify where they would contact me for appointments. I would think it would be something general. Most of the time I feel like those options are on your profile.  I would probably click on My HealtheVet to see my  profile. I would click on healthcare settings. I guess I’m looking at different labels and most important at the topo and least at the bottom. For me I like seeing the most important at the top and anything below, I hardly scroll. The hierarchy makes sense.  
-Layout of the page? *No, I would not change anything. I feel like it’s self-explanatory. 

sub-groups 1a & 2a: … “Indicate whether you prefer to be seen by a male or female provider”. 

sub-groups 1b & 2b: …”Indicate how you want a scheduler to contact you to schedule  medical appointments. 

sub-groups 1c & 2c: …” Indicate what day and times you prefer to have your medical appointments. 

 

5. Please think aloud as you’re moving through this prototype and explain your thought process. I may stop you from proceeding while you navigate to ask you questions before you proceed to the next screen.  

 Note to moderator:  The participant may take several different paths through trial and error to get to scheduling preferences. 

6. Why are you choosing “X”? - Why did you believe you would find it in that section? 

7. What are some other ways to tell the VA scheduler anything about your health that could be relevant? 

 

Is there anywhere else you'd expect to make those types of selections? 

 

Moderator Note: Move on to task 3. 

 

 

 

 

 

Task 3: Scheduling preferences – 15 minutes 

 

Note to moderator: Group 2 starts Task 3 after Task 1 after Task 1 is completed , then moves on to Task 2 after Task 3 is completed.  Instruct participant to click on the VA logo to get to the T3  link for the Scheduling preferences page. 

 

Note to notetaker: Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature. 
*My impression , it looks like it would be used for someone to schedule me an appointment and what days, times work best for me. Then they would schedule that appointment for me based on that available information. I’ll be honest, the information makes sense but I don’t think it would work for me because you never know where they are on the schedule. Sometimes they are 40 days out on the schedule. 
 -Edit contacts *No, I would not change anything there because that would change the masses. 
* I would expect to click on your preference on what you want and contact me on my mobile phone and I like the option of getting an email. For me personally, it would be email and that is based on the system I’m in; in case I miss their phone call. 
* I prefer a preference of hierarchy.
* I find the preference highly useful. Because If I’m able to manage and ensure that I’m being communicated. I prefer an email or text instead of waiting on the phone 30 minutes.  
* I would want them the same across the board. 
1.Now, I’ll have you click on the VA logo which will take you back to the first screen, but this time you will click on …[insert main group here].  

Group 1: …T3 

Group 2: …T2 

 

2.Similar to the last time, please think aloud as you read through this page scrolling down to the end, and back up again - but please don’t click on anything just yet. 

Note to notetaker: Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature. 

 

3.Can you describe the main purpose of this page? *Maybe the various types of appointments and list a specialist of your primary care. 
*

 

Note to moderator:  Ask participant to open each card for all 3 sections and ask the following questions for each card (all 6 preferences): 

 

Under “X” preferences, “X?”, before you select anything, what do you think the purpose of this preference is?  *This is not what I was thinking but after looking at it, it makes sense. 
*I think I’m still processing things from the previous question, and once I clicked on it, it made sense. 
-Would you change or add anything? *I feel like those two sum up everything. I don’t think there is anything additional to be there. 
* I would think to have days of the week and you can select a range of times. I would want to know a specific time but in my case, I would choose no preference because I want email. 
 *

sub-groups 1a & 2a: … “Indicate whether you prefer to be seen by a male or female provider”. 

sub-groups 1b & 2b: …”Indicate how you want a scheduler to contact you to schedule  medical appointments. 

sub-groups 1c & 2c: …” Indicate what day and times you prefer to have your medical appointments. 



 

For card 3 Appointment preferences: Do you want help scheduling your appointments? Ask “What do you expect to happen for each of the options”:  * It means basically, someone, instead of me it would be someone else scheduling the appointment for me. I didn’t expect to see a no preference. * It means basically, someone, instead of me it would be someone else scheduling the appointment for me. I didn’t expect to see a no preference.


Yes 

No 

No preference 

 

For card 6 Provider preferences: Do you want help choosing your provider? Ask “What do you expect to happen for each of the options”:  * I would expect preference built around my preference. I don’t expect that since there are so many different variables to do that. I think this should be across the board for people who need that or specific parameters. 
*Just an option to choose or no preference. That is exactly what I expected. 
Yes 

No 

No preference *I would expect to choose that save it. 
*The VA would just schedule me based on that it wouldn’t matter if it’s male or female. 
*I think it’s useful. Because as a female, for secure appointments, you may want a female over a male. 
*Why not, even if it’s not exposing a particular body part, it’s good to have that option there. 
* I don’t think you can make it more helpful. The resource is already there. 
 

5. What do you expect to find when you click edit?  *I’m assuming that means that they will look for a doctor, I have never seen that before. I’m assuming they are looking at the doctors who are available. I don’t know what to make of this question. They choose your provider and I don’t understand what role it plays. We never had a choice to choose our providers; they chose for us. To me, they would assign me to someone based on the case load and availability. 
*If, I say no I don’t want you choosing my provider, does that mean I get to choose my provider. I would need more information because the yes and no doesn’t give me enough options and you are inclined to say no. 
*just those two would make it more clear to me to choose a provider. I would want that option because I have VA doctors that I would never want to see again. 
6. Go ahead and try to update that preference.  *It’s helpful to have a preference, but this is not helpful. 

7.Would you add, delete, or change anything about this preference? *

8.How do you expect the VA to utilize this information? What workflows do you expect to impact, or do you believe letting VA know this preference would be helpful, not helpful, or are you unsure?-Why? 

9.Do you think this preference should apply to all medical appointments or would you make different decisions based upon each appointment or type of care? 

10.Would you expect to find this preference on any other section on VA.gov? 

 

Note to moderator:  Now move on to asking participants about the overall page. 

13.What’s your overall impression of the scheduling preferences page? 

14.Would you add or remove any preferences? 

15.If you could change one thing about this page, what would it be? 

16.If you had any questions about updating these preferences, what would you do next? Who would you contact? 

Okay, thank you for that. We’re done with all of the questions, and you can stop screen sharing.  

Edit Preferences: * Ideally you want to get in within a week or two, even with a specialist. I feel like you’ll pick the dates but they may not be available.  To me it’s not helpful with my 10 plus years’ experience with the VA. They never have what you need available. 
*I think I was thinking more dates versus days in the month. I think if the feature is there, it’s okay to have it there for all appointments but it doesn’t matter if it’s an ortho appointment, regardless of the appointment. 
*Somone of these thoughts I have already stated. I feel like most of this, I would not use and that is my personal circumstances. 
*I would like to see, not so much of needing options, what would work the best is I make an appointment with a  specialist and I go there to pick my date and time. I live an hour from the VA, I don’t know want someone to make an appointment for me based on the criteria.
*Having someone to call you and extra stuff is not modern at all. All this stuff is still old school. 
*If I had questions, they have a contact us at the bottom, if I were looking for help, that is where I would look.  

Consent to use video clips 

Do you have any questions for me before we close this session? *No, I don’t. 

I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences. 

If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? 

[Record answer here] 

Thank-You and Closing – 5 minutes 

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. 

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in future research studies. 

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day! 

Emergency Exit 🚨 

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.
