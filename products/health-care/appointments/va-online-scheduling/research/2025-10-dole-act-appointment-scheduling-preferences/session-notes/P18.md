## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tim/Nina] and [Tim/Nina] is taking notes. I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...
Today we're going to talk about making updates to health care settings.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities.
- I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA.
- If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
- Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
- Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- (If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
- Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
  [Yes, that is fine.]
- Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
- Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?
  [Yes.]
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
    ➡️ Start recording.
- After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
  [Yes.]
- Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?
  [Yes.]

## Task 1: Past experiences with a VA staff scheduler/self-scheduling on VA.gov - 5 minutes
1. We are going to be interacting with a prototype during this session. But before we get to that, I’d like to ask you a few questions to better understand your past experiences and your needs in regard to VA health care appointments.

2.	Can you let me know about your most recent experience with a VA scheduler when you were setting up an appointment? * Very easy. I went to MyHealtheVet which is the only way I secure a message, and I wrote to my PCP, and his nurse answered, and it was pretty easy. 
a.	What information do you believe would be useful for them to have for you when scheduling your appointments without you? * I recall it was easy on my end, I didn’t have to call much. 

3.	What does self-scheduling mean to you? *To me that I can pull up a calendar and see what is available and schedule it myself. 
4.	What does help with self-scheduling mean to you? *That someone would assist me with, to figure it out.
*Yes, I prefer to do it myself. 
a.	Would you like to self-schedule VA appointments or do you preferer help when scheduling and why? *No, I’m pretty sure this one had all the information they needed. They piggy backed off the appointment I already had coming up. 
*Would have been helpful for her to know what day wouldn’t work for you? *Yes it would have been helpful. 

5.	Great, thank you for the very helpful insight. 


## Task 2: Find a preference from the My VA landing page - 15 minutes

**Note to moderator:** Group 1 starts Task 2 after Task 1 is completed, then moves on to Task 3 after Task 2 is completed. Once participant opens prototype link, instruct them to click on T2 to go to the MY VA landing page.

**Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

1. Now, I’ll send you a link to the prototype in the chat located at the X and have you click on it and share your screen. But don’t click on anything else until I ask you to do so.
2. Since this is a prototype for testing purposes only, it may not work as you may expect even though it may look like the actual VA.gov website; and just a reminder, this will not affect any of your VA information.
3. Okay, now that you’ve shared your screen, click on T2.

  **Note to moderator:** Help participant with the prototype if necessary. If the participant is unable to share their screen, then share your screen and follow the participant’s instructions mobile screen sharing instructions.

4. **Scenario:** Can you show me where you believe you would go to…[insert sub-group here]. 
  - Sub-groups 1a & 2a: … “Indicate whether you prefer to be seen by a male or female provider”.
  - Sub-groups 1b & 2b: …”Indicate how you want a scheduler to contact you to schedule medical appointments.”
  - Sub-groups 1c & 2c: …”Indicate what day and times you prefer to have your medical appointments.”
5. Please think aloud as you’re moving through this prototype and explain your thought process. I may stop you from proceeding while you navigate to ask you questions before you proceed to the next screen.
  **Note to moderator:** The participant may take several different paths through trial and error to get to scheduling preferences.
6. Why are you choosing “X”? - Why did you believe you would find it in that section?
7. What are some other ways to tell the VA scheduler anything about your health that could be relevant?
9. Is there anywhere else you'd expect to make those types of selections?

**Moderator Note:** Move on to task 3.

## Task 3: Scheduling preferences – 15 minutes
-What do you think the purpose of this page is to you? * Something that I could , If I can’t do things Mondays -Thursdays but Friday’s I’m open. They can put that in my preferences. 
-Overall impressions? * I like what I see. It gives me more options, and tell them what days I can’t. Seems like I can do all that here. It seems more seamless as opposed to communicate so much. 
-

**Note to moderator:** Group 2 starts Task 3 after Task 1 is completed, then moves on to Task 2 after Task 3 is completed. Instruct participant to click on the VA logo to get to the T3 link for the Scheduling preferences page.

**Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

Contact preferences:
-What do you expect to see? *Some sort of Calendar and best times to contact me. 
-What do you think will pop up if you pick no preference? * Nothing, I don’t expect to see anything. 
-What do you think VA will do with this information? *They will reach out when they have availability. No preference. 
-Would you change or add anything? No. 
-What does morning meant to you? *7-12 and lunch 12-5/close. I don’t weekends are necessary, I don’t expect Saturday or Sunday to be added. I think mornings Monday- Friday is fine. 
-Would specific times be beneficial? *This is good the way it is. It might overwhileing for the VA to call 100’s of people waiting for 8am to get a call. 
-Should apply to all appointments? *To all. 
-Do you find this helpful? *It’s helpful. 
1. Now, I’ll have you click on the VA logo which will take you back to the first screen, but this time you will click on… [insert main group here]. 
  - Group 1: …T3
  - Group 2: …T2
T2: 
-Where would you go, date and times to select your medical appointments, where do you think you would go? * I would go to my profile and if that didn’t work, I would go to menu. Because all my basic information is there, disability status, medications, I would think it’s there. 
-If I were not here what would you do? * I would go under healthcare settings because it says scheduling preferences. Yes, what I expect to see. If I click on that and it will let me update or look at what I put in there. 
*I would click on scheduling preferences. 
-Would you expect to find preferences anywhere else? *Maybe in the menu dropdown but nothing here. I would not expect to manage this appointment and change my preferences. Because I’m used to the preferences being on my profile. 



2. Similar to the last time, please think aloud as you read through this page, scrolling down to the end, and back up again - but please don’t click on anything just yet.
Appointment Preference: 
-Is this what you expect to see? *Yes.
*I just pictured yes and no. 
-Would you add anything? * I would just add yes or no, it might confuse people if they don’t know what they want. 
-Should it apply to all appointments?  *All
-Is this helpful? *Yes.
Edit appointment preference: 
* I would expect a Calendar. 
-Is this helpful? *Yes.
-What do you expect VA to do if you choose no preference? *What they do now, just call me and see whatever their next available works for me. 
-*This might be better than having a calendar. 
- Would you find this should be to all? *To all. 
*Would you find this helpful? *Yes.
  **Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

I would receive texts or emails verifying my emails and scheduling a time for appointments. 
9. Do you think this preference should apply to all medical appointments or would you make different decisions based upon each appointment or type of care? *It looks like it’s giving you one option. 
-Would you want more options to select for preferences? *Me personally, yes, I would select email and text messages. 
-Do you think this is okay for all appointments? * I think this would fine for all of them.

## Thank-You and Closing – 5 minutes
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
  
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in future research studies.
  
Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit 🚨
In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.
Male or Female Providers: 
*That is fine, mine would be no preference. 
*Yes it would be because I don’t care if it’s male or female. 
-What do you tihink *If I choose male, combine with all the info above and try to get me a male doctor. 
-Apply to all appointments? * No, this could be for all appointments. 
*Me personally, I would never use this. It will just add, it will narrow my appointments. 
*Somone can contact me and help me choose who to see, I guess. 
* I expect a yes, no, or no preference. 
*Yes, I don’t understand the question. I can’t choose my own provider; I know exactly what Doctor I have. I have who I already have. 
*I don’t know, I assume an attachment to the male or female and help me select who I want. It wouldn’t apply to me. I already chose the gender, but it would be giving me the options of the female doctors from where I pick from. 
*Because it’s under that and I don’t know if I call secure message and call the VA right now, I’m going to get Doctor Naylor, and I if I was anxious, I know who I’m going to get. Choosing a provider, there is not a list of people of who I want to see today. 
-Should this apply to all preferences? *To all
-Helpful or not? *No, because I would not need to choose a male or female because I don’t care. 
*Yes, I suppose but I would have been confused. Are you giving me a list a doctors, but I would be confused if this was for this or that appointment.
