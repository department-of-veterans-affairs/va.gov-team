Intro - 5 minutes 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tim/Nina] and [Tim/Nina] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about making updates to health care settings. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you: 

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. 

 I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA.  

If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know. 

I know Perigean asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session? * Yes.

If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom. 

If yes: Admit observers. 

Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.) 

Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth 

(If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits. 

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.  

After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. 

Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

[Yes] 

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?  

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image.  

Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products.  

These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed. 

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? 

[Yes] 

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. 

➡️ Start recording. 

After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording. 

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

[Yes] 

Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? 

[I am] 

 

Task 1: Past experiences with a VA staff scheduler/self-scheduling on VA.gov - 10 minutes 

We are going to be interacting with a prototype during this session. But before we get to that, I’d like to ask you a few questions to better understand your past experiences and your needs in regard to VA health care appointments. 

 

Can you let me know about your most recent experience with a VA scheduler when you were setting up an appointment? *The most recent about a month a go I had to schedule a dental. This one was over the phone. 

 

What information do you believe would be useful for them to have for you when scheduling your appointments without you? * Information, name, Date of birth, they asked me if my phone and address had changed. Usually if I have to make any changes I go online and do it myself. 
*It depends on what I have to do it online. If it’s for my mental, I’ll send a secure message. It depends on the situation. 
What does self-scheduling mean to you? * If I need to make a schedule myself, I can go into the system and do it myself. Usually, If I need an appointment I will go in and request an appointment. Sometimes I don’t see all the providers, then I will go in and send a secure message. 


 

What does help with self-scheduling mean to you? *If I needed to reschedule I can go into the system and cancel and reschedule for another date. 

Would you like to self-schedule VA appointments or do you preferer help when scheduling and why? 

How would you improve the overall experience when scheduling appointments with VA staff? 

 

Great, thank you for the very helpful insight.  

 

 

Task 2: Find a preference from the My VA landing page - 20 minutes 

 

Note to moderator: Group 1 starts Task 2 after Task 1 is completed, then moves on to Task 3 after Task 2 is completed.  Once participant opens prototype link, instruct them to click on T2 to go to the MY VA landing page. 

 

Note to notetaker: Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature. 

 Scheduling Preferences: 
First impression- *I like this. I like they give you options the best way to contact you. I like the “ when do you want us to contact you and option if you need help”. I also like the provider gender preferences because a lot of the time you don’t have that option. 
-Main purpose of the page? * To help streamline to make an appointment. Especially an appointment you might need quicker. 
First card: 
What do you think you’ll see? * Either the way to be contacted via Text, email, or phonecall.
*Yes, it gives you the option to be contacted via phone, email, secure message. For me I prefer email, cell phone or secure message. Anything quicker than snail mail. 
Anything you would change? *No
*I like the way it’s set up. 
What do you expect the VA to do? *Usually, within 1-3 days someone will reach out to you based on your preference. 
Do you think these preferences should apply to all? * To all. Because it’s a lot easier to know and sometimes people need a reminder. I do get the text messages that will remind me of the appointment, and it will ask to confirm or deny. 
*I feel it’s a value. I love using the app. 

1. Now, I’ll send you a link to the prototype in the chat located at the X and have you click on it and share your screen. But don’t click on anything else until I ask you to do so. 

2. Since this is a prototype for testing purposes only, it may not work as you may expect even though it may look like the actual VA.gov website; and just a reminder, this will not affect any of your VA information. 

3. Okay, now that you’ve shared your screen, click on T2. 

 Note to moderator: Help participant with the prototype if necessary. If the participant is unable to share their screen, then share your screen and follow the participant’s instructions mobile screen sharing instructions. 

 

4. Scenario: Can you show me where you believe you would go to…[insert sub-group here].  

sub-groups 1a & 2a: … “Indicate whether you prefer to be seen by a male or female provider”. 
What do you think provider preference means to you? *that it means if you have male or female to choose from. 
Do you think this should apply to all appointments? *I would say all but for me it would not matter but for certain people it may matter. 
*Certain situations or appointments some people may not want a male provider. 
*I don’t think it should be changed, and it would not matter and you have an option to choose whether you want a male or female. I would not change anything. 
* I would find this helpful.

Finding a provider
Do you need help choosing a provider? *help choosing a provider's gender.
Is this what you expected to see? * Not exactly but it’s still helpful, but it still gives you the option to say yes, no, or no preference. I was thinking based on the first question you asked me. Yes, based on the way it’s situated. To me if it said, Do you need help choosing a provider not be specific of male or female. If this card came first, I would have chosen something else. 
*I would not made the presumption but if I saw the male or female, I would of seen no preference. 
*I don’t think it needs to be more clear, I think it’s the context and where it’s placed the position of where it was. 
If you choose yes? * I would expect the VA if I chose yes, they would help me find male providers for whatever appointment I’m looking for. 
Do you think this preference should be to all? *Again, all. 
Would you find this helpful? * I would find it helpful. r
sub-groups 1b & 2b: …”Indicate how you want a scheduler to contact you to schedule  medical appointments. 

sub-groups 1c & 2c: …” Indicate what day and times you prefer to have your medical appointments. 

 

5. Please think aloud as you’re moving through this prototype and explain your thought process. I may stop you from proceeding while you navigate to ask you questions before you proceed to the next screen.  

 Note to moderator:  The participant may take several different paths through trial and error to get to scheduling preferences. 

6. Why are you choosing “X”? - Why did you believe you would find it in that section? 

7. What are some other ways to tell the VA scheduler anything about your health that could be relevant? 

 

Is there anywhere else you'd expect to make those types of selections? 

 

Moderator Note: Move on to task 3. 

 

 

 

 

 

Task 3: Scheduling preferences – 15 minutes 

 

Note to moderator: Group 2 starts Task 3 after Task 1 after Task 1 is completed , then moves on to Task 2 after Task 3 is completed.  Instruct participant to click on the VA logo to get to the T3  link for the Scheduling preferences page. 
Is this what you expected to see? *Yes. 
Would you change anything? *No.
You expect a calendar to show you? Yes.
What does no preference mean to you? *That you would still be contacted, but don’t have a specific day or time, and can be contacted anytime. 
Do you think it’s helpful? *I think it’s helpful.
Anything you would change or add? *No
Do you think this should apply to all preferences?  *All. 
What do you think the VA will do with this information? *It will give them an idea best way to reach out to you. 
*It will give me the option whether I want to call in or I can self-schedule and pick the date and time. 
What do you expect if you choose yes? * Some dialogue if I need help that I can either call a specific number with the extension, and someone will reach out to me. Help means assistance in scheduling an appointment. 
Assistance in what form? *Probably to give you more of a detailed option. 
No preference? * It doesn’t mean I still can’t get help; it just means I don’t want to do it myself. 
Do you find this useful? *I think it is. I wouldn’t add anything to it. I’m familiar with using the app but if I was not, it still works and gives me the option of having assistance. 
*Sometimes it will also give you the option to do a virtual appointment. Depends on what you are being seen for.
