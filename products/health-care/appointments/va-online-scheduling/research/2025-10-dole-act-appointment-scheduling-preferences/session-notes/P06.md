## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tim/Nina] and [Tim/Nina] is taking notes. I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...
Today we're going to talk about making updates to health care settings.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities.
- I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA.
- If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session? *Yes. 
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
- Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
- Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- (If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. *Yes.
- Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? *Yes.
  [Record answer here]
- Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
- Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? *Yes.
  [Record answer here]
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. 
    ➡️ Start recording.
- After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? *Yes.
  [Record answer here]
- Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

## Task 1: Past experiences with a VA staff scheduler/self-scheduling on VA.gov - 5 minutes
1. We are going to be interacting with a prototype during this session. But before we get to that, I’d like to ask you a few questions to better understand your past experiences and your needs in regard to VA health care appointments.
2. Can you tell me about your last VA health appointment? – How was the appointment scheduled and by who? *Yes. 
3. Was there ever a time a VA staff scheduled an appointment for you? [Note to moderator: If yes, then ask the following. If not, move to #4] *Most of my appointments I have to go in and most of them are made after an appointment. My psycaty are sometimes made without me calling. I like when I have the option when I can pick the time. I’m not a morning person and I would rather book a later time slot. I follow through an appointment and make it know that for the future, I would like to be present for an appointment. 
-What would like to see in a self-scheduler? *When they have to make an appointment without me knowing, it would be good to know if there is a note in there of my preference. They  have access to any conditions that may have like sleep apnea. 
  - Why did the scheduler make the appointment instead of you using the self-scheduling tool on VA.gov?
  - Was the appointment made for you in real-time while interacting with the scheduler or was it made without you? If not, how were you informed of the scheduled appointment details?
  - What did you like or dislike about a VA scheduler making the appointment for you?
  - Did the scheduler call you afterwards with additional questions?
  - Do you feel that VA schedulers have enough information to adequately schedule an appointment without needing to contact you?
  - If so, what information do you wish the scheduler would have had before scheduling an appointment for you?
  - How would you like to relay this information to VA staff?
4. What does self-scheduling mean to you? * Being able to make appointments on my own. 
5. What does help with self-scheduling mean to you?* I tried to do that on the website, but that didn’t work. I got a error message. The ability to set an appointment for dental was not an option. 
  - Would you like to self-schedule VA appointments or do you prefer help when scheduling and why? * Like a wizard, like the AI stuff and simple walk-through. 
* I would like to do it myself because when you call the VA, you’re on hold for a long time and so many questions to get through. Right now I need to make an appointment with my provider, so now, I’m going to message her. 
6. Have you ever submitted an appointment request online? – A Request is when you say what type of appointment you'd like with some options for preferred days and times.
7. How would you improve the overall experience when scheduling appointments with VA staff? *I would say, the easier, you can message your providers directly but older Veterans who aren’t savvy, the wait times on the phone, maybe have a specific number for scheduling without going through a zig-zag. 
8. Great, thank you for the very helpful insight.

## Task 2: Find a preference from the My VA landing page - 15 minutes

**Note to moderator:** Group 1 starts Task 2 after Task 1 is completed, then moves on to Task 3 after Task 2 is completed. Once participant opens prototype link, instruct them to click on T2 to go to the MY VA landing page.

**Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

1. Now, I’ll send you a link to the prototype in the chat located at the X and have you click on it and share your screen. But don’t click on anything else until I ask you to do so.
2. Since this is a prototype for testing purposes only, it may not work as you may expect even though it may look like the actual VA.gov website; and just a reminder, this will not affect any of your VA information.
3. Okay, now that you’ve shared your screen, click on T2.

  **Note to moderator:** Help participant with the prototype if necessary. If the participant is unable to share their screen, then share your screen and follow the participant’s instructions mobile screen sharing instructions.

4. **Scenario:** Can you show me where you believe you would go to…[insert sub-group here].  *This is an informative screen, which I think is awesome. Seems like the purpose is the needs are met regarding appointments. 
  - Sub-groups 1a & 2a: … “Indicate whether you prefer to be seen by a male or female provider”.
  - Sub-groups 1b & 2b: …”Indicate how you want a scheduler to contact you to schedule medical appointments.”
  - Sub-groups 1c & 2c: …”Indicate what day and times you prefer to have your medical appointments.”
5. Please think aloud as you’re moving through this prototype and explain your thought process. I may stop you from proceeding while you navigate to ask you questions before you proceed to the next screen.
  **Note to moderator:** The participant may take several different paths through trial and error to get to scheduling preferences.
6. Why are you choosing “X”? - Why did you believe you would find it in that section?  * Phone, text, or email. 
*Yes, what I expect to see. 
*It’s thorough and comprehensive. 
*Mailing address, by the time it gets to my mail, don’t know why it would be there. Your mailing address is part of your information, I don’t see why the mailing address would be there if I’m trying to schedule an appointment. 
7. What are some other ways to tell the VA scheduler anything about your health that could be relevant?
9. Is there anywhere else you'd expect to make those types of selections? * Just to verify my email address. 
*I would expect the VA to; it would be a back-and-forth email and can take a long time and not straight -forward. Scheduling an appointment should be fewer steps. 
*Say they send me an email and link to schedule, that link would be helpful. 
* I would take away the mailing address. 
*I would say my preference should be applied to all appointments. 
**Moderator Note:** Move on to task 3.

## Task 3: Scheduling preferences – 15 minutes

**Note to moderator:** Group 2 starts Task 3 after Task 1 is completed, then moves on to Task 2 after Task 3 is completed. Instruct participant to click on the VA logo to get to the T3 link for the Scheduling preferences page.

**Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

1.	Now, I’ll have you click on the VA logo which will take you back to the first screen, but this time you will click on… [insert main group here].  * I would go to manage this appointment. I would click on that and see what you can do there. I would probably go to details if you weren’t here. If that were the case, I would go to appointments. Because it’s the general option. To pick my preference and options to schedule appointments/manage. 

*I would choose this option over the first option. I was thinking about appointments in general; everything I need for appointments should be in one. This one was hard, it was extra. I would in the appointments link, and be specific, I would expect them to be where the appointments are, and a general and preference to have it in own area. 
*This screen makes sense, I like it. 
* I would click on scheduling preferences. 
*I would probably go to MyHealtheVet, but it wasn’t there, I would search somewhere. I would schedule preferences. 
-Would you click on your name? * Clicking on your name would make sense. 
*Yes, I would click profile because I can manage my preferences. It’s perfect, it has all my information and preferences. Everything is there specifically to my needs. 
-Would you change the flow? * It makes perfect sense. you, go to your profile and go to the option to update. 
* Maybe having the link in the appointments area and available. 
  - Group 1: …T3
  - Group 2: …T2
2. Similar to the last time, please think aloud as you read through this page scrolling down to the end, and back up again - but please don’t click on anything just yet.

  **Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

3. Can you describe the main purpose of this page?

  **Note to moderator:** Ask participant to open each card for all 3 sections and ask the following questions for each card (all 6 preferences):

4. Under “X” preferences, “X?”, before you select anything, what do you think the purpose of this preference is? * expect to see different time frames. Moring, afternoon, or other time periods. 
5. What do you expect to find when you click edit? *I would just have all the options on the page instead of clicking more stuff. 
*I like it, I just feel like it might too much. It feels like it’s too much but it’s not. 

6. Go ahead and try to update that preference.
7. Would you add, delete, or change anything about this preference?
8. How do you expect the VA to utilize this information? What workflows do you expect to impact, or do you believe letting VA know this preference would be helpful, not helpful, or are you unsure?-Why? *I would expect a follow up but not sure if they would have it for specific times. 
*It will allow the scheduler to expect a call in the morning or afternoon, that is when they will call. 
9. Do you think this preference should apply to all medical appointments or would you make different decisions based upon each appointment or type of care? *All across the board. 
* I would do time frames like 9-11, 1-4, I would have that type of time. 
10. Would you expect to find this preference on any other section on VA.gov? *Absolutely helpful. 
11. For card 3 Appointment preferences: Do you want help scheduling your appointments? Ask “What do you expect to happen for each of the options”: * I expect to see the options for someone to help me, heading back on how to schedule an appointment. 
  - Yes* Yes. 
*I expect them to ask me how I would want the help. 
 - No * I expect for that to be save and moved on to the next. 
  - No preference* No preference is a little weird. It’s either yes or no. The person should know. 
* I don’t think that option makes sense. 
*Just having yes or no would be more helpful. 
12. For card 6 Provider preferences: Do you want help choosing your provider? Ask “What do you expect to happen for each of the options”: * Similar to the other ones. Morning or Afternoon. 
  - Yes
  - No
  - No preference
  **Note to moderator:** Now move on to asking participants about the overall page.
13. What’s your overall impression of the scheduling preferences page? * No, it makes sense. 
14. Would you add or remove any preferences?
15. If you could change one thing about this page, what would it be? * If I choose my day in the morning, It would be the preference saved to my profile. I like mid-morning, but I would guess it would be either morning or afternoon. 
*Just to ensure Veterans are getting what they need and appointments are available for that specific Veteran. 
16. If you had any questions about updating these preferences, what would you do next? Who would you contact? * I think when it comes to the days and times, I think it would apply to everything. All across the board. 
17. Okay, thank you for that. We’re done with all of the questions, and you can stop screen sharing.

## Consent to use video clips
- Do you have any questions for me before we close this session? * I think it’s straightforward, I like it. 
*It says contact us, There is no help icon. It would be helpful to have a FAQ’s, clarification option, click here. 
- I want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

## Thank-You and Closing – 5 minutes
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
  
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in future research studies.
  
Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit 🚨
In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.

*Just the option if you want a male or female provider. 
*Some Veterans have a preference for the type of Gender for the provider. 
*My Gynecology is a male; I didn’t have the option. Maybe providing a preference for different specialties. 
*Whatever provider is available for that time. 
*I would expect them to try to make my appointments where all my providers are male. I would expect them to at least try. 
I think it’s helpful but there should be a disclaimer based on availability because it won't always be available. I don’t see how that would actually work. 
-Choosing a provider: 
-Yes? * I would expect someone to call me. 
-No? * That I would do it myself, maybe. I don’t know the providers, how would I know who I would want. I don’t find this as valuable as the other ones. Maybe if you’re having an issue with a provider, my first provider didn’t seem as caring and didn’t feel like I was getting the care I needed, and I switched providers. I had to go around and around. I feel like it would be useful, but generally, I don’t understand how you are going to help me find my first provider. More helpful in finding a second provider. 
*It’s straight-forward.
