## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tim/Nina] and [Tim/Nina] is taking notes. I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...
Today we're going to talk about making updates to health care settings.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities.
- I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA.
- If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
- Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
- Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- (If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. *Yes.
- Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? *Yes.
  [Record answer here]
- Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed. *Yes..
- Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? *Yes.
  [Record answer here]
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
    ➡️ Start recording.
- After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? *Yes.
  [Record answer here]
- Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? *Yes.

## Task 1: Past experiences with a VA staff scheduler/self-scheduling on VA.gov - 5 minutes
1. We are going to be interacting with a prototype during this session. But before we get to that, I’d like to ask you a few questions to better understand your past experiences and your needs in regard to VA health care appointments.
2. Can you tell me about your last VA health appointment? – How was the appointment scheduled and by who? *I think it was made for me after I went to another appointment. 3. Was there ever a time a VA staff scheduled an appointment for you? [Note to moderator: If yes, then ask the following. If not, move to #4]
  - Why did the scheduler make the appointment instead of you using the self-scheduling tool on VA.gov?
  - Was the appointment made for you in real-time while interacting with the scheduler or was it made without you? If not, how were you informed of the scheduled appointment details? *I was there. I was seeing my provider for an annual checkup and I had a couple of concerns and  she scheduled me for a follow-up. 

  - What did you like or dislike about a VA scheduler making the appointment for you? *I liked that they were able to see their calendar right then and there and give me options. I usually take the last available appointment. 
  - Did the scheduler call you afterwards with additional questions?
  - Do you feel that VA schedulers have enough information to adequately schedule an appointment without needing to contact you? *
  - If so, what information do you wish the scheduler would have had before scheduling an appointment for you? *Yes, I had one of those. I had the person who made the schedule was not there at the time and about two weeks later I was out sick and I called back to reschedule and that was made without me being there and talking to someone. 
*I think some type of secure messaging, appointment setting function where you can say what times so when they are making their appointments. 
*Secure messaging, what I mean is the email function of who I’m trying to get in contact and had a function like that for scheduling. I would expect that under my MyHealthyeVet once I log in. 
  - How would you like to relay this information to VA staff? *All of the providers that I have interacted with. Sometimes it’s a shot in the dark if I’m communicating with the proper people. Right now I have an appointment on the 12th with the sleep clinic but not all of them check and I can be talking to one provider versus another provider. Right now, nurses check the messages. 
4. What does self-scheduling mean to you? *Being able to take accountability for my own healthcare an give me the power to the appointments and more likely show up for them knowing that I scheduled them. 
5. What does help with self-scheduling mean to you? *That would be a FAQ situation where there would be a list of things to schedule. 
  - Would you like to self-schedule VA appointments or do you prefer help when scheduling and why?
6. Have you ever submitted an appointment request online? – A Request is when you say what type of appointment you'd like with some options for preferred days and times.
7. How would you improve the overall experience when scheduling appointments with VA staff?
8. Great, thank you for the very helpful insight.

## Task 2: Find a preference from the My VA landing page - 15 minutes

**Note to moderator:** Group 1 starts Task 2 after Task 1 is completed, then moves on to Task 3 after Task 2 is completed. Once participant opens prototype link, instruct them to click on T2 to go to the MY VA landing page.

**Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

1. Now, I’ll send you a link to the prototype in the chat located at the X and have you click on it and share your screen. But don’t click on anything else until I ask you to do so.
2. Since this is a prototype for testing purposes only, it may not work as you may expect even though it may look like the actual VA.gov website; and just a reminder, this will not affect any of your VA information.
3. Okay, now that you’ve shared your screen, click on T2.

  **Note to moderator:** Help participant with the prototype if necessary. If the participant is unable to share their screen, then share your screen and follow the participant’s instructions mobile screen sharing instructions.

4. **Scenario:** Can you show me where you believe you would go to…[insert sub-group here]. 
  - Sub-groups 1a & 2a: … “Indicate whether you prefer to be seen by a male or female provider”.
  - Sub-groups 1b & 2b: …”Indicate how you want a scheduler to contact you to schedule medical appointments.”
  - Sub-groups 1c & 2c: …”Indicate what day and times you prefer to have your medical appointments.”
5. Please think aloud as you’re moving through this prototype and explain your thought process. I may stop you from proceeding while you navigate to ask you questions before you proceed to the next screen.
  **Note to moderator:** The participant may take several different paths through trial and error to get to scheduling preferences.
6. Why are you choosing “X”? - Why did you believe you would find it in that section?
7. What are some other ways to tell the VA scheduler anything about your health that could be relevant?
9. Is there anywhere else you'd expect to make those types of selections?

**Moderator Note:** Move on to task 3.

## Task 3: Scheduling preferences – 15 minutes

**Note to moderator:** Group 2 starts Task 3 after Task 1 is completed, then moves on to Task 2 after Task 3 is completed. Instruct participant to click on the VA logo to get to the T3 link for the Scheduling preferences page.

**Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

1. Now, I’ll have you click on the VA logo which will take you back to the first screen, but this time you will click on… [insert main group here]. 
  - Group 1: …T3
  - Group 2: …T2
2. Similar to the last time, please think aloud as you read through this page scrolling down to the end, and back up again - but please don’t click on anything just yet.

  **Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

3. Can you describe the main purpose of this page? * It says scheduling preferences for scheduling. *To set your preferences as far as how you would like to be contacted or see. It’s really good, I would use that feature to be able to get better scheduling. I think it would be beneficial. 

  **Note to moderator:** Ask participant to open each card for all 3 sections and ask the following questions for each card (all 6 preferences):

4. Under “X” preferences, “X?”, before you select anything, what do you think the purpose of this preference is? 
5. What do you expect to find when you click edit? *Probably ne a text, snail mail, something like that, I would hope. 
6. Go ahead and try to update that preference. *Yes, so far. I would expect a drop down menu. 
7. Would you add, delete, or change anything about this preference?
8. How do you expect the VA to utilize this information? What workflows do you expect to impact, or do you believe letting VA know this preference would be helpful, not helpful, or are you unsure?-Why? * I like the options, I think the phone could be just a phone number, most people have a mobile phone number. 
*Too many options there for phone call. 
*I think that’s a thorough list. 
9. Do you think this preference should apply to all medical appointments or would you make different decisions based upon each appointment or type of care?
10. Would you expect to find this preference on any other section on VA.gov? * Probably have a feel for it and enter my email. 
11. For card 3 Appointment preferences: Do you want help scheduling your appointments? Ask “What do you expect to happen for each of the options”: *Hopefully, it would impact the communication. Sometimes there’s enough and not enough information. Sometimes I get tons of paper or tons of texts. Sometimes have a number of times to be contacted. 
*For me it would be helpful, whether for the VA, I don’t know. My preference for all appointments would be whatever I choose here. 
*Probably one of those evening, morning, type things is what I expect to see here (Contact preferences). 
* I like this page, that is what I expected. 
*No, this is pretty good. Toom many options might overwhelm some of us. Maybe be specific with the morning, some places might be 8-11 and others 8-12. I say that because of the lunch factor. 
*For the use to what it’s intended for and it would impact me because if I say to call me in the afternoon, I would not expect a call in the morning. Knowing when to expect calls from the VA. This should apply to all appointments, in my opinion. 

*I’m not sure what to expect. Maybe a yes or no and see what is available. 
*This is what I expected. I expect the VA to do with this information, is this all for this card. For this card I am assuming the intent is to let the VA know I need help. I would expect a text, call or email that I need help. It’s unclear. 
  - Yes
  - No
 - No preference
12. For card 6 Provider preferences: Do you want help choosing your provider? Ask “What do you expect to happen for each of the options”: *I prefer a list of the radio button. 
-Add or change anything on this card? *No. 

  - Yes
  - No
  - No preference
  **Note to moderator:** Now move on to asking participants about the overall page.
*Let the VA know what the preference is on their end. I would expect all my appointments to be with a Male provider. 

13. What’s your overall impression of the scheduling preferences page? *Probable dates and times. 
*No, this is good as previous page 
14. Would you add or remove any preferences? *define morning, afternoon, but I think that’s more of a regional thing. 
15. If you could change one thing about this page, what would it be? *I know for a fact I need help with community care but not scheduling with the VA. Sometimes with community care it’s unclear who I’m seeing or who is making the appointment.  *For me it would not matter. Maybe for some specialty care, some people may want a male or female specifically for that appointment. 

*This one is too; lets say I click yes and save and the VA will think I need help every time but if I say no, they will assume I will never need help. I don’t even know what “no preference” would even do. 
16. If you had any questions about updating these preferences, what would you do next? Who would you contact? *On specialty care, for male or female, have a different list for preference.
*Probably another list.
*Yes.
*It’s giving you the option to say yes or no and if you say yes, hopefully, get some communication on help choosing a provider. Someone is calling, texting, or emailing for the list of providers and some background to choose the best one. 
*No. Probably not. I hope when I said yes or no, I would get the help. 
If I choose no, I would be signing a provider on a random basis; no preference would lead to the same outcome. 
*Based on the appointment, it might be more helpful to the Veteran. 

17. Okay, thank you for that. We’re done with all of the questions, and you can stop screen sharing.
