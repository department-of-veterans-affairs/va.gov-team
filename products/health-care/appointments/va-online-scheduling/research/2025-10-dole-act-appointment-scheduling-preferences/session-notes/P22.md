## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tim/Nina] and [Tim/Nina] is taking notes. I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...
Today we're going to talk about making updates to health care settings.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities.
- I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA.
- If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
- Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
- Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- (If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
- Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
  [Yes]
- Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
- Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?
  [Yes]
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
    ➡️ Start recording.
- After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
  [Yes]
- Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?
  [Yes]

## Task 1: Past experiences with a VA staff scheduler/self-scheduling on VA.gov - 5 minutes
1. We are going to be interacting with a prototype during this session. But before we get to that, I’d like to ask you a few questions to better understand your past experiences and your needs in regard to VA health care appointments.

2.	Can you let me know about your most recent experience with a VA scheduler when you were setting up an appointment? *I do it for community appointments. I will go in and send them the secure message and my appointments get made.
a.	What information do you believe would be useful for them to have for you when scheduling your appointments without you? *Both, they will come back and made an appointment for you or they will call and tell me someone will contact me weather it’s internal or external. 

3.	What does self-scheduling mean to you?
* I prefer to self schedule if I can. 
4.	What does help with self-scheduling mean to you? *It means that I can go in and request the appointment and get it. I feel like when I go in to request, then they are getting back to me with appointment information. That is what that means to me. I don’t expect someone to get on the call with me. I expect a response one way or other. 
a.	Would you like to self-schedule VA appointments or do you preferer help when scheduling and why? *It’s simple as it is. I think the timeliness. Sometimes it can take a couple of weeks before they call, and I have to call to ask what happened. I know they get far behind sometimes. Most recent one I sent a message and then I got a phone call about a referral and the provider contacted me to let me know when the appointment would be. I didn’t have to do anything. That was the smoothest. The timeliness issues with the VA is that they are so booked out. I have no complaints; the website works great. 
*I thought I had, but now I’m questioning myself. I use it, I go in there and see all my appointments and can change. 

5.	Great, thank you for the very helpful insight. 


## Task 2: Find a preference from the My VA landing page - 15 minutes

**Note to moderator:** Group 1 starts Task 2 after Task 1 is completed, then moves on to Task 3 after Task 2 is completed. Once participant opens prototype link, instruct them to click on T2 to go to the MY VA landing page.

**Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

1. Now, I’ll send you a link to the prototype in the chat located at.  the X and have you click on it and share your screen. But don’t click on anything else until I ask you to do so.
2. Since this is a prototype for testing purposes only, it may not work as you may expect even though it may look like the actual VA.gov website; and just a reminder, this will not affect any of your VA information.

*Scheduler to contact you, where would you go? *I would go to the menu, unless I can scroll down. I would and my HealtheVet. 
*No, well I would go the link where it says MyhealtheVet. I would go to messages, but I might go to appointments first, but I think that just shows me what I have scheduled. I would want to send a message to my team and let them know I want an appointment. 
-What other way? *I would go to appointments. I don’t recall ever seeing start scheduling before. I would go to start scheduling, 
-Do you think you would find it in another place? *I think this would be the place. I would scroll down and look at what I want to schedule for and look at the next line. I would expect to follow through and be told or ask questions about who, when, or what. 


3. Okay, now that you’ve shared your screen, click on T2.

  **Note to moderator:** Help participant with the prototype if necessary. If the participant is unable to share their screen, then share your screen and follow the participant’s instructions mobile screen sharing instructions.

4. **Scenario:** Can you show me where you believe you would go to…[insert sub-group here]. 
  - Sub-groups 1a & 2a: … “Indicate whether you prefer to be seen by a male or female provider”.
  - Sub-groups 1b & 2b: …”Indicate how you want a scheduler to contact you to schedule medical appointments.”
  - Sub-groups 1c & 2c: …”Indicate what day and times you prefer to have your medical appointments.”
5. Please think aloud as you’re moving through this prototype and explain your thought process. I may stop you from proceeding while you navigate to ask you questions before you proceed to the next screen.
  **Note to moderator:** The participant may take several different paths through trial and error to get to scheduling preferences.
6. Why are you choosing “X”? - Why did you believe you would find it in that section?
7. What are some other ways to tell the VA scheduler anything about your health that could be relevant?
9. Is there anywhere else you'd expect to make those types of selections?

**Moderator Note:** Move on to task 3.

## Task 3: Scheduling preferences – 15 minutes

**Note to moderator:** Group 2 starts Task 3 after Task 1 is completed, then moves on to Task 2 after Task 3 is completed. Instruct participant to click on the VA logo to get to the T3 link for the Scheduling preferences page.

**Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

1. Now, I’ll have you click on the VA logo which will take you back to the first screen, but this time you will click on… [insert main group here]. 
  - Group 1: …T3
  - Group 2: …T2
2. Similar to the last time, please think aloud as you read through this page scrolling down to the end, and back up again - but please don’t click on anything just yet.

  **Note to notetaker:** Please pay special attention to and document all the links and paths participants take to access the new feature, noting any deviations or unexpected routes. Additionally, capture any comments or non-verbal cues that highlight participants' mental models and understanding of the feature.

3. Can you describe the main purpose of this page? *Method for communication. Assuming it will say email, contact. 

  **Note to moderator:** Ask participant to open each card for all 3 sections and ask the following questions for each card (all 6 preferences):

4. Under “X” preferences, “X?”, before you select anything, what do you think the purpose of this preference is?
5. What do you expect to find when you click edit? * This is what I would expect. * I think it will have a selection of boxes that says email, phone number, mail. 
6. Go ahead and try to update that preference. * I would go into the select piece and that is what I expected. 
7. Would you add, delete, or change anything about this preference? *I think it has everything covered. That is exactly what I would expect. 
*No, I would not change anything, it has everything possible. 
8. How do you expect the VA to utilize this information? What workflows do you expect to impact, or do you believe letting VA know this preference would be helpful, not helpful, or are you unsure?-Why?
9. Do you think this preference should apply to all medical appointments or would you make different decisions based upon each appointment or type of care? *I think I would want it to be across the board. 
-Do you think this information is valuable? *I think it’s very valuable, especially if it can go across the board for everything. 
Edit Preference: 
*I think it will ask me for dates, times, hours, select time and day. 
*I think it’s better than I expected. Preference makes sense. The VA will look at it and contact me when it’s good for them. I would not use it myself. I would select days and times. 
-*I would want to be able; as long I can select multiple. I do care that it’s in the afternoon. It seems like a lot of work going click click Monday-Friday. It would be nice to have “any day” am or pm for myself. 
-What does Afternoon mean to you? *Anytime in the afternoon because I’m in Alaska and people don’t know the time here. Morning means to me 8-12 but living in Alaska, people’s 8am is my 6am. I think it would  better to have a button “ am or pm” am 8-12 and 12-4 for pm, and another button that says “any day.”
-What do you think the VA will do with this information? *When they want to schedule me, they will call in the areas I requested. I don’t expect them to call me at 8am. 
*The option to edit on the type of care, in case I have an urgent matter. I would not say any day, I would say now. 

10. Would you expect to find this preference on any other section on VA.gov? *They would do whatever is easiest for them, I think a phone call or a secure message. A secure message would be my preference. 
* I feel like I can only choose one option. I wish there were more to choose from. At least two because one doesn’t work. I think two options are great. 
11. For card 3 Appointment preferences: Do you want help scheduling your appointments? Ask “What do you expect to happen for each of the options?”: *I feel like they are asking if I need guidance scheduling an appointment. I don’t know what to expect here because I know how to schedule. 
-What do you think of these options? *I  don’t know, have I gotten permission to schedule? 
-Anything additional to help you make a preference? *I guess I don’t understand what that means, I’m requesting, not need help. I guess I would pick no preference. It’s unclear here. 
  - Yes *I’m either going to get a bunch of questions or the VA will call me. 
  - No *You just move on to the next. 
  - No preference *Sure it is, a little confusing though but if there is no preference, you don’t know what will happen next. I would choose it because I don’t care either way. I would eliminate it. 
-Should it apply to all appointments? *No, it depends on the type of appointments. If it were rheumatology, I would need help getting a hold and finding a doctor. Ophthalmology has availability all the time. 
12. For card 6 Provider preferences: Do you want help choosing your provider? Ask “What do you expect to happen for each of the options”:
  - Yes
  - No
  - No preference
  **Note to moderator:** Now move on to asking participants about the overall page.
13. What’s your overall impression of the scheduling preferences page?
14. Would you add or remove any preferences?
15. If you could change one thing about this page, what would it be?
16. If you had any questions about updating these preferences, what would you do next? Who would you contact?
17. Okay, thank you for that. We’re done with all of the questions, and you can stop screen sharing.

## Consent to use video clips
- Do you have any questions for me before we close this session?
- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
  [Record answer here]
  
## Thank-You and Closing – 5 minutes
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
  
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in future research studies.
  
Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit 🚨
In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.


-Appointment preferences: 
*I expect to see a similar screen like before. Days and times. That’s good, that is what I would expect. I like there is no preference there because sometimes it’s more important to get into the doctor than when you truly want to go. It depends on the urgency of the appointment. 
-Select days and times? * I feel the same way as the other one. Having am and pm, any day. I would always want a Monday or Tuesday, but it can be any day in the afternoon. but I would like to see more options. 
*I would like to say Afternoon and Monday and Tuesday only, afternoon rather than click, click, click all these. 
*The appointment would be made for that day and time frame. 
*I would use it. I typically would not use the no preference option. 
Provivder Preference: 
*Male or female, that is what I expected. I think the all should be there. 
-What do you think the VA will do with this information? They wont do any filtering based on the gender of the doctor. 
*I don’t want to be locked in choosing a male or female doctor. 
*They would only select male providers. 
*For me it’s not needed at all.
* I would say no preference, no doubt. 
-Do you find this helpful? *Yes, I find it useful, but I think I would always choose no preference but it is important to have the option of male or female. 
-Do you need help choosing your provider? *I guess I’m getting lost in if you or am I picking my provider. 
*Yes, that is what I expected to see. The no preference I’m not understanding that. What will you do with that. It’s either yes or no. 
*If you chose yes? *The VA will give me a list to choose from based on the communication method that was previously chosen from. 
-Any other information you’d like to see here? *No. I have already told you what type of provider, communication method and they will either contact me or not. 
-Do you think these preferences are dependent on each other? *Yes. 
-Would you use these preferences? *It depends what I’m doing. If I have to go see a Podiatrist, I would need help. Don’t let me look up every possible Podiatrist. If it’s a physical therapist, I would not need help, I know who I need to see. 
Overall impressions: 
*I like this page, it flows nicely. I feel like once I hit submit, my appointment will be made or have a provider I can call. 
-General or specific appointments? Specific appointments, options can change. I would love it if could be contact preferences be the same, static. I don’t know if for provider preferences will be static. I would like the flexibility to have preferences on the type of care. 
-Anything you would change on this page? *Some place to go for help like a phone number or link.
