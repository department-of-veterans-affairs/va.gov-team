# Express Care: Participant 10

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I would like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers? 
What is telehealth: Using electronic resources to provide medical care
Same day care: Typically that day or within 24 hours
Urgent care: Same day. 


## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth

- Have you ever used Telehealth appointments? Yes I have
  - If YES: 
    - Was this with a VA provider or non-VA doctor? Both VA providers one was by phone and the other was over the computer like talking to them like this web conference. 
        - If VA: How did you schedule your appointment: I scheduled them in person when I was there for an appointment but after that they schedule again as ask for in person or telehealth and they do it from there.
Normally like telehealth if the option is there: I do because it is a bit of a drive to the VA for me. 
Good experience: Yes. 
Express care: I do not think I have. 
What might it be: At least same day care. I am not sure. 
In person or virtual: I think it could be both, similar to like instead of going to the ER or urgent care they can talk to you right away to see if you need to be seen in person. 
- Have you heard anything about same-day/urgent care Telehealth appointments through VA? A little about the same day ones because I go to the womenâ€™s wellness clinic they work harder to let us know they are available. 
- Have you ever tried to make a same-day appointment with a VA provider, either someone you see regularly or any available provider? I have not. 
If you did would you be okay if it were a person on your team: Yes.
Anything that prevents you from doing same day: No, I have insurance outside of the VA so I can go outside of the VA. Typically when I try to do same day appointment it is with my outside provider because the va has not been able to get me in. Normally when I decide to go to the doctor I have tried to do everything else or am at the point where I have to see someone now. 
Other medical coverage is you VA coverage secondary: I think the va treats it as the primary because they do not bill my insurance. 
How do you currently schedule for the VA: I usually call and schedule. There are a few I do if it is not urgent I will do it through secure messaging to tell them I need an appointment. Sometimes they say ill see you in 6 months and if you need something I will see you in 6 months. 
How long does it take to get a response: 1-2 days minimum. 


## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment? No. I mean in terms of needing to be there I would consider it the same but they are different reasons. One is following up and the other is needing care right now. 

- Can you tell me what types of urgent care you might seek through VA's same-day Telehealth appointments? I have had issue with  a cold and it turns into bronchitis so I would go there for urgent or a UTI. Once you know you have one you need medicine right away. I mean an injury, broken bone, feeling symptoms, heart attack would be an ER not urgent care. 

- Who do you expect to speak with for an urgent same-day VA Telehealth appointment? See I am not sure. 
Who would you want to: Probably being able to call into someone, a phone line that you can call and talk to someone that could figure out how quickly you need the appointment to be in based off of the issues. Otherwise someone with the team I am with. 
  Someone on your team: yes
Would it be okay if it were just a VA provider if they can access the records: Yes. If you go to urgent care or an ER as long as they can access your information you are getting care fine. 

## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we are going to take a look at a prototype. We have stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it is a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.  At the top it has the request for express care with a blue box and will get a call back within 4 hours. The blue ! catches my eye. As I scroll down I can see the appointments I have scheduled. I can also click schedule new appointment. 


- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed into your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment?  I would click request express care screening. 
Why: because it seems like the other one would be a routine or follow up appointment. 
What do you expect: it would ask about general information about what is occurring, information to contact back.
 
 - Is that what you expected to happen? It tells me that if it is an emergency I need to use another resource instead of this resource. Its asking about the details I said earlier. It is exactly what I expected. 
Would you get called today: I think it would depend on the time if it were morning for when placing it in I would probably get a call back in 4 hours. Without knowing the hours its operating or where to go, if I place it in the afternoon or evening I am not sure.
Evening though there are options there for you: It says the best times for VA to call but does not say if you will get a call back that day.
Who will call: Highly likely a nurse that would do the screening. 
Does requesting a screening meet your expectation: It would if they would actually get back to me in that day or it would not be same day. 
On the previously screen it says call back within 4 hours: Yes I did but based on VA experiences. Sometimes when after the hours of working you may not get a call back. Even with my primary care doctor when I call late in the day they may not be able to get me in and I have to go to urgent care. That is my expectations.

Same day, business hours or within 24 hours: When I hear same day I feel like it should mean the same day someone should get back to me. Obviously before the middle of the night. I can also understand if it were within a 24 hour period.  
What do you think would happen next: I would assume I would get a call back in 4 hours . I would have the realization that I may not get a call back based on my time. 

- [in prototype: show scheduling list screen] Imagine you are signed into your account, want to make an appointment, and you see this appointment scheduling screen. From this list, walk me through how you would try to be seen today for something, virtually.  Scrolling down to the same day telehealth screening. Well I think based on what it is saying you could do either. Basically the express care is defined that it will save you a trip of going there if you did not need to actually go to the clinic. The screening would give you a telehealth appointment with someone. 

Appointment form the same day telehealth screening option: Well it says you can request a screening and it does not say an appointment but I think that would be my thought process that if they did not need to come in. With express care I would need to go in. 

Would you use express care if you needed an appointment: Yes I would. 

  - Why did you choose this option?

  - Based on the type of care description, what do you think will happen?

    - Was it clear to you that this is a screening before an actual appointment?

    - Was it clear to you that this is not an in-person appointment? 

    - Who do you think you will get a call from? (Clarify: a provider or a scheduler?)

  - Do you think you will get a call back *today*?

  - Who do you think you will speak with?

## Section 4: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today? Yes

  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? Definitely. 

- Do you think VA has resources appointments available to help you if you are experiencing symptoms or may be suffering from coronavirus? I think they have as many resources as anyone else right now.
Will you keep using telehealth after COVID 19: I was using them as much as I could prior to COVID 19, I like to opt for them when I can because it is simpler for me. 
Option to do it in the future: Yes. 

- Do you have any comments or questions about Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  No
