# Express Care: Participant 03

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I would like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers?

What is telehealth: is it like using a phone for healthcare needs. It is a video chat or can call in let them know what is occurring.
Same day care: make an appointment at 8am and can be seen at 12pm.
Urgent care: it is like going to a doctor and  have used it prior when I thought I had strep instead of going to my doctor
Have you used it: No I have not used it yet.

 - If NO: What do you think it might be?

## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth
   - Have you considered it before?  Yes I have. 

Prevented from doing it: I had to get labs because of high cholesterol. Since you do not want to go to the lab to get it done because it prevents you from talking about it. 

Type of appointment does not allow you to: Correct. 
   
  - Would you consider using Telehealth appointments for a same-day appointment? I would, I am in the process of trying to increase my VA claim and instead of me going to the doctor and I can do it on video chat that would be better instead of going into possible infected areas. IF they can ask you instead of having to go to the actual VA it will save time and prevent them from traveling or getting infected. 

Express care: I have heard of it but I have not done it. Maybe it is for the common cold, I do not know what it is about.,

VA or something else: I guess it is a VA thing. I have heard it through friends. 
In person or on phone: from what they say it is over the phone. When they describe it, they were about to do it but have not done it yet. 

- Have you heard anything about same-day/urgent care Telehealth appointments through VA? I have heard of it; it is something new that they started when they started the urgent care. They are able to connect you to the nurse or doctor at the urgent care and they can tell you if they need to come in or not. 

- Have you ever tried to make a same-day appointment with a VA provider, either someone you see regularly or any available provider? I have and I have gotten in. I talked to my doctor about knee pain. I was not sure what it was and he happened to have an opening for 230-300pm. 
Scheduling opening: Yes. 
Was it an urgent appointment or could wait: I could have waiting for that one but when I had a cough in November. I called back and stated I was still having it and I asked if I could get in and he told me to give him an hour than called me back and provided a time. 
Hard or easy to get an appointment: For me when they were open, it is about 10-15 minutes form where I work. If I needed to go to the big va it is a 40-45 minute drive. 
Scheduling your appointment: I go online and do the schedule an appointment and narrow it down for the department or they will send me an appointment reminder and have me call. Or whenever I have an appointment I try to schedule while I am there.
Where do you go: I go to my health evet, schedule an appointment. It always goes to the west haven but you can put in the comments ho you need to see and where they are.

## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment? It depends on what it is and it can be all three at once. I can ask to go to the urgent care instead of the VA because they are booked. 

    - How would you schedule this type of care appointment? With urgent care I would just go straight there because it is 2 minutes form the house. If I were somewhere else I would send the doctor a message about what is occurring. I can see that you have no appointment can you refer me to urgent care or can I go there with information that I talked to you and I can go there. 

- Can you tell me what types of urgent care you might seek through VA's same-day Telehealth appointments? I am sure you can get the basic stuff done like a cough. It all depends where you are going. The smaller branch only does so much. You can go if you need it wrapped or an air boot for a sprain. For me with the cough, headaches, etc. It is like a small aid station that can get you by until you can get into a specialist. 

- Who do you expect to speak with for an urgent same-day VA Telehealth appointment? Usually go with the small branch, the doctor has the nurse to handle incoming calls and emails. Then they handover the phone or message to the doctor. 
Someone of your pack or someone else: I would hope they are part of the VA and part of your team and not temps. I prefer someone within my team but if my team is not available than I am okay with that because I am sure they talk. 
  

## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we are going to take a look at a prototype. We have stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it is a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.  It is basic and simple. 
Anything familiar: The color blue is a normal color seen on here. I cannot remember what the VA appointment when it is confirmed so I do not remember how it looks but I assume it looks like this 


- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed into your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment? I think you would have two options, express care screening or click on the new appointment button. 

Why two options: Just reading on the right part when you request express care, then reading above I think it is something they can do quickly and speed up the process. If you do not read it you may go to the new appointment button. Even when the information is on the page not all they time people will see it if they are focused.

Where would you go: request express care than it goes and tell you that they can do this or that.
 
 - Is that what you expected to happen?  Yes, it has call 911 if it is a crisis than go from there. The additional information is for what is happening and you can select the time to call. It is what is expected. 

When you click submit it would go to the VA and I assume it will go to the big va than they will send an email or call the smaller va where they do my medical and call me quicker rather than the big va. From the timeframe I want them to call the smaller va would call and explain in better detail than they tell me to come in or go to urgent care.

How long do you think it would take: it depends on what all is going on will determine when they call. It goes to Mother VA than smaller VA. It depends on the situation like for me the smaller va would give me a call quickly because I am close. 
Call today: Yes, I know it says 4 hours but I think it would be within an hour to 45 minutes or if you are lucky 10-15 minutes. 

Who would call: I assume depending on the situation it may be the nurse. Depending on what it is the nurse will call and ask what it happening and screen to the doctor to have the conversation. The nurse is knowledge and knows what to do. 

What does the button mean when you request a screening: screening is when they give a quick assessment, within 5 minutes of clicking the button maybe someone will popup asking what is occurring and asking if everything is alright. Hopefully, they would pop up quick to get on the line to see what is occurring. 

Is that what you expected: No, not really. I understand that they say they will call within 4bhours. Maybe on the other end there are key words or keystrokes that others can see and give you a call back. I was not expecting a pending appointment. 
Now what do you expect: they have all of this information and then it would go to the person that it needs to go than they will call back instead of a video screen to ask what is going on then you describe what is occurring than the doctor on call. 

- [in prototype: show scheduling list screen] Imagine you are signed into your account, want to make an appointment, and you see this appointment scheduling screen. From this list, walk me through how you would try to be seen today for something, virtually.  As closest to the problem that you are having, I would select the type of care than click on it and continue. I do not know what happens after.

Would you expect to be seen today to have that option: I think so depending on what it is. If it is mental health it  would go straight to them but the other things that are urgent enough like eye I would schedule an appointment. 


## Section 4: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today? Yeah if it saves me from going through the issue of making an appointment with your doctor. They only let you schedule so often on myhealthevet when you need an appointment but they would give me a call. Depending on your claims maybe you can use this option instead of going to your doctor because some of us need to travel to see the doctor. 

  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? Yes, again we are still in the colds season. Hopefully if I have a scratchy through, headache or runny nose they can tell you if you have the common cold. This way you do not need to go to the doctor than worry about being infected while at the doctorâ€™s office.

- Do you think VA has resources appointments available to help you if you are experiencing symptoms or may be suffering from coronavirus? I am sure that they do. I know they have emails some out that say if you are experiencing these symptoms call the va. I have not used it for that yet. 
Comfortable going back to the office after this: yes, it is like every day. You take your chance with life every day. If you are going to get the virus than you will get it if you are than you will not. You cannot live in fear if you do you might as well put yourself in bubble wrap. Going back to doing the normal life things that is fine. I know for me I will go back to the normal because we take chances with life every day. 

Prefer in office going forward: depending on what it is. I like talking to my doctor and see how their brains work. Depending on what it is if it can be done over the phone I will. I would do both. 


- Do you have any comments or questions about Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  Is it a new thing occurring soon or is it just in the works. This is easier than trying to call the va.
Secure messaging: yes I use it. I use it all the time, it is normally how I get my appointments, I message them telling them what is occurring then I get an appointment.
