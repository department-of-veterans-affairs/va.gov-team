# Express Care: Participant 08

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I would like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers? 
What is telehealth: It is  communicating electronically via technology to schedule or look up information for yourself, when appointments are and anything provided such as prescriptions. 
Same day care: That was mentioned to me before, like if someone cancels their appointment you can take it.
Urgent care: The need to get issues taken and you can go there immediately instead of waiting to go to the doctors.

 - If NO: What do you think it might be?

## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth

- Have you ever used Telehealth appointments? I have experienced it with the VA, my nurse from the VA introduced me to it.
You know it is available : Yes. 
Anything that would prevent you from use it: No, not at all. It is convenient. For sur of the moments. You cannot always go take care of your information whereas this it right at your finger time.
Express care: I have heard of it. 
What is it: It is receiving care, prescriptions. I received a pamphlet. It is getting prescriptions or care. 
- Have you heard anything about same-day/urgent care Telehealth appointments through VA? Within the last two months I have had the nurse call me. So everything was done fast. It was spur of the moment to take the appointment at the time they called. It was in the matter of hours. 
Was its telehealth: Yes.
How was it: Getting connected, once it was up and running it was not long. They wanted to make sure I was doing well and asking me how my health was and if I needed prescriptions or to come in. They can have you do your vitals where they send you the blood pressure. They said like diabetes they are able to have you record it instead of coming to the office. 
Was that an appointment already scheduled or they reached out: They called to reach out, especially after COVID 19 started. They cancelled one appointment but a nurse called to ask if I would like to do one on one telehealth to see if I had concerns or needed immediate attention. 
Was it with your normal provider: Yes.
Would you consider making a same day appointment using telehealth: Yes, depending on the appointment, If it is one on one it is highly convenience due to my distance and traveling. If it is a follow up I would definitely consider it because of the convenience. 
Someone on your care team or any available provider: Me personally if it were my regular doctor. It depends on my situation; I feel more comfortable with my doctor but if I just needed a reference I would be fine with any provider. 
How do you currently schedule your appointments: Actually I schedule by calling in. I always call the main switch and verbally schedule it by phone .They will reach out as well, even when I call in and they cannot provide on they reach back out to ensure I get the appointment.  

## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment?  They offer same day to you and it is convenience. I have been offered that. Yes I consider that a scheduled appointment. Urgent care is pretty much walk in, I have used it a few times. It is when you need assistant and cannot make it to your provider. 

- Can you tell me what types of urgent care you might seek through VA's same-day Telehealth appointments? Going over test results, further instructions of care if you just had a procedure, they communicate how we are doing and if your prescriptions are working or if you need more. 

What if you had an urgent matter, what type of care from an urgent telehealth appointment:  If it is urgent and you have a fever than they will ask if it is normal or still highly. You will need to go to urgent care now but if it broke than they will call back within a few hours to see if it went down so they can monitor the fever.

- Who do you expect to speak with for an urgent same-day VA Telehealth appointment? The nurse. 
Your team or any available VA nurse contacted you: With my regular nurse but I would appreciate if a nurse contacted me. You do not know if your nurse is in or with someone else but if someone were to reach out to care for me it would not matter if it were another nurse. 
  

## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we are going to take a look at a prototype. We have stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it is a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. It is saying that if I have symptoms to request a telehealth express care screening, it have VA appointments. So ill click request express care. 


- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed into your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment? Ok I would request an express care screening appointment. I already have appointments but If I need to talk to someone I would just click request screening. 

What would happen: I could see putting in the information I need to, to get an express care appointment and I would get a call within 4 hours. 
 
 - Is that what you expected to happen? (reading page) Um, well yes. Like I said it is urgent express care but honestly I was thinking someone would live chat to get the information and number to call but this provides the information you need. Being familiar you always see the call 911 or ER if it is an emergency. 
What are you seeing/thinking as you read through: It has the best contact and time to call. It has you provide the email and more than one way to contact. Phone is the best to contact because of the times. Of course a follow up to get back to you immediately for appointments. 
What do you think will happen when you click submit: That it will say someone will follow up with you within that time frame to take care of your needs such as an appointment or concerns.
Who would you hear from: The nurse or the provider themselves.
How would you feel if it were a scheduler: IF they called me back, that is fine. They are taking care of me with an appointment. For the issue or concern, I would be happy but I would still want to talk to a nurse. As long as they are communicating and to take care of my needs that is fine. 
Phone screening meet expectations for a same day urgent telehealth appointment: Yes it does because they are saying they will get back to you within that day. 

IS this what you expected: Yes because it explains that they will contact you within 4 hours. It tells you to wait for them to contact you, yes I expected this. 

- [in prototype: show scheduling list screen] Imagine you are signed into your account, want to make an appointment, and you see this appointment scheduling screen. From this list, walk me through how you would try to be seen today for something, virtually.  I would click on the contact appointment  I would need; these are different types of care. I would click on it and then continue. 
Do you think if you clicked on any of them you would be able to make a same day or telehealth: No most of these have to be through a referral by your provider. Sometimes it depends if you need the follow up. My experience they doctor tells me where I need to go and then normally someone will follow up or need to call. It was not a same day from experience.

Do you see options for same day urgent appointment: Yes, same day telehealth screening. If it is urgent than it says call 911 or go to urgent care but they will call within 4 hours. If they get back to you within 4 hours, I would just go to urgent care if you needed care right now or wait for the appointment if you can. 


## Section 4: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today? Yes.

  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? Yes and no. Yes I would honestly. When you go there and you wait. Either way you are waiting, from what I understand that there will be a wait and some hospital will ask if you have symptoms. Then following up from there they will be in contact with you. If the hospitals are full than  they may turn you away for it, my doctor asked me what was occurring and to see if anything was going on just like flu season. 

- Do you think VA has resources appointments available to help you if you are experiencing symptoms or may be suffering from coronavirus? Yes, I was aware. The nurse provided information for the nearest hospital and 911 you know what to do. They would tell you where to go and what symptoms to look for. 

Will you be comfortable with normal office visits: Yes, I would. Telehealth is convenience but sometimes you cannot just do everything over telehealth. You need to be there to do certain things. Telehealth you can do a lot but I will feel comfortable going to office visits again. 


- Do you have any comments or questions about Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  No. Everything was set in stone for what I need to know and how it works.
