## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Melissa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling Telehealth, or virtual medical, same-day appointments with a VA provider. I am going to ask you a series of questions and we'll take a look at a prototype to help my team understand how to make this process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- In your own words, can you define:
  - "Telehealth"
  - "Same-day care"
  - "Urgent care"
- Have you ever used Telehealth appointments?
  - If YES: 
    - Was this with a VA provider or non-VA doctor?
      - If VA: How did you schedule your appointment 
    - Was this a same-day appointment?
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience?
  - If NO: 
    - Have you considered it before? 
    - What would convince you to try it?
  - Would you consider using Telehealth appointments for a same-day appointment?
- Have you heard of "Express Care"?
  - If YES: 
    - What is it? 
    - Have you used it?
  - If NO: What do you think it might be?
  - Prompt, if needed: Is it Telehealth or in-person?

## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth

- Have you heard anything about same-day/urgent care Telehealth appointments through VA?
  - Clarification question if needed: 
    - Do you think that VA offers any same-day urgent care appointments? 
    - Do you think that the VA offers any same-day urgent care Telehealth appointments?
- Have you ever tried to make a same-day appointment with a VA provider, either someone you see regularly or any available provider?
  - If YES: 
    - Can you tell me what happened?
    - How did you make this appointment?
    - Were you able to be seen?
  - If NO:
    - Have you ever considered doing this, but something prevented you? If so, what?

## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- How do you currently schedule VA medical appointments?
- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment? 
  - If YES: How would you schedule this type of appoint now?
  - If NO: How are these care types different than other appointments you schedule?
    - How would you schedule this type of care appointment?
- Can you tell me what types of urgent care you might seek through VA's same-day Telehealth appointments?
- Who do you expect to speak with for an urgent same-day VA Telehealth appointment?
  - Probe, if necessary: Your PACT, any available provider, an RN, etc. 

## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we're going to take a look at a prototype. We've stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.
  - Probe: What does / doesn't make sense?
- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed in to your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment?
  - Is that what you expected to happen? 
    - If YES: Why?
    - If NO: Why not?
- [in prototype: show scheduling list screen] Imagine you are signed in to your account, want to make an appointment, and you see this appointment scheduling screen. From this list, walk me through how you would try to be seen today for something, virtually.
  - Why did you choose this option?
  - Based on the type of care description, what do you think will happen?
    - Was it clear to you that this is a screening, before an actual appointment?
    - Was it clear to you that this is not an in-person appointment? 
    - Who do you think you will get a call from? 
      - Prompt: a provider or a scheduler?
- [in prototype: show Express Care scheduling screen] (Click continue from scheduling list screen) This is the Express Care request screen. What do you expect will happen once you submit this form?
  - Prompt if necessary: Does "request a phone screening" meet your expectations for making a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment?
  - Do you think you will get a call back *today*?
    - What if you specify a "best times for VA to call" window?
  - Who do you think you will get a call from? 
    - Prompt: a provider or a scheduler?
    - What if you had the option to select "call from PACT member"? Would you mind waiting a little longer to speak with someone you know?

## Section 4: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today?
  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus?
- Do you think VA has resources available to help you if you are experiencing symptoms or may be suffering from coronavirus?
- When we've returned to "normal", do you anticipate feeling comfortable going back to regular office visits?
- Do you have any comments or questions about Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 

- If YES: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
