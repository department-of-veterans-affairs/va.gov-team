# Print Button Analytics and Feedback - August 2023

## Background

On 08/02/2023 the VAOS team released a feature for users to print their appointments list. This added a print button the the appointment lists using a new tertiary style. To assess the usability of the style and whether it's meeting a need, we gathered user behavior data and feedback from Medallia for one month after the release.

## Findings

**Immediately on release, users started clicking the print button.** Desktop users clicked it the most often, and most users printed the upcoming appointments page. We believe this indicates that the print button is findable/usable.

**August was the first month since November 2022 where no users left comments related to printing.** We believe that, because Medallia feedback trends negative, receiving no feedback is an indicator that the print button may be meeting the intended need.

## Next steps

We plan to follow up with UAT that will include testing this button on production.

Find and print all VA appointments on a single sheet. I did not find where any this function was available. This helps me to see the overall picture of upcoming appointments. If this function is not available it would be nice to have.

I only had five  small appointments.  Why did the font's  printout "Extra Large"  take up an ENTIRE page.  I would have given you a very satisfied MARK instead of  the Neither satisfied Mark.
