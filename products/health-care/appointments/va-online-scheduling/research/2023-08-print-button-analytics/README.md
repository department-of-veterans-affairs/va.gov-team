# Print Button Analytics

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

On 08/02/2023 the VAOS team released a feature for users to print their appointments list. This added a print button the the appointment lists using a new tertiary style. To assess the usability of the style and whether it's meeting a need, we will gather user behavior data and feedback from Medallia for one month after the release.
