## Research Plan: Tele-Urgent Care Veteran Study

## Background

The PTEMS Tele-Urgent Care experience is focused on the Veteran experience of getting access to care, specifically remotely. Can Veterans get non-emergency care from home, and do they know their options when it comes to telemedicine? 

## **High Level Objectives**

This effort supports these Office of Connected Care’s Goals: 

1. Increase the usage of Tele-Urgent care, reducing ED visits

2. Decrease the wait times for Veterans seeking Tele-Urgent Care services

3. Improve Veteran awareness and clarity of access to Tele-Urgent Care services

## **Research Goals**

The goal of this study is to understand the Veteran’s end to end experience of receiving urgent care remotely and discover unmet Veteran needs that might inform Tele-Urgent Care and related CRM implementations.  \

1. Develop a thorough understanding of the Veteran’s end-to-end experience of accessing immediate care at the VA. \

2. Discover what user needs might be unmet by the current implementation plan for  \
the CRM solution.
3. What new opportunities might we uncover to improve the Veteran  \
experience of Tele-Urgent Care? 

## Hypotheses

Uncovering opportunities to optimize the Veteran’s experience of Tele-Urgent Care will inform the development of an integrated, modern VAHC, and an optimized workflow will improve the overall Veteran Tele-Urgent care experience, reduce wait times, reduce call abandons, and reduce emergency department visits. 

We hypothesize that Veterans who utilize Tele-Urgent Care will reduce their need to visit the Emergency Room, and will increase the quality and efficiency of care they receive at the VA.

## Research questions

* What do Veterans need/want when seeking care that is defined as not emergent, but urgent and fits the recommended follow up interval of 0-2 or 2-8 hours for   diagnosis and treatment?

* Do Veterans have any awareness of such offerings currently and can Veterans easily distinguish between types of care?

* Do Veterans understand the technology needs for virtual visits?

* Is the technology and the communication of requirements accessible to Veterans and/or their caregivers? 

* Do Veterans feel secure in virtual visit environments?

* What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing for a Tele-Urgent visit?

## Method

Remote, contextual inquiry and observation will be used to gain a broader understanding of their experience and attitudes towards tele-medicine.  We will ask Veterans to share their screen and demonstrate how they might find tele-medicine / tele-urgent care from the VA.
