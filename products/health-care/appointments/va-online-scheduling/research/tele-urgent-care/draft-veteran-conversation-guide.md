### **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thank you for joining us today! My name is _, and I also have my colleague _ on the line taking notes. We are here today to talk about VA Tele-Urgent Care. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help my team understand how to make the telehealth process easier for Veterans.

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:

* We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.
* There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions,  \
	so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans' needs.
* I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
* This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to  \
	keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to  \
	the next question.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let  \
me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? _Start audio and screen recording._
