# VA Tele-Urgent Care Veteran Research Readout

January 26, 2022 


# Background and goals
The goal of our UX research is to ask how might we uncover opportunities to improve the Veteran experience of Tele-Urgent Care?
- Develop a thorough understanding of the Veteran’s end-to-end experience of accessing immediate care at the VA.
- Discover what Veteran needs might be unmet by the current path or proposed solutions. 
- Uncover new opportunities to improve the Veteran experience of Tele-Urgent Care.

This research report covers conversational interviews conducted January 5-14, 2022.

# Purpose of January 2022 interviews
The purpose of the January 2022 interviews was to better understand why and how Veterans choose the ways that they find and interact with telehealth services at the VA, and identify any gaps that exist in the VA's existing Veteran-facing technology and Tele-Urgent Care proposed solutions. 

# Research questions
- What do Veterans need/want when seeking care that is defined as not emergent, but urgent and fits the recommended follow up interval of 0-2 or 2-8 hours for diagnosis and treatment?
- Do Veterans have any awareness of such offerings currently and can Veterans easily distinguish between types of care?
- Do Veterans understand the technology needed for virtual visits?
- Is the technology and the communication of requirements accessible to Veterans and/or their caregivers?
- Do Veterans feel secure in virtual visit environments?
- What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing for a Tele-Urgent visit?
  
# Method
- Sessions were conducted remotely via Zoom and scheduled for 45-60 minutes. 
- Sessions were conducted over the course of two weeks beginning January 5 and ending January 14. 
- Remote interviews were used to gain a broader understanding of their experience and attitudes towards tele-medicine.

# Research Findings

## Finding Care: Veterans don’t know where to find immediate telehealth services at the VA.
- Many Veterans call the 24-hour nurse line at their local VAHC for urgent care needs. 
- Veterans will often secure message their care team via MyHealtheVet for urgent care advice. 
- If they aren’t sure where to go for care, or how to respond to a health event, they tend to call their primary care team. 
- Most participants had multiple channels of communication with the VA and used combinations of My HealtheVet, in-person visits, and phone conversations to manage their healthcare.

## Care Experience: Veterans’ experience with telehealth care was uneven.
- Participants' experience with wait times varied, often within the same process. Some participants called the 24-hour nurse line and received a decision they were happy with and their issue was resolved. Other participants had spent a long time on hold, or waited for a call back that took days. Some experienced no call back at all. It is important to note that most participants were referring to scheduled care, as they had not experienced Tele-Urgent Care at the VA.
- Most understood the technology to connect with care, but a few had privacy concerns.
- Connection issues were perceived to be “on the VA side”.
- Participants expressed concern about what care is covered. They expressed concern about reporting to an urgent care or an ER that might not be paid for by their VA health plan. 

## Comfort Level: Veterans’ attitude towards Tele-Urgent Care was positive and they believe it would greatly improve their lives.
- All participants expressed how much Tele-Urgent Care would benefit their lives, once they understood it meant immediate remote urgent care offered by the VA. 
- Participants discussed how much time it would save them, reduce the distance they had to travel, and remove mobility obstacles. 
- Several participants noted that remote urgent care would alleviate the social anxiety of traveling to public places in general, but especially during the pandemic. 
- Participants offered how much it would support their work/life interactions. 

## Preparing For Care: Veterans noted several things that would help Tele-Urgent Care visits be successful. 
- Veterans expressed how much knowing wait time would help their experience of a visit. A sense of knowing what’s coming was noted as helping ease anxiety during a health event or concern.
- Participants would like to better understand what constitutes urgent care? They don’t distinguish acuity of care needs easily, so many suggested a list of symptoms that they could reference to better understand what to use when. 
- Most would prefer a walk-through of technology involved in a visit, and one participant suggested a video lesson. They would like to be prepared technically to have a successful visit.
- There is a lack of awareness of the VA VVC app. Many participants mostly referred to connecting via “a link”, or “Zoom”. 

## Ease-of-Use: Veterans want easy to use, on-demand care at the VA. 
- A “one-stop-shop” is preferable, offering a clear path to care.
- "It feels like there are a lot of different portals, taking you to different places" 
- Simple technology and reliable access is important to them.
