# Express Care: Participant 09

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I would like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers?
What is telehealth: It is being able to reach out without having to go to the VA, you can use the phone or computer, it is more through video conferences than a phone appointment. 
Same day care: It would be like be having a problem in the morning and hearing something or care by midday and no later than the night. 
Urgent Care: It is more for not a heart attack but if you have a bad back and have issues with back pain, maybe a cold or something. You cannot wait to get into see the doctor I would go to urgent care. 

## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth

- Have you ever used Telehealth appointments? Yes
  - If YES: 
    - Was this with a VA provider or non-VA doctor? Yes with the VA. 
        - If VA: How did you schedule your appointment 
    - Was this a same-day appointment?
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience? It was done on the phone for mental health, it was as everything was shutting down I needed an appointment with my physiatrist for med. I was going to go in but I know I could do it over the phone, Talked for 15 minutes and got everything, it is greatly beneficial. I live 30 miles from the va so being able to do it over the phone helps from the wear on me with driving.  
Changed to a phone from in person: exactly. 
Something you would do again: Yes. 
- (Clarification question if needed: Do you think that VA offers any same-day urgent care appointments? Yes.
Express care: not from the VA I have not. 
What do you think it is: Probably a type of urgent care, or just getting you in there quicker instead of having to wait. 
In person or telehealth: Probably phone or video would work.

- Have you ever tried to make a same-day appointment with a VA provider, either someone you see regularly or any available provider? No, not same day. I tried to do it with mental health through myhealthevet but it would not let us do it for mental health. I do not understand why, I think you should be able to schedule the appointment if you are a patient. 
Uses myhealthevet: I use the secure messages if I need refills on meds without it being called in, if I need a new pillow due to my bad back I send a message and the same day you get an answer, we are lucky to have myhealthevet. There is a lot of information on there.
Scheduling tool: Other than the mental health part I use it there. 

## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment?  No.
How are they different: urgent care is something that happens over night and is urgent or is just urgent. Same day maybe I can wit a bit later in the day for care. 
What would you get same day for: Mental health, primary care, would be beneficial. 
Who would you speak to: probably a nurse or if I call in it would be an operator. I assume they have some sort of medical training. 
Someone on your team or someone else that is available: I would be okay with anyone if they are able to assign it with the team that would be nice. You may have to wait longer but if I can talk to anyone that works for me. 
If you have the option to wait longer for your team but called back the same time would you choose your team: Yes I would. 
  

## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we are going to take a look at a prototype. We have stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it is a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.  I thinking of it as if I am having symptoms but it is not anything urgent I can call and be screened prior to having to go in right away. It says that they will call you back within 4 hours. It does help protect me contacting and maybe not going in to be exposed. I see the highlighted link that I can request the express care screening. There is the VA address. 


- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed into your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment? I would possibly click on new appointment. 
What do you think will happen: I think there will be a calendar with times that an appointment could be open or a contact number I guess if its not in there. 
 
 - Is that what you expected to happen? It has a list of things on there and tells me if I am experiencing a medical emergency to call 911. Then it tells me the types of cares that you can click on for what you need to get into. Down here same day telehealth screening. 
What next: Click same day telehealth screening and click continue. 

  - Why did you choose this option? same day telehealth screening- I am having symptoms so I can start the process before going to the VA I would go through the telehealth screening. 


    - Was it clear to you that this is a screening before an actual appointment? To me yes it is really clear. 

    - Who do you think you will get a call from? (Clarify: a provider or a scheduler?) It would either be a doctorâ€™s nurse or medical staff such as a scheduler.
Not confessed if it is a scheduler: No I would be okay with that. 

Continue There is a box for additional details
After or before talking to them: It looks like maybe after you speak to them.
What details would you provide: The symptoms I am having and maybe what I need. You can put in there what time you would like to be called and the date. 
Do you think you would get a call back the same day: Yes. 
What would you think happens when you submit: It should go to the next page that has everything there to review. My information, best time for them to call, I would think that would be there to review it. 
Did you expect that:   Yes. I like that they have in there that they will contact you within 4 hours.
What if you submitted it at 10pm: I would assume I wont here anything until the VA opens again. 
Did you notice at the top where it says request express care screening: Yes
Anything that did not stand out to you for the same day urgent telehealth appointment: It is not really saying that it would be the same day unless you really know it. You are requesting it and its not really giving you an appointment. 


## Section 4: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today? Yes I would. 

  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? Yes. 

- Do you think VA has resources appointments available to help you if you are experiencing symptoms or may be suffering from coronavirus? Yes they do, the do the testing at the VA. I do not know if they have enough resources but they have some and do the tests. 

- Do you have any comments or questions about Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  No. Is it something that is happening or will be happening. 
Yes, we are helping to see if it is useful. _ I think it would be greatly beneficial. My dad is a veteran as well and will drive to the VA when he could just do it on the phone. Telehealth is a great thing. 
If it were between a video call or phone call would that be a blocker: No I do not think it would be.  My wife is not a veteran but we had an issue and had to do telehealth, we normally have to drive 30 miles there and were able to do the phone appointment. I think it is the new thing. I am the Vice President of the Key Stone Paralyzed Veterans and we do our meeting on video and it is incredibly helpful. I
