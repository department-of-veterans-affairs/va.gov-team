# Express Care: Participant 06

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I would like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers?
What is telehealth: It means that I am able to accomplish all I need to for health care from a distance, phone, online presence, phone, smartphone, computer, or devices that are able to transmit data from to me to the provider.
Same day care: an appointment or need for an appointment is apparent and contact is made with the provider the same day. The appointment starts and the provider is able to speak with me or look at the information provided to begin treatment. If it is 6pm, I would expect it to occur on Monday. My thought process is calendar day not 24 hours. 
1159 that night: common sense to me says that would happen. If it has told me that it is same day it would be nice to it to occur that way but real world tells me it would not
Same day and 24 hour bias: Monday is Monday. 24 hour day is a variable start time. Same day starts at 12am to 1159 pm. When I hear same day it will be the same day.
Does same day vary depending on who the service is for,  more reliable from amazon vs best buy: No. If you tell me the thing will occur the same day I expect it to. If its not my feelings are that you mislead me or did not articulate it well enough and neither clarified the expectations to the other. 
Urgent care: not to the level of emergency care but not something that can wait a week to see someone. Like a temperature that is not to the level of serious but needs to be seen, symptoms of allergies, creating issues or turned into an infection and need to be seen before 1-3 weeks. It is an interim between it is a broken arm. 

 - If NO: What do you think it might be?

## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth

- Have you ever used Telehealth appointments? I have.
  - If YES: 
    - Was this with a VA provider or non-VA doctor? Both
        - If VA: How did you schedule your appointment 
    - Was this a same-day appointment?
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience? It was a result from the covid-19. I switched to my old va to my new one. I needed a new provider and had to do a first appointment. Due to the COVID circumstance it was rescheduled by the doctor who called at 645pm. He asked his questions I asked mine. The appointment was helpful, there were some issues that I wish I could have address but was unable to due to it needing a physical exam due to being a new provider to me. I was satisfied. I was upset I did not hear something until later and I was surprised pleasantly at 645pm when he call but happy that he was still working. Changing his appointment to phone was seemed better and had to spend more time with them due to it being a phone call.
Contacted due to the delayed: no. they called me the morning of to tell me it was change. It was when the va switched to phone only. I got a call that said your appointment will be by phone and I heard nothing until 645pm.  I had paperwork that the doctor needed to see and had things he needed to check, it was the day of prior to everything being in place and I was irritated but it is understanding that it was out of anyone’s control.
Express care: NO I have not heard of it through the va
What is it: There are many phrases in health care. Express care to me is just like urgent care. It is a streamline process not to the level of emergency care but over the level of mundane. I expect wait time and checking in to be streamline.
In person or not: it would be either way. If you are going to offer it one way or the other than it should be identified as such. If you just say express care than I do not know, if you say online or at my clinic I know what I am getting upfront. 

  - If NO: 
- Have you heard anything about same-day/urgent care Telehealth appointments through VA? I have not. 
- (Clarification question if needed: Do you think that VA offers any same-day urgent care appointments? Do you think that the VA offers any same-day urgent care Telehealth appointments?) They probably do. 

- Have you ever tried to make a same-day appointment with a VA provider, either someone you see regularly or any available provider? I have. I had been out in the foothills and found myself with poison oak. It normally is not bad but I had it on my face near my eye and it was of concern. I contact the va with an urgent care facility and were not able to take me. I contacted the other VA that do not have an urgent care but they had an opening that they could schedule me and see me same day. 

How do you currently schedule: my appointments are mostly maintenance and we schedule them by phone at about 3-6 months out. If I am at work at lunch I will make the phone call if I am at phone I may use myhealthevet. I have also used secure messaging to get an appointment and the nurse would contact me for an appointment. 

## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment?  Typically no. It can be a scheduled thing but to me urgent care is something that has came up and needs faster attention than started appointment. If I have a fever of 101 I may want to go to urgent care if it is higher than 103 it is an er visit. I do not think of an appointment as a vital part of the process. If I wake up with a sinus infection, I know when I have one I do not think I should make an appointment for them to tell me. I should be able to walk in and do that. The downside of it is that we do not have the number of providers to take care of that so I understand that scheduling may get me in faster. 
Different that you schedule for: Typically People may go to the er for a headache, a sinus infection is an urgent care matter, the rash and fever would be an er visit. For medical refill I would not go to urgent care I would make an appointment. If there is a lump that has not changed in 3 months, that an appointment. If I broke my arm and knew it, that is an er visit.


- Who do you expect to speak with for an urgent same-day VA Telehealth appointment? Well that is tough. I do not expect the senior nurse, PA, or doctor to be the first person to talk to. The first person could be a medical assistance, someone that is a not a provider but asks the questions to start the process. The person would function as a phone receptionist than it would go to the provider, a MD, PA, or FMP. 
  

## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we are going to take a look at a prototype. We have stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it is a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.   First thing I see is the box for express care screening or a prescreening. I like that. Again going to my expectations I provide the information and when I get an appointment it provides the amount of time may be short because I have done the prescreening questions that are normally done. I think id have to do pulse, blood pressure but the questions such as do you think of hurting yourself I feel would be done here. My first thought is that it saves me time once I am taken back for my appointment. This will save maybe 10 minutes. Healthcare provider calling me back within4 hours is a challenge because if this is for me needing to be seen today, 4 hours is a long time if that makes sense. 

What do you think a good time period is: I do not know. I understand the issues and staffing issues. I work in healthcare to. I understand some of what  occurs. My challenge is, it is a 30 minute drive so its 2pm, I can be at the va by 230pm. Wait to be seen for the time frame but because I am there when they shut down I will be seen. If I do this at 230 I may not be seen. It says they will call beck within 4 hours when they close at 530 so I would need to be seen tomorrow. If it is urgent care than it is urgent, if it is er circumstance, 4 hours is not emergent but coming back to my typical clinic visit like adjusting my medicine for blood sugar or regular clinic visit this would be helpful but the 4 hour window means I wouldn’t use it for urgent care or an ER visit because it doesn’t match up with urgent. A reasonable time frame for an er case, if there is a way to be marked and contacted within 30 minutes because they are asking to self-triage, yes people will abuse it but they can tell them where to go based off of the situation but you rely on what they say without an exam. The issue with this is that they cannot see it and it may not look as bad as it is. As a fix to that I would leave ER off of there because I do not see a way to make it work for that. If I think it is a heart attack, I might not have 4 hours. 

  - Probe: What does / does not make sense?

- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed into your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment? 
New appointment, I think it will take me to the page to ask me what I am trying to do. 
 
 - Is that what you expected to happen? Yes. Why do you need to be seen. I am looking at it. 

- [in prototype: show scheduling list screen] Imagine you are signed into your account, want to make an appointment, and you see this appointment scheduling screen. From this list, walk me through how you would try to be seen today for something, virtually.  There is nothing that would cover that, the same day is still talking about doing a screening prior to scheduling a telehealth for today. As I understood I need an urgent telehealth appointment for today. Not going in but need to talk to the doctor. Looking at my options, I have express care it is screening prior to going, (reading page), same day telehealth screening is for prior to going to the clinic. It is the same as the express care. In fact it is the same description. There is nothing that tells me telehealth appointment for today so I would go to PMC. I would like to see the option for my telehealth appointment. Then maybe have the decision making tree prior are you looking for an in person or telehealth appointment then go to this screen. I came here specifically to make a telehealth appointment.

You want to decided prior to this screen: Yes. Right. Exactly. Here I want to make a telehealth appointment and I do not see it. Depending on my frame of mind or attitude or how I feel, this is supposed to make it easier and it is presenting more than what I am looking for I would just call. The other side is why are they presenting me is do I want to see in person or use the phone. Not everyone will be happy but if I am here to be seen for telehealth I should do that prior to being at this screen. 

If you saw express care here what you think would happen: Again express care to me, I think an urgent care here is even called express care. To me everything is streamline, I hear express and I think streamline. Less time, easy access and less dealing with the mundane stuff. Less intrusive with the questions that occur. When you tell me express, you will save me 20 percent of the time and effort. I am going to the clinic on Monday and talk about my med, spends 2 hours. I say 2 hours because I arrive early and leave late. Wait for them to get to me, come to me, chit chat, what are we seeing you for today, get on the computer for them to know why I am there, by the time it is all said and done and if I need to get meds that want me to start. That is fine, that is normal. If it is urgent care that 2 hour appointment should be an hour or less. It is on a triage basis when I get there,  may wait a bit longer to be seen, doctor should say what are we doing today, rash lets look at it. I may need meds but the pharmacy wait is normally quick so its about an hour. Express care I think it should take maybe 45 minutes because it is streamline, there should not be that wait. It is dependent if they have the staff to do it or add more to make it work. It needs to be faster than urgent care. If it is not faster than it is a lie and it would upset me. The realistic aspect is that if its not less time than its just the VA just lied to me. 

What do you see here: I think the box asking for additional details is going to get the story talking about everything besides the problem. I am afraid you will get a lot of information but not useful information. I think you should ask specifics. Like what is the primary concern, what is your temperature. People can take their own pulse.  Ask triage questions, you cannot ask 50 of them but you can ask ones that can get focused information for those who read it. 

Rest of the questions expected: It is. Although it is interesting for me to see 4pm to 8pm. I am happy to see evening times but I do not know if I would expect that to actually happen. The other thin is that you have ET to everything and you work to your time but I see a lot of veterans struggle with times so have it as local times and adjust it to your time. Solely because 8pm your time is 5pm my time and I see 4pm to 8pm and I am an old vet, hard of hearing and seeing I would not see the ET so I would be mad. 
  - Why did you choose this option?

Member of your care team or anyone: only because I am experienced with it is that it would just be a provider and does not have to be a member of my team. I am comfortable with it because I experienced it already. Someone that is wedded to the idea of their own people caring for them may not be as open. I suggest that on here that it says a healthcare provider will use it to contact you but may not be a provider other than yours. 


## Section 4: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today? I would consider it. I would have high expectations that may not be reasonable. Again we talked about it but I still do not know what express care means to the VA. I gave you my feelings but we have not talked about what it is to the VA. I would give it a shoot. If I need a provider id give anything a shoot.

  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? I would. Having said that there is a lot of misinformation and anger, frustration, irritation, and other things out there that I am skeptical that a lot of the public would. I try to do the smart thing so I definitely would but I do not have faith in my peers. 

- Do you think VA has resources appointments available to help you if you are experiencing symptoms or may be suffering from coronavirus?  It is a two edge sword. My local va can only send me to a local ER. Here, no because there is an 80 bed hospital that is over 2 hours away. That is my only option for the VA. Having said that I have went to a local hospital as a recommendation from the va and received care. When the va was unable to care for me they are able to facilitate me getting care for me based off of past experiences. 


- Do you have any comments or questions about Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  No, I like what I see.
