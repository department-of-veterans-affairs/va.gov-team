# Express Care: Participant 01

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I would like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers?
  - If YES: 
    - Which ones? Mostly just mental health, that is how my husband accesses them, I do not use telehealth myself. 
      Consider at all: Yea, some of mine like labs are unavoidable. Mental health appointments, wellness or referrals I would prefer to do telehealth instead of driving or going into the VA due to it being stressful. The choice to do telehealth would be helpful. 
      Non-va telehealth: no
- Have you heard of "Express Care"? No

 - If NO: What do you think it might be? Is it like an urgent care.
   Is that what you think: Yes, that is what it sounds like.
   In person or virtual: Virtual. 
   Telehealth offered for same day: Yes, that is what the name would lead me to believe
   You have not had telehealth for same day: No.
   In your own words describe telehealth: access to health care by teleconference video or phone. 

## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment? Yes. 
  - How would you schedule this type of care appointment? Anything for behavioral health, I think that would be number one on the list. Maybe anything that could be done quickly by the doctor or PA to see and assess via the video and being able to assess if the patient needs to go to the ER. I am assuming it could work for a number of things. Being able to determine and safe time instead of going to the ER for 4 hours when you are fine. 
- Can you tell me what types of urgent care you might seek through VA's same-day Telehealth appointments? I believe twice.
  Experience: it dealt with a lot of waiting.
  How did you try to make appointment: called into the nurse station and asked if there are walk in hours and they told me the best bet to walk in and when they finally got us in it was unpleasant because the doctor was focused on getting to the next person. Because we were not on the schedule it was like we were not priority. We were rushed in and out of there and it was a waste of time to be seen. Overall crappy experience. 
  Were you able to get the right attention or to distracted: I think they were busy trying to push us in and out. If it were for my husband they would not have gotten what he needed and we needed to redirect them for what we needed like medicine or a signature. 
  How do you schedule appointments, do you concern same day or urgent care as the normal appointment: Would I call the nurses desk the same way?
  Can you tell me how to make appointments: For both myself and my husband our appointments are recurring so for our appointments we go in and we know that they are scheduled accordingly unless the doctor needs to change it or we do. The only time that we need to schedule is with our PCM or dental every 6 months when I call into the clinic and do it over the phone. 
  Same day or urgent matter how would you do it: over the phone as well. 
  Same way: Yes. 
  Go in for same day telehealth appointment who would you talk to: I guess at least a nurse, probably depends on the issue for what the appointment is for. If it is triage Definity a nurse but if it is behavioral health related than a doctor. It depends on the type of care it is.
  A member of your clinic or anyone: If it is same day than you must understand that you are working with someone that is available and may not be on your team. That is just how that works, you are asking for anyone available when it is urgent care. 
  In the case it is urgent and want to talk to someone on the same day or 48 hours but done want to go in, option to speak with someone on your care team: I think so. If there is one within 48 hours that way your care team can be given a heads up. It depends on my issues if it is urgent care than the first available provider or I could just call the front desk for the first appointment. 
  Can you explain what Triage means to you: so say I injured myself gardening and I had a physical injury and needed an assessment to see if I need stitches, they can see the damage, how much its bleeding and decide if I can care for it at home. 

## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we are going to take a look at a prototype. We have stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it is a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing: It kind of looks like the regular va appointment page but for express care screening and instructions on how to do so. 

  - Probe: What does / does not make sense? I like the request an express care screening appointment, I think the option to make appointments on the normal page has to be dug for. This is pretty straight forward. 

- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed into your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment? Right here , request express care screening.
  Wy: it guarantees someone will call within 4 hours and that knocks out the screening portion. Regardless they can see if I need to schedule an appointment or if it can wait. The screening kind of takes out the middleman of going to the urgent care unless it is serious.
  Normally call in for appointments but page is familiar, what websites do you use for appointments for the VA: MyHealtheVet. 

 - Is that what you expected to happen? Basically. SO I know that having used Tricare for a few years they have their system when you are active duty prior to going to the ER you must call the triage nurse system to go through symptoms. That is a little timelier or at least for your time. On here it is someone will get to you within 4 hours instead of being able to call the nurse yourself. I do not think the VA has a triage nurse, is there a triage number to call. There is only calling the crisis line or waiting the 4 hours to them to call you. 

- [in prototype: show scheduling list screen] Imagine you are signed into your account, want to make an appointment, and you see this appointment scheduling screen. From this list, walk me through how you would try to be seen today for something, virtually.
  What do you see: It is straightforward, if you get to this page you have logged in and proven you are part of the VA system. I feel like it might be, where it says additional details for screening, having optional there may not be a good thing because if the nurse or whoever doing the call does it unprepared and there are no notes, they may not know what they are calling in reference for, if there are notes in place they could have resources prepared instead of having to wait and hear it, some people talk more when on the phone instead of when they have a limited space to right it. Taking the optional away and requiring the details may be more helpful for the individuals conducting the screening. 

Options to provide there: Maybe if there were a multiple choice where you could briefly describe the issue or reason for needing a telehealth screening. For example, physical, related to behavioral health or pharmaceutics  A list of different departments and the screen details  the process would be more concise. 

- [in prototype: show Express Care scheduling screen] (Click continue from scheduling list screen) This is the Express Care request screen. What do you expect will happen once you submit this form? Yes. That is straightforward. 

  - Prompt if necessary: Does "request a phone screening" meet your expectations for making a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment? I think so. With the telehealth system is it only available during regular hours or 24 hour system. How does it work. What happens when someone submits it later in the after will they still get a call in 4 hours. 

Looking at the hour options, does it provide insight: it asked when it is best for the VA to call, I think it means generally 8am to 8pm EST they are available. If someone submits it in the evening will it still say within 4 hours? I only say that because when older people submit it and they may get upset because they do not get a call in 4 hours because they do not read it fully. 

What do you expect, 24 hour service: When I think of express care or urgent care, a lot of them are the same hours of an ER or somewhere close like to 10pm or 11pm. Maybe having clarity of the hours of operation if it will not be a 24 hour service than clarify the operation hours so that someone will not assume no matter what time it is they will get a call within 4 hours.

  - Do you think you will get a call back *today*? Yes, I would assume I would hear back by around 2 pm. So I would assume this is the same day thing and because it is Friday I would hope to hear back within 4 hours. 

Best time to call window: Than I would assume it would be earlier or later if I clarify the specific time window. Maybe that makes a bit trickery if you are having it say they will call within 4hours but than asking the veteran what the best time to call is because if they try to do an express care screening and they expect a response within 4hours than its not up to you. You should be expecting a call within 4 hours. 

  - Who do you think you will speak with? I would assume a team of nurses would be running this. 

Clicking on new appointment button, see the appointment list, form this list how would you try to be seen today virtually: Click same day telehealth screening.

Why: I would just use the express care option instead. 
What factored into the first option: seeing same day. 
Based on the type of care what do you think will happen: Well, so if I try to schedule with either one, do I still have the option or still have to do the express care screening before doing the appointment. 
Was it clear to you that express care is a screening: No. 

Questions: I cannot think of anything right now. 

## Section 4: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today? Yes absolutely. 

  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? Yes, probably would be the first options instead of risking infecting other people. 

- Do you think VA has resources appointments available to help you if you are experiencing symptoms or may be suffering from coronavirus? I am not aware of anything before the screening process the VA have at the front desk when you go in. They are screening everyone before going in.

- Do you have any comments or questions about Express Care that we have not yet covered today?   No, other than the telehealth is incredibly helpful. Anything at will make it less stressful for my husband is incredibly helpful. It is a time saver and stress reliever for the household. 

Do you think that you would be comfortable for regular doctor visit in the future: I think I will, the one time I had to do lab work since this started I was anxious and nerves and on edge when going there. Once there it was easier, no one was there, and it was super clean. I am used to everyone hanging out there all day. Normally the va puts me on edge natural but I know there are a lot of people getting help. Waling in to do that lab work two weeks ago was when I was the least stressed going to the VA. They are handling it well and makes me comfortable for future appointments.
