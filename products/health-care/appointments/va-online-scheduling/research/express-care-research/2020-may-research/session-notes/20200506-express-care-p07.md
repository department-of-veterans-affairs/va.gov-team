# Express Care: Particpant 07

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I would like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers? 
What is telehealth: easy access to medical professionals for patients in hard to reach places and people that are not able to leave their homes. 
What is same day care: Making an appointment and having it the same day.
Urgent care: can be either emergency visit or visit when a person cannot see their doctor same day.


## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth

- Have you ever used Telehealth appointments? Yes.
  - If YES: 
    - Was this with a VA provider or non-VA doctor? No but I had a phone appointment the other day.
        - If VA: How did you schedule your appointment: I called to see if they need to reschedule due to COVID and check but said we would have the appointments still. The day prior to my appointment the doctor called to see if we could do it over the phone. 
    - Was this a same-day appointment?
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience? It was good, a lot quicker and dint have to meet at the VA.
Consider doing again: Yes. 
  - Would you consider using Telehealth appointments for a same-day appointment? Yes.
Do you consider the phone appointment telehealth: Yes. 
Express care: No. 
What do you think it might mean: Going to the ER and seeing the doctor in the same day. 
In person or telehealth: Either. 
- Have you heard anything about same-day/urgent care Telehealth appointments through VA? No I have not. 
- Do you think that VA offers any same-day urgent care appointments? Do you think that the VA offers any same-day urgent care Telehealth appointments? I am not aware of it. 

- Have you ever tried to make a same-day appointment with a VA provider, either someone you see regularly or any available provider? I believe I did last year. 
Experience: I called in to make an appointment with my doctor and she told me there were no appointments.
How do you currently schedule appointments: When I go there I make the appointment at check out.
In advance in person: Yes
Any other ways: Other than calling, no.  


## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment?  Yes. 

    - How would you schedule this type of care appointment? I would go ahead and call. I am not sure if it is by the on call nurse but you can call and talk to them. You can call and talk to the nurse at the ER and get instructions from there. 

- Can you tell me what types of urgent care you might seek through VA's same-day Telehealth appointments? Bronchitis, asthma, headaches, migraines, emergency care would be urgent care other than 911. 
Expect to talk to someone of your care team if it is a same day: No, they may call back or see me the other day but the doctor that saw me would communicate with them. 
  

## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we are going to take a look at a prototype. We have stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it is a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing:   I see an explanation to request the express care screening, button to request new appointments, confirmed appointments and a pending appointment with options to cancel. 

- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed into your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment?  Request an express care screening then add new appointment.
Why were you thinking the express care options first: I would need to talk to a nurse first than they would direct me if I needed to call back but they could do it from there as well. 
What do you expect to happen: I would talk to a nurse to get my information than I guess wait to talk to an ER doctor or an express care doctor. 
 
 - Is that what you expected to happen?  (reading page) It provides the option to call 911 by clicking on the number or the crisis line and it allows you additional information for symptoms, asks the time of the day best to call, good number and email to contact you at. No.  
How do you feel about this: It is okay to me. I think it is to see who is more urgent and needs to be taken care of first. I would not mind doing this. It also depends where I am in line and it is just like a call back. 
What do you think would happen if you clicked submitted: A nurse or a technician would call me back.

Do you expect that to happen today, or how soon: Within 24 hours. 
Is there anything that would indicate when: If I call late in the evening it may be the next morning. It does say evening here though. 

How would you call if a scheduler called: Depending on my symptoms I would not be too sure I guess but they know the doctors schedule. I would prefer a nurse to call be back.  (reading page)

How do you feel about this page: It is informing, I feel better now that it says within 4 hours. It provides the name of the doctor so I know who I will be talking to.

Do you think you would speak to someone in that list: I think it would be a nurse. 

- [in prototype: show scheduling list screen] Imagine you are signed into your account, want to make an appointment, and you see this appointment scheduling screen. From this list, walk me through how you would try to be seen today for something, virtually:  I would scroll down to see where my symptoms would be close to. I mean I would click on mental health if I needed to talk to my psychologist. 

What if you needed an appointment today for virtual appointment: I would click on express care and/or same day telehealth screening.

What stood out: Express care was on top. Then same day screening was on the bottom. I would prefer it to be under express care.
Do you think there is a difference between the two: Yeah. Not in the description there is not a difference.
Name is difference: Yes.
What is the difference in the name to you: Express care is an urgent need and same day telehealth is for less emergency type symptoms. The word screening is different, it would tell me that they are screening be prior to an appointment. Express care would be having an appointment that same day.
