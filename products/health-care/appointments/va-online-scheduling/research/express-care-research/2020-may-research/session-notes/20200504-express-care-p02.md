# Express Care: Participant 02

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I would like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers?
  Telehealth is meeting with a health care professional by phone or video.
  Same day care is when you go in the same day to be seen.
  Urgent care is when you have an urgent issue and you are taken care of the same day.


## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth

- Have you ever used Telehealth appointments?
  - If YES: 
    - Was this with a VA provider or non-VA doctor? Both
      - If VA: How did you schedule your appointment: Basically they scheduled it than they call and I spoke with them over the phone. 
    - Was this a same-day appointment? No.
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience? It was easy. 
      Something you would do again: Yes.

- Have you ever tried to make a same-day appointment with a VA provider, either someone you see regularly or any available provider? Yes.
  Express care: I do not think so. 
  What do you think it might be: Similar to urgent care or same day appointment
  In person or virtual: probably virtual.
  Why: Just that you can get it right away and see them the same day. 
  Telehealth and same day through VA: Yes, I have heard of it. 
  Have not considered doing it or no need: I have not had a need for it until recently. 
  Confirm: 

## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment? 
  Yes I have tried to make an appointment for same day.
  Process: I call or walk in to be seen.
  Are you able to be seen: No always. 
  How do you communicate with your provider. I send a secure message to my provider. Normally I receive contact back through secure messenger. 
  Any other way: Like I said, I just or walk in. 
  Carew types are different than your appointment: That would be for something more pressing that could not wait unlike a follow-up. 
  Rephrase, Is it something that pops up and you do not have a chance to schedule but can within 24 hours: Right. 
  What types of care would you use telehealth: cold, respiratory health, something that you do not need x rays or test for. 
- Who do you expect to speak with for an urgent same-day VA Telehealth appointment? Either a nurse or a doctor.
  Expect to speak within someone of your pact: Not always but maybe.
  Option to wait a few hours to talk to someone on your pact instead of someone else: I would rather talk with someone on my pact. 

## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we are going to take a look at a prototype. We have stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it is a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing. There is an option to request an express care screen where they call back within 4hours, request new appointment and they tell you when you appointment is, with who and what for.  This is telling you the appointments you already have. 
  Look Familiar: No. 


- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed into your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment? At the express care screening.

Why: Because it says that they will call back within 4 hours so if you need to talk to someone today you can request a telehealth screening.

 What do you expect to happen: Them to call me back.

 - Is that what you expected to happen? Yeah pretty much. It has you to give more information and tells you to call 911 if it is a medical emergency. 

Anything that stands out: No it is basic stuff. How they will contact you, when they will contact you and information for why they are contacting you. 
What do you expect after you click submit: I think I will tell you when they call you back and maybe who will call you back.

When do you expect a call back: Within four hours depending on when you tell them that you want them to call. 
If you submit now at 220pm ES, you expect a call back within 4hour: Knowing the VA and they normally close at 3pm. Not until tomorrow.
When do you think the 4 hour window takes place: Probably in the morning. 
What do you think will happen if you specify the timeframe: That they would call you back within one of those timeframes. 
Who would call: Like I said a nurse or doctor.
How would you feel if you received a call form a scheduler first: Unless they decided that it could not be handled with telehealth I would be irritated.

Is this what you expected: Yes.
Enough information: Yes, it tells you your information, who your doctor is. It does not say who is going to be calling. It does say healthcare provider so I would not expect a scheduler to call me unless they decided a telehealth appointment would not work.  

- [in prototype: show scheduling list screen] Imagine you are signed into your account, want to make an appointment, and you see this appointment scheduling screen. From this list, walk me through how you would try to be seen today for something, virtually: Express care.

  - Why did you choose this option?: It says if you are experiencing symptoms you can have an express care appointment prior to going to the VA or ER. They also have the same day telehealth screening at the bottom. 

  - Based on the type of care description, what do you think will happen?

    - Was it clear to you that this is a screening before an actual appointment? Yes, it has before going to the clinic, er or urgent care.

    - Was it clear to you that this is not an in-person appointment?  Yes


- [in prototype: show Express Care scheduling screen] (Click continue from scheduling list screen) This is the Express Care request screen. What do you expect will happen once you submit this form?

  - Who do you think you will speak with? Probably a nurse. 

## Section 4: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today? Yes. 
  Why: I personally rather deal with the computer than with the people calling or trying to wait for a response from the securing messaging because they do not always check it right away. This I think would be checked because they call you back for the appointments. 
  Faster than secure messaging: Yes
  How long does it take for a response for secure messaging: It depends someone is the same day and sometimes a week. IF I do not hear back I will message again or call.
  How often: A lot. I know they are busy and have a lot of patients. 

  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? Yes. 

- Do you think VA has resources appointments available to help you if you are experiencing symptoms or may be suffering from coronavirus? I would hope so. 
  Have you seen any: Yes. I honestly have not paid it so much attention because there are messages form everyone. I am staying at home mostly. 
  Comfortable going back to normal office visiting or continue with this.: This would be useful in the future; I have a lot of grandkids and this is much easier than taking them all with me for an appointment.
