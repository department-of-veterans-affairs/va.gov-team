# Express Care: Participant 05

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I would like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 0: Warm-up questions

Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you aware of any forms of Telehealth appointments offered by VA providers? 
What is telehealth: I used it the other day for my appointment. It is fairly good; it is like getting services for veterans that cannot get out now. It is video conferences for medical reasons. 

Same day care: For in person appointments, call in the morning and get an appointment that day. For telehealth I have not done it yet.
Urgent care: I would just go to the ER and I would not do telehealth or urgent care. 
 Any urgent issues that you use telehealth: I have a brain tumor so I have to get MRIâ€™s. I do not know that if once they read them, I am comfortable to talk to the neurologist to talk through it. For follow-ups it would be good but not first time appointments. It also depends on circumstances. 

 - If NO: What do you think it might be?

## Section 1: Value of VA urgent Telehealth

- Have you ever used Telehealth appointments?
    - Was this with a VA provider or non-VA doctor? Through the VA. I used it with my phone. 
        - If VA: How did you schedule your appointment 
    - Was this a same-day appointment?
    - Can you tell me a bit more about your experience? I have a standing every 2 weeks for the oncology social worker, I cannot get out and she has gotten access for telehealth so she sends me an email and I click on it. It is like sitting there with her and it was really great. 
Express care for the VA: No I have not.
What do you think it might be: Its like an express care, like getting oil change. Like an in and out service.
In person or virtual: I think it could be either way. I would prefer it to be in person but if it is just a cold they can just tell me what to take. 
Urgent care or telehealth from VA: No I have not heard of it.
Do you think they offer it: I think they would and they probably do and should. Especially right now due to the circumstances. Then again go to the VA in Providence RI and they only have 15 doctors for all veterans so it is hard to get your doctor on the line. 
How do you schedule the appointment: They call me. Like the MRi is on the 19th and they call me , somedays I may go online to schedule. I normally use that for refilling medication. 
Is that myhealthevet: Yes
Do you use secure messaging: Yes, once or twice.

## Section 2: Scheduling expectations

- Do you consider "same-day" or "urgent care" the same thing as scheduling an appointment? No. If I woke up and was sick and call in I would not think of it as an appointment. I think of schedule like at a later date.
Scheduled appointment : It is like you make plans for it. 


    - How would you schedule this type of care appointment? I think any of it. Like if I have a cold. If I have a seizure I cannot do telehealth I have to go to the ER. I have called a few times for sore throats and normal needs. If they cannot give me a same day they discuss going to urgent care and it is close to me and they would pay the bill. I did not know that until I found out that they pay for it. I do not want to pay for medical services if I do not need to

- Can you tell me what types of urgent care you might seek through VA's same-day Telehealth appointments? 

- Who do you expect to speak with for an urgent same-day VA Telehealth appointment? Probably my doctors nurse. Every doctor has a PA that makes appointments. I would call them .
Someone on your Care team: Yes.
 What if they were not on your care team: I would probably call the call center for them to get in contact with me. Then if that does not happen I would call the medical director of the hospital because he knows me. 

## Section 3: [Prototype](https://invis.io/3PWYUFVAVQU)

Next, we are going to take a look at a prototype. We have stripped away a lot of the webpage to focus on specific information, so it may look and feel different than what you are familiar with on VA.gov. As I mentioned earlier, this is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it is a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- Take a moment to look at what you see on your screen. Read through the information aloud and talk through what you are seeing.  The top portion is straight forward. It is requesting an emergency screening. I do not like the 4 hours; I think that is probably a little to long. That is what it is. I guess it is the standard time, especially if you go into the ER that 4 hours will look like 30 minutes. The second portion for VA appointments is good, I see the appointments and it has pending appointments. That is incredibly helpful, sometimes when they call I forget unless it is on my calendar. I get to see what appointments are scheduled. I would be able to cancel from here as well. I had an MRI scheduled than I got transferred. They called me when I transferred, I like I can cancel from here. 


- [in prototype: show appointments screen] Imagine you have signed into your account on VA.gov and you see your appointments page. Where would you go to make a same-day urgent Telehealth appointment? Request express screening.
What do you expect to happen: I would expect it to gather personal information and what the situation is.
 
 - Is that what you expected to happen? Yes. 
I would place my symptoms, the number to call and the time to call. This is pretty straight forward.

4 hour window and best time to call: They are 4 hour blocks.
Do you feel like: It is good that it is 8 to 8. So divided by 4 and you have morning, afternoon, and evening. 
Request at noon, would it change when they call: IF you clicked noon at noon, they should call at by 4pm and if not I hope they would call in the evening. Not the next day.
Even when they said they would call within 4 hours: Right.
Expectations for same day telehealth appointments: I think so. It is pretty impressive to me.
Who do you think will call back: The nurse PA not the doctor but one of his staff.
What if it was a scheduler: That is acceptable to. 
Even if you talk to someone within 4 hours: As long as they have an appointment for me that would be okay. 

Is this what you expected to happen when requested it: yes. My information on the right side, basically the way I like it would have my PMC there. 

Based on PMC information, do you expect them to call: I would expect that but probably not. It would be someone on his staff or a scheduler. 

- [in prototype: show scheduling list screen] Imagine you are signed into your account, want to make an appointment, and you see this appointment scheduling screen. From this list, walk me through how you would try to be seen today for something, virtually.   If I needed social work for a same day I would click on same day telehealth, if it were my foot I would click on podiatry, for a psychiatrist I would click mental health. If I have symptoms of COVID-19 I would click on express care. If experiences symptoms you can do an express screening prior to going to the clinic. Same day and telehealth is the same as express. I would go with express. 

  - Why did you choose this option? Express, you think fast. Same day you can do it at 8am or until 6pm. Within the same 24 hour care I think same day, with express I think within a short amount of time. That is my thought. 
 

    - Was it clear to you that this is a screening before an actual appointment? Yes. 

    - Was it clear to you that this is not an in-person appointment?  So same day telehealth would be a virtual. Express care, you would want to put telehealth in the title. If I just look at it this way I think I will get an in person appointment but if I look at same day I see telehealth. I would like to see express care telehealth screening. 

    - Who do you think you will get a call from? (Clarify: a provider or a scheduler?)  If I look at express care I would think a nurse. If I look at the same day, just a scheduler. 

## Section 4: Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- After learning more about Express Care, would you consider it if you were in need of an appointment, today? Yes, I would.

  - Would you use consider using this kind of screening tool if you were experiencing symptoms of coronavirus? Yes, I would. 

- Do you think VA has resources appointments available to help you if you are experiencing symptoms or may be suffering from coronavirus? I would hope so. 
Do you think you will feel comfortable once we return to the state of normal: Yes, I love the VA in Provence and want to get back into my routine. 

- Do you have any comments or questions about Express Care that we have not yet covered today?  No, I think it looks really good and I cannot wait for them to roll it out. I would list the type of care you need. Yes, the new appointments I would probably put in a lot more.

Explain: oncology ,neurooncologist. I have to see the neurologist for the medicine. If I am getting dizzy I just need to reach out the oncologist. 

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
