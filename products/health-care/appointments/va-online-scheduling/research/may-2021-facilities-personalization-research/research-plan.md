# Facilities personalization research plan [DRAFT]

## Goals	

Our overall goal is to improve completion of the VA facility selection step. We believe that Veterans see facilities where they currently receive care will be able to complete this step **faster and more often** than Veterans who do not.

Our research goals are 
- Better understand the language Veterans use around facilities
- Learn how much control and knowledge veterans have, and expect to be provided, about their registered facilities
- Discover Veteran needs around scheduling tied to facility selection that will help us personalize this experience

### What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This research is a collaboration between two products/teams:
- Profile "My VA health facilities", Authenticated Experience
- Choose your VA health facility, VA Online Scheduling

### Background	

The VAOS (online scheduling) tool allows Veterans to make an appointment at all of the facilities at which they're registered, but Veterans are frustrated because being registered at a facility doesn't mean they are currently receiving care there. Veterans are still considered registered at facilities where they used to receive — but no longer receive — care, and at some facilities for reasons other than having ever been a patient. Therefore, Veterans see facilities in VAOS that they don't go to, and they do not understand why they are being asked to make appointments at facilities they don't go to. This has resulted in a considerable amount of complaints. 

The Authenticated Experience MVP will add functionality to VA.gov profile to allow Veterans to set their facility preferences, which will in turn inform the list of options Veterans see when they use VAOS to schedule an appointment online. User goals, business goals, and assumptions are listed in the [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/preferred-facility/README.md)

The VAOS MVP will allow Veterans to save facilities where they regularly receive care, so they can quickly select those facilities when they schedule health care appointments.

### Our approach

We'll run an interview + usability study to get feedback from Veterans, and validate two flows:
- From profile to VAOS
- from VAOS to profile

We'll show half of the participants will a the flow starting at the profile; the other half will start at VAOS.

## Hypotheses

We believe that Veterans will understand that "saving a facility" (language still TBD) in VAOS means they will be able to choose that facility more easily the next time they schedule.

We believe that Veterans will find value in being able to manually control which facilities they currently go to.

We believe that Veterans will find value in seeing which facilities they recently visited.

## Research questions

| Research question | Interview question(s) |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| How do Veterans think about facilities where they currently receive care, compared to those where they are registered? | - Where do you generally receive VA care? <br> - Where are you registered to receive care? <br> - (If they don't know) How would you expect to find out where you're registered? |
| How often do Veterans go to different facilities for the same type of care? Different types of care? | Do you go to the same facility for all of your medical appointments? |

| Research question | Concept test question | Section | Notes |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Does a Veteran see value in the ability to manually change the facilities where they currently receive care? Or do they expect VA to "just know" this information? | | Profile-first / Facility list | |
| How might a Veteran expect to use facility information outside of scheduling? | In what situations would you want to know this information, outside of scheduling appointments? | Profile-first / Facility list |
| Do Veterans expect to be able to manage facilities in their list when scheduling? | | VAOS-first - Facility selection pages |
| Do Veterans understand the "My VA facilities" section outside of the VAOS context | | Profile-first - MY VA facilities" |




## Participants

### Primary criteria
- Must have VA health care

### Secondary criteria
- Ideal to test with Veterans who have visited multiple VA facilities (maybe even in multiple states, and over many years - e.g. had health care through the VA for X+ years? Interestingly if we add a year/timeframe criteria like that we will automatically get an older population)
