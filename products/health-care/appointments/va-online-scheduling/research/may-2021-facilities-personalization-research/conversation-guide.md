Intro - 5 minutes
-----------------

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Peter Russo/Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We're looking to understand how Veterans choose VA health facilities. Today, I'd like to hear about your experience with getting health care at VA health facilities, and go through a prototype of an online scheduling tool to get your thoughts on it.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about one hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

-   You'll be interacting with a demo tool. It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

-   We like to use recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

-   First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?

-   Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.

If phone:

-   OK great. When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. 

-   If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show.

-   The buttons are Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?

-   First I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the arrow that says "Share content" and hit "share screen". Select that button. You should be prompted with an option to share "Zoom" and then "Screen". Then select "Start Broadcast". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.

-   Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application.

-   Great, now I can see your phone screen! We are going to use this prototype in our session today. I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments.

If can't share

-   Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:

-   Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok? [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

Warm-up Questions (all participants)
------------------------------------

Today we're interested in learning about the places Veterans receive health care.

So where do you currently receive health care, VA or otherwise?

-   Do you have other options for where to receive care?

    -   If YES: why do you go to (facility you mentioned)?

    -   If YES: why do you go to other locations?

    -   If NO: would you like other options? If so, why?

-   Have you ever changed where you receive VA health care?

    -   If YES: why?

-   How many different VA locations have you gone to for care?

    -   If more than one: why do you go to some of the other locations? ```comment: This question works well if they are going to multiple facilities currently, but if they say that they have gone to more than one location b/c they moved or something in the question before this, this question doesn't make sense. However, it might be worth asking them directly in a separate question if they currently go to more than one VA facility for care. Be preapred - You may get answers like CBOCs and main facilities, which isn't quite what you're looking for. ```

    -   Does anything stop you from going to a different location that might be better suited to your needs? ```comment: Are you looking for VA specific here, or all health care? May need to specify.``` 

_Listen for:_ 

-   What are the reasons they go to different locations? 

-   Any language around preferences - what do they like, and how do they describe it 

-   Any mention of "registered" facilities

Concept test intro (all participants)
-------------------------------------

Thank you, that's very helpful!

Now I'd like to switch gears and get your thoughts on the demo tool I talked about earlier.

As I mentioned, some areas of the demo tool will be clickable, and some will not. Some things may not work as expected. If anything catches you by surprise, please let me know as we're going through the tool.

*Ask to screen share*

Thanks!

What we're going to do is run through a series of tasks in an imaginary scenario. As you're going through these tasks, it's most helpful if you say what's on your mind. Your thoughts and feelings will help us make this better for all Veterans.

Scenario 1 - opt-out flow (50% of participants)
-----------------------------------------------

[Prototype - opt-out flow](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/console/share/BX2JRZTUR2)

*Last year*, you moved to a new city, Evanston Illinois _from Seattle_. You're interested in setting up a follow-up visit with your primary care doctor there. ```comment: see suggested addition of 'last year' and  'Seattle.' In this question you may need to establish that they have already been to a primary care doctor. My first read on this was ' if i just moved, i won't have a doctor there.' Additionally since they will see Evanston and Seattle in this list, you should set that up for them.```

### Task 1 - review facility list in VAOS

*Start on VA.gov home page* ```comment: what is your plan if they do not go to VAOS?```

Using VA.gov, show me how you would set up a Primary Care visit with your ~new~ doctor in Evanston.

**PAUSE on VAOS facilities page**

-   What is this page asking you to do?

-   What facilities would you expect to see here if this was based on your information? ```Comment: i'm struggling with phrasing on this question. Cut the "in real life".```

    -   Why would you expect to see those ```facilities``` _here_? 

-   Let's say you don't expect that you'll return to that Seattle facility again because it's so far away. Have you ever experienced this at the VA, i.e. when you moved and changed facilities? ```Cut "in real life" - this is their real life, and that is why you are talking to them. May need to add a bit more context to the "this" in the "have you ever experienced this at VA?"``` 

    -   If these were your facilities and you saw one in a city you hadn't lived in for 10 years, what would you do?

_If needed:_ click the link with the dashed underline, then click the Profile link. 

_Watch for:_

-   Where do they expect to go first?

-   Any challenges to navigating the profile?

-   Any challenges navigating to the Your VA Health Facilities section via the profile navigation?

-   When they list the facilities they'd expect to see there if they were doing it in real life:

    -   Do they list EVERYWHERE they're registered?

    -   OR only the places they currently receive care?

### Task 2 - review facility list in Profile

*Start on Profile - Your VA health facilities*

-   What is this page telling you?

-   How would you use the information in this list?

    -   What do you think the VA is using this information for?

-   What do you think "Edit" does?

-   If this was your list of facilities, which facilities would be listed?

-   How would you add a facility in your list that isn't currently there?

    -   Thinking about your current facilities, have you ever run into a similar situation when being able to edit your facility list might have been helpful?

_Watch for:_

-   Do they naturally connect this with the list they saw in VAOS?

-   Does the edit functionality meet their expectations?

-   What did they think about how the list is sorted?

-   Any comments about the "schedule appointment" link.

### Task 3 - manage facilities in Profile

*Start on Profile - Your VA health facilities*

Back to our fictional scenario, let's say you are only planning on going to Evanston and Lakeside clinics for right now. 

-   If this was your list of facilities, would you do anything here?

-   Let's say you do want to make this list reflect your current situation. How would you do that here?

_After changing the list:_

-   What do you think this change did?

    -   What's unclear about what this change did, if anything?

    -   What's helpful about being able to make this change, if anything?

-   If this was your list of facilities, can you think of a situation where you'd like to change them in this kind of way?

_Watch for:_

-   Did editing the list do what they expected it to do?

-   Are they able to easily make the facility changes?

-   Any confusion around "unchecking" to mark a facility as not current?

-   Did they understand what happened to the facilities they unchecked? 

### Task 4 - schedule an appointment

*Start on Profile -Your VA health facilities (updated)*

-   Now that you've changed your facilities, you want to schedule that primary care appointment. How would you do that from here?

**PAUSE on VAOS facilities page**

-   Tell me about this page.

**CONTINUE Finish scheduling**

Follow-up questions (if not answered during run-through):

-   Choose facility page:

    -   What is the "Your VA health facilities" section showing?

    -   What about the "Recently visited" section?

    -   What are your thoughts about these options?

    -   What's confusing about this page?

    -   What's helpful, if anything?

*Watch for:*

-   Do they expect to be able to schedule appointments from Profile?

    -   Do they find the link at the top?

    -   Do they try to take other paths before the link?

-   Do they connect "Your VA health facilities" in VAOS with the same list in Profile?

-   How do they feel about the facilities list 

### Task 5 - schedule by phone

*Start on VAOS - confirmation page*

While you're looking at this list you remember that you also need to make an eye care appointment at the Evanston VA. 

-   How would you do that from here?

*Follow-up questions (if not answered during run-through):*

-   What was different about the list of facilities that time?

-   (On phone list) What would you do next?

*Watch for:*

-   Do they find the "New appointment" link?

-   How do they react when their facility isn't listed?

### Task 6 - find facilities list in Profile

_Start on VA.gov home page_

-   Finally, how would you find your list of facilities from here?

-   Now, show me what you'd do if you wanted to update your address.

*Watch for:*

-   Was the list where they expected it?

-   Were there any navigation challenges?

    -   Specifically moving around the Profile using the mobile menu.

-   Did they connect that list with their profile?

Scenario 2 - opt-in flow (50% of participants)
----------------------------------------------

[Prototype - Opt-in flow](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/console/share/BX2JRZTUR2/621669703)

Last year, you moved to a new city, Evanston Illinois from Seattle, Washington. You're interested in setting up a follow-up visit with your primary care doctor there.

### Task 1 - save a facility

*Starting on VA.gov home*

Using VA.gov, show me how you would set up a Primary Care visit with your new doctor in Evanston.

**PAUSE on (or return to) VAOS facilities page**

-   What is this page asking you to do?

-   What facilities would you expect to see here if this was based on your information?

    -   Why would you expect to see those there?

-   Let's say you don't expect that you'll return to that Seattle facility again because it's so far away. Have you experienced something similar (see changes above)?

    -   If these were your facilities and you saw one in a city you hadn't lived in for 10 years, what would you do?

**CONTINUE to save facility**

*Follow-up questions (if not answered during run-through):*

-   What did you expect "Save your facility" would do?

-   If you wanted to see your saved facilities at some point in the future, where would you go to find them?

*Watch for:*

-   Any challenges to finding the scheduling link from home

-   Expectations around "Save facility" page

-   Any indication that they notice the facility list only shows those that allow online scheduling

-   When they list the facilities they'd expect to see there if they were doing it :

    -   Do they list EVERYWHERE they're registered? 

    -   OR only the places they currently receive care?

### Task 2 - schedule at saved facilities

*Starting on confirmation page*

Back to our fictional scenario, imagine that you want to see your mental health provider at the Evanston Clinic on the same day so you don't have to make multiple trips. 

-   How would you do that from here?

*Follow-up questions (if not answered during run-through):*

On the "Choose a facility" page:

-   What is the "Your VA health facilities" section showing?

-   What about the "Recently visited" section?

-   What are your thoughts about these options?

    -   What's confusing about this page?

    -   What's helpful, if anything?

*Watch for:*

-   Do they connect "save a facility" with the facilities that show on the new page?

### Task 3 - review facility list in Profile

*Start on confirmation page*

Earlier we talked about saving facilities and your expectations around that. Can you show me how you'd find your list of facilities? 

*on Profile - Your VA health facilities*

-   What is this page telling you?

-   How would you use the information in this list?

    -   What do you think the VA is using this information for?

-   What do you think "Edit" does?

-   If this was your list of facilities, what would be listed?

-   How would you get a facility in your list that isn't currently there?

    -   Thinking about your current facilities, have you ever run into a similar situation where this might have been helpful?

*Watch for:*

-   Do they naturally connect this with the list they saw in VAOS?

-   Does the edit functionality meet their expectations?

-   What did they think about how the list is sorted?

-   Any comments about the "schedule appointment" link.

### Task 4 - manage facilities in profile

    -   What's unclear about what this change did, if anything?

    -   What's helpful about being able to make this change, if anything?

-   If this was your list of facilities, can you think of a situation where you'd like to change them in this kind of way?

_Watch for:_

-   Did editing the list do what they expected it to do?

-   Are they able to easily make the facility changes?

-   Any confusion around "unchecking" to mark a facility as not current?

-   Did they understand what happened to the facilities they unchecked? 

### Task 5 - schedule by phone

_Starting on Profile facilities page_

Back to our imaginary scenario, you decide you want to schedule an eye and vision care appointment on the same day and at the same facility as your other two appointments. 

-   How would you do that from here?

_Follow-up questions (if not answered during run-through): _

-   Why wasn't your saved facility showing in the list? 

-   (On phone list) What would you do next?

_Watch for:_

-   Do they find the "New appointment" link?

Wrap-up questions (all participants)
------------------------------------

-   Tell me about the difference between being registered at a facility and receiving care at a facility.

    -   _(If they don't know what registered means)_ Just to help us understand how to use that word better, what would you guess it means? There are no wrong answers.

    -  _ After answer:_ When you first go to a facility, the VA notes that you receive care there. [Fill this out a bit]

-   Do you know at which facilities you're currently registered to receive VA care?

    -   (If they don't know) How would you expect to find out where you're registered?

    -   Would this be useful to you?

Thank-You and Closing
---------------------

Thank you for working through that with me. I just have a few more questions before we break:

-   Is there any other feedback you would like to share?

-   Do you have any other questions for me?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
