## Intro - 5 minutes   

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Peter Russo and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We're looking to understand Veteran's how Veterans choose VA health facilities. Today, I'd like to hear about your experience with getting health care at VA health facilities, and go through a prototype of an online scheduling tool to get your thoughts on it.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [TBD].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **You'll be interacting with a demo tool.** It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- We like to use recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
    
*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

- First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?

    - Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.
    
**If phone:**
- OK great. When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?

- First I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the arrow that says "Share content" and hit "share screen". Select that button. You should be prompted with an option to share "Zoom" and then "Screen". Then select "Start Broadcast". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.

- Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application.

- Great, now I can see your phone screen! We are going to use this prototype in our session today. I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments.

**If can't share**
- Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
[Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

## Warm-up Questions

Today we're interested in learning about the places Veterans receive health care.

So where do you currently receive health care, VA or otherwise?
- Do you have other options for where to receive care? 
   - YES why do you go to (facility you mentioned)?
   - YES why do you go to other locations?
   - NO would you like other options? If so, why?

- Have you changed where you receive VA health care recently?

*Listen for: 
 What are the reasons they go to different locations?
 Any language around preferences - what do they like, and how do they describe it
 Any mention of "registered" facilities*

## Concept test intro

Thank you, that's very helpful!

Now I'd like to switch gears and get your thoughts on the demo tool I talked about earlier.

*Ask to screen share*

## Scenario 1 - profile - first flow (50% of participants)

[Prototype - profile-first flow](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/console/share/BX2JRZTUR2)

You recently moved to a new city, Evanston Illinois. You had one appointment at the VA health facility there, and would like to find out where else you are registered for VA health care. [Stay away from "registered" language here?]

### Task 1 - find facilities list in Profile

*Start on VA.gov home page*

Where would go to find out which facilities the VA thinks you currently receive health care?

*Watch for:*
* Where do they expect to go first?
* Any challenges to navigating the profile
* Does the edit function surprise them/is it unexpected?

*Follow up questions (if not answered during run-through):*
* Tell me about this list of facilities - what do you think they are for?
* Does it feel like anything is missing from this list? Facilities or other information?
* If this was your list of facilities, what would be listed?
   * Tell me about a time you might have wanted to change that list.
* What do you expect "Edit" to do?

### Task - manage facilities in Profile

As we said, you recently moved to Evanston Illinois. Let's say you currently only schedule appointments at the Evanston and Lakeside VA clinics. How would you make this list reflect that?

*Watch for:
* Are they able to easily make the facility changes?

*Follow-up questions (if not answered during run-through):* 
* Did the edit button do what you expected?
* What do you think this change did?
* If this was your list of facilities, can you think of a situation where you'd like to change them in this way?

### Task  - schedule an appointment

*On Your VA health facilities page*

Back to our fictional scenario, imagine that, while looking at this list, you remember you need to schedule a check-up with your regular VA doctor at the Evanston Clinic. How would you do that?

*Watch for:*
* Do they expect to be able to schedule appointments from here?
* Do they find the link at the top? 
* Do they try to take other paths before the link?
* Do they connect "Your VA Health Vacilities" in VAOS with the same list in Profile?

*Follow-up questions (if not answered during run-through):*
* (Choose facility page)
    * What are the two facilities in "Your VA Health Facilities" showing?
    * What about the "Recently visited" section?
    * Thinking about your own experience finding a facility when scheduling, what would change if you had these options?
    * What's confusing about this page, if anything?
    * What's helpful?

### Task - schedule by phone

*On modified VA facilites list*

While you're looking at this list you remember that you need to schedule an eye appointment at the Evanston VA. How would you do that from here?

*Watch for*
* Frustration

*Follow-up questions (if not answered during run-through):*
    * Why wasn't your saved facility showing in the list?
    * (On phone list) What would you do next?

## Scenario 2 - scheduling-first flow (50% of participants)

[Prototype - Scheduling first flow](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/console/share/BX2JRZTUR2/621669703)

You recently moved to a new city, Evanston Illinois. You're interested in scheduling a follow-up visit with your primary care doctor. 

### Task - save a facility

*Starting on VA.gov home* 

How would you schedule a primary care appointment online from here?

*Watch for*
* Any challenges to finding scheduling link from home
* Expectations around "Save facility" page

*Follow-up questions (if not answered during run-through):*
* Facility list - imagine this was your list of facilities - which would you expect to see here?
* What do you expect "Save your facility" would do?

### Task - schedule at saved facilities

*Starting on confirmation page*

Back to our fictional scenario, imagine that you want to schedule mental a health appointment at the Evanston Clinic on the same day so you can get a couple of appointments done at once. How would you do that from here?

*Watch for*
* Do they connect "save a facility" with the facilities that show on this page?

*Follow-up questions (if not answered during run-through):*
 (Choose facility page)
    * What is the facility in "Your VA Health Facilities" showing?
    * What about the "Recently visited" section?
    * Thinking about your own experience finding a facility when scheduling, what would change if you had these options?
    * What's confusing about this page, if anything?
    * What's helpful?

### Task - manage facilities in Profile

*Starting on confirmation page*

As we said, you recently moved to Evanston Illinois. Let's say you currently schedule appointments at the Evanston and Lakeside VA clinics, and you'd like to update your saved facilities to include Lakeside. How would you expect to do that?

*Watch for:*
* Where, or at what point in the process, do they expect to be able to make the changes?
* Does the path to profile make sense
* Are they able to easily make the facility changes?
* Does the edit function surprise them/is it unexpected?

*Follow up questions (if not answered during run-through):*
* Tell me about this list of facilities - what do you think they are for?
* Does it feel like anything is missing from this list? Facilities or other information?
* If this was your list of facilities, what would be listed?
   * Tell me about a time you might have wanted to change that list.
* * Did the edit button do what you expected?
* What do you think this change did?
* If this was your list of facilities, can you think of a situation where you'd like to change them in this way?


### Task - schedule by phone

*Starting on Profile facilities page*

Back to our imaginary scenary, you decide you want to schedule an eye and vision care appointment on the same day and at the same facility as your other two appointments. How would you do that from here?

*Watch for*
* Frustration

*Follow-up questions (if not answered during run-through):*
    * Why wasn't your saved facility showing in the list?
    * (On phone list) What would you do next?

## Wrap-up questions

Do you know at which facilities you're currently registered to receive VA care?
* (If they don't know) How would you expect to find out where you're registered?
* (If they don't know what registered means [TBD])


## Thank-You and Closing

Thank you for working through that with me. I just have a few more questions before we break:

* Is there any other feedback you would like to share?
* Do you have any other questions for me?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
