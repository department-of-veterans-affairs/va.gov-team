# Research - a personalized facilities list

The completion rate for the facility selection page is 72% (as of April, 2021). This page shows every facility a Veteran has registered at, and may include many where Veterans don’t currently receive care. We believe that if we surface only the facilities where the Veteran currently receives care, the resulting reduction of noise on the page will help Veterans find a facility more easily, and faster.

This research is a collaboration between VAOS and the Authenticated Experience team.
