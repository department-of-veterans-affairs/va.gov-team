## Documented Decisions and Frequently Asked Questions

### Why can veterans only self-schedule into clinics that they've been seen at within the last 24 months?
- Many facility + care type combinations have an overwhelming numbr of clinic options. Furthermore, many of these clinics are confusing to veterans, because they're not consistently named in a way that's useful to veterans or even written in plain english.
- Certain clinics have specific uses that aren't obvious to veterans (for example, for new patients only), so opening up all available clinics for self-scheduling for everyone results in many cancelled or rescheduled appointments.

### Legacy VAOS includes a messaging dashboard to facilitate back-and-forth chats between veterans and schedulers. Why does the redesigned VAOS not have this feature?
- In usability testing, veterans were confused by the different communication options they have for their VA healthcare, and tended to think that messaging is done through Secure Messaging.
- Most veterans used the 'message a scheduler' feature to communicate more details about the appointment request or medical condition, and didn't expect to have bidirectional convrsations through the interface.
- The redesigned VAOS tool allows veterans to submit one message to a scheduler within the flow of creating an appointment request, and they can also see that message repeated back to them later in their pending appointments list.

### Why does the veteran not select an appointment cancellation reason?
- There are only three possible cancellation reasons that a veteran can select in the legacy application. In usability testing, veterans were confused by the three options and what the information was being used for at the VA.
- Of the three options, the 'unable to keep appointment' cancellation reason is sufficiently broad to accurately encompass most specific reasons that a veteran may use to cancel an appointment.
- Upon doing discovery into these cancellation reasons, the redesign team found the data to not be used for anything or reported on at any level. Thus, the team opted to simplify the veteran experience by removing the question.
- The 'unable to keep appointment' reason, if available for a facility, is auto-filled when cancelling.

### Can you track who cancelled an appointment (VA vs. veteran)
- Not currently, though we have heard from veterans and schedulers that it is frustrating to have the VA cancel an appointment, and similarly from schedulers that it's important to know whether the VA or a veteran cancelled a given appointment.
- Legacy VAOS does not have this capability either.

### Why is the facility timezone used when displaying appointment times to veterans?
- Veterans may be booked to receive care in a timezone that isn't their own residential timezone. In these instances, it is more useful to tell the veteran what time their appointment is in relation to the location of the appointment, since they will need to physically be in the facility's timezone at the time of the appointment.

### Why are you not using the standard Forms chapter progress bar in the VAOS appointment form?
- Because the flow of the form is so forked depending on which options you select. It isn't really a linear booking process that maps cleanly to the concept of progressing through different chapters.

### What type of 'add to calendar' action is triggered when someone clicks that link from their confirmation page?
- ??? .ical?

### How far in the past will appointments be pulled to determine available self-schedule clinics?
- 24 months (confirm with Jeff, may be 12 months presently).

### How would a veteran be blocked from excessive no-shows?
- Just as with legacy VAOS, there is no mechanism to 'turn off' someone's ability to use VAOS based on count of no-shows.
- Through discussion with Shawn Adams, this situation is annoying when it arises but is actually quite rare.

### How are 'registered VA systems' derived?
- ?? Presumably some VA system has a list of system IDs and associated ICNs
- The data source and logic for this is not being updated and should work the same as legacy VAOS

### Why 'confirmed appointment' and 'pending appointment request'
- ?? Lauren / Ryan

### Why is there not an 'office hours' question in the request flow?
- Because veterans are already signifying their preferred appointment dates and general times (am / pm), this question is redundant.

### Can a veteran change their residntial address that's used in the CCE calculation?
- Not currently, though we are exploring post-MVP enhancements to the CCE experience

### Why are 'nutrition' and 'podiatry' not Community Care types of care?
- Because CCE API (which is the API that the redesigned VAOS ultimately uses to check CC eligibility) is not currently able to check CC eligibility for these two types of care. This functionality is roughly expected in December, and VAOS will be updated as soon as those types of care are functional in CCEP API.

### The legacy VAOS application has a modal when you start it that tells you to not use VAOS for urgent care - why does the redesigned application not have this?
- The redesighned application has several similar prompts that are more contextual.
  - On the static page preceding the application (va.gov/heatlh-care/schedule-view-va-appiontments), there is an alert banner on the page noting that veterans should contact a care provider through other means if they have an urgent issue.
  - A red Veterans Crisis Line button is present on every page on VA.gov
  - Depending on the date choices a veteran makes within the self-schedule flow, conditional alerts let them know that there may be faster means of getting care.
  
### The legacy VAOS application has a 'hamburger menu' that allows veterans to update their email / phone contact info, as well as opt in / out of notifications. Why doesn't the redesigned application have this menu?
- VA.gov includes a centralized account prefrences hub that spans all tools and intgrates with VA-adopted 'source of truth' databases / systems to ensure that all veteran information is consolidated and up-to-date.
- While diting contact prefrences for an individual request is not possible in the MVP, veterans still have the ability to provide an email and phone of their choosing while scheduling / requesting to schedule an appointment.
- Post-MVP discovery work is needed on improving notifications overall because veterans don't currently find them useful. As part of this work, the redesign team will consider options for how best to integrate notification preferences into VA.gov's account infrastructure.

### The legacy VAOS application has a link to a user manual. Why doesn't the redesigned application have a manual?
- The manual is baked into the application, in the sense that actions that users can take are explained in plain language within the flow of the application itself. The scheduling flow is set up as a step-by-step wizard specifically to reduce cognitive overhead for veterans and eliminate confusion about what to do.

### How can veterans submit feedback about the new tool?
- A ForeSee survey will show to veterans on the confirmation page, once they complete their appointment scheduling process.

### Why does the new application not have a 'call before booking' option like the legacy application does?
- Because all veterans should receive a phone call before their appointment is finalized in order to reduce miscommunication / missd appointments and improve veteran satisfaction.
- The front end will auto-submit this option for all appointment requests

### Why does the new application not have a 'send me updates' option?
- Because appointment-level notification preferences are not editable, we have opted to send updates to all veterans so that no communication from the VA is missed.
- The alternative would have been to not send anyone updates, which would be a bad experience.

### The email and phone number contact information is being prefilled for veterans; where is this information coming from?
- Data is taken from the veteran's account preferences on VA.gov, which generally tie into Vet360.
- Phone numbers are mobile when available, or home when no mobile provided.

### Does changing email / phone in the appointment booking flow update the veteran's profile?
- No, it does not update their VA.gov / vet360 contact info. This is stated to vetrans on the contact info page as well.

### Why is there no facility info in the appointments list and other similar places?
- Facility details come from a separate endpoint that is not integrated into VAOS presently. The team is working to integrate this data source in order to show a richer variety of data about facilities to veterans.

### What's the maximum number of requests & appointments that a veteran can make?
- Request maximum is based on a facility's settings
- No maximum for self-scheduled appointments, just like legacy VAOS

### Why is there no 'prepare for appointment' in the appointment list?
- The content information is duplicative of the information contained both within the flow of the app as well as the individual facility pages.
- The full-fledged 'prepare for appointment' that's on legacy Staging isn't in production in legacy VAOS, so it was deemed to be out of scope for the redesign MVP.
- The redesign team is aware of important 'appointment information' that schedulers pass along to veterans through this field and is exploring integrating it into the appointment views.

### Why is 'express care' not a type of care that is offered through the new VAOS?
- The redesign team did discovery work on express care and found that it was more of a care modality than a specfic / separate type of care.
- Veterans were consistently confused by 'express care' in usability testing.
- ?? Lauren / Ryan - integration of express care isn't off the table, but needs more discovery

### Why do healthcare systems on the system selection page not show a state like legacy VAOS?
- VA healthcare systems may be spread across multiple states, so showing a state isn't necessarily accurate.

### Are 'resolved / no schedule' appointment requests displayed?
- No, the filtering in the new application mirrors the legacy VAOS application, which similarly does not include resolved appointments.

### Why does the new VAOS tool not ask for a preferred location for a CC appointment?
- Veterans have the ability to enter preferred provider contact info if they have a specific provider they'd like to see.
- We are usign the veteran's residential vet360 address to assume that they want to be seen somewhere near where they live, which should line up with their CC eligibility data.
