# VAR Baseline Research Overview
Usbaility sessions were conducted between 10/24/17 - 10/31/2017 with Veterans to better understand the content and process related to scheduling an appointment at VA. Users were asked questions about their knowledge and current expectations related to scheduling an appointment at VA as well as asked to complete several tasks:
- Show and/or your current process for scheduling an appointment at VA
- Evaluate new MHV logged-out content (prototype)
- Evaluate new MHV logged-in content (prototype)
- Evaluate new Vets.gov content (prototype)
