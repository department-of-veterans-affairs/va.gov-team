## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME], and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We are here today to look at one of the VA's online scheduling tools. We'll take a look at some pages together to better understand what parts of the site are easy to use, and what parts are unclear or difficult. 

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.    
- We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
- I’ll be recording the screen activities and audio as we look at the site, so that we capture your experience accurately. Only my screen and our conversation will be recorded--video will not be in use. 
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

The first thing I'd like to ask you to do is to login to your My HealtheVet Premium account, if you have one. 
  - If yes, take them through task 1. 
  
  - If no: "That's ok. Do you happen to have a DS Logon Premium account?" If YES to DSLogon Premium, take them to  [Online scheduling home](https://veteran.mobile.va.gov/wayf/v1/index.html?redirect_uri=/var/v4/&scope=VETERAN) and ask them to login. Skip Task 1.
  
  - If no to DS Logon Premium, take them to [Online Scheduling Home](https://veteran.mobile.va.gov/wayf/v1/index.html?redirect_uri=/var/v4/&scope=VETERAN) and login under MHV as User ID: MHVOED01 (not case sensitive); Pass: Vetsg@01. Skip Task 1. 

Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. *Start audio and screen recording.*

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes 

*Based on takeaways from discoverability sessions, we may want to change our focus for these questions.*

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- Have you heard anything about online scheduling at the VA?  
- Have you tried to use the VA's online scheduling tool?

One note before we begin, while we are making real appointments, we will be sure to remove them before the end. Nothing in your record or appointments will channge. Is that ok?

## First Task: MHV premium account access to VAR - 5 minutes
*Purpose*: We want to learn about current MHV premium account holders' ability to locate and access the online scheduling tool. 

*Prompt*: Imagine you want to make a primary care appointment online using your My HealtheVet Premium account. How would you do this?
Please talk aloud as you navigate. It is helpful for us to hear your thought process as you explore. Help us understand why you decide to click on different links, what you expect to have happen, and if anything is unexpected or confusing.  

*Stop user when they reach the VAR homepage*

*If users struggle to locate the VAR application links let them explore a few minutes, then stop them*

*If user is confused by the eligibility criteria and disclaimers leading into VAR and determines that is the wrong path stop them, ask:*
- What did you think about the guidance provided around scheduling an appointment?
- What would you have done if I had not stopped you?

### Follow-Up Questions
- Do you think that you will be able to schedule an appointment online?
  - Is your facility participating in online scheduling?
  - Do you meet the eligibility criteria for previous appointments?

## Second Task: Create a new appointment - 10 minutes
*Purpose*: We want to see if the user can accomplish the main purpose of the online scheduling tool, schedule a new appointment online.

*Prompt*: For this next activity, pretend you need to schedule an appointment to see your primary care physician for your annual physical. Make the appointment in February 2018. Please remember to talk aloud as you interact with the tool to help us follow your thought process.

*If they cannot find their clinic or the type does not allow for online scheduling and the participant stops:*
- Its ok if your clinic does not appear, please select a diffent clinic 
- Its ok if the type does not allow for online scheulding, please try another apointment type

- What were your expectations for scheduling a new appointment? How does this compare to other ways that you have tried to schedule an appointment at VA in the past? 
- How would you rate the time it took to schedule an appointment, using a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is much shorter than expected and 5 is much longer than expected? 
- Using a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the easiest, and 5 is the most difficult, how would you describe your experience scheduling that appointment?
- [esp if user answers 3-5 in question above] Was there anything you found particulary confusing about this process?

- Can you explain to me the difference between scheduling an appointment and making an appointment request?
- When would you use the appointment request?

## Third Task: Create an appointment request - 10 minutes
*Purpose*: We need to know if users can differentiate between appointment requests and online scheduling, then see if they can complete the steps to put in a request. Additionally, we need to know if they understand the next steps, after a request has been submitted.
