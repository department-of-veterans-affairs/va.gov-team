~~Where we'd like to be with VEText by December 31, 2017~~ 

## This is no longer the plan. See [Project Notes]() for the latest.

- Know who the project owner is and delineate their role v.s. ours.
- ~~Have a signed one page security risk acceptance document~~ **I don't think this should be our approach. Thoughts?**
- Have a plan for getting VEText into the VistA ATO
- Have a coherent argument re: privacy concerns using commercial EHR comparisons

## Plan to get there
* Week of Nov 13:
    - [X] Build slides comparing commercial EHRs appointment reminders. 
    - [X] Research PII/PHI implications of desired contents of VEText reminders: According to HIPAA, it's definitely PHI. 
    - [X] Chat with Aaron about who the current CISO is and what including VEText in the VistA ATO would look like.
    - [ ] Draft one page security risk acceptance document. 
    - [ ] Find an answer re: VistA Re-engineering timing.
    - [X] Brief Chris J. on our efforts thus far (10am 11/17). 
* Week of Nov 20: *Thanksgiving.* 
    - [ ] Start collaboration with OHI re: IT/Non-IT forms
    - [ ] Determine pathway to signature for the document: CISO, Head of VHA, CIO. 
        - [ ] Schedule any calls necessary to socialize it. 
    - [ ] Brief Charles on slides comparing commercial EHR appointment reminders.
        - [ ] Determine if we need a statistcal analysis to evaluate the security risk of the date, time, and clinic name together.
    - [ ] Refine one page security risk acceptance document.
* Week of Nov 27: 
    - [ ] Have an answer re: VEText ownership from Dr. Evans. 
    - [ ] Get risk acceptance one pager finalized.
* Week of Dec 4: 
    - [ ] Get risk acceptance one pager signed. 
    - [ ] Develop privacy argument using commercial EHR comparison. It looks likes the HIPAA Privacy Rule (ยง 164.502 Uses and disclosures of  protected health information:  General rules.) Allows for the disclosure of PHI to the individual so...fingers-crossed, I think we have a rock-solid argument that once security risks are accepted by the relevant VA people, privacy is not an issue according to HIPAA itself. 
* Week of Dec 11: *Last week most VA partners are likely to be in the office full time.* 
    - [ ] Refine and finalize privacy argument. 
    - [ ] Float this argument to Stephania Griffin.
* Week of Dec 18: 
    - [ ] Deal with emerging issues and chase down outstanding items.
* Week of Dec 25: *Christmas and New Year's.* 
    - [ ] Evaluate current standing and plan for first 6 weeks of 2018.
