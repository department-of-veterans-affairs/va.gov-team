## Calls with Mark Bulson, Contracting SME, VHA Innovation Program
*Outstanding questions and Action Items moved [here]()*

### 9th November 2017: Marvo, Mark

1. ATO
* Both Rob and Shane have wanted to avoid doing an ATO, but Mark (and his boss) thinks it's inevitable and that getting one by attaching VEText to VistA would be the best path forward.
* Mark Cecil is the current VistA owner and is not keen on this idea. However, VistA is going to national ownership, so the person we'll need to work with is John Short. Mark suggests asking John Short if VistA ownership is going national, and if so, when.
* We discussed the chicken and egg issue with the PoAM and ATO and Mark indicated that the only productive path forward would be DSVA getting a high-level person to command that it move forward. I asked if there were any other options, but apparently that's the path so I shared that we want to have a bullet-proof package to present to said high-level official so they are confident in issuing that command.  

2. Commercial EHRs

* Mark hasn't had any luck getting details about the Cerner and Epic installs. He did some Google Image searches and found that while a number of the example SMS messages from clinicians included both clinic and date name, it was apparent that they also struggle with providing enough information to be helpful while not running afoul of privacy and security laws.
* Learned through a personal contact that Epic includes both date and clinic in messages. However, he's unsure if this is via third-party like Twilio or if the messages come directly from Epic.
* Analogy with postcards VA currrently sends out, might be an additional piece of evidence to support more informative text messages.

3. Other items

* Mark said that Dr. Neil Evans is looking into the privacy issue, but that we will have to do some digging ourselves. 
* Parallel effort (not for distribution): VISN7 will be implementing VEText and approached Mark for assistance. He will proceed with helping them, (funds will come from teh Innovations Network) rather than waiting for the national solution and figures this will provide additional data about the benefits of VEText.


### 6th November 2017: Alex, Marvo, Mark

Mark chatted with Dr. Neil Evans (VHA - Connected Care Chief) last week. Concluded that VEText is the right path forward, however Mark cannot do a lot on contracting before we know where the funding is coming from.
IT/Non-IT Board determines flavor of money. 
**Determining this is the next logical step.**

Mark is of the opinion that adding VEText to VistA ATO is the best way to go. *Related emails from Rob and Shane (VEText SMEs), indicate they are concerned this will lead VEText into an OIT black hole.*

New FISMA Guidance shared with Alex by Dr. Evans indicates that with the right approvals (CIO and ISO) and acceptance of the risk, security concerns are not a barrier.

Need to have ATO before PoAM.
