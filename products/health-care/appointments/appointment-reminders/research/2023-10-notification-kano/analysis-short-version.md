## Research Goals

The Appointments team is exploring ways to enhance future appointment reminders, which play a vital role in the authenticated experience for Veterans managing their health. Veterans rely on various types of notifications to stay on top of their appointments, while staff at VA facilities use different systems to send out these reminders. This can lead to issues such as excessive, missing, or inconsistent reminders for the same appointment. Previous research has shown that these systems are not well integrated, highlighting the need for a more streamlined approach, which will require further technical investigation. This research aims to understand Veterans' preferences regarding appointment reminders and related tasks, helping our team prioritize which types of reminders should be developed and tested first.

## Research Questions

- Which types of appointment reminders are most and least helpful for Veterans?
- What formats (text, email, phone call, or push notifications) do Veterans prefer for different types of reminders?
- How do Veterans feel about receiving appointment reminders and related notifications?

## Methodology 

We conducted an unmoderated Kano study using Optimal Workshop, where participants were invited via email. Upon accepting the invitation, Veterans and caregivers received a link to a survey with 20-25 questions, designed to take less than 15 minutes to complete. We received completed responses from 63 Veterans, divided into 7 distinct cohorts (fewer than 10 participants per cohort, as per PRA guidelines). Each cohort accessed the study through a unique URL. The surveys were completed remotely and asynchronously.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- Veterans will have a clear opinion on the value of each reminder.
    - MAYBE TRUE. While respondents were able to indicate their preferences for each reminder, it's difficult to gauge how they would actually think and feel about these reminders in real-life situations. Their opinions may also vary based on personal needs; for instance, someone who has never been referred to a different provider may not be able to provide a fully informed opinion on referral reminders.
      
- For a straightforward appointment (without canceling, rescheduling, or other difficulties), Veterans only need 4 notifications. They include a reminder with pre-check-in questions, check-in, AVS, and money-related (e.g., copay and travel pay) notifications.
    - NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. Our team may need to make decisions on a case-by-case basis. While this might apply to Veterans with straightforward appointments (without cancellations, rescheduling, or other complications), the study alone doesn't provide enough insight into whether Veterans want all types of reminders.
      
- Veterans expect to receive email, text, and phone call notifications. The modality of communication they prefer will be a personal preference.
    - FALSE. The result shows Veterans have reminder modality preferences for each reminder. 

## Key Finding
