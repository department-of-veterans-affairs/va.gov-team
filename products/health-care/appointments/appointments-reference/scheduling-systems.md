VA is transitioning to a new electronic health record (EHR) system — the software that stores health information and tracks all aspects of patient care — over a 10-year period scheduled to end in 2028. The new system connects VA medical facilities with the Department of Defense, the U.S. Coast Guard and participating community care providers, allowing clinicians to easily access a Veteran’s full medical history in one location. VA’s Office of Electronic Health Record Modernization (OEHRM) manages deployment of the new system. (1)

Virtual Care Manager (VCM)
Virtual Care Manager enables clinicians to create*, view, and join video visits and create group visits. With Virtual Care Manager, it is easy to invite Veterans' family or caregivers, as well as additional VA staff, to video visits.(1)

## VIA

## VistA
AKA “Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture”
A health information system deployed across all veteran care sites in the United States. VISTA provides clinical, administrative, and financial functions for all of the 1700+ hospitals and clinics of the Veterans Health Administration[1] VISTA consists of 180 clinical, financial, and administrative applications integrated within a single transactional database [1].

In May, 2018, the VA awarded a contract to Cerner Corp to replace VistA with the commercial off-the-shelf EHR, Cerner Millenium. Pilot implementations took place in the fall of 2020, and by November, 24 million veteran health records had been migrated to the new platform. The projected completion for migration of all VA sites is 2028. [2]

## VistA Scheduling Enhancements 

`VSE`, `VSE GUI`

VSE GUI is a software module that allows schedulers to make appointments quickly by
viewing multiple appointment request types and multiple clinics in one screen. A scheduler
can easily view patient requests for service, find the next available open appointment, view
the provider’s availability in multiple clinics, and track a patient’s appointment process.
