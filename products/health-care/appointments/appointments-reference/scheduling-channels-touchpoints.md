# Channels and touchpoints for scheduling and managing appointments [WIP]

This documents touchpoints where a Veteran may schedule and manage health care appointments through VA or Community Care. These touchpoints provide ways to complete tasks such as:

* Scheduling or requesting appointments
* Finding information about an appointment's status or details
* Managing appointments
* Checking in to appointments
* Participating in appointments

Touchpoints are organized by the channels through which they can be accessed. Quotes from relevant research are included to help provide context around Veteran attitudes toward individual touchpoints or channels.

Half of the participants prefer to make appointments in person.There was no larger theme here, but some of the unique points included:
- Two mentioned that it was sometimes more convenient to walk in to schedule than call.
- Another said they liked to make their follow up appointments with the scheduler at the facility right after they completed an appointment.

### Research notes

7 of 8 participants shared a negative perception of calling the VA - [Facilities personalization research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/may-2021-facilities-personalization-research/research-findings.md#half-of-the-participants-preferred-to-schedule-appointments-through-a-combination-of-secure-messenger-and-in-person)

* 2 of the 8 participants said they would prefer to schedule over the phone. 
    * One explained they preferred to schedule over the phone because they believe the person on the other end can be more flexible, and better able to adapt to their needs, than an automated system.
    * The other  worked at VA and explained they could schedule their appointments without needing to call or go online, so the preference was just a guess. They did expect calling would be difficult

## CH: Text/SMS

* 2 of the 8 participants expected that they would prefer to schedule by text, though they hadn't done so. Both related positive experiences with non-VA systems, like checking in to online order pickups via text message. Those participants expected that text scheduling would require less of a wait than calling on the phone (due to decreased staff at VA), or having to navigate a phone tree.

Participants expected the following benefits from scheduling online:
- Able to schedule at any time, not limited to the hours of the location.
- Able to plan by looking at their personal calendar, without feeling rushed as they might by a phone or text exchange.
- Avoid navigating a phone call to VA that would involve long wait times and difficult to understand menus.
- Able to print a physical record of the appointment that could act as reminder and confirmation once they arrived.

Some of the potential detriments to scheduling online included:
- Some participants reported confusion about appointment requests as they read through the content on the static landing page
- Some participants said they didn't trust the appointment information presented in MHE was updated regularly.

### TP: MyHealtheVet appointments

### TP: MyHealtheVet secure messaging

Over the course of the sessions, four participants told us they start with secure messaging their health care provider. There was no common reason as to why they prefer secure messaging, but individual reasons that came up were:
- Easily able to access records of communication
- More convenient and less painful than calling to schedule
- More accessible for those with disabilities
