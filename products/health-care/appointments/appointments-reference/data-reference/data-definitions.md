#### Video Visit Preparation

Example of data that comes back from VCM in the `patientInstruction field`:

```
Before your appointment:
- If you're using an iPad or iPhone for your appointment, you'll need to download the [VA Video Connect iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/va-video-connect/id1224250949?mt=8) beforehand. If you're using any other device, you don't need to download any software or app before your appointment.
- You'll need to have access to a web camera and microphone. You can use an external camera and microphone if your device doesn't have one.

To connect to your Virtual Meeting Room at the appointment time, click the "Join session" button on this page or the link that's in your confirmation email.

To have the best possible video experience, we recommend you:
- Connect to your video appointment from a quiet, private, and well-lighted location
- Check to ensure you have a strong Internet connection before your appointment
- Connect to your appointment using a Wi-Fi network if using your mobile phone, rather than your cellular data network

```

Example of how data is hardcoded in VAOS  `if (instructionsType === VIDEO_VISIT_PREPARATION)`:

```
  {
    return (
      <div>
        <h4 className="vads-u-font-size--base vads-u-font-family--sans">

          <li>
            You'll need to have access to a web camera and microphone. You can

        <ul>
          <li>
            Connect to your video appointment from a quiet, private, and

      </div>
    );
  }
```

#### Medication Review

Example of data that comes back from VCM in the `patientInstruction field`:

```
Medication review

During your video appointment, your provider will want to review all the medications, vitamins, herbs, and supplements you're taking â€” no matter if you got them from another provider, VA clinic, or local store.

Please be ready to talk about your medications during your video visit to ensure you're getting the best and safest care possible.
```

Example of how data is hardcoded in VAOS `if (instructionsType === MEDICATION_REVIEW)`:

```
 {
    return (
      <div>
        <h4 className="vads-u-font-size--base vads-u-font-family--sans">
          Medication review
        </h4>
        <p>
          During your video appointment, your provider will want to review all
          the medications, vitamins, herbs, and supplements you're taking
          &mdash; no matter if you got them from another provider, VA clinic, or
          local store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be ready to talk about your medications during your video visit
          to ensure you're getting the best and safest care possible.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
```

### Preferred Facility Information


#### Preferred Facility Name


#### Preferred Facility Address


#### Preferred Facility Phone Number


### Preferred Modality


### Requested Type of Care

### Veteran Contact Information


### Veteran Reason for Appointment


## Community Care Booked Appointments


### Appointment Date and Time

The day and time of the appointment. May be in the future or the past. The time displayed is in the facility's time zone.

### Type of Care


### Provider Name

VAOS Display Requirements:
- Frontend recieves the HSRM "Service Requested" data in the `practitioners:` field for community care. 

### Treatment Specialty

VAOS Display Requirements:
- Front End receives the HSRM "Service Requested" data in the `serviceType` for community care.  HSRM "Service Requested" maps to CPRS/CTB Standard Episode of Care field which would be too cryptic for the user. So for now Type of Care is not being displayed for CC appointments and instead provider name is displaying.
