#### Instructions: Prepare for Telehealth Visit

VAOS displays these instructions via `comment` field for `home video` and `atlas` appointments. The `comment` field contains instructions passed from Virtual care Manager (VCM). Right now, VAOS only accepts/support 2 types of instructions ('Video Visit Preparation' & 'Medication Review' instructions) due to limitations in the way data is passed to us in that field.Video visit instructions from Virtual Care Manager (VCM) instructions are suppressed if the instructions are any of the following:
  - `Message sent in MyHealtheVet`
  - `Resources Mailed to Patient`
  - `Signup for My HealtheVet  Message` 

##### Video Visit Preparation - Video at home

```
Before your appointment:
- If you're using an iPad or iPhone for your appointment, you'll need to download the VA Video Connect iOS app (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/va-video-connect/id1224250949?mt=8) beforehand. If you're using any other device, you don't need to download any software or app before your appointment.
- You'll need to have access to a web camera and microphone. You can use an external camera and microphone if your device doesn't have one.

To connect to your Virtual Meeting Room at the appointment time, click the "Join session" button on this page or the link that's in your confirmation email.

To have the best possible video experience, we recommend you:
- Connect to your video appointment from a quiet, private, and well-lighted location
- Check to ensure you have a strong Internet connection before your appointment
- Connect to your appointment using a Wi-Fi network if using your mobile phone, rather than your cellular data network

```

##### Medication Review - ATLAS

```
Medication review
During your video appointment, your provider will want to review all the medications, vitamins, herbs, and supplements you're taking — no matter if you got them from another provider, VA clinic, or local store.
Please be ready to talk about your medications during your video visit to ensure you're getting the best and safest care possible.

- Type of Care for VA appointments must be set to the `serviceType` except if any of the following are true:  
  - `serviceType` is `NULL`, Front End will set type of care to ‘VA appointment’.
  - `serviceCategory` is other than `regular`, Front End will set type of care to ‘VA appointment’. 
      - Note, Backend sets the `serviceType` when the stop codes from the remote procedure call match VATS service type (VAT or CCM stop codes).  

- Type of Care may not be available for phone appointments and video appointments from Virtual Care Manager (VCM) and/or Telehealth Management Platform.

**Technical notes:**

Treatment Specialty: Front End receives the HSRM "Service Requested" data in the `serviceType` for community care.  HSRM "Service Requested" maps to CPRS/CTB Standard Episode of Care field which would be too cryptic for the user. So for now Type of Care is not being displayed for CC appointments and instead provider name is displaying.
