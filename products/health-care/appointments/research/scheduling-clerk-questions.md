General Process Questions

-   What's the process you go through when someone requests an appointment?
-   What information do you see from the VAOS request? Of that information, what do you use? What is helpful?
-   What else would be helpful to ask veterans but isn't in our prototypes?
-   If you could change anything about what VAOS tells you about requests, what would it be?

Provider-based scheduling

-   We've seen in our testing that veterans think PC doctors / relationship doctors would be in the provider flow we've prototypes. Is it reasonable based on facility-level business rules (must have been seen within last x months) for us to say that we could show all available providers?
-   Could we surface community care providers?
-   What happens when someone requests an appointment with a provider via Secure Messaging? Where does that request go and how do you fulfill it?

Express Care

-   Tell us everything you can about Express Care :)
-   Is EC always a video / telehealth visit?
-   Is EC always with a member of your PACT?
-   Is there a difference between an Express Care appointment and a telehealth appointment with your PACT for Primary Care?
-   Is it always same-day? How far in advance can you book & cancel
-   How do you fulfill an Express Care appointment request?
-   Is it true that you need a PACT in order to book an EC appointment?
-   Are there any other eligibility requirements for EC? How do you ensure someone is eligible?

Clinics

-   What specific inputs do you get from veterans selecting a clinic in direct scheduling?
-   What are the params that are relevant when setting up a clinic?

Direct Scheduling

-   Does the reason for coming in / care type make a difference in the allotted duration of an appointment?
-   What happens when a veteran books herself into the wrong clinic?
-   What is your workflow when someone direct-schedules? Is there follow-up / clean-up work that you need to do to ensure the appointment was booked directly?
