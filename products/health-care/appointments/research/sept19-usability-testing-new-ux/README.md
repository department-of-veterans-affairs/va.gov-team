This folder contains the research materials for the user research studies on VAOS usability from September 2019. The team was asked to deliver direct schedule, VA request, and community care request flows by November 2019. 


# Study 1 (Sept 9-13) 
Study 1 covered the new community care and VA request flow to account for ux changes as a result of the new drive time API calls.

Research questions included:
- RQ1: How does our strategy of "only showing Veterans options that they have" work within VAOS work w/r/t user flow?
- RQ2. Are users aware of VAOS?
- RQ3: What is the user's "goal" or "mental process" for scheduling an appointment?
- RQ4: Do the new user interface components introduce any pain points or confusion?
- RQ5: What content is needed to facilitate decision support at key moments in the appointment scheduling process?

# Study 2 (Sept 25-30) 
Study 2 covered rigid and semi-rigid self-schedule flows, messages, and appointment canceling.

Research questions included:
- Are Veterans receptive to a choice-architecture approach of limiting self-schedule only to a clinic where a user last booked (within a set time frame for a type of care)?
- How do Veterans make a choice about self-scheduling when faced with a complex list of clinics?
- Is the date and time selection tool intuitive?
- How much detail (which data fields) are useful to a Veteran w/r/t their appointments?
- Do users find the messaging field helpful? 
- Is the cancelling process intuitive? 
- Do Veterans want to see cancelled appointments inline with other confirmed/pending appointments, or separate?
- What content is needed to facilitate decision support at key moments in the appointment scheduling process?

## Future studies needed
Future studies will need to cover the provider flow, express care, messaging, and accessibility + usability issues with the direct schedule flow.
