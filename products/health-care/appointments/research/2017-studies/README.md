# Research Planning for Online Scheduling

## Why

**1. What product are we testing?**
[Here is VAOS](https://mobile.va.gov/app/veteran-appointment-request)
The application formerly known as VAR; now: VA Online Scheduling Tool or VAOS.

**2. Goals: what do we want to know? Why do you want us to do this research?**
Broadly, we are looking to do research in two phases. 
- **Discoverability: Phase I** 
1) How do Veterans currently schedule appointments at the VA?  
2) Do users understand the new content around online scheduling? 
3) Using the new content, are they able to determine if they are eligible to use self-scheduling tools? 
- **Accessibility and Usability Phase II** 
1) Using new user flows: are Veterans able to find the self-scheduling tool?
2) If Veterans are eligible to use the tool, are they able to login to it? 
3) Once Veterans login to the tool, can they successfully schedule an appointment? 
4) Do Veterans understand the difference between requesting and scheduling appointments? 
5) Are Veterans able to successfully cancel or modify appointments? 

Across these phases, we are also interested in:
- What barriers do Veterans hit along the discoverability/login/scheduling journey? 
- What else do Veterans wish they knew about online scheduling? 
- When would they want that information? 

**3. Primer: what is the background on this question? What would a new person on the team need to know about this page/section/benefit/question?** 
*Include previous research, outside examples, information on the section/benefit in question*

There are a number of good GitHub Issues with background on this issue. 
- [Preliminary overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/preliminary-overview.md)
- [Comprehensive scheduling overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/comprehensive-scheduling-overview.md)

**4. Universe of possibilities: what can be changed as a result of this research? What cannot be touched? What are the sensitivities around this question?**

This research will help clarify the way forward with online scheduling at the VA. Currently, the online scheduling tool is under-utilized. By improving discoverability and accessiblity to this tool, we are hoping to see an increase in its use. If the tool continues to not work for Veterans, this research will help inform the way forward to a better solution.

This tool is supported and managed by many different stakeholder teams. However, it is a high priority for the VA. 

**5. Success: what information will you want to have from this testing? What knowledge will make you feel like the research process has been successful? Is task completion time important**

We want to understand how people discover, access, and use the online scheduling tool to schedule/request appointments. 

Phase I. We need to know how people currently schedule appointments at the VA. We want to understand the way they go about searching for this information, what stumbling blocks they hit along the discover-login-use flow, and if they are able to understand content around scheduling & eligibility requirements. Task completion time is not as important as ability to navigate new flows and understand content. 

**6. Urgency: is there a deadline by which we would like to complete this research?** 
October 27 for Phase I
December 6 for Phase II

**7. Availability: when would you like sessions scheduled?**
*Please list exact dates and times.* ASAP? We need this research complete by end of October. 
Want 5-6 total participants, MHV or DS logon premium users, who are at VAR participating facilities.

*Research team scheduling policies:*

- *Issues should be submitted for recruiting at least 2 weeks before desired start date*
- *No more than 3 hours of research in one day*
- *No more than 2 consecutive hours of research*

*Please request enough dates and time slots accordingly*.

**7. Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your conversation guide.**

**8. Please indicate a date after sessions are completed for a debrief.**

## Who

### Participants and Recruitment

**9. Participant criteria: what are you looking for in a participant?**

Please be as specific as possible. ex. What benefits do they use? How often do they go online? How often do they use VA services online?

- Patients seeking primary care provider or mental health appointments
- Must be currently enrolled in health care, registered at a facility, and assigned a care team
- MHV Premium account or DS Logon Premium account

**10. Recruitment: In addition to pulling from the Cohorts database, are there other places (facebook groups, meetups, stakeholders, etc.) or people we should contact to find participants specific to this project?**

**11. Will the sessions be remote, in-person, or mix?**

## Lessons Learned from Research

**Reframer**
- If you are looking at multiple pages in a task, need to code each task.
- Having verbatim notes was really helpful! 
- Put that entire transcript in Reframer: you never know what will be important. 
- Treat Reframer process like a qualitative content analysis. Create a codebook and keep int updated, define each code, use codes consistently, and make sure all people involved in tagging are tagging consistently.
- Having two people tag to check each other's work was really helfpul. 

**Questions**
- Make sure not to ask leading questions. Some user responses may have been because they were looking for the right answer. 
- Users did not understand the line of questioning asking them to confirm if they could use the scheduler tool. It was meant to be a comprehension of eligibility requirements, not a question of their capability using an online tool that they haven't tried yet. 

**Study Design**
- Not being able to get into the online scheduling tool during the discoverability phase required us to shift our focus and direction of the study midstream. Need researcher to be closely involved with the project to be able to keep up with what is needed and make adjustments to study design. 
- Pilot user test several days in advance of running study to allow time to adjust as necessary. 
- Lots of rescheduling contributed likely to lots of no shows. 
- If possible, try to test content before it is going live, not as it is going live. This was a challenge in the discoverability phase due to unforeseen and unpreventable circumstances. 
- It might have been more helpful to do a before/after comparative content study as opposed to showing the users the same content on three different pages to test if each was helpful. By third page, users were overexposed to content and didn't understand that it was from three different user flows, so there were lots of comments about language being repetitive. 
- A content usability test is very different than a functionality usability test. We may want to look into study design options and considerations for each.
