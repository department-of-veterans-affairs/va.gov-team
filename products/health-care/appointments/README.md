# Executive Summary

## User Problem Statement
*Note: this problem statement is not final*  
A very small percentage of veteran appointments with VA Medical Centers are scheduled online. Other avenues for scheduling appointments like phone, secure messaging, reminder letters, and return to clinic orders can lead to clerical errors, miscommunications, and heavier burden for schedulers. The result is delayed appointments and frustration for veterans.

## Solution Goals

### Veterans
- Easily navigate to scheduling app and set up an appointment as a self-service
- Leverage the convenience of mobile accessibility for scheduling appointments
- Make it easier to interact with the VA

### Business
- Have a reliable success rate and uptime for online scheduling service so that support services can be used more effectively
- Reduce the number and frequency of manual scheduling errors
- Improve efficiency, spending less time on the phone booking and managing appointments
- Grow communication and trust between veterans and the VA

## Assumptions
- This scheduling tool will increase user adoption of online scheduling services
- Users prefer self-service to face-to-face interaction
- Appointment scheduling features should be consolidated / co-located rather than split across tools & platforms (Secure Messaging, etc.)
- Missed appointments are due to lack of reminders / updates (and not some other cause)
- Veteranâ€™s experience can be greatly improved through transparency and plain-language tweaks in the interface
- VA will be able to handle any influx in request volume that may stem from easier self-service Veteran experience

## Requirements and Constraints
- Legislation requires that certain features exist, and that those features have a specific set of functionality
- Backends may be swapped in the future (VistA -> Cerner), so APIs for self-scheduling may change in form & function in the future.

## Discovery Takeaways
[Initial prototype based on DSVA research](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/KSTFY798BU3#/screens)
