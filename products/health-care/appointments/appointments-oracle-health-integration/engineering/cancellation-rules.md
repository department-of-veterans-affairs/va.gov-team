# Appointment Cancellation Rules

This file details how the `vetsapi-patient-gateway` (VPG) service determines whether a given Appointment or appointment
request is cancellable by the patient.

An Appointment may be cancelled by the patient through VPG if it was returned from the service with the `cancellable`
field set to `true`.

```
GET /vpg/v1/patients/{icn}/appointments?...

{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "97ff00db-7d18-4baa-ad45-73b1db3335fd",
      ...
      "cancellable": "true"
    }
  ]
}
```

An Appointment may not be cancelled by the patient through VPG if it was returned with the `cancellable` field set to
`false`. If a VPG client attempts to cancel an Appointment that is not cancellable an HTTP 400 error will be returned.

The rules and logic to determine whether a given Appointment is cancellable by the patient is different for each EHR.

## Oracle Health (Cerner)

VAOS OH scheduling policies are located in and retrieved from the Cerner Terminology Policy Service (CTPS). These
policies are defined for each VAOS type of care and are analogous to the VATS policies defined for VAOS VistA scheduling.

### Appointment Requests

An OH Appointment request is cancellable by the patient, unless:

1. The Appointment status is not `proposed` (it hasn't been cancelled or booked yet).
2. The OH Millenium API indicates the Appointment is not cancellable
   ([Millenium reference](https://fhir.cerner.com/millennium/r4/base/workflow/appointment/#custom-extensions)). The
   reasons why an OH Appointment would have the `is-cancelable` extension set to true are unknown at this time.
3. The Appointment is classified as a VAOS type of care, and the CTPS policy for that type of care has cancellation of
   appointment requests disabled.
4. If the Appointment contains a Cerner 14249 scheduling appt type code that is configured as not schedulable.

### Booked Appointments

A booked OH Appointment is cancellable by the patient, unless:

1. The Appointment status is not `booked` (it hasn't been cancelled, checked-in, or completed yet).
2. The OH Millenium API indicates the Appointment is not cancellable
   ([Millenium reference](https://fhir.cerner.com/millennium/r4/base/workflow/appointment/#custom-extensions)). The
   reasons why an OH Appointment would have the `is-cancelable` extension set to true are unknown at this time.
3. The Appointment is classified as a VAOS type of care, and the CTPS policy for that type of care has cancellation of
   booked appointments disabled.
4. If the Appointment contains a Cerner 14249 scheduling appt type code that is configured as not schedulable.

## Accessing VistA Scheduling Policies

### Staging / SQA

Testers and developers can directly access all staging VAOS VistA type of care policies for a particular facility from a browser on the VA network:
https://veteran.apps-staging.va.gov/facilities/v2/scheduling/configurations/984GA

Replace 984GA with the desired VHA facility ID.

### Production

Testers and developers can directly access all production VAOS VistA type of care policies for a particular facility from a browser over the open internet:
https://veteran.apps.va.gov/facilities/v2/scheduling/configurations/984GA

Replace 984GA with the desired VHA facility ID.
