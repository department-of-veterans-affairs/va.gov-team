## 游늶 Previous Sprint Summary:
This sprint, we implemented VetsAPI support for creating new appointment requests at Oracle Health sites, including modifying the CES infrastructure to include business rules specific to Appointment creation.  Additionally, we upgraded the VetsAPI Patient Gateway (VPG) to refresh Oracle Health site configuration information at configurable intervals, which will serve to improve the reliability of our data.  The CES component was modified with a new endpoint that returns valid appointment cancellation reasons by site, and the documentation needed for production deployment was completed and submitted for review.  Lastly, a document detailing the business rules governing the cancellation of Appointments was created and uploaded to the `appointments-oracle-health-integration` github team area.
