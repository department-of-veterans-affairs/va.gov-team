Side thoughts: On the track delivery page, a participant thought that the tracking number link would redirect him to the delivery service site (ex. redirects to USPS). Gina is going to find out what that link goes to because the prototype is not cooperating. Might be better to take out the hyperlink and leave confirmation number as it is without confusing users OR actually redirect to service site.
