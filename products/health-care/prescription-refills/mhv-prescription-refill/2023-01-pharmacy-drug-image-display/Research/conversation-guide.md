# Drug Image Display Conversation Guide

## Introduction

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Harrison Amelang and [NOTETAKER’S NAME] will be taking notes for us today. I also have a couple of colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Before we get to them...

- **The entire session should take about 20 to 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran’s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You’ll be interacting with a prototype build.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it’s a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to make sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple additional observers during this session?**
  - If yes, admit observers.
  - If no, Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - Then, ask notetaker and observers to give a brief, on-camera introduction like their first name and position with VA.gov.
  - Once complete, ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: **Once I begin recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording*

- **I have started recording.** I’d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get setup, I will give you instructions on what to do. *[when ready]* I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen and then you will be able to control my screen. Ready?
  - After participant gains control, open landing page for prototype.
- Great! When you’re ready, go ahead and click on the ‘begin’ button and we can start our test. 

## Overview + First Task: [Refilling a prescription]

*[User should be looking at the prototype Refill VA Prescr iptions page]*

- Are you familiar with this page?
  - **If yes:** Tell me more about what you do on this page?
    - *Follow up questions should involve glossary, recognizing/using statuses, and tracking.*
    - How long have you been visiting this page?
  - **If no:** Take a moment to explore this page. What do you think you would this page for? *[Perigean should send us users who are familiar with this page]*
- Have you visited this page for anything other than refilling a prescription?
- Does your doctor ever fill prescriptions for you? Tell me about your experience with that.
  - *Many Veterans voiced never using the refill flow in previous research because their doctor would take care of ordering the prescriptions.*
- Please fill a prescription for the medication Cabergoline.
  - (Upon completion) How do you know you successfully submitted your refill?

### Things to watch out for:

- Is the Veteran proficient at filling a prescription?
  - Does the Veteran’s doctor normally fill prescriptions?
- Do Veterans reference calling a Pharmacy, using Secure Messaging, or other forms of communication with their healthcare team?
- How does the Veteran confirm if their refill submission was successful?

## Second Task [Opening Prescription Label Information]

- From this page, how would you look at the details for your prescription of Buspirone?
  - *If user is having trouble* For example, how could you tell me the expiration date for the prescription of Buspirone?

*[User should be on Medication Details page]*

- Have you ever visited the Medication Details page before?
  - **If yes:** Can you tell me why you open this details page?
    - *Follow up questions should involve understanding dates, statuses, and what Veterans feel is currently missing*
    - Tell me about what you do on this page.
      - *Does the Veteran then call healthcare team, go to google, etc?*
    - Is there anything on this page that seems out of place, or anything that you find odd that it’s there?
  - **If no:** What on this page seems especially helpful to you?
    - Is there anything missing from this page that you feel should be here?
- Before you click on anything, what stands out to you? What do you find to be helpful? Unnecessary?
- Can you tell me the Prescriber Name for this Buspirone?
  - *Veteran should open drop down.*
  - **If successful:** Thank you. Is the information in this drop down what you expected to see?
  - **If unsuccessful:** *Guide user to open Prescription Label Information and find Prescriber Name.*

### Things to look out for:

- Does the Veteran know how to open the drop down?
- Does the Veteran recognize the information under Prescription Label Information (makes the connection to their bottle)?
- If unsuccessful for any portion, why? Cognitive load? Navigation issues?

## Third Task [Opening Drug Image Display]

- Let’s pretend you just picked up a prescription for Buspirone. You think that the pills might look a little different than previous refills. What would you do to confirm that this new medication, though it looks different, is the correct medication for you?
  - **Successful:** Veteran opens Fill/Refill History and opens drug image for most recent refill and the refill before.

 ### Things to watch out for:

- Do Veterans recognize they can use a drug image display to confirm whether their medication is the correct drug?
- How many Veterans reach out to their healthcare team with questions?

## Post-Task Interview

- Go ahead and close all images and dropdowns.
- Now that you’ve spent some time on this new design for the Medication Details page, what are your thoughts? Questions? Concerns?
  - *Note: Are there any repeated concerns or questions?*

## Thank you and Closing

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
