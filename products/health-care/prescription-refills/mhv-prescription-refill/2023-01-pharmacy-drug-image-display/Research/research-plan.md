# Pharmacy Research Plan for Drug Image Display on My HealtheVet, January 2023

## Background

Providing Veterans with an image of their current medications (and previous refills within the lifespan of the prescription) can help Veterans feel confident they are taking the correct medication. Sometimes medications may suddenly look different but are in fact the same medication. For example, say a Veteran has been taking a medication that looks like a small white pill for several months. After a recent refill the Veteran notices the pills are now red and slightly larger. While the prescription hasn’t changed and the Veteran doesn’t need to change anything with regard to taking the pill, the new pills may worry Veterans into not taking their prescription or cause unnecessary confusion.

We hope that adding a drug image display field within the Medication Details page will ease any confusion and help Veterans trust the medications they are taking are correct. 

### OCTO Objectives

This research applies to multiple OCTO objectives including:

- Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov.
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

Measures to increase:

- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov.
- Usage of digital, self-service tools.

Measures to decrease:

- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution.

### Veteran Journey

- Taking care of my health.
- Engaging VA to access benefits and services.

## Research Goals

1. Evaluate drug image ease of use and navigability. 
1. Determine if the proposed design changes are helpful to Veteran’s experience on the Medication Details page.
1. Determine the purpose of Veteran’s visiting the Medication Details page, and what can be done to facilitate those needs. 

### Outcome

The proposed designs are significantly different from what is currently in production. Before such designs are implemented, proper testing to understand how Veterans feel about the proposed changes is critical to creating a satisfactory experience for Veterans. After determining Veteran’s response, next steps can be coordinated. 

### Research Questions

1. Can Veterans navigate the new designs of the Medication Details page and open the necessary drug images?
1. *In reference to what is currently in production:* Why do Veterans currently visit the Medication Details page? What actions do they take? Is there anything that is missing that Veterans wish they saw?
1. What do Veterans expect to see on the Medical Details page? How did Veterans respond to the drug image?
1. How do Veterans react to the new designs? What were the pain points?

### Hypothesis 

1. We believe that Veterans will be able to navigate through the new designs and easily access the drug image link.
1. We believe that Veterans will appreciate a new level of accuracy and record keeping of prescriptions. 

## Methodology

We will be conducting moderated, remote usability tests followed by some contextual inquiry. 

### Location

These tests will be conducted remotely via Zoom as scheduled by Perigean.
