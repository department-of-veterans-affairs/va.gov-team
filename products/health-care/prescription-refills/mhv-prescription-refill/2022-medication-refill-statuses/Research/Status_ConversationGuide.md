# **Conversation Guide: Rx Refill Status Usability Tests**

**Session setup**

These tests will be conducted in-person at the Mount Vernon, Washington VA clinic. Arienne Walters, Harrison Amelang, and Jessica Robertson will be conducting, moderating and taking notes during these tests.

**Introduction**

Hello! We are designers at My HealtheVet conducting research on your experience with filling prescriptions online.

Are you familiar with or use My HealtheVet?

- **If YES, continue. If NO, thank them for their time.**

Great! Do you or have you ever filled a prescription order through My HealtheVet?

- **If YES:**

We have some new designs that we'd love to hear Veteran's feedback on. Do you have a moment to look at these designs?

- **If YES, see below**.

Before we start there are a few things I want to mention.

- This session should take about 15 minutes.
- During this test, we want your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability, just the designs. We just want to improve these tools to better fit Veteran's needs. We will not be offended by any opinions you express and we welcome your feedback.
- You will be interacting with a prototype. While it might look real, you will notice it might not function how you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, others will not. Since it is just a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information.
- If for any reason at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- We will be taking notes during the test today, but recording what you do and say is especially helpful to be as accurate as possible. Do you mind if we record today? The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

**Getting set up**

You will be using an iPad to take this test. Are you familiar with iPads, touch screens and how they function?

- **iPad should already be ready for with the prototype and ready to start recording.**
- _ **Once user is established with the iPad, hit record.** _

Lets start with a few warm-up questions.

- Tell me a little more about your experience filling prescriptions on My HealtheVet?
- _Any other personal get-to-know-you questions to avoid steamrolling the user._
- _Introduce the demographics survey â€“ record their selections_

Great. Let's begin the test.

**Testing**

Please remember we are not testing you, we are testing the designs. We'd love to hear everything that comes to your mind while interacting with these designs. Tell us what you see, what you like, don't like, anything that quickly catches your eye, stuff like that.

1. **First screen is the Refill Prescriptions page with tags.**

Please take a look at the first screen. Can you tell me about what you're looking at?

TASK #1: You've just been given a new prescription from your doctor to fill. Tell me about your next steps.

TASK #2: You've just filled an order for MEDICATION X and are curious about the status of the refill. What can you tell me about your MEDICATION X refill?

(NOTE: 1-5 rating scale for tasks?)

Is what you're looking at what you expected to see? (Module containing the definition)

TASK #3: You've told me the refill status of MEDICATION X. Let's say a friend has a different status than any you see in the table right now. Can you tell me what you would do to find the status of the prescription your friend has?

2. **Tags, pop-ups Details Page**

TASK #1: Can you tell me what the expiration date is for MEDICATION Y?

Next, tell me about the page you're looking at.

- Further questions for user:
  - _Do you visit this page for your prescriptions? Why or why not? I want to know why people come to this page__._

What is the status for the prescription for MEDICATION Y?

Great. Please return to the Prescription Page.

SHOW USERS ONE OR BOTH DETAILS PAGES?

3. **Drop-down Details Page**

TASK #1: Your doctor is asking for the Prescription status for MEDICATION Z. What is the definition for the prescription status for MEDICATION Z?

**Thank you + closing**

Well thank you very much for your time today. Your feedback has been really helpful and helps us know how to make the site better for Veterans.
