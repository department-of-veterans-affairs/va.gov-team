# **Research Plan for Rx Refill Status and Details Page**

This research plan is being submitted on behalf of the Human Centered Design (HCD) team at By Light Professional IT Services. The team is currently engaged in the design of prescription refill statuses, their implementation, efficiency, and end-user satisfaction.

**Background**

- In the current design, prescription statuses and refill statuses are found in the VA Prescription page, but not in the prescription Details Page.
  - The definitions are often confusing for users.
  - Current design does not reflect upcoming designs from the My HealtheVet mobile, potentially creating more confusion.
- These designs are to replace the current iterations while simultaneously preparing for further integration between My HealtheVet and VA.gov in the future.

**OCTO Objectives**

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

**Veteran Journey**

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

**Research Goals**

1. Is the new 'tag' design intuitive, helpful and informational for Veterans?
  1. Can Veterans easily find and interact with the new 'tag' design on both the VA Prescription page and Prescription Details page (when available)?
  2. Do Veterans know they _can_ interact with tags, and do they know what to expect when interacting with the tags?
  3. Do the colors convey the necessary information for users, tipping them to priority, internal information, or guiding users in the correct direction?
  4. Is the new table layout in the VA Prescription page easier for users to navigate? What is the general response?
2. Is there a design that Veterans prefer on the Prescription Details page? If so, why?
  1. Are the tags noticeable and helpful?
  2. Why are Veterans visiting this page? Are we helping them with the current information? (Current information offered is reflective of Health and Benefits app research)
  3. How does the drop-down feature affect readability, interactivity?
  4. Is one design more intuitive than the other?

**Outcome**

Depending on Veteran response, the Prescription Details page and Refill Prescription table will be adjusted accordingly. These changes should be easily implemented into the next design phase and in preparation for the transition to VA.gov.

**Hypothesis**

We believe Veterans will appreciate the tag design and it's clarity, as well as the definitions found withing. Furthermore, we believe that Veterans will find the new Prescription Details page(s) to be more intuitive, helpful, and accessible.

**Methodology**

- **Research method**
  - We will be conducting in-person moderated observations and high-fidelity usability testing.
  - The user flow for these tests are short, so we will be relying on subjective responses rather than quantitative data. We will be conducting these tests in-person at the Mount Vernon, Washington VA clinic for ease of access, speed in which we can conduct these tests, and to get a better understanding of how Veterans interact with the new designs.
  - We will be testing using a small selection of high-fidelity screens – the VA Prescription Refill chart and Prescription Details page as well as pop-up modules.

**Location**

We are have been working with the coordinators with the Mount Vernon, Washington VA clinic to use their lobby for our tests.

- Address: 307 South 13th Street, Suite 200 Mount Vernon, Washington 98274
- Point(s) of contact:
  - Susan Haidary
  - Kazumi Cornell
  - OTHERS
- Equipment used:
  - iPad for Veterans to use during the test
  - Laptop for notetaking/recording if necessary
  - NOTE: this test will be examining a desktop prototype, not a mobile version

**Recruitment**

**Recruitment approach**

We will be looking for Veterans using the Mount Vernon, Washington clinic and who are willing to participate in the study. We would prefer to find users who are familiar with My HealtheVet and the Prescription Refill page and flow however this is not a hard criteria for this test.

**Recruitment criteria**

Testing is to be completed ASAP. Times are subject to change based on availability and planning. Testing should be completed over the course of one session.

- Monday December 5th 10:00am PST – 4:00pm PST

**Prepare**

- The prototype that will be used for testing will be completed by the end of the day on Friday, December 2nd.

**Length of sessions**

- Each test should take no more than 15 minutes maximum, while the entire session should take no longer than 6 hours.

**Team Roles**

Please list the people who will be serving in each role.  **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker**
