Last updated: 10/2021

- By Light UCD Team: research@bylight.com

### Initial Product Overview
Repetitive pages and information in MHV Pharmacy are causing confusion and extra steps for Veterans trying to complete tasks.

### The Solution Overview
Consolidating the repetitive pages and information into one comprehensive page (My Medication List), will help Veterans complete their pharmacy tasks in one place. Also, including a way to communicate any updates to the pharmacy module.

### Problem Statement
My HealtheVet users who utilize the pharmacy site to access their medication related data find the process of viewing and interacting with their medications confusing, cumbersome and time consuming, often resulting in page abandonment and help desk calls.

## Desired Outcomes

**For Users:**
-   Veterans should be able to view all their medications in one place.
-   Veterans should be able to refill their medications from the My Medications list page and table.
-   Veterans will be able to understand pharmacy terminology using the updated glossary of terms.
    

**For Business/Stakeholders:**
-   Consolidate duplicative pages such as VA Prescription History, and VA Medications List without disrupting the user. The system shall keep the navigation (left-hand and menu dropdown) intact and re-direct users to My Medications List.
-   Users with a Basic MHV Account: User will receive existing user-friendly error message when they select a page that includes VA data explaining that an Advanced or Premium Account is needed.
-   Users with an Advanced Account – Not VA Patient: User will receive existing user-friendly error message when they select a page that includes VA data explaining that the user must be a VA patient.
-   Because Veterans will be  able to find information and complete tasks on their own, there will be  less calls to the help desk.
-   Because the new model will be less confusing, cumbersome and time consuming, user satisfaction scores will increase, and bounce rate will decrease.
    

## Measuring Success

**Objective:**

Decrease Veteran confusion when searching multiple pages for prescription and medication information. 


**Key Results**
-   Less help desk calls
-   Less time on task
-   Less bounce rate
    
## Solution Approach

-   A new table design was implemented to include all medications removed from repetitive pages.
-   All prescription label information is now located in the table, allowing Veterans to easily distinguish multiple medications.
-   Because there was a clear lack of terminology understanding during user testing,  the UCD team suggests updating the glossary of terms, thus making it more accessible for Veterans.
-   Because Veterans wanted to be able to refill prescriptions from the same page, a new column was added to the table to accommodate hyperlinks, where Veterans can perform actions, such as refilling prescriptions.
-   During testing, Veterans voiced they would like to be notified of any changes surrounding the location where their medications will be listed. When prompted with a selection of notification options, Veterans unanimously agreed that a popup would be the best solution to this problem.
-   During testing it was determined that Veterans preferred to have a drop down to sort their medications rather than the radio buttons currently used on the page.

## Latest Production Status
- All prescriptions and medications are viewable on the My Medications list page.
- The ability to refill prescriptions from the My Medications list page has NOT been added (the refill checkboxes column), instead a button at the top of the page will take Veterans to the Prescription Refill page.
- The "I want to" column was added to the My Medications List table.
- A source filter dropdown was added to filter by medication type and another dropdown for medication status. (radio buttons were removed)
- Business decided to leave old pages on for 6 months with content explaining where they can go to see what was once on that page. After 6 months those pages will be removed.
