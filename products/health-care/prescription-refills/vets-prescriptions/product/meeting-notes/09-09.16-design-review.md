### Meeting attendees:  Theresa H., Tom Emmendorfer, ERic Spahn, Mike Valentino, Maureen Layden, Stacey, Kelly, Gina
Purpose: Finalize Design for iteration 1

- Glossary; they need to get us the exact definitions from Eric.
- Eric Spahn@All: Fill Date â€“ For an Active prescription, the Fill Date is the date that the prescription was last refilled. Otherwise, the Fill Date means the next possible refill date. If a prescription has never been refilled, the Fill Date is the date that it was first issued. When you submit a refill request, the Fill Date updates when the request is being processed by the issuing pharmacy, i.e. such as when the status changes from Submitted to Refill in Process.
- Eric:  Use "refillable" prescription; we will use what's best for users and consistent w/ site.
- Eric: lots of feedback on the mail order slides; fill date follow up required (future dates), track package (remove), mail order status?
- Eric:  disclaimer language needs to be changed; follow up w/ him
- Eric: track package biggest gap; he wants another meeting. order history 
- Maureen liked glossary
- Maurren said gaps in tracking; wants to see what her mobile testing shows.  (note i believe this mobile app work should be stopped; clarifying w/ theresa)
- Eric wants to be involved in API work.
