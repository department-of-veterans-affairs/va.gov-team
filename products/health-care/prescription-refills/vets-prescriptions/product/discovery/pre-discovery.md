##### Current Experience
[Current Experience] (https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/anonymous.portal?_nfpb=true&_nfto=false&_pageLabel=mhvHome)

[Prototype] (https://mhvred-intb.myhealth.va.gov/home)
requires unique credentials, so anyone should be able to set them up on the prototype site

[Initial Experience Review with screenshots] (Screenshots/Prescriptions%20Screenshots%20-%20PreDiscovery.pdf)

##### Existing Data/Services/APIs
[Documentation](Discovery and Technical Docs)

##### Objectives (Why are we doing this?)
* Enable veterans to more easily fill a new prescription and refill and prescription online.

##### Goals
•	Enable a veteran to refill his VA prescription
•	Keep a veteran up-to-date on the status of her prescription, including delivery
•	Give a veteran access to all prescriptions they have had through the VA
•	Make it easy for a user to create and maintain an account
•	Reduce calls to call center [confirm this was a high call driver] note; 1.7M calls per year to call center re prescriptions (24% of calls to HEC) but these are not calls re MHV; users don't want to use MHV and instead use call system (IVR?)
•	Enable easier sign in to MHV


##### Potential Scope
Build 3 pages that use back-end data provided via APIs from the MyHealtheVet team:
* Refill VA Prescription
* Track delivery/prescription tracking
* Medications list/prescriptions history

##### Analytics
[Analytics Review] (Analytics/0.Prescriptions%20Analytics%20Assessment.md)

##### Success Criteria
* Bounce rate from landing page
* Rate of successful prescription refills (i.e. conversion)
* Login success

##### Pre-Discovery Questions
* What services/APIs exist for:
  * Refill Prescriptions
  * Track Delivery
  * Medications List
  * Meds, OTC, Herbals, & Supplements
* What are the types identifies that exist - a unique MHV account?
* What are the different levels of identities (e.g., basic, advanced) and how many of each?
* What Terms & Conditions need to be agreed to for prescriptions?
* Are there scope changes between the current site and the prototype (e.g., is Meds, OTC, Herbals and Supplements removed)?
* What would you describe as the major improvements between the current site and the prototype?
* Are there analytics on the current experience that can be shared?
* Has any usability research been done on the current experience or the prototype that can be shared?
* Is there data on up time of APIs?
* What is returned from APIs in event of no response/error?
* Can we get access to:
    * Subversion / version control  (read only)
    * Dev / Staging environments
        * Backend
        * Messaging queues
* How do we setup the MHV code locally?
