# Vets.gov Product Management Checklist

This is a set of actions for product teams to complete both prior to the launch and immediately following launch of a vets.gov product. The goals of the checklist are to 1) ensure product planning and delivery is consistent across products, 2) prevent common issues with what appears to be a production-ready service, and 3) achieve a repeatable process that is improved with lessons learned on an ongoing basis.

This checklist is a living document that is meant to be a set of *minimum* actions to take. Each product team should add additional items as necessary. If any items added are cross-cutting issues, they should be added to this checklist to encourage shared, iterative learning as vets.gov progresses.

Sections are organized chronologically, following the VA DS product life cycle methodology. The team lead is accountable for ensuring that all tasks are completed on-time and communicating progress / identifying blockers to the Product Manager (Stacey) and team in a timely way. The team lead is responsible for escalation and issue resolution for risks and blockers on these items.  Not all tasks will be completed by vets.gov team members directly--many tasks will be completed by VA stakeholders or team members--but the vets.gov team lead is responsible for confirming that it has happened.
