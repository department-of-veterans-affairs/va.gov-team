## Objectives ##
The team will conduct interception style usability sessions at two site: VAMC in SF and in DC. Each session of usability testing will align with overall project goals.

### Goals

	1. Better understand the needs of veterans who refill prescriptions with the VA.
		- Identify main tasks and users' needs related to each task (what are they trying to accomplish?)
		- Document user task flows for online prescription refills
	2. Determine if the early design concepts are meeting users' needs and working as intended.
		- Determine how easy or hard it is for users to accomplish tasks
		- Identify what aspects of the site work well, and what needs to be improved

### Key Research Questions

Goal 1: Better understand the needs of veterans who refill prescriptions with the VA.

- What does a user task flow look like for prescription refills? What are users trying to accomplish, in what order, and why? What are their main needs?
- What is the most important information that veterans need to know about their medicine?
- What are some other tools Veterans use to track their medication?
- Do Veterans track non-rx medications (such as tynenol and vitamins?)

Goal 2: Determine if the early design concepts are meeting users' needs and working as intended.

- Can veterans accomplish their tasks using the prototype?
- How easy or hard is the prototype for veterans to use?
- How long does it take for a veteran to refill their prescription, using the prototype?
- Why and when do veterans look at their medication history?
- What are all the reasons a veteran might need to send a secure message to their doctor?
- Are there any missing information that Veterans wish they could have seen?
 
### Methods:
- in-person usability testing on a mobile device (tablet)
 
 
### Participants:
- In-person usability sessions with veterans at the DC and SF VAMC. 
- Participants will represent a *mix* of ages and genders
- Participants will 
 

### Screening (5 minutes)###

Hello my name is _____ and I am here today with my colleague to get some feedback on a website on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build Vets.gov.  

The team is trying to learn more about how it works when Veterans refill their prescriptions with the VA. Would you be interested in talking with me for about 20 minutes to give us your opinion? 

[If no] Okay, no problem. Have a great day!

[If yes] - Great! We are looking from feedback from people who currently have a prescription with the VA. Do you have any prescriptions from the VA (you don't need to tell me what it is)?
 - [If yes] CONTINUE
 - [If no] Ask, "Have you ever had a prescription with the VA? How long ago?" and "Have you ever had a prescription from another doctor? How long ago?" (If either was within the past year, continue -- if not, terminate and thank the veteran anyway.)

Before we start, we want to let you know that:

	•We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.    
	•We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.  
	•This entire feedback session should take about 30 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.  
	•I’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.  
	•If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.  

Open-ended question: 

1. Walk me through a really positive experience you've had with ordering something for yourself (note for moderator: this doesn't have to be online -- can be a pizza, or something from amazon)
 - **PROMPTS:**
  - What was it like?
  - What worked really well?
2. Walk me through the last time you refilled a prescription. 
 - **PROMPTS:**
  - What was it like?
  - What did you do next?
  - And then what did you do?
  - How did you know to do that?
3. Have you ever filled a prescriptiong another way? What was that like? 
[Note to moderator: tease through some of the difference with follow-up prompts, like:]
 - What was better about experience 1? How could experience 2 have been more like experience 1? Why do you think experience 3 was so much simpler? etc. etc. 
3. What information about your medicine is most important to you?
	- What do you most need to know? 
	- What do you need to know about your medicine to stay healthy?
	- What information do you look at the most (online, on the bottle, on the package?)



### Task 1 - Getting a prescription refill
Let's say that you just had a procedure and you're running low on your medicines. The medicines you need to get more of are indomethacin, acetaminophen, and meloxicam. 

What would you do next?

*Keep asking the participant what they would do next until they reach the point of online services or don't have another answer. Try to ask thigns if "what if you're not at the VA medical center?"*

	•How did that go?
 	•What worked well? What could have worked better?
  	•How useful is this information?
	•How easy or hard is this tool to use?
	•What could make it easier?  
	•What, if anything, surprised you?
	•What, if anything, is confusing or unclear? Why?  
	•What, if anything, would make this more useful to you?  
	•What, if anything, would you do with this information?  
	
**Watch for**: 
- add
- a 
- list
- of 
- stuff

### Task 2 - Getting new Prescription
Your prescription didn't have any refills, what would you do next?

If participant arrives on Secure Messaging link, ask: 

- "What do you expect to see when you click on that link?"
- What do you want in a secure messaging section?


### Task 3 - Medicine Detail Page
If you wanted to get more information about a medicine, let's say hydrocodone, where would you go?

- What is the most important information on this page? 

- What is the least important information on this page?

- What do Veterans want to call "Medicines?" Prescriptions? Mecidines? Medications?


### Post-Task Questions

- What do you like most about this website? What do you disklike?  
- Would you use this website in real life? Why or why not?  
- Do you have any comments or final thoughts about Rx refill?

### Thank-You and Closing ###
*[The moderator concludes each session by thanking the participant for their time and for offering his/her opinions and suggestions.]*

Thank you very much for taking the time to give us your feedback today. We really appreciate your help!
