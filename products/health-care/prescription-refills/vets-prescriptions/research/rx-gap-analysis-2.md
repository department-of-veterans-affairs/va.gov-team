# MHV Rx Gap Analysis
This is a gap analysis of Rx specifically on MHV vs. Vets.gov as of 10/27/2017 based on issue #. Another gap analysis can be found [here]() of MHV including Rx. 

On MHV, a Veteran can refill their prescriptions, view refill prescription information page, view prescription history, view prescription tracking information, view Medications, OTCs, Herbals & Supplements Information (self-entered), and set their email notifications for Rx. On vets.gov a Veteran can do all of those tasks except self-enter their medications, OTCs, and herbals & supplements information and setting email notifications for Rx. 

## Pharmacy

### Refill my prescriptions
A Veteran can refill prescriptions on both MHV and vets.gov. Vets.gov doesn't allow for selecting multiple prescriptions to refill at once like MHV.

### Refill Prescription Informational Page
A Veteran can view additional information about each prescription. Vets.gov version does not include dispensed on and ordered on date.

### View Prescription History
The difference here is viewing history on vets.gov doesn't include currently facility and prescription tracking in the "view history" tab, but does include submit date that is not included on this page on MHV.

### View Prescription Tracking Information
This page is in MHV, but not it's own page in vets.gov. Vets.gov does offer tracking information though.
