## Objectives ##
The team will conduct sessions with 3-5 users to observe the usability of the current MHV prototype and identify any missing elements. 

The purpose of each usability session is to explore: 

	1.What are participants’ first impressions of the site?
	2.Do participants understand the purpose of the site?
	3.How intuitive is the interaction and design of the site?
	4.How clear and actionable is the content and labels on the site?
	5.What aspects of the site work well (e.g., layout, design, interaction features, etc.)?
	6.What difficulties (pain points) do participants encounter when using the site?
	7. What tasks do participants want to accomplish? Are there tasks other than the top 4 tasks identified through analytics?
	8. What, if any, is the relationship between refilling prescriptions and secure messaging?
