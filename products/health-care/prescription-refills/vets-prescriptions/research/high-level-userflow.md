### Proud Patriot
Older veteran with high blood pressure
Go to the VAMC for checkout –> diagnoised with HBP –> prescribed medication (doctor talks to Veterans about MHV... Veteran is given a pamphlet) –> goes home and starts talking meds –> create a login for MHV –> refill rx for following month –> get rx 10 days later.

### Fast tracker 
Single mom – needs birth control
already has Rx – on it for 5 years –> log in to MHV –> no refilles –> sends secure message to dr. –> 36 hours later gets note back –> see Rx in MHV –> selects "refill" –> gets Rx 10 days later

### Day to Day (struggling veteran)
Cancer patient – Chemo
Spouse logs in to MHV –> wants to refill 6 meds –> 1 is expired  –> continues with 5 refills –> calls the office about the expired one –> schedule appointment –> go to VAMC –> get new Rx –> fill at VAMC
