# Rx refill scenarios

## My prescription is running low
I know that I'm going to run out of Lipitor soon. So I log into vets.gov and navigate to My Prescriptions. I locate the Lipitor on the first screen (it’s ordered alphabetically). There is a refill button in the Lipitor “card” and I click it. A window pops up and asks me to confirm the refill of Lipitor. I click “Order refill”. The pop-up goes away and I see a banner on the screen that tells me I have successfully ordered a refill. It says tracking info is pending, so I can come back later to check on progress. I don’t have any more prescriptions to refill today so I sign out.

## I wonder when my refill will arrive
I ordered a refill of Lipitor a day or two ago and I want to know when it will arrive. I log into vets.gov and navigate to My Prescriptions. I see that there is a shipment notice at the top of the screen. It includes a track package button. I click it and a new window opens with a USPS package tracking screen in it. I can see that they know about my package but it hasn’t been shipped out yet. I’ll have to check back later.

## My doctor wants to know what drugs I’m taking
I’m seeing a doc about a shoulder injury and she wants to know what other meds I'm on. I log into my account and see my current prescriptions. I click the print link and a printable list opens up in a new tab on my browser. As I'm looking at it I remember that she asked for the last three months. I close the window and then click over to the Prescription history tab. At the top I see a couple links. "last 6 months" is close to what I need so I click that. Like before I get a list in a new tab but this one is a little longer. I print it out and close out the window. I've got what I need for my appointment.

## I’m out of refills for a prescription
I’m running low on Lipitor again and I log in to order a refill. When I get to the refill page I see that I am out of refills for Lipitor. The Prescription card doesn't have a refill option but there is a button "message provider". I click that and see a pop-up window that I can type a message into. I ask how to get more refills and click send. After the pop-up closes I see a notification that the message was sent. I'll check back later.
