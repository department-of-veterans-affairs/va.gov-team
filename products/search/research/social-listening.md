Below are relevant quotes that came from Reddit.com/r/Veterans or Hadit.com within the last 12 months, regarding finding information.

Reddit.com/r/Veterans:

October 2020

“My VSO said she uploaded my supporting docs, and that I can't see them because I didn't upload them. I've heard from other veterans that they can see ALL documents for their claim, even if their VSO uploaded it. Any of you guys not able see what your VSO uploaded?”

September 2020

“The uploaded documents page for my disability claim on both ebenfits and va.gov says nothing has been uploaded. The VSO that filed my claim says I can't see anything she uploads on my behalf, but what's written on ebenefits/va.gov contradicts that. It says anything I or a representative uploads should be viewable.”

April 2020

“Can’t find my LES” “I'm trying to qualify for fasfa, but they require 3 payment stubs for the application process. I went onto to mypay but there's no option for it anywhere. What gives?”

October 2020

“MH Appt Notes...Can you find these in your Va medical records? Or are they kept separate than the ones you can get off of blue button to help protect confidentiality?”
 
November 2020

“I’ve been trying to find in eBenefits and the VA website my explanation of benefits. One that describes my disability decisions. Best I can find is a list of my disabilities, but no real documentation.” 

-“You have to request that. You can do that by calling 1-800-827-1000. The good thing is they will email it to you now…”

June 2020

“Can’t find this answer anywhere. I’m currently receiving a VA disability check (20%). Will I still receive my regular social security check when I turn 62 (or whatever the age will be when I retire).”
“Every time I tried to come up with a search phrase to find the answer it kept leading back to SSDI and SSI.”

January 2020

“I’m wondering if anyone knows how to go about trying to get a therapy dog. I have been going to my therapist and they suggested I get one, but I have been looking online but can’t find a straight answer on how I would go about trying to get one. Any information would be helpful.”

October 2020

“...I'm in my 30s and living with my retired Navy father(in his 60s). His health is declining (COPD and CHF)... I guess I'm trying to find out things like: 1. Powers of attorney and what they even mean. 2. If there's a way I can manage his finances when needed. 3. Ways to be a part of his medical care like speaking with his doctors on his behalf. 4. Guidance on what to do if he suddenly passes away and what happens in that case? 5. Are there care providers for someone that isn't completely disabled, but needs serious self care help? 6. Are there any financial resources for me or him?”

June 2020

“...I didn't realize at the time that I needed help managing my finances or that I'm so naive about people. It's almost like fraudsters can smell vulnerability… I don't know why the VA won't help me. The laws that's protect vulnerable adults doesn't seem to cover me. You would think they'd have some protections written in for disabled veterans who are not elderly, but they dont. Does anyone know of some kind of resource that can help? I can't do homeless again. I just can't.”
 
August 2020

“...The doctor highly recommend I be fitted for hearing aides. The hearing aides through the doctor after insurance will cost me approximately $3,500. My question is, will the VA cover this additional cost outside of my insurance? Or would I have to go through the VA directly for the hearing aides? I’ve tried looking on the VA’s website, but can’t find anything.”
 
August 2020

“I'm pursuing a comp sci degree and as the title states, I've exhausted my post 9/11 benefits, but I was approved for the STEM scholarship. My question is, am still eligible for the VETTEC program? I know you're supposed to have at least one remaining day of Post 9/11 benefit left, but I'm curious as to whether the STEM scholarship would count. I can't find anything on this online and since I'm currently overseas in a remote area, I'm having difficulty getting ahold of anyone on the phone and they haven't responded to my emails. Any one have any info?”

September 2020

“I can't find for the life of me how to view the short form dd214. I need it quickly for legal reasons and all I've been able to get in the VA website is my long form. Can anyone point me in the right direction?” 

November 2020

“Hey! So I'm trying to apply for my fishing license and state parks pass they are saying I can turn in a formal stating my service connected percentage. Where do I find such forms?”

September 2020 

“DD Form 1966 Location...I've found one Reddit post stating I can find it on e-benefits. I cannot for the life of me find it anywhere. Anyone know where I can find it?”

November 2020

“Anyone know how to get your current disability list on either website? I’m on an iPhone i Have figured out you can get to it you going to payments information and the then click on additional benefits, but other then filing for an Increase to see the list and The decision letter isn’t there one you can download?found it so I’ll post it for iPhone users in VA.gov under benefits menu....” 
-“Yea, its on ebenefits/va.gov  Just keep looking.  The site is not easy to navigate.  Try a search.”
