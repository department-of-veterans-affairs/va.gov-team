# Experience overview for authenticated and unautheticated users on va.gov homepage

## Overview
OCTODE will develop a vision for cross product, end-to-end Veteran task successes which are supported by VA.gov and integrate with the existing VA ecosystem or products.

Content that needs to live on an unauthenticated experience:
- Sign up/Sign in
- Browse/Manage Benefits
- Announcements
- Alerts

Content that needs to live on an authenticated experience:
- Overview/Benefit Summary
- Notifications
- Profile/My Profile
- My VAMC
- Browse/Manage Benefits*
- Announcements*
- Alerts  

   *Indicates content that would live in both auth and unauth

## Problem Statement
Today, our team builds product on VA.gov with narrow and deep focus on specific user outcomes. We need to take the opportunity to step-back and view the ecosystem holistically from a user experience perspective. 
Currently, VA.gov does not clearly create a distinction between new and existing customers (for example, the homepage and global navigation do not change).

Veterans that do not have va.gov accounts or do not use VA services have a different set of needs and expectations from Veterans with existing accounts. 

Veterans visiting for the first time are interested in exploring VA benefits, determining eligibility, getting answers to their questions, or completing a specific task (such as complete the add a dependent form, which ironically, requires them to create an account).

Veterans with accounts expect a personalized experience on VA.gov, similar to their experiences with private sector websites where they can track and manage their existing benefits or explore new ones that are relevant to them. 

When Veterans visit the VA.gov homepage they encounter a long list of links, most of which require login prior to completing a task, this solution tries to meet the needs of both groups. 

The global navigation and homepage do not adapt to the authenticated user, and this places a large burden on the user and unnecessarily complicates the purposes of key products such as My VA. 

Some symptoms of this problem include:
- It takes many clicks to get to a frequently used product (e.g. claim status)
- We are unable to surface relevant personalized benefit information on key pages
- The Homepage is not designed for new member capture/sign-up
- The Homepage does not emphasize login or search

How might we statement:
- How might we leverage what we know about authenticated users to better serve their needs?
- How might we tailor our products to serve unauthenticated users?
- How might we focus on the end-to-end user experience to inform both the authenticated and unauthenticated experience?
- How might we provide VA authors the best digital product toolset in order to deliver information to Veterans?

## Desired Outcomes

### User Outcomes

New users are:
- Driven to create or login to a VA.gov account
- Encouraged to enroll in VA services
- Able to find eligibility information and start applications easily
- Made aware of VA announcements and alerts

Current Va.gov users are:
- Access to their benefit status information
- Provided notifications and messages for actions VA needs them to take
- Able to easily access and modify their profile
- Able to find and explore new benefits that may be relevant to them
- Able to easily find VA services relevant to their existing benefits (e.g. Rx Refill)

### Business Outcomes
- More people are driven to create accounts
- The va.gov homepage has more content that encourages Veterans to enroll in services

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Increased number of va.gov accounts
- Improve quality and quantity of media content on the homepage
- Increased user task completion (e.g. Veteran receives a notification to complete task X, and is able to do so)

- Task completion rates for top 20 tasks
- User satisfaction with VA.gov
- Number of accounts created per month


#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

## Assumptions
- This effort will serve as a starting point to differentiate and clarify the roles of several key products that are part of the auth and unauth global experience.
- The team members will work collaboratively, contributing to this vision and leveraging their knowledge of their own product space to bring each product in closer alignment with this vision.
- Auth and Sitewide crews will provide cycles from existing teams to work on this vision.
- The Web Governance Board will allow for the creation of a working group to support iteration of the unauthenticated homepage.

## Solution Approach

Potential solution for an authenticated user must account for the following categories of information or interactions:
- An overview of their current benefits information:
  - Provides users with timely, actionable notifications—Do things
  - Provides scannable status information about what VA knows about you—Track things
  - Surfaces tailored, relevant links to new benefits—Get new things/Explore
- A quick way to browse the top tasks relevant to an authenticated user:
  - Example, all the links currently under “Manage your benefits” in the Disability mega menu
- Access to the user’s medical center website (for users with current health care)
- Announcements that provide users with marketing communication including current relevant news stories and a history of these announcements
- Notifications prompting the user to act on their current benefits or pending applications
  - A history/full reference list of all notifications
  - Ability to act directly to resolve the issues list in the notification
- Access to the user profile to provide updates to relevant personal information and preferences
- Alerts informing the user to on critical information (e.g. COVID) that affect all users or are specifically relevant to that user (e.g. hurricane closure at their medical center)

Potential solution for the unauthenticated experience, would involve a redesign of the current homepage of VA.gov
- Shifting the priority of interaction from benefit-related tasks to sign-in, search, marketing and browsing benefits
