Review of redesign and research plan with Dave Conlon, Chris Johnston, and Jeff Barnes

| Suggestion/Feedback | Outcome |
|---	|	---
| The area reserved for the VAntage Point promo should allow for content from other sources to be featured. | |
| Review ChooseVA pages to identify areas of focus, ideas to emulate (i.e. email sign-up, promotional video) | |
| Consider a method of supporting those who are new to the VA (i.e. _New here? Start here_) | |
| Be conscious and intentional about the order of the benefit hubs. Current production version accounts for the prominence provided by four top task boxes - without those, may need to elevate hubs for health, disability, etc. | [Link to benefit utilization data](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/benefit-utilization-data.md) |
| Consider best off-ramp for Departments, other user types | |
| Consider method for allowing Veterans and beneficiaries to receive information/updates (i.e. subscribe to email notifications) | |
