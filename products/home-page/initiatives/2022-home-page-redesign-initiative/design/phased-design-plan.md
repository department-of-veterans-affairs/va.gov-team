## Initial iteration designs
The initial designs for the iteration of the VA.gov homepage planned an evolution through a series of steps characterized as
- Baseline
- Converge on sign-in
- Date-informed iteration

### Step 1
**Summary of changes**
- Move Veteran profile images from below the top task blue boxes to just above the header. 

**Value Proposition**
- Veteran research indicated that some Veterans mistake the row of images as the bottom of the page and do not scroll beyond them. By moving the images to the actual footer, we can measure the impact of this single change before making other significant changes. 

**Expected outcomes**
- Scroll rate is expected to increase.
- Click through for links below the blue boxes should increase.
- Minimal to no increase is expected on Facility Locator, Crisis Line and Sign CTAs as they are available several places throughout the page.

### Step 2
**Summary of changes**
- Facility Locator, Crisis Line and Sign in CTAs moved up to just below the Top task boxes.
- Three OPIA boxes will be replaced with a single box in a new location.

**Value Proposition**
- Validation of click through rates for Facility Locator and Crisis Line CTAs at this location to see if they should continue to be available via these CTAs. 
- Validation of click through rates for Sign In/Sign up CTA to determine if it should receive increased visibility as planned in Step 3. 
- Increase visibility to OPIA features by changing placement and visual styling.

**Expected outcomes**
- Click through rates on VAntage Point content is expected to increase. 
- Click through on links below the blue boxes should increase (except for those in the three boxes as they are available several places throughout the page).
- By offering a single spot to OPIA, content may get updated more frequently.

### Step 3
**Summary of changes**
- Return randomized, rotating set of Veteran portraits to top of page 
- Elevate visibility of Sign in/Sign up CTA (assuming this need has been validated in Step 2).
- Replace four top task boxes with a shorter, data driven list of popular links.
- Leverage queries to direct users to the best page for the task, reducing the number of intermediate clicks
- Add a visible search option for other links. 
- Add links to other search tools not available through Search (such as Yellow Ribbon, Education benefits, Find a VA form, Facility Locator) 

**Value Proposition**
- Veteran portraits humanize VA
- By using analytics to determine the most popular task list, we can ensure optimal use of space. 
- Delivers simplified, easy to read design 

**Expected outcomes**
- Increase use of Sign In/Sign Up.
- Increased Veteran understanding, ease of use, time to task completion
- Decreased clicks to task

### Post Step 3
- Consider adding alt text and links to individual Veteran stories from portraits
- May need to add links to other VA resources such as Choose VA, Resources and Support, VSO websites, VA offices and Programs
- Add links to other VA news, additional resources from OPIA feature
