## Summary of changes

The following changes were informed, in part, by the [findings from the VA.gov homepage usability research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md) conducted in August 2022. 

|	Design change	|	Reason for change | Expected outcome
|	---	|	--- |	---
|	Added prominent benefit promo block	|	Participants in usability research sessions indicated a desire for relevant, new information about changes to benefits and services. | Increased Veteran satsifaction by making information on changes to benefits and services more readily available and higher engagement with fresh and timely featured content, measured by increases in clickthrough rates
|	Added context and clearer link labels for news promo spotlight|	Participants in usability research sessions weren't able to easily distinguish news content from ads or information about benefit changes because of context and unclear link language. | Improved comprehension and engagemen,  measured by increases in clickthrough rates
|	Changed button from "sign up/sign in" to "create account" only	|	During usability research sessions, most sign-ins didn't happen on the home page (with "Sign in or create an account" near the photos or "Sign in" in the header) and participants were confused or frustrated by duplicate buttons. | Increased use of the logged in experience and account creation originating on homepage
|	Increased number of links with first pass at rubric for determining links	|	Without explicit links on the homepage, some tasks were difficult for participants to complete during usability research sessions | Improved discoverability and findability of information and improved task completion for common tasks and those which are difficult to find by browsing or frequently searched from the homepage
|	Changes to "Other search tools"	|	Links for "Yellow Ribbon" and "Education benefits" were confusing to participants during usability research sessions | Increased Veteran understanding of the content available on the homepage, measured by clickthrough rate on search tool links
|	Addition of Resources and support link	|	Resources and support could be another method for finding the information and links Veterans and other beneficiaries need | Improved task completion and traffic to Resources and Support page originating from homepage
| Addition of email sign up | Provide an avenue to Veterans to receive updates and information by making a sign-up available | email subscription rate originating from homepage
| Addition of "Welcome to VA.gov H1 | Removal of "Access and manage your VA benefits and health care" title caused a defect in heading hierarchy  | Those using screenreaders or keyboard navigation will have context for the page when they arrive
