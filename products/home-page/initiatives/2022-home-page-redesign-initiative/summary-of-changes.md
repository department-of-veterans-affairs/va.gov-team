</details>

 - A randomized, rotating set of Veteran portraits has been added to the top of the page
 - Sign in/Sign up CTA has elevated visibility and top placement
 - Four top task boxes have been replaced with a data-driven list of links to 5 Veteran-facing pages where actions can be taken 
 - A visible search option which mimics the site search is available, followed by a  list of other search tools not available through Search (such as Yellow Ribbon, Education benefits, Find a VA form, Facility Locator)
 - VAntage blog article appears in prominent location

**Value proposition**
- Veteran portraits humanize VA and remind stakeholders who VA.gov is intended to serve
- By using analytics to determine search tools and task lists, we can ensure optimal use of space
- Delivers simplified, easy to read design 

**Out of scope**
- Initial scope will not include the header and footer as these are shared across VA.gov and developing consensus on their use will be significantly more complicated. 
- The “Other VA resources” section (which contains links to other VA resources such as Choose VA, Resources and Support, VSO websites, VA offices and Programs) is found in the design but not implemented in the testing version as the links are not Veteran-facing. 

This design was validated with usability testing in August 2022 and findings informed Round 2 design iteration.

- Making information on changes to benefits and services more readily available should result in higher engagement with fresh and timely featured content, measured by increases in clickthrough rates
- Adding context and clearer link labels for news promo spotlight	should improve comprehension and engagement. Participants in usability research sessions weren't able to easily distinguish news content from ads or information about benefit changes because of the lack of context and unclear link language.	The goal is higher engagement with fresh and timely featured content, measured by increases in clickthrough rates.
- Changing button from "sign up/sign in" to "create account" only	should increase use of the logged in experience and account creation originating on homepage
- Increased number of links will improve discoverability and findability of information and improve task completion for common tasks and those which are difficult to find by browsing or frequently searched from the homepage
- Changes to "Other search tools"	will improve task completion and Veteran understanding 
- Adding Resources and support link	will improve task completion and result in traffic to Resources and Support page originating from homepage
- Adding email sign up	will provide an avenue to Veterans to receive updates and information 
- Addition of "Welcome to VA.gov" H1	will improve experience for those using screenreaders or keyboard navigation by giving context to landing page

This iteration adds a modal for opting-in to the redesigned user experience. Content input was provided to convey the full-functionality of the redesigned page, a CTA to provide feedback, and expectation about the per-session nature of the opt-in (i.e. "Try the new homepage", "No,maybe next time").

It also includes changes to make the "Create account" CTA a bit more compelling. It also incorporates a new flow to a pending Resources and Support page. This is a bet to educate new users about the benefits of an account and support account creation. This flow was preferred over negotiating changes to the current login-in modal which wasn't intended to cover these needs. 

Other adjustments include
 - determining the position of the feedback button to avoid competing with the row of Veteran portriats or the email sign up field
 - adding the visible label for the email field to address accessibility feedback from Midpoint review
