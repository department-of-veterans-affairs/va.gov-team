## Decision log

Documenting rationale for decisions made during the course of this initiative

Date | Decision | Rationale
--- | --- | --- |
| June 2022 | Determination of which top tasks to include in [moderated/unmoderated research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/home-page/research) | Intentionally tried to keep list as succinct as possible to minimize cognitive load and participant willingness during survey - decisions on individual tasks can be found in [Veterans Top Task sheet in Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rhaV0rZJcVYfwMaHWUpxHyC0cMQP_lDd/edit#gid=1357444844) | 
| June 2022| Cohort definitions for [Top Task research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/research-plan.md) | Include Veterans, service members and a range of types of beneficiaries who have various benefit experiences, including those with no health care experience, to avoid bias toward healthcare related tasks 
| June 2022 | Removal of "Survivor" as targeted participant in cohorts for [Top Task Unmoderated research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-plan.md) | "Survivor" is no longer a defined type of participant on recruiting questionaire
| June 2022 | Reduction in target number for participants without any VA benefit experience for [Redesigned homepage Usability](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/redesigned-homepage-usability/research-plan.md) | This type of participant is inherently difficult to recruit because they aren't involved with VA. In future research, when possible given the type of research and planned questions, we'll use benefit areas for which participants have no experience as proxy for the "new to VA" experience.
| July 2022 | We will request a larger than average number of participants for the [VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/redesigned-homepage-usability/research-plan.md) | The conversation guide has 20 tasks (based on our recent top task findings) and we know we can't/shouldn't ask every participant to complete that many. Our goal is to have each task completed by ~4 people, for confidence - if only 1-2 people respond to the task, we risk the feedback not being generally applicable.
September 2022|	Design iteration round 2 will add separate "Create account" CTA from "Sign in" button in header	|	Finding from [VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#4-several-participants-said-that-it-was-redundant-or-confusing-to-have-two-different-sign-in-buttons): Participants found presence of two different sign-in buttons to be redundant or confusing | 
September 2022|	Design iteration round 2 will maintain benefit hubs and multiple methods for completing task	|	Finding from [VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#1-most-participants-browsed-clicking-links-without-using-the-search-box-at-all-or-searched-only-when-browsing-didnt-work): Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searched only when browsing didn’t work and navigation of the home page often didn't include the entire page but only certain parts of it.|
September 2022 |	Design iteration round 2 will add explicit link for "Dependents on your disability benefits" to Common link list	|	Finding from [VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md): Participants couldn't find this by browsing (tried megamenu, benefit hubs > Family member benefits) and didn't recognize links with the word "dependent" as relevant |
September 2022 |	Design iteration round 2 will add more context and clearer links to "More VA news" 	|	Finding from [VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#6-no-participants-said-anything-about-the-vantage-blog-promo-box-entitled-updates-on-veteran-homelessness-nor-clicked-on-it-while-doing-tasks): Participants couldn't differentiate blog post promo news content from important VA benefit information.
September 2022	|	Design iteration round 2 will add second OPIA area to highlight new/updated benefit information 	|	Finding from [VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#6-no-participants-said-anything-about-the-vantage-blog-promo-box-entitled-updates-on-veteran-homelessness-nor-clicked-on-it-while-doing-tasks): Participants indicated an expectation for recent legislation or other changes in VA benefits or procedures
September 2022 |	Design iteration round 2 will add more links to common task list 	|	Finding from [VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#3-of-the-20-top-tasks-tested-9-tasks-were-completed-successfully-by-everyone-and-4-were-completed-by-only-half-of-those-who-tried-them): Although 16 of 20 top tasks tested, 16 were completed by at least 70% of participants, only 9 tasks were completed successfully by everyone, and 4 were completed by only half of those who tried them. By adding more top tasks to the link linst, we hope to improve task completion, particularly for those tasks which were most difficult
September 2022 	|	Design iteration round 2 includes a link to "Departments"	|	Need to provide an "off-ramp" to program office content
September 2022 	|	Design iteration round 2 includes an email subscription sign-up	|	Satisfy need for Veteran opt-in (similar to Choice)
September 2022	|	Recommend adding "Find a mental health counselor or therapist" and "Learn about benefits related to toxic exposure" to common task list in Design iteration, round 2 |	These tasks are important but difficult to find by browsing
September 2022	|	Recommend adding "Review or update your dependents" to common task list in Design iteration, round 2	|	This task was one of the most problematic for participants during [usability research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#3-of-the-20-top-tasks-tested-9-tasks-were-completed-successfully-by-everyone-and-4-were-completed-by-only-half-of-those-who-tried-them)
September 2022	|	Recommend adding "Manage your VA health care" to common task list in Design iteration, round 2	|	Can serve as umbrella task covering multiple important tasks (appts, prescriptions, messaging, lab results)
September 2022	|	Recommend adding "Get your VA medical records" to common task list in Design iteration, round 2	|	This task is important to everyone, even those without health care
September 2022	|	Recommend adding "Learn about or file for reimbursement for travel expenses to/from medical appointments" to common task list in Design iteration, round 2	|	These task is important but difficult to find by browsing. It is also very commonly searched from the homepage. 
September 2022	|	Recommend adding "Learn about or apply for education benefits" to common task list in Design iteration, round 2	|	This umbrella task can cover multiple education-related needs, many of which were common searches from the home page
November 2022 | Revise Popular on VA.gov task list | Based on research findings and other feedback, we need to adjust to avoid links which are too general/duplicating link to benefit hub links and restore action words to make the links recognizable as tasks. Links will point to unauthenticated pages. [_See details_](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/initiatives/2022-home-page-redesign-initiative/popular-links-menu.md)
November 2022 | Popular on VA.gov menu label | Renamed to "Top pages" since topics and content which appear here (i.e. disability claims or mental health) may not be well-represented using "popular" as a label
November 2022 | Will be released with a soft launch approach | More information available in [Phase I: Moderated production testing during Soft launch period](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/initiatives/2022-home-page-redesign-initiative/release-plan.md#phase-i-moderated-production-testing-during-soft-launch-period)
November 22, 2022 | Modal design | The implementation of this modal is different than originally designed because the design system doesn't have a component which strictly meets the need. <li> Try the new homepage" should semantically be a link and "No Thanks" should semantically be a button </li><li> We still want to make sure the "Try the new homepage" has the visual impact and priority as best we can though to help drive folks to that new page. </lit><li> In consultation with the Design system team, it was proposed that the modal should use a primary action link for "Try new homepage" and a secondary button for "no thanks" as those are the appropriate components to use from the existing system. </li><li>[Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C01DBGX4P45/p1669152245109399) 
December 2022 | VA Departments | <li> Launch for VA departments site is tied up in review so it can be added to the main homepage post-launch or added sooner to the "about us" area <li> Original plan to add as a benefit hub is complicated by entityqueue/content type technical constraints - delay can be used to determine a more elegant solution
Early Jan, 2023 | delay modal launch | <li> Internal stakeholders needed a clearer understanding of the soft-launch approach and assumptions around the new page <li> The VA Dept website was known to be very close to launch, and it was decided that the “Hub list” area of the new homepage should include it prior to soft-launch. <li> A roll-out strategy for the soft-launch modal was deemed necessary – 25% to start, bumped up to 50, 75, and 100
Jan 18, 2023 | Benfit Hub List | The solution for adding a non-Benefit Hub Landing Page to the homepage "Hubs" area will be a new menu in Drupal. Implementation details in [issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/11968).
Feb 16, 2023 | Modal launch date | After a briefing to the Web Governance Board, we were cleared to soft-launch the modal to 25% of VAgov visitors on Tues, 2/21/23
