## Product context
Conceived as the unifying "Veteran-facing digital brand" for the Department of Veteran Affairs when it launched in late 2018, VA.gov has become the front-door to top tasks, tools and information for Veterans and their beneficiaries. 

The homepage fulfills Lincoln's promise, the VA's mission to honor and serve America's Veterans, and the following digital modernization goals
- to increase use of VA's self-service tools
- to enable faster access to care and timely delivery of services
- improve the use experience of interacting with the VA

**Homepage goals**

To help Veterans and beneficiaries
- explore VA benefits and services
- complete tasks to manage their benefits and services
- get the latest information 
- log in for access to a personalized streamlined experience

In the nearly three years since the site's launch, the range of VA benefits and programs has grown and evolved, with new valuable offerings. The VA.gov authenticated experience has expanded to include MyVA, MyProfile, eBenefits migration, and soon MyHealthevet integration. 

Veterans have evolved too - from never logging in to understanding that some tasks are possible online _only when logged in_. The VA.gov homepage needs to reflect the evolution of our Veterans and the benefit landscape.

- Digital Modernization Council (DMC)
  > Context from Chris Johnston: The DMC is a cross-administration body that supports VA's digital modernization vision and strategy -- specifically making VA.gov the primary online destination for Veterans and their families to learn about, apply for, track, and manage their VA benefits. The Council is comprised of senior leadership across VA, including representatives from VHA, VBA, NCA, VEO, OPIA, OIT, CTO, AMO, OEHRM, and more. Goals are varied, but generally orbit around the idea that we want relevant stakeholders to be aware and in support of our work. "Support" could come in many forms, including helping remove blockers, making connections to other groups, and defending budget. One key thing that enables OCTO to continue to do the work we do, and in the way we do it, is because we deliver good results, repeatedly. Our participation in the DMC, where we transparently showcase our work, is a key component of our ongoing autonomy.
