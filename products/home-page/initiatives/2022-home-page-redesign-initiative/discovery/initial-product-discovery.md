## Authenticated experience

Purpose: A cohesive logged-in experience will help veterans complete tasks more quickly, increase veteran satisfaction with the VA, reduce the need for multiple touchpoints (other VA websites; VA call centers), and help veterans get benefits more quickly.

### Profile
- Purpose: The VA.gov profile provides a centralized place where users can see what information the VA knows about them, and where they can update that information as needed.

### myVA
- Purpose: When Veterans log into VA.gov, they expect to be met with an experience that reflects their personal circumstances at VA. My VA aims to meet this expectation by providing Veterans with a direct route to their most critical tasks and updates. The My VA dashboard on VA.gov provides Veterans easier access to critical information in one place. My VA allows Veterans to view a summary of important information about themselves, applicable benefits, statuses and additional resources.

### Health apartment homepage
- Purpose: The Health Apartment Team’s mission is to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov, which is nicknamed the “health apartment.”

## Search
- Purpose
  - powered by Search API -> [implementation guide](https://search.usa.gov/sites/7378/api_instructions)
  - "Search Typeahead" uses a database of suggestions to assist users in finding what they are looking for on va.gov. These suggestions are algorithmically generated (if a query is searched X number of times, input it as a suggestion, and then remove it if it goes Y days without being searched Z times). These numbers are controlled by search.gov, and we do not have much control over them.
