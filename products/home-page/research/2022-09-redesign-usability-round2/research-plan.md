# Research Plan for VA.gov Home Page Redesign ROUND 2 Usability Testing [Sitewide Home Page team, October 2022]

## Background
The current VA.gov website was launched in 2018 but hadn't been the subject of much user research until [Baseline Wayfinding Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md) was conducted in April 2021. Findings from this research and also from [Search Design Concepts Usability Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/research-findings.md) have been incorporated into a new VA.gov home page design, which was usability tested in August 2022. Now more revisions have been made to the home page design, and we're doing a second round of usability testing.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
1. Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online 
1. Veterans can manage their health services online 
1. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online

### Veteran Journey
Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the *newly revised version* of the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We will observe which areas of the home page they use and how well it supports Veterans, VA beneficiaries, caregivers, and service members while completing benefit-related tasks. 

### Outcome
This research will inform release decisions, as well as future research and design of the home page.

### Research questions
*Note: In this research plan, "successfully completing" a task means that a participant has navigated to a web page on VA.gov where they could do that task or sign in to do the task (participants will NOT sign in during the sessions).*
1. Are participants able to successfully complete tasks from the home page without getting stuck?
    1. For tasks previously assessed, how do task success rates compare to those in the first round of usability testing?
    2. For tasks previously assessed, how do task success rates compare to those in the baseline wayfinding study last year?
1. Which parts of the home page do participants use to complete tasks? 
    1. Benefit promo at top of page (PACT Act article)
    2. "Create account" button
    4. The new search box 
    5. "Other search tools" 
    3. "Popular on VA.gov"
    4. VA News promo (PathFinder article)
    6. Benefit hubs 
    9. Header (including Search, Sign in, VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu)
    10. Footer 
1. Do participants know when to use the "Sign in" *vs.* "Create account" buttons?
1. Is there anything that participants find unclear or confusing on the home page, especially when using a smartphone or a screen reader? 
1. What are participants' impressions of the two new promo sections (with PACT Act and Pathfinder news articles)?
    1. How would they get more details on these topics?
    1. How would they get stories on other topics? 

### Areas of focus
In this research, we are primarily interested in the following areas of the home page as used in task completion:
- Benefit promo (PACT Act article)
- "Create account" button
- The new search box
- "Other search tools"
- "Popular on VA.gov"
- VA News promo (PathFinder article)
- Benefit hubs

### Hypotheses
1. The revised home page design will result in improved task success rates as compared to the first round of usability testing, especially including the tasks below.
    1. The 4 tasks with the lowest success rates:
        1. Check current disability compensation rates (60%)
        2. Compare education benefits by school (56%)
        3. Add spouse (Review/update dependents) (56%)
        4. File for disability increase (50%)
    2. The 2 tasks with lower success rates than last year's baseline wayfinding research:
        1. Message your doctor (83%)
        1. Add spouse (Review/update dependents) (56%) -- also listed above
1. There are no significant differences in task success rate across devices (especially smartphones) or screen reader users.
1. Participants will know when to use the "sign in" *vs.* "create an account" buttons.
1. The home page supports multiple ways of navigating, and participants will find a way to complete every task--i.e., there's a navigation path that works for them. 
1. Participants understand that the top promo is about benefits or services for Veterans.
1. Participants understand that the bottom promo is news and know how to get more news stories.

## Method	
We will conduct **remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom**. Participants will be asked a few questions about their past usage of the VA.gov site, and then will be given some **tasks as wayfinding prompts** to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server, including some that didn't go well in the [previous round of usability testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md).

**I would like Zoom transcripts please.** And I would like to request that **Perigean *calls* each participant** to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them.

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.
