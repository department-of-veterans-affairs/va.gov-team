### Findings

Were you able to do your task today?
- 342 = NO
- 115 = YES

**Pain points**
- Sign in was cited directly in 75 of 342 "NO" responses and was a complicating factor for many others. 
  - Logged out immediately after signing in and challenges creating / verifying account or ID were the most common specific complaints
- Managing health care tasks - at least 1 in 4 negative sentiments was related to sign-in challenges while trying to complete task, others related to challenges navigating new tools
  - Appointments - 36 
  - Ordering supplies (hearing aid or other) - 8
  - Prescriptions - 31 
  - Secure messaging - 13 
  - Lab results - 8
- Travel reimbursement - 11 
- VHIC - 9 , almost all navigation related
- Claim status - 13 
- General feedback included IA/Navigation challenges and that too many changes were being made

### Recommendations
1. During the last review period, it was acknowledged that the sign in experience was actively being improved and it was expected that the next Medallia pull/review would show an improvement in this area.
