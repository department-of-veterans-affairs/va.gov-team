This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page they used and how well it supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

## Participants
We talked to **19 people: 16 Veterans, 1 Caregiver of a Veteran, 2 family members of a Veteran** (one was also a Veteran and the other was also a Caregiver), and **2 service members**. 
- 17 had experience with at least 2 VA benefits.
- 3 had experience with VA benefits that didn't include VA health care.
- 1 had experience with only one VA benefit, which was education (a service member).
- 1 had experience with *no* VA benefits (the other service member).

## Preliminary Findings
### Navigation
1. **Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searched only when browsing didnâ€™t work**. We observed distinct **browse *vs.* search usage patterns** among the participants:
     1. More than a third of participants *browsed exclusively* and never used search to complete tasks.
     2. Only our youngest participant *searched exclusively* to complete tasks. (This same behavior was observed in our youngest pilot participant, whose data isn't included in this report even though he's a Reservist.)
     3. Some participants who *started off browsing and later discovered the search box* were impressed with the results and then used search more. 
     4. A few participants *tried searching, got irrelevant results, and gave up on search*, so only browsed after that.
5. Participants' browsing of the home page often didn't include the entire page but only certain parts of it. Some participants found **one way to navigate that worked for them, which they used it for most tasks**, ignoring other parts of the home page. Here are some **different browsing focus patterns** that we observed:
     1. Only the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu in the header
     1. Only Common tasks and Other search tools
     1. Only the benefit hubs
     1. A combination of some of the above but usually not all
7. **Most participants (79%) scrolled all the way down** the home page to the footer.
8. Different participants took very **different paths to complete the same tasks**, which was possible because there are many ways to navigate from the home page to the same content page.
9. Each of the top 20 tasks tested in this research were attempted by 6-10 participants with varying degrees of success.
     1. **9 tasks (almost half) were completed successfully by ALL those who tried them**, some more quickly than others.
     1. 7 tasks were completed successfully by 70-90% of those who tried them.
     1. 4 tasks were completed successfully by only half (50-60%) of those who tried them. 
1. Several participants said that it was **redundant or confusing to have two different sign-in buttons** ("Sign in or create an account" near the photos, and "Sign in" in the header). 
     1. One quarter of the participants (5 of 19) said that they'd sign in first--before using the home page--so that they'd see customized links or wouldn't get interrupted later to sign in and then have to figure out how to get back to where they were.
3. Some participants had **difficulty using the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu because it didn't work as expected** since one dropdown option was already expanded upon opening--either the first option (Health care) or the one last opened.  

### Content
8. The Vantage box entitled "Updates on Veteran homelessness" was interpreted in different ways by participants:
     1. No one said anything about it while doing tasks. During the post-task interview, one participant said they thought it was a banner ad and so ignored it.
     1. Many participants **didn't realize that the Vantage box entitled "Updates on Veteran homelessness" was a news article** and thought it was about much-needed VA help for homeless Veterans. It was a particularly emotional issue for one Veteran, who got teary while discussing her thoughts about it.
     1. Those who noticed the "All VA News" link in the box thought it would be more information about homelessness, or questioned why it was there because it had nothing to do with the homelessness benefit information.
     2. When asked what other types of content should be shown here, several participants said they wanted information about recent legislation enacted, changes in VA benefits or procedures, or specific VA benefits (e.g., disability/claims, education, housing loans). 
3. Almost half of the participants **didn't know what "Yellow Ribbon" means**, which was listed under the heading "Other search tools".
