# Research Plan for VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Testing [Sitewide Home Page team, August 2022]

## Background
The current VA.gov website was launched in 2018 but hadn't been the subject of much user research until [Baseline Wayfinding Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md) was conducted in April 2021. Findings from this research and also from [Search Design Concepts Usability Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/research-findings.md) have been incorporated into a new VA.gov home page design.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
1. Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online 
1. Veterans can manage their health services online 
1. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online

### Veteran Journey
Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We will observe which areas of the home page they use and how well it supports Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks. 

### Outcome
This research will inform iterations to the home page redesign, the need for future research, and release decisions.

### Research questions
*Note: In this research plan, "successfully completing" a task means that a participant has navigated to a web page on VA.gov where they could do that task or sign in to do the task (participants will NOT sign in during the sessions).*
1. Are ALL participants able to easily complete tasks from the home page? *("easily" = being able to figure out where to go and not get stuck)*
    1. For tasks that are the same as those from last year's baseline wayfinding research, how do success rates compare with last year? 
3. Which parts of the home page do participants use to complete tasks and how? Where do they go first?
    1. "Sign in or create account" button
    3. "Common tasks"
    4. The new search box (next to common tasks)
    5. "Other search tools" (next to common tasks)
    6. Benefit hubs (below search and common tasks)--Are they used at all?
    7. The main content of the page (between the header and footer)--Did they scroll all the way down the page?
    8. VAntage Point blog promo (below search and common tasks)
    9. Header (including Search, Sign in, VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu)
    10. Footer 
1. When do participants search (by typing into a box) *vs.* browse (clicking on links, like the benefit hubs)?
    1. Are there differences between browsing/learning tasks *vs.* managing tasks?
    2. Are there differences between people more *vs.* less familiar with VA benefits? 
3. Is there anything that participants find unclear or confusing on the home page? 
    1. Other search tools?
4. What are participants' expectations of the VAntage Point blog promo content?
    1. What content would be helpful to be there?
    2. How often should the content be refreshed?
3. Where do participants typically go to get information and benefits from the VA? (i.e., search engine, VA.gov, call VA, etc.)

### Areas of focus
In this research, we are primarily interested in the following areas of the home page as used in task completion:
- Login/signup CTA
- Common task list
- Search
- Benefit hubs
- VAntage Point blog promo

### Hypotheses
1. The prominent sign in/sign up location and CTA makes it easier for participants to easily sign in/sign up.
1. More participants will use the prominent sign in/sign up CTA than the button in the header.
1. The streamlined design enables participants to complete tasks efficiently. 
    1. For tasks that are the same as those used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates will be higher.
1. Participants will know to search for tasks not listed as "common tasks". 
1. Participants understand where "other search tools" links will take them and what they will find there.
1. A focused and prominently displayed VAntage Point blog promo increases participants' engagement with the content.
1. Participants will scroll all the way down the home page to the footer (even if they don't look at links in the footer). 
2. Most participants start with a search engine, not VA.gov.

## Method	
We will conduct **remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom**. Participants will be asked a few questions about their past usage of the VA.gov site, and then will be given some **Veteran top tasks** (per findings from the Veteran Top Tasks Unmoderated Survey in June 2022) **as 
wayfinding prompts** to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server. Some top tasks will be represented in the "common tasks" section of the redesigned home page, and others will not. For any tasks that were used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates will be compared to assess the home page redesign. 

Participants will be asked to complete some tasks based on which VA benefits they have experience with, per their responses to questions at the beginning of the session. Each participant will do a subset of the full list of tasks in the conversation guide. We will **track how many participants complete each task and make note of which tasks need to get prioritized in subsequent sessions**. If we're unable to find enough participants that meet the benefit qualification for a particular task, the backup plan is to ask any participant to do that task.
