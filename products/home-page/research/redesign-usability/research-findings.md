# Research Goals
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page were used and how well it supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 

- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
*Note: In this research plan, "successfully completing" a task means that a participant has navigated to a web page on VA.gov where they could do that task or sign in to do the task (participants did NOT sign in during the sessions).*
1. Are ALL participants able to easily complete tasks from the home page? *("easily" = being able to figure out where to go and not get stuck)*
    1. For tasks that are the same as those from last year's baseline wayfinding research, how do success rates compare with last year? 
3. Which parts of the home page do participants use to complete tasks and how? Where do they go first?
    1. "Sign in or create account" button
    3. "Common tasks"
    4. The new search box (next to Common tasks)
    5. "Other search tools" (next to Common tasks)
    6. Benefit hubs (below search and Common tasks)--Are they used at all?
    7. The main content of the page (between the header and footer)--Did they scroll all the way down the page?
    8. VAntage Point blog promo (below search and Common tasks)
    9. Header (including Search, Sign in, VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu)
    10. Footer 
1. When do participants search (by typing into a box) *vs.* browse (clicking on links, such as the benefit hubs)?
    1. Are there differences between browsing/learning tasks *vs.* managing tasks?
    2. Are there differences between people more *vs.* less familiar with VA benefits? 
3. Is there anything that participants find unclear or confusing on the home page? 
    1. Other search tools?
4. What are participants' expectations of the VAntage Point blog promo content?
    1. What content would be helpful to be there?
    2. How often should the content be refreshed?
3. Where do participants typically go to get information and benefits from the VA? (i.e., search engine, VA.gov, call VA, etc.) 

## Areas of focus
In this research, we were primarily interested in the following areas of the home page as used in task completion:
- The new "Sign in or create an account" CTA
- The new Search box
- Other search tools
- Common tasks list
- VAntage Point blog promo
- Benefit hubs

# Methodology 
We conducted **remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom**. Participants were asked a few questions about their experiences with VA benefits, and then were given some **Veteran top tasks** (per [Veteran Top Tasks Unmoderated Survey findings from June 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-findings.md)) **as wayfinding prompts** to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server. Some of the top tasks were listed in the "Common tasks" section of the redesigned home page, while others were not. For the 5 tasks that were also used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates were compared to assess the home page redesign with the baseline (which is the current home page on Production). 

Participants were asked to complete some tasks based on which VA benefits they had experience with, per their responses to questions at the beginning of the session. **Each participant did a subset of the full list of 20 tasks in the conversation guide**, and for each, we recorded whether they were successful and also their ease rating on a scale from 1-5. Over the course of the sessions, we tracked how many participants completed each task and prioritized tasks that hadn't been completed by enough participants yet in order to get feedback on each task from at least 4 participants (we surpassed this goal by having each task completed by at least 6 people).

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. The prominent sign in location and CTA makes it easier for participants to easily sign in/sign up (as compared to the "sign in" link in the header, a standard place to log in on many websites).
     1. PROBABLY FALSE: Most participants didn't click *either* "sign in" button, and of those who did, 2 used the new prominent button and 4 used the old button in the header. 3 other participants were confused or annoyed at seeing two separate "sign in" buttons, so perhaps the old button in the familiar location in the header is sufficient. 
3. More participants will use the prominent sign in CTA than the button in the header.
     1. FALSE: Of those who chose to sign in from the home page, only 2 participants used the new "sign in" button, whereas four used the original "sign in" button in the header. All other participants (13) instead used "sign in" buttons on content pages.
5. The streamlined design enables participants to complete tasks efficiently. 
     1. PARTLY TRUE: 16 of the 20 tasks were successfully completed by at least 70% of the participants who tried them. However, some participants struggled to complete some of the tasks, and 4 tasks were unable to be completed by 40-50% of those who tried them.  
1. For tasks that are the same as those used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates will be higher.
     1. PARTLY TRUE: Three tasks had improved task completion rates, but two tasks had lower task completion rates (*Message your doctor, Add spouse*).
6. Participants will know to search for tasks not listed as "common tasks". 
     1. FALSE: Some participants didn't use "Common tasks", and of those who did, most participants didn't use search and instead tried browsing elsewhere on the home page. Only 4 of 19 participants searched when they couldn't find what they were looking for in "common tasks".
8. Participants understand where "other search tools" links will take them and what they will find there.
     1. PARTLY TRUE: Most participants understood and/or used at least one of the links (most often "Education benefits"). However, "Yellow Ribbon" was problematic because half of the participants didn't know what it was, and some who did questioned why the link was separate from "Education benefits".
10. A focused and prominently displayed VAntage Point blog promo increases participants' engagement with the content.
     1. FALSE: No participants said anything about the Vantage blog promo, nor clicked on it while doing tasks (no tasks were related to it). The only engagement was when the moderator asked specifically about it at the end of the research session.
12. Participants will scroll all the way down the home page to the footer (even if they don't look at links in the footer). 
     1. MOSTLY TRUE: Most participants (79%) scrolled all the way down the home page to the footer. 
14. Most participants start with a search engine, not VA.gov.
     1. FALSE: **Only 5 of 19 participants said they use google to get VA information**. 9 said they go to VA.gov. Others said they call VA or visit in person, use MHV or eBenefits, use the VA mobile app, ask other people, ask on Facebook, or use emails from VA or other organizations (e.g., American Legion, VFW, MOAA).


# Key Findings
1. **Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searched only when browsing didn’t work**. 

1. **Most participants' navigation of the home page often didn't include the entire page but only certain parts of it.** 
     1. Most research participants used the header, *Common tasks, Other search tools*, and the Benefit hubs on the redesigned home page. 
     1. Almost half of the participants used the new search box, and many fewer used the "sign in or create account" button. 
     1. **Most participants (79%) scrolled all the way down** the home page to the footer.

1. **Of the 20 top tasks tested, 9 tasks were completed successfully by *everyone* who tried them, 7 were completed by *most* who tried them, and 4 were completed by *only half* of those who tried them.** 
1. **Most sign-ins didn't happen on the home page** (with "Sign in or create an account" near the photos or "Sign in" in the header). 
1. **Two accessibility issues were discovered with the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu** on desktop, both of which confused a pilot participant using a screen reader, and one of which also confused several sighted participants.  

1. **No participants said anything about the Vantage blog promo box entitled "Updates on Veteran homelessness" nor clicked on it while doing tasks** (no tasks were related to it).


# Details of Findings 

## 1. Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searched only when browsing didn’t work
We observed 5 distinct **browse *vs.* search usage patterns** among the participants:
1. (7 participants) **Browsed exclusively** and never used search to complete tasks.
1. (7 participants) **Started browsing and later discovered the search box**. They were impressed with the results and then used search more after that.
2. (3 participants) **Mostly browsed but tried search once**.
4. (1 participant) **Tried search first, had success a couple times, then got irrelevant results, and so stopped using search**. This participant only browsed after that.
5. (1 participant) **Searched exclusively** to complete tasks. This was the youngest participant in this research; this same behavior was observed in our youngest pilot participant, whose data isn't included in this report even though he's a Reservist. The second youngest participant never searched but only browsed, so with only these 3 data points, we can't conclusively link young age to searching behavior. When the participant who was searching exclusively didn't find what he was looking for, he tried different search strings or browsed links on the page he got to, rather than browsing on the home page.

One participant said they were giving a lower task rating because they *"had to do a search for it" (p4).* Some participants said that they browse first and avoid searching because they
- Don't like to type into the search box
- It's easier to click on something 
- Figure they can find what they need by browsing the topics shown
 
Below is some specific feedback on using search:
- At least 4 participants clicked on one of the auto-complete suggestions.
- 2 participants were annoyed that VA.gov search isn't as forgiving with spelling mistakes as Google is (e.g., "benifits" isn't recognized as the same as "benefits").

>  Regarding browsing and then trying searching: *"I gave up [on browsing] and used the search...search is better to use* vs. *so much to read [on the home page]--a whole page that I have to read, when I should be depending on search" (p14).*

> *"Getting used to using search...working pretty good...autofill function...seems intuitive" (p4).* 

Of the participants who tried search, **9 of them used the new search box, which is more than the 6 who used the existing link** in the header.
   
## 2. **Most participants' navigation of the home page often didn't include the entire page but only certain parts of it** 
Some participants found **one way to navigate that worked for them, which they used it for most tasks**, ignoring other parts of the home page. Here are some **different browsing focus patterns** that we observed:
1. Only the *VA Benefits and Health Care* megamenu in the header
1. Only *Common tasks* and *Other search tools*
1. Only the benefit hubs
2. Only the search box
3. A combination of some of the above but usually not all

**Most research participants used the header, *Common tasks, Other search tools*, and the Benefit hubs** on the redesigned home page. Almost half of the participants used the new search box, and many fewer used the new "sign in or create account" button. No one clicked on the Vantage blog promo. Below you can see the different areas of the redesigned home page labeled, followed by the percentages of participants who used each area of the page. 

![home-pg-areas](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/images/home-pg-areas.png)
    
![home-pg-clicks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/images/home-pg-clicks.png)
   
**4 participants didn't notice *Common tasks*, but many others used these links.** Participants suggested adding more items to the list, including mental health, change address, message doctor, burial info, and the most frequent searches.

**2 participants didn't notice *Other search tools*, but many others used these links.** 
- Many participants said that the links in *Other search tools* are useful quick links to other pages but not necessarily what they expected as "search tools", such as filters to narrow a search. Other participants thought that the phrase "search tools" makes sense to describe search for specific things, such as a form or a facility, but "education benefits" isn't a search tool in the same way.
- The inclusion of "Yellow Ribbon" was problematic because half of the participants didn't know what it was, and some who did questioned why the link was separate from "Education benefits".
- Two participants wondered why "Find a VA facility" and "Education benefits" were in "Other search tools" because they're also in the header.

**A lot of participants used the benefit hubs, and some focused most of their attention on that section** of the home page. Some feedback from individual participants:
- Like the benefit hubs along with their different colored icons
- Looks like everything in the megamenu
- Want a miscellaneous category for other stuff they couldn't find elsewhere (e.g., travel reimbursement).
- "Housing assistance" doesn't make sense for home loans, so perhaps split it up into 2 different topics: "VA home loan" and "Housing assistance".

**Most participants (79%) scrolled all the way down** the home page to the footer. This is an improvement over the current home page on Production, which has a row of images that gives the false impression of being the bottom of the page. In the 2021 baseline wayfinding study, only two-thirds of participants scrolled past the images.

## 3. Of the 20 top tasks tested, 9 tasks were completed successfully by *everyone*, and 4 were completed by *only half* of those who tried them
Different participants took very **different paths to complete the same tasks**, which was possible because there are many ways to navigate from the home page to the same content page. **Each of the top 20 tasks tested in this research was attempted by 6-10 participants** with varying degrees of success:
1. **9 tasks (almost half) were completed successfully by *everyone*** who tried them, some more quickly than others.
1. 7 tasks were completed successfully by 70-90% of those who tried them.
1. **4 tasks were completed successfully by only half (50-60%)** of those who tried them. 

A summary of the task completion and success rates for each task is shown below. Participant success rates were *not* correlated by participant age, mobile *vs.* desktop, experience with VA.gov, or whether the task was about learning/applying *vs.* managing benefits.

![task-success&ratings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/images/task-success%26ratings.png)

In comparing task success rates with last year's baseline wayfinding study, we see that 3 tasks improved with the home page redesign, but the success of 2 tasks unfortunately decreased: *Message your doctor*, and *Add a spouse*.

For the 4 most problematic tasks, below are the primary reasons why they were difficult and what might help make them easier:

Task | Why Difficult | What Could Potentially Help
------------------|--------------|-----------
File for disability increase | **Link goes to application for disability that doesn't mention filing for an increase** | Make clear on [disability application page](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction) that this form can be used to increase your *existing* disability rating (i.e., add to heading "or increase your current rating")
Add a spouse (review/update dependents) | **Couldn't find by browsing** (7 of 19 tried megamenu or benefit hubs > Family member benefits), 1 didn't recognize links with the word "dependent" as relevant | Add "View or change dependent" to Family Member Benefits page, on the home page somewhere, as a search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation" for "spouse" and "dependent"
Compare education benefits by school | 5 of 19 **didn't notice "GI Bill Comparison Tool" in right rail of megamenu > Education and training** | Change link in megamenu to GI Bill Comparison Tool to make it look more like a hyperlink instead of an ad
Check current disability compensation rates | **Couldn't find by searching** (tried "disability pay") **OR browsing** (tried megamenu > disability, megamenu > pension, benefit hubs > pension) | Add "View disability rates" to megamenu under Disability, search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation"   

Participants struggled with some of the other tasks, too, as shown in the table below:
Task | Why Difficult | What Could Potentially Help
------------------|--------------|-----------
Message your doctor | **Couldn't find by browsing**, used to doing from MHV and not VA.gov | Add "Manage your VA health care" link to home page, which leads to secure messaging, appointment scheduling, prescriptions, lab results, etc.
Get VA medical history/records | **Couldn't find by browsing** (tried megamenu > health care) | Add "Get your VA medical records" to home page, to megamenu under Health care
Find mental health counselor/therapist | **Couldn't find by searching** (tried "therapist", "counselor") **OR browsing**| Add "mental health" to home page, to megamenu under health care, to search autocomplete suggestions, to search "top recommendation" for "therapist" and "counselor" and "therapy"
Update your address with VA | **Couldn't find by browsing** (tried benefit hubs) | Add "Update contact info" to Common tasks, and in the Records benefit hub

From the most frequently done tasks reported in the [Veteran Top Tasks Unmoderated Survey Findings research report from July 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-findings.md), only two of those 5 tasks were included in this usability test. They're listed below with their success rates: 
- *Message your doctor* (83% completed successfully)
- *Check/update education benefits* (71% completed successfully)

## 4. Most sign-ins didn't happen on the home page (with "Sign in or create an account" near the photos or "Sign in" in the header). 

Neither sign-in button got much use during the research sessions:
- 2 participants used the new "Sign in or create account" button.
- 4 participants used the old "Sign in" button in the header.
- **Everyone else (13 participants) didn't use either sign-in button because they instead used the "sign in" button on specific content pages they navigated to later.**

A quarter of the participants (5 of 19) said that they'd sign in first--before using the home page--so they'd see customized links or wouldn't get interrupted later to sign in and then have to figure out how to get back to where they were.
- One participant said that they didn't think to sign in because they primarily use the VA mobile app, in which you stay signed in. 
 
3 participants pointed out that there were 2 different sign-in buttons and didn't need more than the one in the header. One of these participants said it was confusing to have two buttons in two different places that do the same thing.

## 5.  Two accessibility issues were discovered with the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu on desktop, both of which confused a pilot participant using a screen reader, and one of which also confused several sighted participants.

1. Several participants and a pilot participant had difficulty using the megamenu because it didn't work as expected. When the megamenu dropdown is opened, one dropdown option is already expanded--either the first option (Health care) or the one last opened. **Participants expected to see a list of dropdown options *without any of them expanded*.** 
- One participant wanted to browse the dropdown options but skipped health care because it was already open. 
- A different participant didn't open the Disability option because they didn't realize that the Health care option was already open. 
- A third participant was surprised by seeing Burial and Memorials still open from the previous time they opened the megamenu and had expected to choose which dropdown option to expand. 
- Opening the dropdown and having the health care option already expanded was confusing for our pilot participant using a screen reader.

> *"I thought it would clear out; you wouldn’t think a drop-down would save that [the last option opened]" (p23).*

2. Our pilot participant who uses a screen reader noticed that **clicking on a link in the megamenu led to a focus issue when the content page was opened**. When they clicked on *Education and training* and then *Eligibility*, the [Education eligibility page](https://staging.va.gov/education/eligibility/) that opened had focus still in the megamenu instead of on the title of the content page where it should have been.

## 6. **No participants said anything about the Vantage blog promo box entitled "Updates on Veteran homelessness" nor clicked on it while doing tasks**
There were no tasks related to the Vantage blog promo box, and no one mentioned it until the moderator asked about it during the post-task interview. Participants expressed their impressions in various ways:
1. Many participants **didn't realize that the Vantage box entitled "Updates on Veteran homelessness" was a news article and thought it featured an important VA benefit for homeless Veterans**. Some Veterans said that this information should be featured more prominently on the page, and some wanted to see how VA is helping now. Other participants thought that homeless Veterans may not see this information because they wouldn't have a computer or Internet access. It was a particularly emotional issue for one Veteran, who got teary while sharing her thoughts.
     
2. **Those who noticed the "All VA News" link in the box thought it would be more information about homelessness, or questioned why it was there at all because it had nothing to do with the homelessness benefit information.**
4. Two participants recognized the Vantage box as news, which they didn't care to look at on the home page. Two different participants suggested showing news articles in a rotating carrousel so they might be enticed to click on one.
5. **One participant said they thought it was a banner ad and so ignored it.**
1. Two participants said they didn't know what "PIT Count" means (it's "Point In Time" count). 
1. One participant thought the picture looked staged and also misleading because it appears to be about providing food, not housing.
1. One ex-pat participant said that the homeless information isn't that useful to anyone in the Philippines because they have no access to these programs overseas.
3. **When asked what other types of content should be shown in this section, several participants said they wanted information about recent legislation enacted (e.g., burn pit registry), changes in VA benefits or procedures, or specific VA benefits (e.g., education, disability/claims, housing loans, local Veterans homeless shelters or mobile assistance units).** 

Below are a few quotes.

> *"Why would I scroll all the way down to homelessness to get to the news?" (p4).*

> *"There are homeless Veterans on every corner...in my community...no one's helping them. Have to fight to get disability...They've already done that, got denied, and there's no fight left in them...It is hard for me to believe they [VA] are doing much of anything to help...to see how they are pushed to the side. I am not sure if they are getting the help or not accepting the help...I want to see how VA is actually helping...I want to see the people out there actually caring for those Veterans" (p9).*

> *"Many Vets don't know that VA can help" (p11, who writes down the 800 number and gives it to homeless Veterans that he sees).*

> *"If it looks like a banner ad, I'd be more likely to ignore it...we're trained to ignore banner ads" (p22).*

> *"I hate the photograph--What's in the bag? Getting free food? Not housing assistance but food assistance" (p14).*

> *"Putting it on a platform that homeless Veterans may not have access to would be pointless. Being out there handing the information out instead of placing it on the website and hope they would come across it would be best" (p22).*

## 7. **Additional usability feedback on the home page**

We heard some additional usability feedback on the home page and other VA.gov pages:
1. One participant suggested removing the 3 photos of Veterans because they *"don't do anything" (p14)*--i.e, you can't interact with them.
1. One participant said that there are too many clicks to get to information from the home page.
2. Two participants said that there's too much text on some of the VA.gov pages, for example, in the light blue box on the [Burial Eligibility page](https://staging.va.gov/burials-memorials/eligibility/).
1. About a quarter of the participants (5 of 19) said that they call the VA when they get stuck trying to find something on VA.gov.
1. One participant said that the **smallest font size was too small for them to read**. This text included the benefit hub descriptions and the common tasks listed. 

> *"Don't bury so many things so deep...[check education benefits] buried under too many clicks...want two clicks max...After two clicks I would stop because I don’t want to have to click five times to get to what I am looking for...search until I get tired, and then use the VA 800 number" (p9).*

> *"Makes you read a lot of stuff you shouldn't have to read" (p14).*

> *"I would scan it. I would eventually have to read it once I was frustrated" (p16).*


## Other Findings
1. One ex-pat Veteran would like the "Use my location" link in the "Find a VA Facility" tool to work in the Philippines (which has the only VA offices outside the US) by directing people to the Manila clinic and regional offices. "Use my location" appears to work only in the US.
1. A few participants looked at the footer, and their individual feedback included the following:
     1. Liked the links for Women Veterans, Minority Veterans, LGBTQ+ Veterans, and PTSD--especially LGBTQ+ and PTSD because it applied to them.
     2. Went to the footer to look for a VA facility because that's where "contact us" information is located on web pages.
     3. There are too many links to look through 

> *"I'm not going to read through that list" (p19).*


## Pain Points about VA

We heard some pain points about VA in general, which is included below but not analyzed because it's outside the scope of this study:
1. When you're signed into VA.gov and need to go to MHV, it's "frustrating and aggravating" that you have to log out of VA.gov and then sign into MHV.
1. It's frustrating to have to submit new evidence to the VA from information they already have when applying for a disability increase.

> *"VA has all my stuff but they want me to resubmit it as new evidence. Have to download the info from VA, highlight what the doctor said on what day, and then submit it as new evidence...then schedule another appointment" (p9).*

3. Didn't hear anything back from primary care provider after sending multiple messages inquiring about chest x-ray results.

> *"Huge problem: primary doctor not available most of the time. See every 6 months. Then they change the doctor on you--no consistency" (p14).*

4. You can't been seen at a VA clinic while traveling until you register with the local site. Seems like I should already be in the VA computer system.
1. I can't figure out how to do travel reimbursement since the process moved online recently. It's convoluted and fails. They used to have an ID scanner at the VA site and got payment automatically.
1. Travel expenses to medical appointments are no longer covered in the Philippines, which often involves a flight to a different island and a hotel stay.

# Recommendations
## For the home page redesign effort
1. **Keep the new search box** because many more participants found it and used it as compared to search in the header.
2. Consider the following **revisions to the *Common tasks*** section:
     1. Make the section (at least the header) stand out more visually so it's noticed by more people.
     2. Add more top tasks to the list, including Get mental health help, Update your address, and Message your doctor.
3. Consider the following **revisions to the *Other search tools*** section:
     1. Make the section (at least the header) stand out more visually so it's noticed by more people.
     2. Consider removing "Education benefits" because it's not a search tool like "Find a form" and "Find a VA facility". 
     3. Remove the "Yellow Ribbon" link because a lot of people don't know what it is, and it's confusing to have a second education link.
     4. Possibly rename *Other search tools* since this name wasn't clear to some people.
1. **Consider renaming the "Sign in or create account" button to "Create an account"** so that it specifically addresses people who don't yet have an account. Most participants in this research were accustomed to using the "Sign in" button in the header to access the account they already have, and some were confused by seeing a second button. 
1. **Try to ensure that all top tasks can be accomplished via both searching and browsing** in order to support people who only search or only browse. Consider adding the following to the home page, which may help:
     1. Add "Manage your VA health care" link, which leads to secure messaging, appointment scheduling, prescriptions, lab results, etc.
     2. Add "Get your VA medical records" to Common tasks.
     3. Add "mental health" to Common tasks.
     4. Add "Update contact info" to Common tasks.
     5. Add "View or change dependent" to Common tasks.
9. **Check the font size of the text of the benefit hub descriptions and the list of common tasks and consider enlarging it**. The current minimum font size for VA.gov is 16px, but Gov.UK recommends 19px for older populations, which we should consider. 

## Beyond the home page (out of scope but can discuss with other teams)  

7. **Try to ensure that all top tasks can be accomplished via both searching and browsing** in order to support people who only search or only browse. Consider making the following changes that may help:
     1. Add "Get your VA medical records" to the megamenu under Health care.
     3. Add "mental health" to the megamenu under health care, to search autocomplete suggestions, to search "top recommendation" for "therapist", "counselor", and "therapy".
     4. Add "Update contact info" to the Records benefit hub.
     5. Add "View or change dependent" to Family Member Benefits page, a search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation" for "spouse" and "dependent".
     6. Add "View disability rates" to megamenu under Disability, as a search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation".
     7. Make clear on the [disability application page](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction) that this form can be used to increase your *existing* disability rating (i.e., add to heading "or increase your current rating").
     8. Change link in megamenu to GI Bill Comparison Tool to make it look more like a hyperlink instead of an ad.

8. **Fix the two accessibility issues with the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu on desktop** *(discussed with Josh Kim and Laura Flannery)*:
     1.  **Change the megamenu interaction to be more like a standard dropdown** in which all options are shown whenever it's opened *without any of the options already expanded until the user selects one.*
     2.  **Fix the focus issue when you click on a link in the megamenu** so focus is on the page title, not the megamenu option clicked on.
10. Consider whether **some common misspellings could be handled more gracefully by search**, such as a search for "benifits" being able to return the results as if "benefits" were typed.

# Next Steps

- Present results to Sitewide Public Websites, Health Apartment, Authenticated Experience, and any other interested teams.
- Discuss possible design changes to the redesigned home page, and then do another round of usability testing on the revised page.
- Look at home page analytics to assess the usage of the current task links on Production.
