## Overview
This project's objective is to allow Veterans' nursing home officials to submit supporting evidence to justify Aid & Attendance or Housebound benefits which increases their monthly compensation or pension benefits.

## Problem Statement
A Request for Nursing Home Information in Connection with Claim for Aid and Attendance (VA Form 21-0779) is completed in order to provide supporting documentation for an Aid and Attendance benefit claim when the Veteran is a resident of a nursing home. The nursing home in which the Veteran resides completes the form provide the Veteran's medical needs and the level of care required. This information helps the VA to determine eligibility for increased pension payments to cover long-term care costs. 

VA Form 21-0779 is required when a Veteran resides in a nursing home. Currently:  
- Entirely paper-based  
- Error-prone, inaccessible  
- Lack of guidance on use and required fields  

**How might we enable nursing homes to submit information digitally to support Aid & Attendance claims?**

## Desired User Outcomes

- Nursing home officials can submit VA Form 21-0779 on VA.gov

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Nursing home officials will prefer submitting a paper version of the form 


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Employees at the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) are able to process requests quicker

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- There is an increased time in processing requests

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

**KPIs**  
- Error rate  
- Rejection rate  
- Submission completion rate  
- Processing time  

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

**OKRs**  
- Reduce rejection rate by 10% in MVP  
- Reduce processing/adjudication time by 15% in MVP

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

- Multi-party routing/signatures are out of scope.  
- Notifications are out of scope.  


## Solution Approach

- Build single-party MVP (nursing home side).  
- Future: expand to multiparty routing.  

### Supporting research

- Minimal for MVP, plan for post-launch usability studies.  

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*

- Initiative | [Link to Initiative Brief](#) - TBD

## Launch Strategy
- IA to ensure searchability on VA.gov.  
- VBA communications/media support under the November 111 initiative.  
- [Link to Release Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/release-plan-template.md) - TBD

## Launch Dates
- *Target Launch Date*
  - November 11, 2025
- *Actual Launch Date* 
  - tbd
- *What date will you evaluate impact after launch (and when do you expect to have your Impact Review)?*
  - Post-iteration 2
