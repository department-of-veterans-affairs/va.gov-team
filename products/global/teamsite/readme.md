## Narrative
To achieve consistent navigation and branding across VA.gov pages, a client side script is used to overwrite the Teamsite header and footer. The [Teamsite Overview](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/platform/architecture/teamsite/#teamsite-overview) covers the high level technical challenges.

## Current Status

- No major updates since January. 
- Development is complete but VA.gov header has not been released to all Teamsite pages.
