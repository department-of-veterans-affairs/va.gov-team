# Saving an application

When signed in, we show users that the application has been saving automatically as they progress.

Whenever a form is saved, we show a confirmation message:
![saved](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Global/SiP-Prefill/Sep2017/Saved.png)

When a user clicks on "finish this application later", they end up at a confirmation screen:

# Relocating an application

Research shows that most people come back to Vets.gov, scroll down the homepage and click on the benefit they were applying for to look for their saved application. Therefore we are showing saved application "cards" in the following pages:

### Benefits landing page
![Benefits_landing_page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Global/SiP-Prefill/Sep2017/Pension%20LP.png)

### Eligibility page
![Eligibility](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Global/SiP-Prefill/Sep2017/Eligibility.png)

### Application process page
![Application_Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Global/SiP-Prefill/Sep2017/Application%20process.png)

### Application entry page
![Application entry](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Global/SiP-Prefill/Sep2017/Pension%20entry.png)

# Profile page

We also store all the saved application in the user's profile page
![Profile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Global/SiP-Prefill/Sep2017/Profile.png)

# Expired application

We replace all the "application is progress" blue cards with the following expired yellow card:
![Expired](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Global/SiP-Prefill/Sep2017/Pension%20LP%20expired.png)

Similarly on the profile page:
![Profile_expired](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Global/SiP-Prefill/Sep2017/Profile_expired.png)

Dismissing the expired message in one location will dismiss them in all locations.
