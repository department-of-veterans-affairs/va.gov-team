# Form Pre-Population

This is an integration with the Enterprise Military Information Service (eMIS) so that we can provide information to Veterans logged into vets.gov at LOA3.

## Problem Statement (User Story)
As a veteran completing benefits forms, I want my military service information to be prepopulated in these forms from a canonical source, so that my repondent burden is reduced.
