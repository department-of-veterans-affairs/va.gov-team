## On the content design side

What icons should we be supporting? Are we just launching with the megaphone visible with the Afghanistan promo banner, or others? What is the semantic intent of each icon?



* “Benefits Announcement”
    * Megaphone icon
* “News” (never been used)
* “Email signup” (never been used)

[This is all documented in the design system](https://design.va.gov/components/promo-banners)

**Are links required for promo banners, or can this be used for info purposes only.**

Yes, links are required

Text.

**Character limits for the text.**

Current Afghanistan is around the limit. It has 42. 

Decision: 55 characters. 

**Text formatting limits**)

Plain text

**Link**

Should allow external or internal


## On the governance side:

**Who do we expect to be managing promo banners in the next quarter. (eg, OPIA?)**



* OPIA owns the Afghanistan one

**Content lifecycle--who should be able to create, approve, publish, archive, for Q1 next year. Similar to full width banner? or any differences.**



* For now, only allow content admins to create, to prevent duplicates etc
* Public Websites owns this decision for now, until additional governance measures can be designed / introduced.
* FE should only allow one… oldest one (sort by creation date)
* No expiration date for now.

**URL targeting** 



* Default every page
* Same governance as full width banner,  only content admins can edit

**Any sense of future users of promo banners** (for example, we've discussed VAMC as a possible user group, after a later iteration)



* For later 


## Editorial experience

Should [reflect design system documenation](https://design.va.gov/components/promo-banners) as much as possible. 


## Other

Rename Banner to “full width alert”
