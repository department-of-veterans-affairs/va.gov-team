## Email from Jenny Heiland-Luedtke on 3/26/2018 with examples of natural disaster banners across VHA from Hurricane Irma

### Example: Hurricane Irma messages on VHA websites

Here are examples of the messages we posted at the national level  about hurricanes. In combination with local information maintained by VAMCs, it worked ok, although in retrospect I wish we’d thought to do campaign URLs on some of this so we could’ve tracked use of the links better.

A national alert banner is on every VAMC website and every VISN website. Per Mary Kay’s suggestion, I switched the order of the hurricane names just now on the national alert we had up and the text on the VHA homepag. I cannot make the font larger (controlled by templates).
 
Here is a snip showing the current alert that is on every VAMC and VISN website (snip below from Dayton’s site: https://www.dayton.va.gov/):

The same Hurricane Update text is on the VHA homepage:

In addition, we worked with vets.gov and My HealtheVet to get links to the VAntage Point info on their homepages:
