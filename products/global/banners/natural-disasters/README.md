## Email from Jenny Heiland-Luedtke on 3/26/2018 with examples of natural disaster banners across VHA from Hurricane Irma

### [Example: Hurricane Irma messages on VHA websites](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Global/Banners/Background-Info/Natural-Disasters/20180326%20Example-%20Hurricane%20Irma%20messages%20on%20VHA%20websites%20.pdf)

Here are examples of the messages we posted at the national level  about hurricanes. In combination with local information maintained by VAMCs, it worked ok, although in retrospect I wish we’d thought to do campaign URLs on some of this so we could’ve tracked use of the links better.

A national alert banner is on every VAMC website and every VISN website. Per Mary Kay’s suggestion, I switched the order of the hurricane names just now on the national alert we had up and the text on the VHA homepag. I cannot make the font larger (controlled by templates).
 
Here is a snip showing the current alert that is on every VAMC and VISN website (snip below from Dayton’s site: https://www.dayton.va.gov/):

The same Hurricane Update text is on the VHA homepage:

In addition, we worked with vets.gov and My HealtheVet to get links to the VAntage Point info on their homepages:
