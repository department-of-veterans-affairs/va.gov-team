# Mobile App Promotion Banner Initiative Brief

Epic: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/13482

#### Overview

Currently there is limited marketing of the VA.gov mobile app from within the benefit hubs. Using patterns created by Apple and others e.g. [Smart App Banners](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/promoting_apps_with_smart_app_banners) we can increase the adoption and overall use of the VA.gov mobile app by placing the banners on the appropriate tool landing pages that map to features/functions available in the mobile app.

#### Using Mobile Analytics Monthly Report for engagement monitoring
For each KPI structured as ‚ÄúIncreased iOS App engagement with ,‚Äù there are two possible types of engagement measurements that can be viewed on the Mobile Monthly Report dashboard.
1. Total number of unique active users engaging with a feature
2. Total number of events logged for specific app analytics

All KPIs can be monitored by the former. Not all will have the latter.

**Total number of unique active users engaging with a feature**
* Go to the dashboard page ‚ÄúApp Users‚Äù (in the left-hand menu)
    * Apply ‚ÄúOperating system‚Äù filter at top of page to see only iOS counts.
    * If necessary, update the date range filter to the time frame of interest.
* Go to the table under ‚ÄúBy feature‚Äù
* View the row for the feature related to the KPI to see the total number of unique active users.

**Total number of events logged for specific app analytics**
* Go to the dashboard page ‚ÄúApp Events‚Äù (in the left-hand menu)
    * Apply ‚ÄúOperating system‚Äù filter at top of page to see only iOS counts.
    * If necessary, update the date range filter to the time frame of interest.
* Go to the top table ‚ÄúApp Events‚Äù
* Sort by column ‚ÄúFeature‚Äù to be able to see all the events connected to a given feature next to one another.
* In the KPI table above, the specific events most directly related to each KPI are named in the ‚ÄúLink to data source‚Äù column.**Some features do not have specific events relevant to the KPI.**

### Possible additional KPIs/tracking
This data is not currently tracked (as of May 2023). As a result it may not specifically be MVP but fast-follow as the above measurements can provide indicators of success whereas some of these measures can provide definitive success metrics.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
- Mobile app does not have 100% parity with VA.gov website and that's OK. This UX feature will only appear on tool landing pages that have parity.
- Cannibalizing mobile web traffic to mobile app use is a good thing.
- Only targeting Apple/iOS/Safari users is sufficient for proof-of-concept and learnings are transferrable to Android device user behavior.
- We can use the out-of-the-box design behavior from Apple for POC and there will not be accessibility problems. (**Mitigated** - This was confirmed by accessibility expert review of "in the wild" functions of Apple Smart Banners in May 2023)

### What're you building

MVP will be to:
* Use Apple's Smart App Banners only, because this is COTS OOB behavior requiring no design and leveraging existing user-expected patterns.
* Create a means by which we specify the specific URLs app promotion happens
* Place the Smart banner on the following pages mapped to the following functions. (Note, we cannot deep-link into the App at this time)
* The VA.gove Flagship mobile app-id is 1559609596
* We will **not** include deep, navigational linking parameters (app-argument) in MVP as the Flagship Mobile App does not currrently support this function.
* We will **not** include campaign linking at this time due to limited Apple documentation for campaigns and smart banners.
