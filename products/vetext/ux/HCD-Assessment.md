# VEText Initial HCD Assessment
Last updated: Feb 24, 2021

**Opportunities:** Using SMS texting to communicate with Veterans provides a light-touch and (potentially) familiar communication pathway without the convolution and delays in other methods of communication within the VA landscape. The scope of best-use-cases needs further exploration and definition. Allowing staff control over and insight into the success of text-based outreach efforts provides custom experiences for each clinic based on their needs and capacity.

**Risks:** Expectations for texting are varied and particular, but at this point unknown with our end users. Automating workflows typically resolved with human intervention can result in less satisfying experience for people whose needs fall outside of the expected flow. Granting sites access to control over texting their users opens the door for high-impact errors and poor experiences for Vets.

## Process Recs

**Increase Channels for Veteran Input (In Progress)**
Opportunities to incorporate the perspectives of Veteran end-users are limited to occasional research efforts and second-hand reports from staff, leading to dead-ends and unsatisfying user experience for all but the happy-path.

**Aim to Reduce Utilization of Internal Support Email Channel**
Of the common reasons for high use of support channels (perception of complexity, roadblocks, service errors, and missing/confusing information), perception of complexity and missing information are the most common in the VEText user experience. One off solutions miss the systemic issues reflected in this pattern.
Appropriately Scale Cycle from Definition to Delivery
On the one hand, this short cycle from problem identification to solution deployment prioritizes solving urgent user needs and requests, on the other hand, it prevents the possibility of deeper ideation, research, and testing, and leads to fragmentation, not simplification and clarification.  

**Vary Channels for Continuous Discovery for Staff Users**
The current channels for communication from staff using the VEText portal allow for strong influence from this group of users on the direction of the product, but do not account for quieter voices among staff users to reveal day-to-day irritations. 

**Diversify Testing Processes**
Current testing consists of internal checks on particular workflows and pilot site use. Adding in an additional layer to observe non-internal users before launching in a pilot could catch high-impact UX issues, opportunities, and bugs.

## Existing Product Usability: Staff Experience

**VEText Portal Heuristic Eval (In Progress)**


Initial concerns:
- Visibility of System Status: Requests for updates and status from users suggests that status and states not easily interpretable
- Match Between System & Real World: Setup of clinic experiences and conversation message templates map more directly to backend models than real-world implementation.
- User Control & Freedom: Highly configurable and customizable, but limitations not clear to users.
- Error Prevention: High use of support email to correct mistakes suggests error prevention could be improved.
- Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors: Requests to email list suggest confidence in error resolution is low.
- Help & Support Documentation: Thorough support knowledge base exists separate from tool, best practice is to place helpful support in context.

In progress/more research needed:
- Consistency and Standards
- Aesthetic and Minimal Design
- Recognition Rather Than Recall
- Flexibility and Efficiency

## Existing Product Usability: Veteran Experience

**Gaps In Understanding of Vet Experience**

**Limited Agency Over Text Experience**

**Low Response Rate to COVID 2-Way Sched & OSM**

**Message Flow Dead Ends & Errors**

## Product UX Next Steps
- Research effort focused on VA texting experience for veterans overall. Who is interested in texting? Why/why not? What would they expect from texting? Who would benefit from access to communicating with VA this way?
- Resolving message flow dead ends & drop offs
- Research effort focused on Staff experience across roles, MSA and Admin. What are the gaps in their user experience? Where do they get stuck? What problems to Vets ask them to solve?
- Address heuristic eval concerns where possible
