# VEText
VEText is a platform for sending SMS messages to Veterans. These messages can be either one way or interactive. It was developed to lower no-show rates for Veterans’ health appointments by a team at the VA Loma Linda Healthcare system and rolled out nationally in 2018. 

While its primary use case is operational messaging, VEText’s interaction with VistA opens it up to many potential applications across VA departments. It has grown into a complex rules engine with a backend portal, allowing for highly customizable administration of messaging including templates, reporting and workflow management by VA site staff. 

In 2020 the VEText team moved to the OCTO to give it a national scope, and is now managed and supported by OCTO staff and contractors.
