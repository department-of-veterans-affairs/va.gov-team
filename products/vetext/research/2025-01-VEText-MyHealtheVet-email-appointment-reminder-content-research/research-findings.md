## Research Goals
- What content do Veterans want/expect in email health appointment reminders?

- What schedule is most effective for receiving appointment reminders?

- If email reminders are not useful currently, what could make them useful?


### Outcome
This research will allow us to gauge Veteran satisfaction with current email appointment reminders. Additionally, we may learn what can improve and then make content, functionality or cadence changes accordingly.

   This will:

  - Increase recipient satisfaction

  - Decrease oversaturation of reminders

  - Improve care by getting Veterans to their appointments, prepared with necessary information


## Research Questions

1. Overall do Veterans find value in email appointment reminders? Why or why not?
2. Is there a way to make the content or cadence of email appointment reminders more useful?


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

* **Hypothesis 1:** Veterans want more information in MHV emails inclucing provider and location: **True**

    * *"I've gone to appointments where I don't know who I am going to see and I don't like that." -P6*
    * *"If it could say 4 North, which would be on the 4th floor on the North, that information would save time for me*
    * *"Where do you go? If you really want to show up there on time, that really helps"*  -P1
    * *"I can go down my appointment list right now and just look at the information and the date and I can tell you who it's with*" -P8
      
* **Hypothesis 2**: Veterans currently do not find the MHV email reminders as useful as the appointment list within the MHV portal: **Likely false**

    * Veterans are using emails (and texts) as confirmation and/or reference to more complete information that they have already recorded in their personal calendars or that some check in VA.gov app. Reminders are secondary to the more complete information they record at the time the appointment is made. More detailed information about the appointments (not contained in email reminder)comes from other sources (see below)
    * *"Typically what I'll do is go in and bounce that against my calendar, make sure there is not any inconsistencies" -P1*
    * *"I double check what they are saying and what I have because a lot of times, they have been wrong." -P6*
      
* Veterans get detailed information:
    * at the time of appointment/confirmation email
    * By making assumptions of who they are seeing and for what specialty based on prior knowledge of the location name
    * Calling the facilities, which can take a long time or cause frustration when a call goes to the general (not clinic-specific) number
    * Consulting the VA.gov app appointment information
    * Using mailed appointment postcards, which may not arrive on time/inconsistent


## Methodology	
1\. Our methodology will be a remote moderated interview of Veterans where we will discuss with Veterans what information they want in email reminders for health appointments and what they would expect to be included.

2\. After discussing what they would expect, we will show them an example of the existing MHV email reminder and ask them to share their thoughts on the content and cadence as well as how they currently use MHV email reminders.


## Key Findings

1. Participants want **more appointment details in email reminders**, specifically **provider**, **direct clinic phone numbers** and a more precise location information like **building number or floor.**

2. Email reminders serve Veterans well as a **reference and backup to confirming appointment information** already recorded in Veterans’ personal calendars.

3. **Lack of detailed information** in reminders **forces Veterans to be detectives,** infer information from clues, and **create their own workarounds** to retrieve appointment details.

4. Email appointment reminders need to **be concise, and the instructions** following the essential appointment information **is often skimmed or skipped as  “filler” or “boilerplate” information.**

5. Participants were **generally comfortable about PHI information being contained in their email reminders,** and the **usefulness of the additional information outweighs privacy concerns.**

6. Many participants would like **more control over how they receive reminders** and **what information is contained within** them.

7. ***Notification Preferences*** section in the proposed, newly-formatted MHV email was **mostly understood to be where Veterans can select the kind and amount of reminders they receive.** However, participants noted that this section is located in the part of the email that they **mostly skim or skip** because they focus only on appointment details.

8. **Punctuality** fulfills Veterans in several ways including **feeling prepared**, being able to **economize trips to distant VAs** and demonstrating **respect to fellow Veterans**. **Precise and updated content in reminders play a role in facilitating timeliness.**

9. **Format of emails, including font size and contrast**, has a significant **impact on usability.**

10. **Changes** to the current MHV email format **should be communicated to Veterans** in advance of release and **across multiple channels.**
<br />
<br />

## Details of Findings 


**1.   What appointment details do Veterans want in MHV email appointment reminders?**

Participants most consistently listed **date, time and place as essential detail information for appointment reminders.** This was a minimum and reflects the non-PHI details included in current MHV email reminders. **Provider name (8/11 participants)** and an exact **address specifically including floor and/or building name (7/11 participants)** were also repeated as desired details. One participant remarked that providers change frequently so that listing a provider was not as important. Participants cited the following reasons including provider's name: feeling **better prepared,** **personalizing interactions,** and not having an **expected provider switched to an unfamiliar provider** after driving a long distance for a visit. While **more than half of participants expressed a desire to add the address with building and/or floor** to help navigation and faster way-finding, one participant had **concerns that databases would not be maintained and out-of-date floor/building number might get communicated** in emails which could cause confusion.


> - “*If you're going to a new provider, it's kind nice to have their name.” - P4*
> - *“There's been some switcheroonies going on when I go to the doctor.” - P3*
> - *“If it could say 4 North, which would be on the 4th floor on the North, that information would save time for me.” - P1*

Most participants also **appreciated the inclusion of modality of appointment (in-person, video, phone)** as was included in the PHI reminder sample. Current MHV emails indicate that a Veteran can call to confirm the modality of appointment. One participant remarked how **inconvenient that call would be for a single detail** and said they would not make a phone call for that purpose. Only one participant mentioned that detail was not important as they attended in-person appointments exclusively.

Including the **status of an appointment (whether it has been canceled or confirmed) was important to include for 5 participants.** For **two participants, status was not important to include.** And one participant indicated that **listing the status felt judgmental.**
 
> - *“To me that's a little standoffish that you're counting how many times that I cancel." - P3*

In comparing a list of all upcoming appointments versus a single appointment per email, **8/11 participants preferred to having all upcoming appointments included in a single email,** as it helped them plan and prepare. 2/11 participants preferred to have only the most immediately upcoming appiontment in a reminder email.

<br />
<br />

**2. Email reminders serve Veterans well as a reference and backup to confirming appointment information already recorded in Veterans’ personal calendars.**

**All participants said that they regularly open and read MHV email appointment reminders,** though one specified that it was secondary to reading text reminders. The most **common usage of email appointment reminders** was to cross-reference or **doublecheck the information that participants recorded in their personal digital calendars or paper calendars.** All but one participant described how they documented their appointments in their personal calendars almost immediately after scheduling the appointment, taking advantage of the ability to link the appointment to their calendar through email confirmations/reminders. Then, when a reminder came, they used the reminder to **confirm nothing had changed or to “reassure” them that they had recorded the information correctly.** One participant kept all reminder emails in an email folder as a reference archive. Only one participant said they did not record appointments to a personal calendar, and felt confident in their own memory and reminders.  

When Veterans are recording emails to their own personal digital calendars, they are often **setting their own advance alerts based on factors like commute time** or color-coding VA appointments. These digital calendars are often **shared with family members and those who assist in transportation to appointments.**

> - "*Typically what I'll do is go in and bounce that against my calendar, make sure there is not any inconsistencies.” -P1*
> - “*With the emails, I'm able to put the appointment in my Google calendar." - P2*
> - “*I don't generally delete (email reminders). I have a VA file in my file system (on phone)” - P9* 
> - “*As a person that  always has things on my calendar, sometimes things can get lost in the sauce. And just that reminder...I'm like, thanks for that.” - P10*
> - "*I double check what they are saying and what I have because a lot of times, they have been wrong." - P6*

<br />
<br />

**3.Lack of detailed information in reminders forces Veterans to be detectives, infer information from clues,and create their own workarounds to retrieve appointment details**

As current MHV email reminders contain no PHI, the only appointment details provided are: date, time, VAMC name and appointment status. Participants remarked that it was by experience that they could look at the facility name and **guess the specialty or provider based on where the appointment was located.** So Veterans are **assuming details** or having to take **extra steps and time to phone in and find out details.** 


> - “*It doesn't really tell you where it is. It says go sign into MyHealtheVet" - P11*
> - “*As long as I know where it is, I can generally figure out who it is" - P6*
> - “*Why do I need to call in to get such a trivial piece of information?" - P10*


**Frustrations in phoning VA facilities** included: being on **hold for 12 minutes,** not being able to **directly reach a specialty clinic,** or having **trouble reaching provider-specific schedulers** who are only available limited times of the day. As a workaround, at least two participants said they **saved direct lines to specialty clinics in their phones,** “having a direct belly button to tickle when you need to” - P11, to avoid being routed through a general facility phone number.

> - “*(The VA is) loath to put clinic (phone) numbers into a lot of these emails." - P11*
> - “*You know how hard it is to get through to your clinic sometimes?" - P9*
> - “*That's kind of irking when you have to call the general number." - P10*

Two participants pointed out that they **used the VA.gov app to access complete details about their appointments.**

<br />
<br />

**4.Email appointment reminders need to be concise, and the instructions following the essential appointment information is often skimmed or skipped as  “filler” or “boilerplate” information.**

In regard to email reminders overall, participants repeatedly **advised brevity and efficiency with important information,** namely **specific details** of the appointments.
> - “*Be more concise” - P1*
> - “*Less is more.” - P10*
> - “*Short and sweet” - P7*

Participants **admitted skipping or skimming the text that followed the appointment information,** including *Before Your Appointment, Quick Reference Guide, * and information on coronavirus. These portions were described as: **“redundant,” “boilerplate” and “filler.”**

> - “*The stuff that is boilerplate that you see every time you kind of already know which it is that they're talking about.” - P1*
> - “*With some of the filler stuff like Coronavirus, I know it has to be in there, but I need something to stand out on my appointments when I scroll. If there was gonna be some new information in there, I probably wouldn't even notice" - P5*
> - “*I found it's a one-time use." - P11
> - “*If I wanted to change my appointment, I know what to do, so I would probably glance at that and move on." - P6*
> - “*It's just like going to McDonald's. You always know the menu is the same." - P1*
> - “*(The updated PHI email format) is more concise and precise" - P10*

<br />
<br />

**5. Participants were generally comfortable about PHI information being contained in their email reminders, and the usefulness of the additional information outweighs privacy concerns.**

After sharing a version of the current, non-PHI MHV email, we shared a newly formatted version of the MHV email which contained more specific information about an appointment PHI. **Participants unanimously agreed they preferred the PHI email,** both because it contained **more useful information** about an appointment as well as it was **formatted in a way that made it more “user friendly.”**

When asked about privacy concerns over having more detailed information about healthcare in an email, **all 11 participants said that they were not concerned about the more detailed information being in an email.** One of those participants did add that they could see cases in which listing details about an appointment related to “infectious disease” could be a “violation of HIPAA.” Overall, having the information included in the email was **more convenient than not having it.**
> - “*It's not enough information to do you in." - P10*
> - “*“I don't see that if anyone were to intercept this email and try to make a phone call to try and get that information, you know they're not gonna get anything out of it.” - P5*
> - “*If it said you had something wrong, specific, big deal.” - P4*
> - “*I really have my computer very protected." - P2*
<br />
<br />

**6. Many participants would like more control over how they receive reminders and what information is contained within them.**

Related to comfort with PHI details included in MHV email appointment reminders, one participant did suggest adding “dropdowns” to select what information a Veteran would like to see or hide from an email, as well as being allowed to select the frequency of reminders being sent.

More broadly, **participants described a wide range of preferences in how they like to communicate about VA healthcare appointments.** At the same time, they also **shared frustrations when they were contacted in ways that were contrary to their preferences.** Some were frustrated with long wait times when calling the VA about an appointment and one enjoyed the ability to talk to a person as opposed to managing appointments online. **Text reminders were prioritized by 6/11 participants** for reasons including always having a phone handy and email getting “lost in the shuffle.” **Email reminders were preferred by 3/11 participants** who liked that they contained a consolidated list of all upcoming appointments. 

> - “*I just prefer to speak to a human. It's a little bit more personal. And there's no room for error.” -P10*
> - “*Text (reminder) usually the one that gets your attention quickest.- P1*
> - “*I enjoy getting my appointment reminders that way (email)." - P9*
> - “*Give people the choice based on their desires.” - P11*

Two participants **wanted the option to go “paperless”** and cease mailed reminders being sent to them. 

> - “*They also send you something in the mail which I think is totally ridiculous" - P3*
<br />
<br />

**7. Notification Preferences section in the proposed, newly-formatted MHV email was mostly understood to be where Veterans can select the kind and amount of reminders they receive.**

<img width="501" alt="notification preferences" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/417e1dc2-b8a2-4067-8d8c-314df249d254" />

Considering the desire for more control over communication preferences, we talked to participants about the section of the proposed PHI email format in which they would make those selections. 

Participants generally **(7/11 participants) understood that this section** directed you to where you could change the kinds of reminders you received (text, email, letter, phone call) as well as believed you could set how often reminders would be sent. Two participants thought this section was **intended for updating your personal information like passwords or contact information.**

As mentioned above, this section is located in the part of the email that is mostly skimmed or skipped by readers because they focus only on appointment details.
<br />
<br />

**8. Punctuality fulfills Veterans in several ways including feeling prepared, lessening stress, being able to economize trips to distant VAs, and demonstrating respect to fellow Veterans. Precise and updated content in reminders play a role in facilitating timeliness.**

An additional benefit of more detailed information in email reminders is the **confidence in feeling more prepared for appointments.** This assurance in preparation has knock-on effects of not only **getting to appointments on time,** but also **demonstrating respect for other Veterans by not delaying subsequent appointments.** Having thorough information about an appointment **saves time in navigating new or large facilities.** A few participants described scheduling several appointments into a single trip because they lived far from their VAMC. When appointments are condensed into one day, logistical planning and preparation are key to attending each of these. Participants remarked that having **information about parking** such as which lots are closest to specific clinics and payment options would **save them time, frustration and get them to appointments on time.**

> - “*Just so you're mentally prepared for what needs to happen." - P10*
> - “*(Reminders) keeps me right on time and doesn't disturb their scheduling...the fact that you know they gotta see somebody next." - P6*
> - “*Navigating an unfamilar facility while getting to appointment on time can "add to your heartrate" - P6*
<br />
<br />

**9. Format of emails, including font size and contrast, has a significant impact on usability.**

While the focus of this research was to determine desired content, participants could not avoid commenting on the format of the proposed PHI MHV email, which was visually distinct from the current email, designed according to VADS. 

> - “*This looks better. I think this looks 100% better and stated very clearly.” - P10*
> - “*I like this one a lot more, it's a bit easier on the eyes instead of being just a bunch of words” - P5*
> - “*That grabs your vision, makes you look, I think that's a little more bolder." - P4*

<img width="659" alt="comparison of email formats" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4f79321-3485-4e5f-9266-08f253e7254b" />


Participants **responded positively to more information hierarchy through bolded text and differentiation in text size.** It was also perceived to be **“cleaner” and not “cluttered.”** Boxing the appointment information in a contrasting grey and bolding headings seemed to allow for **better decision making** as to what information to read versus seeing all information as having equal importance and skipping sections entirely.

> - “*It's in bold letters, that stands out, it lets you know that's something important.” -P5*
<br />
<br />

**10. Changes to the current MHV email format should be communicated to Veterans in advance of release and across multiple channels.**


As the anticipated outcome of this research is some changes to content and potentially look of MHV email appointment reminders, we spoke with participants about how they might respond to a change in their email reminders. This question aimed at developing best practices for new releases/product updates and learn something about **how Veterans might confirm legitimacy of VA communication.**

When encountering unfamiliar emails from the VA, participants mentioned **looking at the return email address, making sure it was from .gov, looking for spelling errors and calling their VA to check on suspicious emails.** One participant said that they would not be suspicious of a newly formatted email. Participants said they had **trust in VA** and **expected that an update would be publicized on multiple VA channels.**  Announcement recommendations included: **posting alerts or announcements on VA.gov, in current MHV email correspondence, on the MHV portal, and by physical fliers or posters at VA facilities,** as well as **providing a phone number to call** to confirm legitimacy of a new emails. 

> - “*It's got to be communicated that something is changing. It's got to be communicated with your options are” - P11*
> - “*I would call and say 'hey, did you send me this?” - P6*
> - “*Just make everything familiar.” - P1*



## Additional Insights

One participant detailed thoughts on why Veterans might no-show to appointments, which included 3 factors: people in general like to complain, cumbersome travel distances to VA facilities, and lack of consequence for not showing up. The participant said that if distances were too far or required heavy-traffic commutes in urban areas, that could deter folks from getting to appointments. 
> - “*The big thing with healthcare is access, and remembering to go to the appointments." - P11*
> - “*It's a matter of showing up, being honest, and telling them why you're there and what you need and letting (VA providers) do their job." - P11*

## Recommendations

1. **Approve the PHI version of email and offer it as an option as soon as possible.**
    * 100% of participants preferred the PHI email, both because it contained more useful information about an appointment as well as it was formatted in a way that made it more “user friendly.”
      
2. **For PHI email reminders include: facility address including floor/building information (if information is maintained up-to-date), clinic name, provider name, appointment status, modality, and direct phone numbers to clinics that have specialty schedulers (and times when they can be contacted).**
    * 100% of of participants want at minimum date, time and address in emails
    * 64% of participants want address with building name/floor in emails
    * 64% of participants want clinic name or indication of procedure (i.e. labs)  in emails
    * 73% of participants want provider name in emails (though it was lower in priority for some)
    * 64% of participants want status listed in emails (although 1 participant only wanted to know confirmed)
    * 82% of participants find value in including appointment modality (in-person, video, telephone) in emails
    * Providing direct clinic phone numbers saves Veterans time and frustration and should be prioritized for, at minimum, clinics that have specialized schedulers
      
3. **Continue sending MHV reminders as a list of all upcoming appointments, however consider moving cadence to 7 days and 1 day prior.**
    * 73% of participants said they preferred a list of appointments
    * Being provided a list of all upcoming appointments in a single email was “reassuring” and helped with long term planning
    * A few participants did point out that for frequent or re-occurring appointments, the volume of emails might become excessive and accommodations for series of appointments should be considered in this cadence
    * The most common two responses for email cadence were
        * 45%: 1 week advance notice (1 email)
        * 27%: 1 week and 1 day advance notice (2 emails)
          
4. **Move forward with a VADS-formatted email that includes headings, highlighted appointment information and consider ways to consolidate/link out some of the non-appointment detail information such as how to prepare or change an appointment.**
    * All participants preferred the PHI version of the email reminder, no only for additional content, but many also thought it looked “very clear,” “easier on the eyes,” and distinguished information hierarchy better. Some of the non appointment detail information (How to manage your appointments, how to prepare, etc) may be able to be condensed, or linked out to other pages in lieu of bulleted text. Half of the participants said they did not read this information in the current email and wanted more concise email reminders. Bolded headings did help participants engage more with this information, however. This information should also be reviewed for redundancy. For example, one participant pointed out that the how to manage your appointments section  directed a user to a phone number that was already listed directly above in the appointment details.
    * *“Trying to streamline (reminders) down. I think that's the way to go.” - P3*
    * “*Right away, I can tell you I like this better.” - P7* 
<img width="530" alt="VADS formatted email" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8689fa3-f546-4f22-81c8-422ea26a5a39" />


5. **Email formatting should be designed with shareability in mind (copy/paste, screen shots, link to share).**
    * Some participants noted that the PHI version of the email reminder seemed easier to share. For example, the graphic presentation of the information makes a clearer screenshot that a user could text to their caregiver or spouse. Similarly, participants pointed out that they often copy and pasted information from reminders. One caregiver said that they often share appointment information with other caregivers or other family members when they cannot accompany a Veteran to an appointment. Formatting should lend itself to making that kind of sharing seamless and without friction. 
    * “*The presentation makes it really easy to copy and paste into a text.” -P7*
<img width="510" alt="Screenshot comparison" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca9540ec-4c29-4baa-972d-67b2853f10f5" />


      
6. **Help Veterans prepare themselves better by including parking information and any procedural requirements like fasting or not wearing deodorant.**
    * Especially when attending Community Care appointments, parking can be distant from a building or require cash only. Knowing parking details ahead of time can help Veterans plan accordingly and get them to their appointments on time. Similarly, knowing procedural details ahead of time minimizes stress.
    * *“There are so many separate buildings (at their VA) that they have an underground tunnel that you can use to go to all the buildings” -P8*
    * *“Just to navigate through the hospital can be time consuming. And there goes that 15 minutes early that you planned for.” - P10*
    * *“"And then you park somewhere and they're like the clinic you need is on the other side of the campus." - P10*
      
7. **Hyperlink a map within the appointment information address for navigation.**
    * 64% of participants want some kind of maplink provided with appointment address
    * Several participants already copy and paste addresses into their GPS navigation and the link could save Users a step
    * Responses were mixed whether the map should link to Google or Apple Maps or should be a more precise map of the VAMC facility itself. Further testing might be needed to target which is more helpful to Veterans. Once at a facility, a majority of participants said that they receive great help from front desk volunteers and facility signage. 
    * *"Our VA is so convoluted. I definitely got lost quite a few times." - P2*
      
8. **Selecting communication preferences for all formats of reminders within VA Profile should clearly explain the result of each selection and be easily findable within the portal.**
    * Some Veterans may associate selection of VEText and/or MHV email reminders as “paperless” and conclude that by making selections of email and text message, that they have opted out of mailed reminders. The option to receive or not receive paper reminders should be presented to Veterans.

    * Since oversaturation of reminders is a common complaint, where possible, information on the cadence of reminders should be presented at the time when Veterans are choosing which kinds of reminders they would like to receive in [Notification Settings for Health Appointment Reminders](https://www.figma.com/design/e6JEtrwZCInKk9SjZktx2T/Profile---Notification-Settings?node-id=572-12658&t=ubf1850HW8krNJY9-1). For example, when a Veteran is presented with the option to opt in to email appointment reminders, that selection should also list how many reminders the Veteran can expect for that modality of reminder. For example, “Email reminders will be sent 14 days and 3 days prior to an appointment.” PHI and non-PHI forms of reminders should be fully explained
    * “*If you signed up to have everything electronically, then it should be electronically.” - P3*
    * *“It's got to be tailored to your communication preferences.” - P11*
    * *“I do not look at letters. I think you guys could save some money by not doing letters in this day and age, saving trees, saving stamps.” - P4*
