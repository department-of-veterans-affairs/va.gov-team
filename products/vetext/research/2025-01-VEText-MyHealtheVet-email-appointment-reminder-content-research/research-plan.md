# Research Plan for VEText Team, My HealtheVet email appointment reminders content Veteran feedback, 01/2025

## Background
VEText is a platform for sending SMS messages to Veterans. These messages can be either one way or interactive. It was developed to lower no-show rates for Veterans’ health appointments by a team at the VA Loma Linda Healthcare system and rolled out nationally in 2018.

VEText will begin additionally sending the email appointment reminders for MyHealtheVet, as My HealtheVet migrates to VA.gov. We would like to evaluate the content, cadence or functionality of those email appointment reminders by asking Veterans for feedback. This feedback will determine if changes should be made to the content, cadence or functionality in order to improve Veterans’ experience using email health appointment reminders.

### Veteran Journey
This fits into the Veteran journey at: Taking care of Myself

Full [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for reference.


## Research Goals	
- What content do Veterans want/expect in email health appointment reminders?

- What schedule is most effective for receiving appointment reminders?

- If email reminders are not useful currently, what could make them useful?


### Outcome
This research will allow us to gauge Veteran satisfaction with current email appointment reminders. Additionally, we may learn what can improve and then make content, functionality or cadence changes accordingly.

   This will:

  - Increase recipient satisfaction

  - Decrease oversaturation of reminders

  - Improve care by getting Veterans to their appointments, prepared with necessary information

### Research questions

1. Overall do Veterans find value in email appointment reminders? Why or why not?
2. Is there a way to make the content or cadence of email appointment reminders more useful?
  

### Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that Veterans want more information in their emails including details about the location and provider for their health appointments and that Veterans currently do not find the MHV email reminders as useful as the appointment list within the MHV portal, which includes more detailed appointment information.


## Methodology	
1\. Our methodology will be a remote moderated interview of Veterans where we will discuss with Veterans what information they want in email reminders for health appointments and what they would expect to be included.

2\. After discussing what they would expect, we will show them an example of the existing MHV email reminder and ask them to share their thoughts on the content and cadence as well as how they currently use MHV email reminders.
