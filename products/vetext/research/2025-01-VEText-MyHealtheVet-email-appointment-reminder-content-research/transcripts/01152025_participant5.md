## MyHealtheVet Email Appointment Reminder Veteran Preferences Conversation Guide

### Introduction - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jamie, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes (introduce). We are here today to talk about the Veteran Email Preferences for health appointment reminders from MyHealtheVet. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help us understand what types of information you’d expect in these health appointment reminders and what else you might like for these emails to include. 

\*\*Before we start, there are a few things I’d like to mention:\*\*

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

- There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans’ needs.

- I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

- I’m hoping to record the session today, so that we capture your opinions accurately.  Please know that they will not be shared with anyone outside of this research study and will be deleted once our research is complete. Are you okay with us recording today?

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I’m going to hit the record button now.

### Section 1: Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes

1. What branch of the military did you serve in? *Marine Corps

2. When did you retire or separate? *December 2003.

3. Do you currently receive health appointment reminder emails from the VA? *Yes.

4. Do you open/read those emails? *Yes.

   1. If not, how do you get information about your appointments? 

5. Do you receive health appointment reminders by any other means like text message or phone call? *Both text and phone calls. 

6. What do you find is your preferred method of communication about Veterans Health Administration appointments? Why? Does it change depending on the kind of appointment information that is being communicated? *Probably prefer the text, the email is good too a week before or if I forget to add it to my calendar. 



### Section 2: Preferred Content - 8 minutes

1. When you open your email health appointment reminders, what information would you like to be included? *I go to the VA app and look it up. 
*Time, date, where, and who it’s with. Clinic or with my primary care or if it’s the cardiologist, who it might be. It’s not necessarily but it’s easier to see if it is I’m visiting. Especially for me because I see so many doctors at the VA. 
   1. Discuss cadence, information details, information about procedures, preparation, maps

### Section 3: Thoughts on Content Based on Sample Emails - 15 minutes

Let’s look at a sample of a [current reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/current-mhv-emailmockup.md):

1. Can you tell me about your experience receiving email appointment reminders from the Veterans Health Administration? *With some of the filler stuff like Coronavirus, I know it has to be in there, but I need something to stand out on my appointments when I scroll. I scan over it now because I’ve seen it so many times. 

   1. (if also receiving VEText) How does this experience compare with your VEText texted appointment reminders?

2. Is there information missing from the current reminder that you wish were included? *Not necessarily. I think it’s virtual appointment, it says that. I’m certain when I get my email it states whether it’s in person or virtual. 
*The other one has volunteer Vets, and they walk you to that area or I walk up to the help desk and there’s someone to tell where to go. 
Would it be helpful to have a link or photo to tell you where to go? *It could be helpful, especially if it’s your first time. 
*If it’s in the email, I’m afraid it’s not up to date, because the email said it’s Mod 3 but there could be construction and now that is in another building. 
3. How often are you receiving reminder emails from the Veterans Health Administration? * I think once a month. 

   1. Is that good? Too much? What is ideal? *That feels like a good amount. 

   2. Discuss consolidation or how many appointments should be in a single email. * I would prefer one email with all my appointments. 

4. How do you prefer for the Veterans Health Administration to communicate with you? - for example emails, sms, letters? * I have a cozy calendar app that I use for appointments and it’s easier to put all my appointments on there, I usually put it in right after I make an appointment. 

Let’s look at a possible [PHI sample reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/Pending-MHV-PHI-emailmockup.md)

1. What are your thoughts here? What do you think of the additional information? * I like this one a lot more and easier on the eyes instead of a bunch of words. I like the bold lettering. At least it starts with the purpose of the email. I like that it’s highlighted. 

2. If you had your choice of this (PHI) reminder and one with more generic information, which would you choose to receive? Why? The second one, because it’s more visually appealing. The second one is clearer, and the appointment reminder stands out. Looks like it has better information. 
*Sometimes I think. I have the same doctor that have seen for the last four years. Then some once a year. I’ll get appointment reminders and a Doctors name and I don’t know who that is. I’ll take that back, not having a doctors name, but having the clinic. 

3. Do you have any concerns about privacy with your appointment reminders? If so, does that influence your method of reminder? *No because when you call the clinic they confirm all that personal identification that it is you. 
*Yes, I do look at that because I had some that I canceled and forgot to remove from my calendar. 
4. Notifications change? *To see where I can turn off notifications. 
5. How would you know it’s not a spam email? * I guess that it stands out from VA.gov I don’t know, I guess if they had something where it says on the VA or the My HealtheVet website that says they are sending new appointment reminders. 
### Closing Interview - 5 minutes

Do you have any comments or questions about VA health appointment reminder emails that we have not yet covered today? * No, I like that it has the header on there and an appointment from the VA reminder.
