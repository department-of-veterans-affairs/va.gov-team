## MyHealtheVet Email Appointment Reminder Veteran Preferences Conversation Guide

### Introduction - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jamie, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes (introduce). We are here today to talk about the Veteran Email Preferences for health appointment reminders from MyHealtheVet. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help us understand what types of information you’d expect in these health appointment reminders and what else you might like for these emails to include. 

\*\*Before we start, there are a few things I’d like to mention:\*\*

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

- There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans’ needs.

- I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

- I’m hoping to record the session today, so that we capture your opinions accurately.  Please know that they will not be shared with anyone outside of this research study and will be deleted once our research is complete. Are you okay with us recording today?

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Any questions before we get started? *

Ok, I’m going to hit the record button now. 

_\*Start audio and screen recording.\*_

### Section 1: Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes

1. What branch of the military did you serve in? *Marine Corps and 4 years in the Navy.

2. When did you retire or separate? *2006.

3. Do you currently receive health appointment reminder emails from the VA? *Yes.

4. Do you open/read those emails? *Most of them I do. They are helpful because you lose track. 

   1. If not, how do you get information about your appointments? 

5. Do you receive health appointment reminders by any other means like text message or phone call? *I get all of those. 

6. What do you find is your preferred method of communication about Veterans Health Administration appointments? Why? Does it change depending on the kind of appointment information that is being communicated? *I think text usually gets your attention the quickest.


### Section 2: Preferred Content - 8 minutes

1.	When you open your email health appointment reminders, what information would you like to be included? *It’s all the same, just the timing. For me it's better to know of the appointment a week out. Because some of my appointments are a month or two out and you forget about it. I think they are helpful and convenient, they don’t go into my spam mail. They are not overwhelming. I have a dentist who overwhelms me with reminders, and they don’t want you to miss. The timing is convenient and effective. I think you’ll see the subject line from the email and anything that comes from My HealtheVet, the format is the same. 

   1. Discuss cadence, information details, information about procedures, preparation, maps. *I think it’s helpful to have more than that to make sure there isn’t an inconsistency. Sometimes I’ll have two appointments, but I don’t have it on my calendar and I will have to call to verify the status of the appointment, personally I like it. 


### Section 3: Thoughts on Content Based on Sample Emails - 15 minutes

Let’s look at a sample of a [current reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/current-mhv-emailmockup.md):

1. Can you tell me about your experience receiving email appointment reminders from the Veterans Health Administration? * Be more concise, some of the information I may skip. With experience, you know how it’s set up and you just get to the information that you need. The stuff that you see every time, you already know what they are talking about and just bypass that to the information you really need. 

   1. (if also receiving VEText) How does this experience compare with your VEText texted appointment reminders? *

2.	Is there information missing from the current reminder that you wish were included? *I would one thing would be, if there is a medical provider that you will be seeing, the medical provider's information be on there. If I go to ophthalmology, I’ve seen a few different doctors, it will give me awareness and understanding of who I will see and lets me better prepare myself. 
Helpful to see the status? *Yes.

4. How often are you receiving reminder emails from the Veterans Health Administration?

   1. Is that good? Too much? What is ideal?

   2. Discuss consolidation or how many appointments should be in a single email. *There might be, but one of the benefits of getting the email is that every email will have that information and can see the quick reference guide and easy go-to. *I can go to the link and change my preferences, that’s where I go to change it. 


5. How do you prefer for the Veterans Health Administration to communicate with you? - for example emails, sms, letters? *The ones that you go to most frequently, you know where they are and it would be helpful to the ones you don’t go to too often. 

Let’s look at a possible [PHI sample reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/Pending-MHV-PHI-emailmockup.md)

1. What are your thoughts here? What do you think of the additional information? *It’s very clear and layout, font is good and bold the important information is good. This has the address of the clinic and contact information is good. The only addition would be where to find it in that VA. Maybe both, link and verbiage of the map would be helpful. *I can’t think of anything. The only thing that stands out is the way it’s laid out and how to manage your appointments. It’s not cluttered and well organized. 

2. If you had your choice of this (PHI) reminder and one with more generic information, which would you choose to receive? Why? *I like this one the best. 

3.	Do you have any concerns about privacy with your appointment reminders? If so, does that influence your method of reminder? *I don’t have any concerns.
   
5.	Is there a way to make this legitimate? *Have a format that looks familiar and if it’s different it might look suspicious and the 1800 toll-free number.
