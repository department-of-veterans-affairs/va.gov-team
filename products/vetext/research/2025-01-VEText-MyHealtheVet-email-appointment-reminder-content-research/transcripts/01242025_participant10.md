## MyHealtheVet Email Appointment Reminder Veteran Preferences Conversation Guide

### Introduction - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jamie, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes (introduce). We are here today to talk about the Veteran Email Preferences for health appointment reminders from MyHealtheVet. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help us understand what types of information you’d expect in these health appointment reminders and what else you might like for these emails to include. 

\*\*Before we start, there are a few things I’d like to mention:\*\*

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

- There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans’ needs.

- I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

- I’m hoping to record the session today, so that we capture your opinions accurately.  Please know that they will not be shared with anyone outside of this research study and will be deleted once our research is complete. Are you okay with us recording today?

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I’m going to hit the record button now.

### Section 1: Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes

1. What branch of the military did you serve in? *Navy.

2. When did you retire or separate? *July 2007.

3. Do you currently receive health appointment reminder emails from the VA? *Yes.

4. Do you open/read those emails? *Yes.

   1. If not, how do you get information about your appointments? *

5. Do you receive health appointment reminders by any other means like text message or phone call? *I get phone calls and appointment cards. 

6. What do you find is your preferred method of communication about Veterans Health Administration appointments? Why? Does it change depending on the kind of appointment information that is being communicated? *I prefer to get the calls and the appointment cards I get them later than I should, but they are effective. * I do it through my Google calendar and I usually call the VA, I know it’s cumbersome but I prefer to speak to a live person. I call and immediately write it down. I usually get confirmation within a day or two. *I usually put it in ahead of time on my calendar so I don’t forget anything. 



### Section 2: Preferred Content - 8 minutes

1. When you open your email health appointment reminders, what information would you like to be included? *Generally my question is the location and floor that I’m going to. Also, at the big VA if they told you things ahead of time where to park so you know where to park based on your location of appointment. *Instructions for whatever your appointment is. For example, my radiation time will tell me not to eat for a certain amount of time before the appointment. 

   1. Discuss cadence, information details, information about procedures, preparation, maps

### Section 3: Thoughts on Content Based on Sample Emails - 15 minutes

Let’s look at a sample of a [current reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/current-mhv-emailmockup.md):

1. Can you tell me about your experience receiving email appointment reminders from the Veterans Health Administration? *Not at the moment. These look pretty standard.

   1. (if also receiving VEText) How does this experience compare with your VEText texted appointment reminders?

2. Is there information missing from the current reminder that you wish were included?

3. How often are you receiving reminder emails from the Veterans Health Administration? *I don’t have a lot of appointments. I usually get a week or weeks out and a few days out but I’m not 100% sure. 

   1. Is that good? Too much? What is ideal? *About five days to a week. You can put a post-it note in the mirror.

   2. Discuss consolidation or how many appointments should be in a single email. *Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. *Less is more. *I don’t need too many visuals but maybe for someone with a lot of appointments, it might be helpful. 
* I would say to call it. I would put what type of appointment it is. Sometimes the line is long and you’re pressed for time to call. 

4. How do you prefer for the Veterans Health Administration to communicate with you? - for example emails, sms, letters?

Let’s look at a possible [PHI sample reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/Pending-MHV-PHI-emailmockup.md)

1. What are your thoughts here? What do you think of the additional information? *This looks better. I think this look 100% better and stated very clearly.  It also tells you when it was last updated.  
* I like that it has the clinic and clinic number. I assume this is not a general number. Hopefully, this is a direct number. Sometimes depending on your appointment, you don’t know where to get there if it was radiology or optometry. 
-Would having a link of a map be helpful? *I have mixed feelings about that. Technology can be a savvy tool but the same thing can be bad in the wrong hands. Now, if a person had bad intentions, now you have pinpointed where to go. We need to be on the side of caution. 

2. If you had your choice of this (PHI) reminder and one with more generic information, which would you choose to receive? Why? * I like that one (second option). 

3. Do you have any concerns about privacy with your appointment reminders? If so, does that influence your method of reminder? *No. 
*It looks like it will take you to the window profile. I would guess that is what that is for and gives you a length of options. 
### Closing Interview - 5 minutes

Do you have any comments or questions about VA health appointment reminder emails that we have not yet covered today? *I would like to know if you are going to a community care location or parking information, and if you have to pay for parking.
