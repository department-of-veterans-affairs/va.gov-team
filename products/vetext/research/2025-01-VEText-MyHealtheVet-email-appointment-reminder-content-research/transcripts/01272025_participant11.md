## MyHealtheVet Email Appointment Reminder Veteran Preferences Conversation Guide

### Introduction - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jamie, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes (introduce). We are here today to talk about the Veteran Email Preferences for health appointment reminders from MyHealtheVet. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help us understand what types of information you’d expect in these health appointment reminders and what else you might like for these emails to include. 

\*\*Before we start, there are a few things I’d like to mention:\*\*

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

- There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans’ needs.

- I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

- I’m hoping to record the session today, so that we capture your opinions accurately.  Please know that they will not be shared with anyone outside of this research study and will be deleted once our research is complete. Are you okay with us recording today?

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I’m going to hit the record button now. 

_\*Start audio and screen recording.\*_

### Section 1: Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes

1. What branch of the military did you serve in? *Army.

2. When did you retire or separate? *May of 2011.

3. Do you currently receive health appointment reminder emails from the VA? *Yes.

4. Do you open/read those emails? *Yes.

   1. If not, how do you get information about your appointments? *

5. Do you receive health appointment reminders by any other means like text messages or phone call? *Texts, phone call, and scheduling assisting and postcards. As far as a reminder, they are all similar. The nice thing of the postcard is that it tells you where you are supposed to go. Unlike the emails, they don’t tell you and tell you to sign into your My HealtheVet. *Probably the email to bounce that back to my personal calendar. Has the VA canceled or moved it, the VA forgets to tell you, sometimes. The ones I use the most would be the email. 

6. What do you find is your preferred method of communication about Veterans Health Administration appointments? Why? Does it change depending on the kind of appointment information that is being communicated? * I have my calendar and paper calendar to write it down and I also put it on my phone. Eventually, I’ll get an updated email and I look, it’s there and as months go by, I’ll get a postcard, text, and about five days out, I’ll get a text and email. *The text ones you can confirm, press one to confirm. They also don’t tell you what clinic it’s with. 



### Section 2: Preferred Content - 8 minutes

1.	When you open your email health appointment reminders, what information would you like to be included? *The date and time. You can always find out online. *Not all specialty clinics use it and that is you need to talk to a particular schedule with a doctor who isn’t there all the time. That’s probably something I would suggest about having a direct number instead of a main number if you need to contact them.  
*Hopefully, if applicable a provider name. Sometimes they say, “Dental appointment with so and so DDS3”, who do I know who is DDS3, it’s a little bureaucratic. 
*

   1. Discuss cadence, information details, information about procedures, preparation, maps

### Section 3: Thoughts on Content Based on Sample Emails - 15 minutes

Let’s look at a sample of a [current reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/current-mhv-emailmockup.md):

1. Can you tell me about your experience receiving email appointment reminders from the Veterans Health Administration? *Adding a Provider name and a more direct number. 
*When I go up there, they're are information boards or a volunteer. I usually use the signs around. 
-Would it be helpful to have more direct information/Link on how to get to your location? *That would be a bonus, not necessarily for the Vet but more of the chaperone. *It would be helpful, but can be information overload too. If you start to put more than four to five lines, people may get confused. Maybe have pull-down windows, “ want to see more about this appointments”.

   1. (if also receiving VEText) How does this experience compare with your VEText texted appointment reminders? 
-How do you look up your emails? *Generally, I’m on desktop. 
-Do you look at the bottom portion of the email?  *I don’t look at it that much anymore. I found it’s a one-time use. You can change things online. Not all clinics are signed up for that. I’ve done it a few times with PCM, and it was very clunky. 
*For some reason the D.C. VA will not put the main number on there. 
2. Is there information missing from the current reminder that you wish were included?

3. How often are you receiving reminder emails from the Veterans Health Administration? *The email reminders that I get are all a list of all my appointments. They come in randomly. I, personally prefer to see all of them together. 
*I would say that would be reassuring the appointment is still good, maybe every other week to receive the email. I would suggest when you sign up for text or emails, to  have a hold-down box where you choose how often you'd like to receive them. 
   1. Is that good? Too much? What is ideal?

   2. Discuss consolidation or how many appointments should be in a single email.

4. How do you prefer for the Veterans Health Administration to communicate with you? - for example emails, sms, letters?

Let’s look at a possible [PHI sample reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/Pending-MHV-PHI-emailmockup.md)

1. What are your thoughts here? What do you think of the additional information? *That seems to be more complete Who, What, When, Where. That’s a happy medium. It doesn’t tell you Cardiology is on the third floor, room 320. Maybe having a hyperlink for more information, click here. * That would be helpful, maybe bolding it and staying away from the color red because some people are color-blind. *It looks okay, most likely if you click on one of those, you’d have to sign in. It would help me if I had a reason to log in to change something, but if I needed to know what clinic it is, I would have to sign in and see its with provider DDS3 and see it’s a dentist appointment, not a hygienist. 
-Change preferences? *I have done that before. I wanted to receive texts. The text reminders are different because you have to press one to confirm appointments. I also get a robot call and ask you to press one to confirm appointments. After a while, because I have a good attendance record, they can get a little annoying. 
2. If you had your choice of this (PHI) reminder and one with more generic information, which would you choose to receive? Why? *What you have there now on the screen that would be preferred over the current email. 

3. Do you have any concerns about privacy with your appointment reminders? If so, does that influence your method of reminder? *Great point but poor question for me because I don’t know if it violates PHI or HIPPA. Let's say it has an infectious disease. Generally, people going to do that could be for STI or STD or prevention of something that could possibly be a violation. 
-Would you think your email would be a scam if you opened the email reminder?  *As for as it was a scam, I would look for the sender and I were still concerned I would look into My HealtheVet to make sure my appointment was still there. I would look for a notice that warns people the reminders will look different. 
- How would you like to see the notification of the change? *Would like to see it everywhere in every which way. 
-Why don’t Veterans show up? *A lot of Veterans, you get taught and its too easy to complain and they aren’t paying for it. They don’t have the financial impetus to show up. The third is the location. For me, I drive over an hour, and that’s in D.C.
