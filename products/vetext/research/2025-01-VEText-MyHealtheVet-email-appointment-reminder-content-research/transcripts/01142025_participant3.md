## MyHealtheVet Email Appointment Reminder Veteran Preferences Conversation Guide

### Introduction - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jamie, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes (introduce). We are here today to talk about the Veteran Email Preferences for health appointment reminders from MyHealtheVet. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help us understand what types of information you’d expect in these health appointment reminders and what else you might like for these emails to include. 

\*\*Before we start, there are a few things I’d like to mention:\*\*

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

- There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans’ needs.

- I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

- I’m hoping to record the session today, so that we capture your opinions accurately.  Please know that they will not be shared with anyone outside of this research study and will be deleted once our research is complete. Are you okay with us recording today?

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I’m going to hit the record button now.

### Section 1: Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes

1. What branch of the military did you serve in? *Army.

2. When did you retire or separate? *1980-1981

3. Do you currently receive health appointment reminder emails from the VA? *Yes.

4. Do you open/read those emails? *Yes,because my iPhone is connected with my VA.

   1. If not, how do you get information about your appointments? *

5. Do you receive health appointment reminders by any other means like text message or phone call? *Yes, text messages. They also send a letter in the mail to let you know you have an appointment and what time. *I look at the app more than the other ones. I will look at the text message but I will see it on the app. 

6. What do you find is your preferred method of communication about Veterans Health Administration appointments? Why? Does it change depending on the kind of appointment information that is being communicated? *



### Section 2: Preferred Content - 8 minutes

1. When you open your email health appointment reminders, what information would you like to be included? *For me, I want to know who it’s with. Because sometimes they switch specialists and when you get there you only see the Nurse Practitioner. I would also like to know if they do text messages. For example, the (doctor) sent me a text message at 8 in the morning and if they can text me instead of calling, it would be better. It would be convenient if I could set it for text messages only. For example, they have me going to (VAMC), which is an hour away and I was under the impression I was seeing (provider) and when I got there, I was not seeing him. They told me I would only see him if I was going over (another clinic). Now, the Doctor I was seeing no longer works there and they still have not told me. 

   1. Discuss cadence, information details, information about procedures, preparation, maps

### Section 3: Thoughts on Content Based on Sample Emails - 15 minutes

Let’s look at a sample of a [current reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/current-mhv-emailmockup.md):

1. Can you tell me about your experience receiving email appointment reminders from the Veterans Health Administration? *I’d go on there when you use the app. For me, it could be so streamed-lined. Why do you have to send me a letter for each appointment, it's not needed. Instead of telling me it was the last update, 0300 hours, you don’t have to put that. Just tell me where, time, and who we are seeing. I don’t need all this other stuff. If you put the address, I can cut and paste it on my Google and get to my appointment. 
*Colors attract people's attention and if you color-coded, that would be great. I get a text message for every appointment and if you can send me a text to let me know it was cancelled, that would be great. 

   1. (if also receiving VEText) How does this experience compare with your VEText texted appointment reminders?

2. Is there information missing from the current reminder that you wish were included?

3. How often are you receiving reminder emails from the Veterans Health Administration? *The day you make the appointment you get a text and an email, then it starts to count down the days. It annoys me because you don’t have to count down the days because you already told me the date. Maybe send me the day before but every day can be an overkill. 

   1. Is that good? Too much? What is ideal? *Four or two days before. 

   2. Discuss consolidation or how many appointments should be in a single email. *It goes into my iPhone calendar and everything is color-coded. Appointments in yellow are my VA and doctors. 

4. How do you prefer for the Veterans Health Administration to communicate with you? - for example emails, sms, letters?

Let’s look at a possible [PHI sample reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/Pending-MHV-PHI-emailmockup.md)

1. What are your thoughts here? What do you think of the additional information? *I like this, you have all your appointments there, address. It’s exactly what I was saying that we need. I like the bold lettering. *Now that you have the note section, lets you know that you are talking about my appointment. 

2. If you had your choice of this (PHI) reminder and one with more generic information, which would you choose to receive? Why? I like this one better. 

3. Do you have any concerns about privacy with your appointment reminders? If so, does that influence your method of reminder? *I don’t specifically.
4. Is having a link to a map of the VA helpful?  *Yes. 
5. Have you had issues with a new clinic, how do you find your way? *We go days before, so we don’t get lost. I will put it in the navigation search. Street view can be helpful because it will tell you exactly where you are going. 
6. Changing your preference? *I like that. You can go in and re-check to see If I signed up to go paperless. 
### Closing Interview - 5 minutes

Do you have any comments or questions about VA health appointment reminder emails that we have not yet covered today?  *Where it says to manage your appointments, the number is there and at the bottom. You don’t need it down there twice.
