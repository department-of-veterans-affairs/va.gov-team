## MyHealtheVet Email Appointment Reminder Veteran Preferences Conversation Guide

### Introduction - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jamie, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes (introduce). We are here today to talk about the Veteran Email Preferences for health appointment reminders from MyHealtheVet. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help us understand what types of information you’d expect in these health appointment reminders and what else you might like for these emails to include. 

\*\*Before we start, there are a few things I’d like to mention:\*\*

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

- There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans’ needs.

- I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

- I’m hoping to record the session today, so that we capture your opinions accurately.  Please know that they will not be shared with anyone outside of this research study and will be deleted once our research is complete. Are you okay with us recording today?

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Any questions before we get started? *Not yet.

Ok, I’m going to hit the record button now. 

_\*Start audio and screen recording.\*_

### Section 1: Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes

1. What branch of the military did you serve in? *Army

2. When did you retire or separate? *1980

3. Do you currently receive health appointment reminder emails from the VA? *Yes.

4. Do you open/read those emails? *Yes.

   1. If not, how do you get information about your appointments?

5. Do you receive health appointment reminders by any other means like text message or phone call? *Yes, text and email. 

6. What do you find is your preferred method of communication about Veterans Health Administration appointments? Why? Does it change depending on the kind of appointment information that is being communicated? *The text message works the best for me because I have my phone with me all the time. With the emails, I’m able to put them on my Google calendar. 
*I like that I can set it when I need to be reminded. My calendar sets it up 24 hours in advance or even an hour before it takes me about 40 minutes to get to my appointment. 



### Section 2: Preferred Content - 8 minutes

1. When you open your email health appointment reminders, what information would you like to be included? *Lately, it’s been immediately coming into my email when the appointment is set and I also get it the day before and I also get a phone call through a robo call, and I also get the email. No, because the initial appointment set up, it has the information I need. 

   1. Discuss cadence, information details, information about procedures, preparation, maps

### Section 3: Thoughts on Content Based on Sample Emails - 15 minutes

Let’s look at a sample of a [current reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/current-mhv-emailmockup.md):

1. Can you tell me about your experience receiving email appointment reminders from the Veterans Health Administration? * For me it’s good, I need reminding. I think if I were younger, I don’t think I would like it as much, but I don’t mind the reminders. I open all the emails. 

   1. (if also receiving VEText) How does this experience compare with your VEText texted appointment reminders?

2. Is there information missing from the current reminder that you wish were included?

3. How often are you receiving reminder emails from the Veterans Health Administration?

   1. Is that good? Too much? What is ideal?

   2. Discuss consolidation or how many appointments should be in a single email.

4. How do you prefer for the Veterans Health Administration to communicate with you? - for example emails, sms, letters?

Let’s look at a possible [PHI sample reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/Pending-MHV-PHI-emailmockup.md)

1. What are your thoughts here? What do you think of the additional information? Status helpful? * For me it’s enough because I know where it is and what clinic I need to go to. *Very much because I had a few tele calls canceled. *Yes, I have gotten lost a few times, but they did change some things. Maybe having the room number or floor number would be helpful. *If they tell me when I’m getting scheduled, I ask where it is and they tell me or I go to the information desk. 
* Very useful because I had a video conference and they didn’t put it on there and I went to the VA, which was not fun. I got into the car and was able to still take the appointment and you can’t be driving. 
*That means I go to My HealtheVet and change the different way of going in there. 
*I’d go to my profile and take it off. I think there’s a check off the slide for me to add it or take it off. 
*Yes, I’d like to be reminded the day before the appointment. I usually get one the week before and the day before the appointment.
 
2. If you had your choice of this (PHI) reminder and one with more generic information, which would you choose to receive? Why? *Yes, I do, in case I miss because I can put it on the calendar. I manage my mother's, husband's, and sister's calendars. I need to put them in so it doesn’t conflict with my other appointments. 

3. Do you have any concerns about privacy with your appointment reminders? If so, does that influence your method of reminder? *No, I don’t. I have my computer very protected. * I’d like this one. Because I like the address, the clinic where I am going, and the number I can call if I need to. 
*Perhaps the provider for the appointment in case it is a new doctor I’m seeing because sometimes things change. * I wish I could access it through with my family, I use MyChart. It has everything on there, tests, her test results, I can send a message immediately. With My HealtheVet I have to go through all the factors and MyChart, I don’t have to. 

### Closing Interview - 5 minutes

Do you have any comments or questions about VA health appointment reminder emails that we have not yet covered today? *No, it’s straight forward.
