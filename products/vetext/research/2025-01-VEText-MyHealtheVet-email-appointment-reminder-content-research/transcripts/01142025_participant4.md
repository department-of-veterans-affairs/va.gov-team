## MyHealtheVet Email Appointment Reminder Veteran Preferences Conversation Guide

### Introduction - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jamie, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes (introduce). We are here today to talk about the Veteran Email Preferences for health appointment reminders from MyHealtheVet. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help us understand what types of information you’d expect in these health appointment reminders and what else you might like for these emails to include. 

\*\*Before we start, there are a few things I’d like to mention:\*\*

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

- There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans’ needs.

- I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

- I’m hoping to record the session today, so that we capture your opinions accurately.  Please know that they will not be shared with anyone outside of this research study and will be deleted once our research is complete. Are you okay with us recording today?

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I’m going to hit the record button now.

### Section 1: Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes

1. What branch of the military did you serve in? *Air Force.

2. When did you retire or separate? *March of 2020.

3. Do you currently receive health appointment reminder emails from the VA? *Yes. 

4. Do you open/read those emails? *Not all the time. You get text message, letter and the email. 

   1. If not, how do you get information about your appointments? * Typically, I get a text message. Everyone has their mobile device on them, and I use email secondary. They come in at the same time. 

5. Do you receive health appointment reminders by any other means like text message or phone call?

6. What do you find is your preferred method of communication about Veterans Health Administration appointments? Why? Does it change depending on the kind of appointment information that is being communicated? *I think you guys do a good job, date time, clinic and the doctor. I can’t think of any other information. Typically, the provider shows up on there. 



### Section 2: Preferred Content - 8 minutes

1. When you open your email health appointment reminders, what information would you like to be included? * The emails I don’t get as many, but I will get a text two days before. I think it’s two and two. I think it’s fine. You also get the phone call the night before. 
*I think for my age group I don’t need as much but for older people you might need that many. 

   1. Discuss cadence, information details, information about procedures, preparation, maps

### Section 3: Thoughts on Content Based on Sample Emails - 15 minutes

Let’s look at a sample of a [current reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/current-mhv-emailmockup.md):

1.	Can you tell me about your experience receiving email appointment reminders from the Veterans Health Administration? *I don’t add them anywhere. I’m pretty good at remembering when I have them, don’t mark them down. *I think that is good when they are listed on the email. * I love the new system. Now, you can do it on one site. 

   1. (if also receiving VEText) How does this experience compare with your VEText texted appointment reminders?

2. Is there information missing from the current reminder that you wish were included?

3. How often are you receiving reminder emails from the Veterans Health Administration?

   1. Is that good? Too much? What is ideal?

   2. Discuss consolidation or how many appointments should be in a single email.

4. How do you prefer for the Veterans Health Administration to communicate with you? - for example emails, sms, letters? *Yes, I don’t look at the letters. I would opt out of getting the letters. 

Let’s look at a possible [PHI sample reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/Pending-MHV-PHI-emailmockup.md)

1. What are your thoughts here? What do you think of the additional information? *That’s more highlighted, to grab your vision, that’s bolder. This has more information and it has links there if I had any questions. 

2. If you had your choice of this (PHI) reminder and one with more generic information, which would you choose to receive? Why? * I like the new format. The bold lettering stands out more. 

3. Do you have any concerns about privacy with your appointment reminders? If so, does that influence your method of reminder? *
4. How are you finding your way?  *I haven’t been to too many VA’s. The one I go to is color-coded. They have locators around the hospital. I would go to the help desk or volunteers to help you find where you need to go. 
5. Would a link be helpful? *Yes. 
6. How is it helpful to have the Provider information?  *It’s in the text message. It’s helpful because you have a name and a face to the name. 
7. Is there a way for you to see the email is not a scam? *Usually when it’s spam, they change the format or lettering. I usually look for VA.gov. *I think a week out and the day before for email reminders is fine. 
### Closing Interview - 5 minutes

Do you have any comments or questions about VA health appointment reminder emails that we have not yet covered today? *No. You guys have been working on this for a long time. I think the changes are helpful.
