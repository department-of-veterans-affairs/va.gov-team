## MyHealtheVet Email Appointment Reminder Veteran Preferences Conversation Guide

### Introduction - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jamie, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes (introduce). We are here today to talk about the Veteran Email Preferences for health appointment reminders from MyHealtheVet. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help us understand what types of information you’d expect in these health appointment reminders and what else you might like for these emails to include. 

\*\*Before we start, there are a few things I’d like to mention:\*\*

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

- There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans’ needs.

- I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

- I’m hoping to record the session today, so that we capture your opinions accurately.  Please know that they will not be shared with anyone outside of this research study and will be deleted once our research is complete. Are you okay with us recording today?

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I’m going to hit the record button now.

### Section 1: Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes

1. What branch of the military did you serve in? *Air Force.

2. When did you retire or separate? *January 1975.

3. Do you currently receive health appointment reminder emails from the VA? *Yes.

4. Do you open/read those emails? *Yes.

   1. If not, how do you get information about your appointments? *

5. Do you receive health appointment reminders by any other means like text message or phone call? *I get them by text and get about 3-4 for the same appointment.

6. What do you find is your preferred method of communication about Veterans Health Administration appointments? Why? Does it change depending on the kind of appointment information that is being communicated? *I like the ones I get the ones from email because it will have more than one. I wish they had location, like building. *I normally know who the provider is. Just by looking at the date and I can tell you who it’s with. 



### Section 2: Preferred Content - 8 minutes

1.	When you open your email health appointment reminders, what information would you like to be included? *Date and time. The location of appointments and doctors name. Most necessary is the location, I still get confused at the VA. *The information is clear and I understand it. I like it. * I don’t read them every time, but I have read them. I don’t read them all the time because it’s repetitive. *I get these cards that come in the mail, they tell you that’s it’s primary card, building and such information. 

   1. Discuss cadence, information details, information about procedures, preparation, maps

### Section 3: Thoughts on Content Based on Sample Emails - 15 minutes

Let’s look at a sample of a [current reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/current-mhv-emailmockup.md):

1. Can you tell me about your experience receiving email appointment reminders from the Veterans Health Administration? * I like this one. Maybe putting what building. 

   1. (if also receiving VEText) How does this experience compare with your VEText texted appointment reminders? *If you’re going to see a doctor and your medications haven’t changed, that’s redundant. I keep a list on me  in case of an emergency. I see people carry a box of medication containers. I don’t understand why they do that. They can look online to see what medications are prescribed. The how to prepare for your appointment is redundant to me. 

2. Is there information missing from the current reminder that you wish were included?

3. How often are you receiving reminder emails from the Veterans Health Administration? *I get them about twice a week. It’s fine with me. I would like get them at least a week out. *I keep a paper calendar. *I try to write it down as soon as I make the appointment. I just check to make sure I have it right. 


   1. Is that good? Too much? What is ideal?

   2. Discuss consolidation or how many appointments should be in a single email. * I like having all of them. * I get my little calendar and make sure I have written it down. Sometimes they cancel and they forget to tell you. So, I call them. 

4. How do you prefer for the Veterans Health Administration to communicate with you? - for example emails, sms, letters?

Let’s look at a possible [PHI sample reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/Pending-MHV-PHI-emailmockup.md)

1. What are your thoughts here? What do you think of the additional information? * I would like to see the building numbers. It helps if you have never seen them before (having provider information).I don’t look at the status. The status is helpful. The email would be helpful for me. Having flyers would be a good idea. 

2.	If you had your choice of this (PHI) reminder and one with more generic information, which would you choose to receive? Why? *I like this format better because it gives more information, but it would be helpful to add the building number. There are so many separate buildings here in the Salisbury VA. I have a map and I look at the signs if they have them. Having a map would help: something you can click on.
3. Do you have any concerns about privacy with your appointment reminders? If so, does that influence your method of reminder? **If something new popped up, I would be wary to open it up. If they didn’t send anything reminding people that their appointment reminders might look a little different.  *No.

Do you have any comments or questions about VA health appointment reminder emails that we have not yet covered today? *No.
