## MyHealtheVet Email Appointment Reminder Veteran Preferences Conversation Guide

### Introduction - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jamie, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes (introduce). We are here today to talk about the Veteran Email Preferences for health appointment reminders from MyHealtheVet. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help us understand what types of information you’d expect in these health appointment reminders and what else you might like for these emails to include. 

\*\*Before we start, there are a few things I’d like to mention:\*\*

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

- There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans’ needs.

- I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

- I’m hoping to record the session today, so that we capture your opinions accurately.  Please know that they will not be shared with anyone outside of this research study and will be deleted once our research is complete. Are you okay with us recording today?

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I’m going to hit the record button now.

### Section 1: Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes

1. What branch of the military did you serve in? *Army

2. When did you retire or separate? *1982

3. Do you currently receive health appointment reminder emails from the VA? *Yes.

4. Do you open/read those emails? *I always open them. Assuming its going to tell me I have an appointment coming up or it has been cancelled. 

   1. If not, how do you get information about your appointments? *

5. Do you receive health appointment reminders by any other means like text message or phone call? *Just email. 

6. What do you find is your preferred method of communication about Veterans Health Administration appointments? Why? Does it change depending on the kind of appointment information that is being communicated? *Yes, it’s my choice to get emails only. It’s on my phone on a VA folder in my filing system. I always get a letter but it’s good to have the email reminder. I probably have a text but I don’t pay close attention to it. *I usually put it on my phone in the calendar. *I get those emails, probably, monthly they will send me a reminder. *



### Section 2: Preferred Content - 8 minutes

1. When you open your email health appointment reminders, what information would you like to be included? *Where, phone number, I wish there was a line that said if it's labs, rheumatology, dermatology (extra line on what type of appointment), address, date and time. *Fortunately, I have never had that problem. If it were between (facility name) outpatient where I usually go, they don’t have rheumatology and dermatology, I would only know the difference between the address. 

   1. Discuss cadence, information details, information about procedures, preparation, maps

### Section 3: Thoughts on Content Based on Sample Emails - 15 minutes

Let’s look at a sample of a [current reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/current-mhv-emailmockup.md):

1. Can you tell me about your experience receiving email appointment reminders from the Veterans Health Administration?

   1. (if also receiving VEText) How does this experience compare with your VEText texted appointment reminders? *I have a question, Do you know how hard it is to call your clinic? It’s usually five minutes to to get a live person. It’s more of an inconvenience than anything else. It also doesn’t know when to call.

2. Is there information missing from the current reminder that you wish were included?

3. How often are you receiving reminder emails from the Veterans Health Administration? * I would say a week because it gives you enough time to react. We only have one car. So it gives me enough time to let them know and myself to plan transportation. 

   1. Is that good? Too much? What is ideal? 

   2. Discuss consolidation or how many appointments should be in a single email. * I like being able to plan out what’s going on. The more time I can react to something the better. 


4. How do you prefer for the Veterans Health Administration to communicate with you? - for example emails, sms, letters?

Let’s look at a possible [PHI sample reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/Pending-MHV-PHI-emailmockup.md)

1. What are your thoughts here? What do you think of the additional information? *Status is confirmed, giving me the clinic, address, and what clinic you are going to, I like that. I also like that it tells you about an in-person appointment. I can understand the tele-video thing, I had an aneurysm they repaired, and they would send me to get a CT scan and instead of me driving to Hinesville, I could just do the tele-video. *What does it mean, notification preferences? I would think how frequently you get them or change how to get the reminders. 
-Would it be helpful to have a link to the location? *Yes, it would be helpful (color-coded buildings, -number of buildings)
-Would what to have the doctor's name? *No. That would be that important. Doctors change all the time.
-I would like to see, if you have an upcoming VA appointment, and blood drawn before your appointment. 
2. If you had your choice of this (PHI) reminder and one with more generic information, which would you choose to receive? Why?

3. Do you have any concerns about privacy with your appointment reminders? If so, does that influence your method of reminder? *No. *I would go to My HealtheVet to double-check. I would do an announcement on My HealtheVet for anyone getting appointments, I would send an email reminder that the reminders will look different. 

### Closing Interview - 5 minutes

Do you have any comments or questions about VA health appointment reminder emails that we have not yet covered today? *No, just that I enjoy getting my appointment reminders that way. My wife's phone and my phone are linked and if I put it on my calendar, it also goes onto hers. I usually have it programmed for the day before.
