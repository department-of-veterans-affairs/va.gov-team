## MyHealtheVet Email Appointment Reminder Veteran Preferences Conversation Guide

### Introduction - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jamie, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes (introduce). We are here today to talk about the Veteran Email Preferences for health appointment reminders from MyHealtheVet. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help us understand what types of information you’d expect in these health appointment reminders and what else you might like for these emails to include. 

\*\*Before we start, there are a few things I’d like to mention:\*\*

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

- There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the emails and meet Veterans’ needs.

- I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

- I’m hoping to record the session today, so that we capture your opinions accurately.  Please know that they will not be shared with anyone outside of this research study and will be deleted once our research is complete. Are you okay with us recording today?

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I’m going to hit the record button now.

### **Section 2: Preferred Content - 8 minutes**



1. When you open your email health appointment reminders, what information would you like to be included? What is the most important information?


### **Section 3: Thoughts on Content Based on Sample Emails - 15 minutes**

Let’s look at a sample of a [current reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/current-mhv-emailmockup.md):



1. Can you tell me about your experience receiving email appointment reminders from the Veterans Health Administration?
2. Is there information missing from the current reminder that you wish were included?
3. How often are you receiving reminder emails from the Veterans Health Administration? Is that good? Too much? What is an ideal advance notice?
4. How do you feel about having a list of all upcoming appointments? Would you like to have just the most immediate appointment in an email or a list of all upcoming appointments?
5. When you are at a new facility or seeing a new provider, how do you usually find your way around the facility? Would it help to have a map of the facility itself? Would you like that linked in the reminder?

Let’s look at a possible [PHI sample reminder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vetext/product/research/2025-01-VEText-MyHealtheVet-email-appointment-reminder-content-research/Pending-MHV-PHI-emailmockup.md)



1. What are your thoughts here? What do you think of the additional information?
2. Notification preferences section: What would you think you do in this section?
3. If you had your choice of this (PHI) reminder and one with more generic information, which would you choose to receive? Why?
4. Do you have any concerns about privacy with an email appointment reminders that has this kind of information in it?
5. If you saw a new email like this one in your inbox and it looked different, would you be suspicious? If you were not sure about an email that seemed to be from the Veterans Health Administration, how would you confirm its legitimacy?
