Background
==========

Communications about debt, which are delivered principally through the paper mail service, are sporadic, and untimely, and often times go unread due to a variety of reasons (misplaced, didn’t open, etc.). This makes keeping track of and resolving debt difficult, time-consuming, and stressful for Veterans.

Benefits and Memorials 2 is developing a way for Veterans to access their debt letters online. The first phase of this product with include two features:
- Debt Landing Page: This page will be accessible to anyone visiting the site and will be a single source of truth for debt management that clearly communicates to Veterans what their options are and will provide functionality and/or calls-to-action to give Veterans the ability to resolve debt in the way that is most appropriate for their situation
- View Debt Letters: This feature will be accessible to logged-in Veterans and will allow them to view both a listing and the content of debt letters in their eFolder

Goals
=====

How might we make the process of navigating debt and communicating about debt easier for Veterans?

How might we provide ways for Veterans to understand the nature of their debt and its origins?

How might we guide Veterans towards information about the different ways they can resolve their debt? 

How might we notify Veterans of changes/updates concerning their debt without them needing to rely on mail correspondence?

Discovery Research Goal
==================

This study was meant to understand how Veterans currently navigate their debt and communicate with the Debt Management Center (DMC). Our team wanted to uncover how debts are resolved and pain points Veterans have surrounding the VA debt process. 

Research Method: Interviews 
===========================================

The first phase of this project is fast-tracked, so our team decided to conduct interviews with DMC's leadership team and contact center representatives to gain anecdotal information about how Veterans navigate their debt and what issues they are currently experiencing. Once we finalize the first design, we will be validating our findings by interviewing Veterans during usability testing.

Who We Spoke With
=================

- An Assistant Chief at the DMC
- The Chief of the Education and External Relations and Treasury Section at the DMC
- 2 Debt Counselors (contact center representatives)

Topics Covered 
===============

-  What interviewees' roles are at the DMC and team compositions

-  How many Veterans are typically assisted each day

-  Training that representatives go through to assist Veterans

-  What types of calls Debt Counselors typically receive from Veterans

-  The process Debt Counselors take to assist Veterans with their unique needs

-  How Debt Counselors interact with the debt letters 

-  Frustrations and pain points Veterans have expressed to Debt Counselors while navigating their debt

-  The different ways Veterans can acquire debt, and the different options Veterans have to resolve their debt

-  What information a Veteran may find important while navigating their debt 

Research Questions
==================

- What sort of training do Debt Counselors have prior to interacting with Veterans?

**3. It's common for Veterans to have more than one type of debt, particularly with education**

**4. Debt Counselors assist many Veterans each day and every call has a personalized solution for the Veteran** 

**5. Veterans often don't understand where their debt is coming from due to missing letters or delays in debts being issued**

**7. Letters are long and intimidating for Veterans, and they often don’t read them** 

**8. Both the regional office letters and the DMC letters are necessary to piece together debt information and next steps** 

**9. There are many opportunities for online functionality to improve Veterans’ experiences navigating their debt**

Key Takeaways In Depth
======================

**1. There are multiple dedicated teams at the DMC that specialize in different types of debt**
   - Some teams only handle education debt, some teams only take electronic correspondence, and some teams handle all calls about debt
   - All DMC Debt Counselors go through training ranging from 8-13 weeks depending on if they're specializing in a certain type of debt or they're providing general assistance to Veterans

**2. Debt Counselors often have to dig for  information about a Veteran's debt and corresponding letters in multiple systems**
   - The systems used are: CAROLS, Share, VBM (education debt), VAS (Compensation debt), VBMS (notification letters for mostly Comp + Pension), and LTS (Post 9/11 GI Bill) 
   - Education debt letters and Compensation + Pension letters live in different systems

**3. It's common for Veterans to have more than one type of debt, particularly with education**
   - Dropping a class, changing enrollment, or a mistake on the school's end results in separate housing, tuition, and books debts
   - These debts are listed individually and result in separate letters from the DMC 
   > "The letter from the regional office will have all of them combined, but each debt is treated separately so they will get 3 separate letters."

**4. Debt Counselors assist many Veterans each day and every call has a personalized solution for the Veteran** 
   - Debt Counselors estimated that they assist 20-50 Veterans every day 
   - DMC leadership estimated their teams assist around 3,000 Veterans each day 
   - There wasn't a clear indication of the split between Education and Compensation/Pension calls
      - Some said there was a 50/50 split while others said they receive twice as many Education calls as Compensation + Pension calls

**5. Veterans often don't understand where their debt is coming from due to missing letters or delays in debts being issued** 
   - Veterans don't understand how the debts were created and may not be aware of the debt
   - Although Debt Counselors have access to multiple systems, they sometimes cannot explain the debt's details; this upsets Veterans 

**6. Veterans have many options to resolve their debt, but many require submitting VA Form 5655**
   - Payment plans initially last for 1 year, but Debt Counselors can approve plans for up to 3 years if the Veteran submits the form
   - Veterans can receive help waiving debt in times of hardship, but it can take months to receive a response after submitting the form
   - Veterans can seek refunds when they have repaid debts in error or paid too much for their financial situation 
   - Veterans are able to dispute their debts directly with the benefit office using VA Form 5655 
   - Veterans are also able to request compromise offers if they can't pay the requested amount using VA Form 5655 

**7. Letters are long and intimidating for Veterans, and they often don’t read them** 
   - Letters can be upwards of 10 pages long and Veterans likely don't read the entire document 
   - The language could be more personalized around why the debt was created instead of the current generic verbiage
   - All the letters are written with the same terminology but are slightly changed depending on the debt 
   > " I don’t think any veterans think any of the letters are clear"

**8. Both the regional office letters and the DMC letters are necessary to piece together debt information and next steps** 
   - Regional office letters contain information explaining the debt, but the DMC's letters do not
      - This disconnect causes Veterans to be confused about the origins of their debt when receiving letters from the DMC 
   - DMC letters only display the type of debt (e.g. housing, tuition), dollar amount, and code number

**9. There are many opportunities for online functionality to improve Veterans’ experiences navigating their debt**
   - Displaying the letters online seems particularly beneficial for those with education debt because they are very transient and tech-savvy 
   - The folks we interviewed thought it would be beneficial to allow Veterans to request a waiver or complete VA Form 5655 online 
   > "I would say it would be helpful right away if the letters could be online other than waiting for the letter to show up."

Next Steps
===============

-   The design team is going to work with the backend engineering team to uncover what data is currently being passed through the API

-   The design team will begin ideation process based on what's available in the API 

-   Once the initial design is created, the design team will conduct usability testing to validate and uncover additional pain points Veterans experience with their VA debt
