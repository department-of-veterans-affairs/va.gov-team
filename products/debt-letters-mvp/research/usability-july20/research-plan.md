# Research Plan for BAM2, Debt Letters MVP, July 2020

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
    - Debt Letters MVP, BaM2

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

- The Debt Letters MVP is a congressionally-mandated initiative to provide VA debt letters online. Today, debt letters are delivered by mail and often don't make it into the hands of the Veterans they address. As an initial MVP, the DMC is looking to demonstrate forward progress on this initiative by implementing a solution that allows Veterans to more quickly and easily understand if and why they may have debts with the VA, and how to work with the VA to resolve them.
  
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

- Interview research questions:
   - What are Veterans' experiences with VA debts?
   - What problems do Veterans experience with the debt letters themselves?
   - Have Veterans interacted with the Debt Management Center? How was that experience?
   - How do Veterans keep track of their debts with the VA now?
   - What is important for Veterans to know about their debts? 
   - How do Veterans prefer to pay VA debts and why?
   - How would Veterans expect to be notified of their debts with the VA? Is that what they prefer?
   - What do Veterans expect to happen after a debt is paid or resolved?
   - What sort of online tools/capabilities would Veterans want available to them when they get a VA debt?
- Usability research questions:
   - Where would Veterans expect to find the VBA Debt Letters on VA.gov?
   - Debt List:
     - Do the debt summary cards consist of the right information?
     - Do Veterans understand each of the status types?
     - Is it clear to Veterans which debts they should investigate further from the debt list?
     - What next steps would Veterans take after viewing the debt list?
     - What do Veterans expect to happen once they click the ‘View debt details’ button?
     - What do they expect to see when they click the ‘View debt details’ button? 
     - What would Veterans think if a debt disappeared from this page?
     - Will Veterans expect to see their medical debts as well?
   - Debt Details:
     - Is it clear what’s currently happening with their debt(s) (i.e. holding, referred to ToP, etc.)? 
     - Do Veterans understand why there is sometimes a ‘Next steps’ section and other times Holding or Repayment alerts?
     - What do Veterans expect to happen once a debt is no longer being held?
     - Are Veterans able to locate the link to download their letters?
     - Are Veterans still interested in downloading their letters after viewing what’s currently happening with their debts?
        - If so, for what purpose(s)?     
     - What are their next steps after downloading the letters?
     - Are Veterans able to easily navigate back from debt details to debt list?
     - Are the options available to resolve debts clear? 
     - How do Veterans feel about certain links redirecting them from the tool into Debtman?
     - What do Veterans expect to happen after a debt is resolved?
   - Debt Download Table:
     - What do Veterans think about the download table?
     - How would they find the right letter for a specific debt?
     - What information are they looking for within those letters that would be helpful as they navigate their debt?
     - Are Veterans able to navigate back to the debt details or list page?
     - What do Veterans expect to happen when downloading a debt letter?


4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?
- Veterans will have negative feedback about the debt letters.
- Veterans will express that it is difficult to keep track of their debts.
- Veterans will expect to see ALL of their debts here, including medical.
- Veterans will want to know more specifically why they have debts.
- Veterans will be able to find the debt letter downloads.
- Veterans will not be interested in downloading the debt letters to understand their debt, but may do so for record keeping.
- Veterans will expect to be able to access past debts, and will be shocked if their debt disappears.
- Veterans may not understand ‘Next steps’ being replaced by a holding or repayment status.
- Veterans will be confused by new tabs being opened to Debtman.

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
- Remote moderated directed interviews and usability testing on high fidelity, interactive UXPin prototypes
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
- We chose these methods because we were unable to do full discovery research prior to development work being started, so we have a lot of lingering generative questions and a prototype to be evaluated.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	
- Online, via Zoom

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
- High fidelity prototypes in UXPin (link forthcoming)

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)
- Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	
- We would like to interview 8-10 Veterans who have incurred at least one VBA debt in the past.
- In order to reach the desires number of participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 15 participants total, with the expectation that a max of 7 no-shows
- We would like to speak with a mix of participants, including:
