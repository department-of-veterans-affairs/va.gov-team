# Debt Letters Conversation Guide

**Note:** This is a draft. Since this conversation guide was written the team pivoted their plans for the MVP and research approach. This conversation guide will be finalized in the following sprint to reflect these changes. 

## Moderator logistics

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute*

*In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is ______, and I'm a designer and researcher for VA.gov. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me. Today we're going to be talking about a new way for Veterans to access their VA debt letters online. During this test, I will ask you to share your screen so that I can follow along with you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?" 



## Interview Questions - 10 minutes

- What did you think about the way your debt was communicated to you?
- How did you pay your debt? (More specifically: method of payment)
  	- Is this payment method what you prefer?
- How did you keep track of your debt to the VA?
- Have you interacted with the Debt Management Center directly?
  - If so, how was that experience?
- What is most important to you when receiving communication about your debt?
- What would you expect to happen once you’ve paid off a debt?

   - If so, what was your last experience like? 


## First Task: Find debt letters on VA.gov - 10 minutes

_Direct the Veteran to VA.gov_

Imagine that you’re trying to find the digital copies of your debt letters somewhere on this site and show me how you would go about doing that, starting from this page. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through what you’re thinking.

### Things to watch for:

- Where does the Veteran go, and what is their reasoning?


## Second Task: Review Content screen - 5 minutes

I'm going to paste a new link into the Zoom chat. This link will be a prototype, so some areas will be clickable while others are not.
_(Paste UXPin link into Zoom chat)_
Take a moment to look over this page and describe what you’re seeing.
_Pause_
- Do you see anything surprising or confusing?
- Before we proceed, can you tell me what sort of debts you expect to see?
- Do you have any other thoughts about this page?
If you’re ready to proceed, go ahead and show me what you would do next to download your debt letters from this screen.
## Third Task: Navigate to the tool & sign in - 2 minutes
_Once they’ve clicked the login button_ 
Go ahead and proceed through the log in using the pre-filled information.
### Questions:
- Did that page provide you with enough information to know what you needed to do, if you received a debt letter in the mail?
- What do you think about being asked to sign in?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant hesitate on any part of the page?
- Does the participant note that anything important is missing?
- How quickly does the participant notice the login button?
- Does the participant hesitate to log in?
- Does the participant mention anything about signing in?


## Fourth Task: Describe the debt list - 10 minutes

Now that you’re in the tool, take a moment to look over the page and describe to me what you’re seeing. As a general note, you would not see this many debts on a typical account, but we’ve included many different types of debt for the purposes of this session.

_Pause_

### Questions

- Can you move down the list and describe to me what is happening with each of these debts?
- What would you expect to see once you click on the ‘View debt details’ button?
- What would you expect to happen if you pay off one of these debts?
- Do you have any other thoughts about this screen?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant seem to understand the content of the cards?
- Does the participant report that anything is missing from the cards?
- What would the participant do next from this list?


## Fifth Task: Download the most recent debt letter you’ve been sent - 2 minutes

Now that you’ve looked over the page, let’s say you want to download the most recent debt letter sent to your address. Can you tell me what you would do next?


### Questions
- What information were you looking for to determine which debt from the list you’d select?
- Were these documents where you expected them to be?
- Can you describe what you’re seeing on this page?
- Is there anything missing from this page that you expected to see?

### Things to watch for:
- Does the participant understand that newly-updated debts will be on top?
- Does the participant locate the downloads quickly?


## Sixth Task: Find information about your Compensation & Pension debt

Now let’s imagine that you previously submitted a waiver for a Compensation & Pension debt and you want to look into the debt’s status. Show me how you would go about that from this page.  

_If they’re unable to find out how to get to the previous page, direct them to the back button_

### Things to watch for:
- How does the participant return to the list view from the most recent detail page?
- Is the participant able to easily find the Compensation & Pension debt with the submitted waiver?
- What keywords does the participant look for when selecting the debt from the list?
- Is it clear to the participant what is happening with the debt?


## Seventh Task: Find information about disputing a debt

Now say that you saw a debt on your list and would you think it was created in error. What would you do?

_If they’re unable to find out how to get to the previous page, direct them to the back button_

### Questions
- What do you expect to happen once you click on the link?

### Things to watch for:
- Does the Veteran seem surprised when they’re taken to the Debtman site?



## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Will be determined in the second iteration convo guide based on pivot with MVP + research 


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
