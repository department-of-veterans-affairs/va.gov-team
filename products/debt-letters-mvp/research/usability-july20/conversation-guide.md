## Intro - 3 min

Thank you for joining us today! My name is ______, and I'm a designer and researcher for VA.gov. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me. Today we're going to be talking about a new way for Veterans to access information about their VA debt as well as download VA debt letters online.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take 75-90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- During this test, I will ask you to share your screen so that I can follow along with you. When we get to that portion of the session, I will give you instructions on how to share your screen.**
- **You'll be interacting with prototypes.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 



## Interview Questions - 13 min

- Before we jump into the session, can you describe your experience with VA debts?
- What did you think about the way your debt was communicated to you?
- How would you expect new debts to be communicated to you?
- What is most important to you when receiving communication about your debt?
- How did you pay your debt? (More specifically: method of payment)
  	- Is this payment method what you prefer?
- How did you keep track of your debt to the VA?
- What would you expect to happen once you’ve paid off a debt?
- What sort of online tools or resources would you want available to you if you got a VA debt in the future?
- What do you think about needing to log into VA.gov in order to see information about your debt?  

**Screen share**

Okay, please share your screen so I can follow along with you for the next portion of our session.  

## First Task: Find debt letters on VA.gov - 10 min

- I'd like you to open a new tab in your browser, and go to https://www.va.gov/ and login. 

Imagine that you received a letter about a VA debt in the mail some time ago and you’d like to look into it, but you’ve misplaced the letter. You’re now trying to find the digital copy of your debt letter somewhere on this site. Show me how you would go about doing that, starting from this page. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through what you’re thinking.

### Things to watch for:

- Where does the Veteran go, and what is their reasoning?


## Second Task: Review Content screen - 5 min 

I'm going to paste a new link into the Zoom chat. This link will be a prototype, so some areas will be clickable while others are not.
_(Paste UXPin link into Zoom chat)_
https://preview.uxpin.com/4355a6c97a71ddaf1069ec43e5dfc0ae46b79869 
Take a moment to look over this page and describe what you’re seeing.
_Pause_
- Do you see anything surprising or confusing?
- Does this page provide  you with enough information to know what you needed to do, if you received a debt letter in the mail?
- Before we proceed, can you tell me what sort of debts you expect to see?
- Do you have any other thoughts about this page?
If you’re ready to proceed, go ahead and show me what you would do next to find a digital version of your debt letter.

## Third Task: Describe the debt list - 10 minutes

Alright, now we’re going to imagine that you’re Hector and you’ve logged into the tool. Take a moment to look over this page and describe to me what you’re seeing. As a general note, you would not see this many debts on a typical account, but we’ve included many different types of debt for the purposes of this session.

### Questions

- Can you move down the list and describe to me what is happening with each of these debts?
- What would you expect to see once you click on the ‘View debt details’ button?
- What would you expect to happen if you pay off one of these debts?
- Let’s say you’d like to request financial assistance for your CH 33 housing debt. Can you show me where you’d find that information? 
	- What would your next step be based on this information?
	- If you were to click the link, what would you expect to happen? 
	- Go ahead and click the link. How do you feel about being redirected to a new webpage? 
- Do you have any other thoughts about this screen?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant seem to understand the content of the cards?
- Does the participant report that anything is missing from the cards?
- What would the participant do next from this list?
- How does the participant feel about being redirected to the Debtman site for more information about requesting financial assistance? 

## Fourth Task: Download the most recent debt letter you’ve been sent - 15 minutes

Let’s say that the VA debt letter you misplaced is for your most recently updated debt. Show me what you would do next to find a digital copy of the letter. 

### Questions
- What information were you looking for to determine what you would do next to download the letter?
- Before clicking on the link to view your downloadable letters, what do you expect to see?

[The participant navigates from the debt summary page to the list of downloadable letters. They may navigate to the debt details page and will need to be directed to look for the link via that screen]

- What information are you looking for when deciding which letter to download?
- What do you expect to happen when you click the ‘download letter’ button?
- Is there any information missing from this page that you would expect to see?
- Is there anything else you’d like to say about this page before we move on?

Go ahead and download the letter. 

- How does this action compare with what you expected to happen?
- What would you do after downloading the letter?

### Things to watch for:
- Does the participant understand that newly-updated debts will be on top?
- Does the participant notice the link on the right sidebar to download their letters?
- If yes, how long does it take the participant to find information about where to download their letters?
- Does the participant click on the debt details button instead of the link in the right sidebar?
- If yes, what does the participant think about seeing their debt letter history but not being able to download the letters on that page?
- How long does it take the participant to decide which letter they would download, and how do they make that decision? 

## Fifth Task: Find information about your Compensation & Pension debt - 8 min

Now let’s imagine that you previously submitted a waiver for a Compensation & Pension debt and you want to look into the debt’s status. Show me how you would go about that from this page.  

_If they’re unable to find out how to get to the previous page, direct them_

- Can you describe what the debt’s status is? 
- What would you do based on this debt’s status?
- Is there any other information that would be helpful to understand what’s going on with your debt?
- If you had a question about your waiver’s status, what would you do? 

### Things to watch for:
- How does the participant return to the listview from the most recent detail page? (back button, the link, etc.)
- Is the participant able to easily find the Compensation & Pension debt with the submitted waiver?
- What keywords does the participant look for when selecting the debt from the list?
- Is it clear to the participant what is happening with the debt?


## Followup Questions - 8 min

That’s all the questions I have about the prototype! 

- What are your overall impressions about this experience?
- Have you used other debt management tools?  
   - If so, how does this experience compare? 
- Would you use this tool to find more information about your debts? Why or why not?
- Would you use this tool to access your debt letters in the future? Why or why not?
- Do you have any other thoughts to share with us today?  

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 min 

That’s all the questions I have for you! Do you have any questions for me?
 
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a thank-you gift.

Is it ok for our contractor Perigean to send that gift to the same email we used to communicate with you about scheduling this session?

   - [If no] Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
