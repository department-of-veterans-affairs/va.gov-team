Goals
=====

-   Ensure that Veteran debts are communicated effectively and timely

Background
==========

The Debt Letters MVP is a new tool that allows Veterans to view their debts and download debt letters sent by VA's Debt Management Center. In many cases Veterans lose, forget about, misunderstand, or do not receive these mailed letters; this leads to adverse consequences like decreased credit scores or referral to the Department of the Treasury. 

User Research Goal
==================

This study was meant to reveal both successes and pain points as Veterans the new "Manage your VA debt" tool

-   Investigate pain points that exist around Veterans' debts with VA

-   Learn how Veterans navigate to the "Manage your VA debt" tool from VA.gov homepage 

-   Uncover any gaps in the tool's design based off Veterans' experiences using the product

Hypotheses Tested 
==================

-   Veterans will have negative feedback about the debt letters themselves

-   Veterans will express that it is difficult to keep track of their debts

-   Veterans will expect to see ALL of their debts here, including medical

-   Veterans will want to know more specifically why they have debts

-   Veterans will be able to find the debt letter downloads

-   Veterans will not be interested in downloading the debt letters to understand their debt, but may do so for record keeping

-   Veterans will expect to be able to access past debts, and will be shocked if their debt disappears

-   Veterans may not understand 'Next steps' being replaced by a holding or repayment status

-   Veterans will be confused by being redirected to the VA Debtman site to learn about the Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655)

Research Method: Guided Interview & Task-based Usability Test 
==============================================================

Due to time constraints for this project, we were unable to run a full discovery sprint prior to design. Because of this, we decided to start our study with about 15 minutes of structured interviews. Afterwards, we conducted a task-based usability test to evaluate the design's intuitiveness as Veterans investigate their VA debts. We lead participants through various tasks using an interactive UXPin prototype. Each remote session lasted approximately an hour and fifteen minutes. 

Who We Spoke With
=================

-   7 total participants (5 female, 2 male, ages from 25-64)
    -   The participants represented a range of current and past VA debt experiences:
    -   2 participants had Compensation & Pension debts as a result of divorce
    -   1 participant had an Education debt from dropping a course
    -   1 participant had an Education debt from her school miscertifying her
    -   1 participants had Medical Copay debts in the past
    -   1 participants did not divulge what kind of debt they had
    -   1 participant had never had a VA debt
    -   2 participants reported that their debts were being held for COVID.

-   Participants served in the following service branches: Army, Air Force

Interview Key Takeaways in Depth
--------------------------------

1.  **Veterans reported that it's difficult to get in touch with the right people to talk to about their VA debt**

    - When calling to discuss their debt, participants reported that they'd be left on hold for up to an hour, transferred in a loop, and dropped.

      - "I've been in constant loops of having to talk to people and getting dropped... and the [45m-1h] wait time alone to talk to the VA is atrocious." 

      - "It seems like the VA just wants to bounce me around from person to person..."

      - "I would do anything not to call the Debt Management Center."

    - Participants reported that they were unable to get the answers they needed by talking to DMC representatives.

      - "It seems like they don't have the answers to the questions I've asked in regards to why the debt that I've incurred cannot be resolved."

      - "Sometimes it makes it that much worse when you're trying to talk to people and they don't have enough time in their day to talk to you."

    - One veteran contacted their senator for help due to difficulty navigating his debt

    - One veteran could not interact with the VA due to having a fiduciary

2.  **Veterans reported that they felt blindsided by their VA debt**

    - Several participants said that it took a long time for an issue with their account to be caught, often resulting in a large and sudden debt.

      - "They give you a letter about 6 months later - that's how it is. They're not timely. You think everything is paid for and everything is good. Then you get a letter saying you owe this much, so then you gotta go back and defend yourself."

      - "It was unnecessary for the amount of time that had lapsed since the time the debt occurred. The VA should have stayed on top of it so I wouldn't incur any debt. Instead I got blindsided by it and I had to pay back a bunch of debt."

    - Three participants felt they did everything right to avoid getting a debt, but ended up with one anyway.

      - "I have a feeling like when you send things to VA, it just gets lost. I did everything on my part to make a debt accumulate and I still got one. I'm hesitant to do anything. No matter what I do, it's going to get lost."

      - "I went directly into the office on the closest base and gave them my papers immediately and was told it would be taken care of. And a year later, they decided to take care of it. So I owed money back for that whole year."

      - "I lost faith in those [at my local VA]  because they led me to believe it was perfect and it wasn't."

    - Some Veterans didn't realize that what they'd done would cause a debt

3.  **Veterans feel that debts are usually caused by the VA's negligence, putting undue stress on them and their families**

    - Several participants stated that they felt the overpayments should not have happened in the first place

      - "If they had a system in place to prevent those payments from being dispersed, then I wouldn't have that debt. But they don't have a system, so I ended up with debt."

      - "I don't think the debt was legitimate, but I paid it anyway."

    - Veterans often depend on the payments that are garnished for debt repayment to live

      - "They don't take into account the fact that sometimes, for most of us, when we're getting housing allowance and our disability... we count on every penny of that to pay our bills."

      - "I think that when people get a debt like that, it worries them. Especially someone older who is retired and on a fixed income, a debt would be a horrible thing for them."

4.  **Veterans do not trust that the VA's systems and processes will work in their favor**

    - Several Veterans reported that they document all of their interactions and payments to VA for their own files, often so they can defend themselves from the VA

      - "[I pay with checks so that,] if someone says I didn't pay it, I can show them the check."

      - "If I decide one day... or if someone requests to see a payment history... or if they try to challenge if I paid that month... I could provide the payment history as physical proof. So that way, there's no question about it. They can see it, I can see it."

    - Several participants reported that they would check their debt's status often to protect themselves

      - "I guess, because I have a strong distrust in VA, I would be checking every day."

    - Several participants claimed that the VA and mail service lose things often

    - Participants don't trust that their forms will be processed correctly or on time by the VA.

5.  **Veterans reported that navigating their debt was difficult due to a lack of accessible information**

    - Due to debt notifications being sent by multiple departments, letters lack the full picture of debt origin, debt amount, and repayment options.

    - Information available online must be actively searched out.

    - Many answers can only be found by calling the DMC or originating office.

6. **Veterans want to be able to find information about their debts digitally**

    - Several participants expressed frustration that they had to call the DMC to get any information about their debt.

      - "I want to be able to login and see how much the debt was and where it came from."

      - "I wish I could send questions [electronically] to VA and ask them things instead of calling 1-800 numbers and waiting for two hours."

    - Many Veterans would prefer to work toward debt resolution online-first

      - "I'm a huge fan of being able to do stuff on the internet without having to talk to people... because there's usually a bunch of kids around me."

      - "I like the ease and the flexibility of being able to submit my own things online."

    - All participants confirmed that VA.gov would be an appropriate location for the tool, and don't mind signing in view it

    - Two participants reported that they'd expect their spouses or assigned dependents to be able to access debt information

7. **Veterans want to be notified of their debts via email or text.**

    - "I would've liked an email or alert 'rather than being slam dunked [by a letter]."

8. **Veterans are frustrated by the online VA ecosystem**

    - Participants noted that they could not always remember which VA site was which, and they didn't understand the differences

    - Participants were frustrated by logins they need to interact with their benefits

      - "I don't get why they're not linked. I'm already logged into VA.gov, why should I have to go that extra mile to log into ebenefits, but when I go to ebenefits and I try to look at my disability rating, it says that I have to sign in[to VA.](http://va.gov/)gov to see those things?"

Usability Key Takeaways in Depth
--------------------------------

1.  **Veterans had different strategies for locating VA debt information online**

    - The blue hub area on the home page drew most attention, no participant ventured into the primary navigation

    - Six participants stated that they'd look beneath the specific benefit hub

    - Five participants narrowed in on 'View your payment history' 

    - Three participants stated they'd look beneath the 'Records' hub

    - Two participants stated that they'd expect the debt letters in their Profile or My VA

    - Two participants stated that they would use the search feature

    - One participant said they would specifically look for a 'Financial' hub

2.  **Participants commonly missed the sign-in alert and weren't aware of the tool pathway**

    - Two participants signed in using the alert

    - Two participants signed in with the blue global sign in

    - Two participants had to be directed to click sign in to continue the test

    - One participant asked, "sign into what?" in response to the alert

3.  **Participants quickly found the content about the types of debt included in the tool, but also expected all VA debts to be included**

    - "School debt, disability, pension, and any health copays should be what's in there."

    - "Uhm, well any debt that you owe the VA. It's all kind of here, right?"

4.  **Participants liked the specificity of the status features and emphasized the importance of setting expectations by including dates**

    - "It's tough because there's no dates. It just says check back soon. How long does this process take? Should I be worrying that the waiver isn't going to be approved?"

    - "Give me a timeframe. You don't know how long. I have other things going on so I can't think about that every single day. I need to know when I can expect something to change and when the ball is back in my court and it's on me to do the next step."

5.  **Participants expected to see confirmation that their debts were fully repaid as well as have access to past debts**

    - "[I'd like a] 'Congratulations, you did a good job!' or at least a notification."

    - "Hopefully there'd be some history that I could log in and see this debt is now 0 or status is now paid off. Something like that."

6. **Many participants understood the cards and were satisfied with the information included in them -- they did not feel drawn to click into the debt details immediately**

    - All participants quickly understood the statuses provided in the test cards and based their next action on that information

    - One participant initially thought that each card represented a letter

    - One participant thought that the cards were just an initial notification about the debt

    - One participant said that she would have liked the "Updated [date]" to be more in line with the status, so it would read "First notification letter sent [date]"

7. **Several participants expected to see payment and debt history on the detail page**

    - "[I want,] at a later time, to be able to view my payment history."

    - "I'm not seeing any payments made, just showing the amounts owed."

8. **Most participants engaged highly with the 'On this page' component, and it helped them complete the usability tasks quickly**

    - "I like that under Current VA debt, it tells you what you can do on the page."

    - "The down arrow says I'm gonna give you the answer when I click on it and it moves you down the page which is good"

9. **Veterans would prefer to fill out the FSR online**

    - "I would prefer to have a link and potentially submit something as opposed to calling someone. I like the ease and the flexibility of being able to submit my own things online."

    - "I would prefer to submit [the FSR] online because people seriously don't trust the mail and it's widely discussed how documents get lost."

10. **Participants were overall satisfied with the letter download page, but several had difficulties navigating back to the debt summary list.**


**Additional findings**:

-   Most participants were satisfied with the 'Why might I have this debt?' while others felt it should be more specific

-   Several participants reacted to the term 'Demand Letter' negatively
