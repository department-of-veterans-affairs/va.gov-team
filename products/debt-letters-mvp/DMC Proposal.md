Epic Name:
Veteran Debt Processing Enhancements LIGHT 
Epic Summary:
This is a potential FY20 quick win solution to enhance veteran experience by providing veterans a limited view of Veteran Debt Letters and leveraging an existing Veteran-facing platform, with  electronic notification of viewing availability.

This solution addresses only one of the requirements per legislation S.2248 Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018: “delivery of debt notices by standard mail and electronic means.”

Currently, debt letter delivery is limited to US Mail notification. 

Requested by:
Debt Management Center (DMC)
Point of Contact:
Jason Hoge
Epic Value Statement:	We will provide online access of four (4) debt letters to increase visibility.

For:
Veterans
Who:

Veterans with profiles in VA Profile, a self-service platform maintained by VEO and formerly known as VETS360, who will benefit from automated emails notifying them that their debt letters are available to view online.
 
The:

This Quick Win capability will provide:

1.	Veteran debt letters displayed via VA.GOV or another veteran-facing system where veterans create a profile. The display will be a digital image like a .jpg, .png, etc.

2.	A landing page on an existing Veteran-facing platform to allow viewing of VA debt letters.  The expectation is that four (4) Debt Letter types will be available, as not all debt letters are in-scope.  (Debt  letters, their origin, totality, and the system in which they reside will be vetted and confirmed by OIT, DMC, VBA and VEO).

3.	VMBS currently stores DMC debt letters and is a potential source for obtaining the 4 Debt Letter types. 

4.	An automated electronic notification to Veterans that their Debt Letters are available for viewing digitally. There is potential to leverage the VeteransProfile platform for Veteran contact information, and the ePharmancy notification process to leverage existing trigger and notification technology. 

5.	Electronic notification should include a link to the landing page using VA prescribed security and access parameters. 

6.	A technical solution that communicates with VBMS, the datasource of DMC debt letters, that is capable of pulling DMC debt letters from VBMS.

That:

The compelling key benefit is that this functionailty dramatically enhances the Veteran experience and complies with a portion of the Veterans and Benefit Transition Act of 2018: delivery of debt notices by standard mail and electronic means. This does not address the rest of the sections of the said law.

Unlike:
 
Current means of antiquated debt letter delivery using ordinary mail alone no longer meets the needs of veterans because of its inability to provide timely and accurate current status and amounts related to veteran debt. There is no online access for veterans to view their Debt Letters.

Our Process/Solution:

Our proposal will:
 
•	Provide a limited view of VA debt letters to Veterans with automated, electronic notification and ability to view their Debt Letters online.  

•	Enhance veteran experience related to Debt Letters.

•	 Bring VA debt notification online and move VA forward in our pursit to resolve misalignment with current industry standards, in compliance with a portion of the Veterans and Benefit Transition Act of 2018. 


In Scope:
•	Online viewing of a subset of debt notification letters via an exsisting Veteran-facing platform.

•	Automated electronic notification of availablilty and viewing access of debt notification letters.

•	Online interface for veterans to view electronic debt records as a digital image via VA.GOV. VEO has the capability to whitelist MyDocuments. VA Profile is currently used for email notifications.

•	Based on a predetermined system trigger, automated email notifications to veterans informing them that their debt letters are available for viewing digitally on VA.GOV or similar system.

•	Development of a technical solution/interface that communicates with VBMS, the datasource for the debt letters, that is capable of pulling DMC debt letters from VBMS.

Out of Scope:

•	This solution does not address the following legislations: (1) S.2155 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Sec.302 and (2) HR.5895, MILCON/VA appropriations Act of 2018, page 262.  

•	This solution only partially addresses S.2248 Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018 and does not address its sections requiring that (1) SECVA collaborate with veteran service organizations to develop standard letter format in plain language and shall include a notice of the debt and a clear explanation; (2) Notice to Congress: initially 90 days from act, then every 30 days; develop a standard letter, study and report; (3) Treasury Study coordination 

•	Non-Veteran Beneficiaries.

•	Means for Veterans to submit a Financial Status Report, VA Form 5655, and request a waiver, negotiate, dispute, and/or payment plan through VA.gov to the centralized mail portal to DMC.

•	Debt letters that are not part of the initial limited scope capability. 

•	Display of DMC-issued pen letters (aka Ad Hoc letters) are out of scope.

•	User training for employees, stakeholders and veterans.

•	Collaboration with Veteran Service Operations.

•	Analysis of the requirements and resources that would be necessary to develop the capability for creating a single consolidated snapshot of a Veteran’s debt.

Non-Functional Requirements:
•	Seamless platform integration.
 
•	Our Veteran-facing platform shouldwhitelist the function for debt notification letters and should not display documents from any other source in order to prevent over-exposure.  
•	The solution needs to have the capability to send out timely email notifications, based on a technical trigger, that inform veterans who have profiles in VeteransProfile that their debt letter is available for viewing digitally on VA.GOV or another veteran-facing system.
•	The system solution must be reliable—email notifications must always be sent out to veterans when the trigger for notification occurs.
•	The digital image of the debt letters must be available for secure viewing as a digital image by veterans when they log-onto their profiles on VA.gov or selected other veteran-facing system.
•	The solution must meet capacity of in-scope debt letters.

•	The solution must interface with VBMS.
