# Executive Summary

There’s an overarching project called the Veteran Debt Processing Enhancement that was put into place due to several overarching legislative requirements specifically related to Veteran debt.  VA is working on a comprehensive solution across all administrations that encompasses all requirements, to include business process re-engineering and modernization of systems.

As an initial MVP, the DMC is looking to demonstrate forward progress on this initiative by implementing a solution that allows Veterans to more quickly and easily understand if and why they may have debts with the VA, and how to work with the VA to resolve them.

## User Problem Statement
### OPTIONS
- How might we make communications regarding debt accurate, timely, and clear, while treating Veterans with dignity and compassion?
- Veterans who have incurred a debt with the VA need a way to get accurate, timely, and clear information about the reason and status of that debt, along with their options for resolving it, while being treated with dignity and compassion.
- I am a Veteran who has incurred a debt with the VA for one reason or another, and I need to understand why and what my options for resolving it are. Currently, in addition to the information sometimes being inaccurate or out of date, the communications I receive from the VA about debt leave me feeling frustrated and demeaned.
- Those of our Veterans who have incurred a debt with the VA struggle to understand the reason for the debt and what their options are to resolve it because the communications about debt the VA sends are difficult to understand and slow to arrive. Our solution should focus on making all content and communication about debt accurate, timely, clear, and compassionate, so that Veterans can take appropriate action while maintaining their dignity.


## Solution

### Phase 1
#### Debt Landing Page
[Epic](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/7527)
Veterans will be able to come to single place on VA.gov where they can get general information about incurring a debt with the VA and learn about their options for managing debt with the VA. This landing page should be clear and concise and accurately communicate the options Veterans have to manage and resolve debt.

#### Veteran Debt Letters
[Epic](XXX)
Veterans with an active debt with the VA will be able to receive secure outbound communications about that debt on VA.gov.

### Phase 2
#### New Letter Notifications
Veterans will...

#### Expanded Letter Types
Veterans will be...

### Potential User Goals
- To have a single place through which I can manage any debts I have with the VA
- To be able to understand all of the communication about any debts I have with the VA
- To be able to understand and access all of the available paths to resolve any debts I have incurred
- To understand ahead of time what benefits and/or set of circumstances might lead to me incurring a debt with the VA
- To know as quickly as possible about changes to my debt status with the VA, to include newly filed debts, and changes to existing debts regardless of the cause of the change
- For the overall experience of handling a debt with the VA be as painless as possible instead of leaving me feeling frustrated and demeaned
- To receive consistently accurate information about the status of my account, regardless of the way in which that communication gets to me

## Hypotheses
- TBD

## Requirements 
### High-Level

- Digital "landing page" explaining the debt management process at the VA
- Veterans can view information about debts they owe the VA in a single place
- Veterans are automatically notified when new communications about debts are available to them, and given a way to navigate directly to the new communication on VA.gov
- Outgoing notifications about debt are configurable
- Veterans can understand the communications they receive from the VA about debts; they are plain-language, adhere to modern design practices, and engage with Veterans in an empathetic way
- Information delivered to Veterans about the status and nature of their debts is accurate and up-to-date

## Constraints
There are two main contraints known at this time, one coming from the business and one from the technical landscape within the VA.

Business: This problem affects Veterans as well as eligible dependents, however due to external pressures from Congress, there is a desire to limit the scope of this problem to indebted Veterans to expedite the process of launching something meaningful to Veterans. It's currently unclear how much wiggle room there is here; it's possible we might be able to address the concerns of non-Veterans without adding complexity to the problem or lengthening the delivery timeline

Technical: There are many different types communications about debt (typically referred to as "debt letters) that are sent out to Veterans. At this time, many of these have yet to be migrated into a central respository and organized in a reliable fashion. Because of this, the scope of this problem is limited to addressing only those letters types which ARE organized and accessible in a central respository (VBMS eFolder)

# Implementation Info

## Status

#### 03/06/2020
BAM2 conducted an internal project introduction where action items were:
- Matt to conduct pre-discovery aimed at clarifying the product AND project landscape (what and who), and making first contact with initial SMEs we'd like to conduct interviews with, including those within DEPO
- Adding artifacts/documentat to the PO (DMC proposal, legislation, sample letters and types, etc.)

#### 02/27/2020
The Debt Letters MVP was officially assigned to BAM2 to be slotted in as our next project. We will be moving forward with the project. Our first major milestone will be creating and delivering a first draft roadmap to all stakeholders; the target window for delivering this roadmap is April 2020.

## Solution Narrative

- **Sprint XX: (02/26/2020 - 03/10/2020)**:
  - Project officially passed intake and was assigned to BAM2 to begin work immediately, in parallel with existing projects
  - A recurring meeting series has been established with the primary stakeholder group (Thursdays at 1200PM, EST) to discuss project status and to help coordinate with various secondary stakeholders both within the VA (numerous lines of business that deal with debt) and without (Congress, Pay.gov, etc)

## API Calls and Dependent Systems
### Existing eFolder Integration
#### Useful Links
The current VSA team owning this is the Structured Data team. Their product folder contains a bunch of useful information on the existing integrations.

- Engineer: Keith Adkins (Keith.Adkins@adhocteam.us)
- Engineer: Ben Shyong (Ben.Shyong@adhocteam.us)

#### Background
We've been told that there are five (5) unique debt letter types that are currently available in a Veterans eFolder (where applicable). This means we will need to integrate with the eFolder to be able to retrieve each of those different letter types and so that the Veteran can interact with them.

This means we are reliant on letters in the eFolder being consistently and accurately identifiable; in other words, there needs to be a defined set of identifiers for each of the letter types we care about, and that definition needs to be applied consistently to the actual letters within the eFolder in order for the solution to succeed.

The burder of defining, applying, and maintaing the letter taxonomy will be managed, on an ongoing basis by our partners within the DMC.

# Appendix
## DMC Proposal
This document was provided to DEPO (Chris Johnston, Andrea Schneider, Steve Kovacs, Matthew Self) from our executive partners within the Veterans Experience Office (VEO). This was the document that ultimately formed the basis of the intake work request (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/digitalservice/issues/1072) that was proposed during DEPO product intake on February 24, 2020.

The original document can be found here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/raw/master/products/debt-letters-mvp/discovery/DMC%20Proposed%20EPIC%20(%22Light%22%20version).docx. Text below.

### Veteran Debt Processing Enhancements LIGHT 
#### Epic Summary
This is a potential FY20 quick win solution to enhance veteran experience by providing veterans a limited view of Veteran Debt Letters and leveraging an existing Veteran-facing platform, with  delectronic notification of viewing availability.

This solution addresses only one of the requirements per legislation S.2248 Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018: “delivery of debt notices by standard mail and electronic means.” Currently, debt letter delivery is limited to US Mail notification.

#### Contacts
Requested by: Debt Management Center (DMC)
Point of Contact: Jason Hoge

#### Epic Value Statement:
We will provide online access of four (4) debt letters to increase visibility.

**For:** Veterans

**Who:** Veterans with profiles in VA Profile, a self-service platform maintained by VEO and formerly known as VETS360, who will benefit from automated emails notifying them that their debt letters are available to view online.

**The:** This Quick Win capability will provide:
1. Veteran debt letters displayed via VA.GOV or another veteran-facing system where veterans create a profile. The display will be a digital image like a .jpg, .png, etc.

2. A landing page on an existing Veteran-facing platform to allow viewing of VA debt letters.  The expectation is that four (4) Debt Letter types will be available, as not all debt letters are in-scope.  (Debt  letters, their origin, totality, and the system in which they reside will be vetted and confirmed by OIT, DMC, VBA and VEO).

3. VMBS currently stores DMC debt letters and is a potential source for obtaining the 4 Debt Letter types. 

4. An automated electronic notification to Veterans that their Debt Letters are available for viewing digitally. There is potential to leverage the VeteransProfile platform for Veteran contact information, and the ePharmancy notification process to leverage existing trigger and notification technology. 

5. Electronic notification should include a link to the landing page using VA prescribed security and access parameters. 

6. A technical solution that communicates with VBMS, the datasource of DMC debt letters, that is capable of pulling DMC debt letters from VBMS.

**That:** The compelling key benefit is that this functionailty dramatically enhances the Veteran experience and complies with a portion of the Veterans and Benefit Transition Act of 2018: delivery of debt notices by standard mail and electronic means. This does not address the rest of the sections of the said law.

**Unlike:** Current means of antiquated debt letter delivery using ordinary mail alone no longer meets the needs of veterans because of its inability to provide timely and accurate current status and amounts related to veteran debt. There is no online access for veterans to view their Debt Letters.

**Our Process/Solution Will:**
- Provide a limited view of VA debt letters to Veterans with automated, electronic notification and ability to view their Debt Letters online.
- Enhance veteran experience related to Debt Letters
- Bring VA debt notification online and move VA forward in our pursit to resolve misalignment with current industry standards, in compliance with a portion of the Veterans and Benefit Transition Act of 2018. 

#### In Scope:
- Online viewing of a subset of debt notification letters via an exsisting Veteran-facing platform.
- Automated electronic notification of availablilty and viewing access of debt notification letters.
- Online interface for veterans to view electronic debt records as a digital image via VA.GOV. VEO has the capability to whitelist MyDocuments. VA Profile is currently used for email notifications.
- Based on a predetermined system trigger, automated email notifications to veterans informing them that their debt letters are available for viewing digitally on VA.GOV or similar system.
- Development of a technical solution/interface that communicates with VBMS, the datasource for the debt letters, that is capable of pulling DMC debt letters from VBMS.

#### Out of Scope:
- This solution does not address the following legislations: (1) S.2155 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Sec.302 and (2) HR.5895, MILCON/VA appropriations Act of 2018, page 262.
- This solution only partially addresses S.2248 Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018 and does not address its sections requiring that (1) SECVA collaborate with veteran service organizations to develop standard letter format in plain language and shall include a notice of the debt and a clear explanation; (2) Notice to Congress: initially 90 days from act, then every 30 days; develop a standard letter, study and report; (3) Treasury Study coordination
- Non-Veteran Beneficiaries.
- Means for Veterans to submit a Financial Status Report, VA Form 5655, and request a waiver, negotiate, dispute, and/or payment plan through VA.gov to the centralized mail portal to DMC.
- Debt letters that are not part of the initial limited scope capability.
- Display of DMC-issued pen letters (aka Ad Hoc letters) are out of scope.
- User training for employees, stakeholders and veterans.
- Collaboration with Veteran Service Operations.
- Analysis of the requirements and resources that would be necessary to develop the capability for creating a single consolidated snapshot of a Veteran’s debt.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Seamless platform integration.
- Our Veteran-facing platform shouldwhitelist the function for debt notification letters and should not display documents from any other source in order to prevent over-exposure.
- The solution needs to have the capability to send out timely email notifications, based on a technical trigger, that inform veterans who have profiles in VeteransProfile that their debt letter is available for viewing digitally on VA.GOV or another veteran-facing system.
- The system solution must be reliable—email notifications must always be sent out to veterans when the trigger for notification occurs.
- The digital image of the debt letters must be available for secure viewing as a digital image by veterans when they log-onto their profiles on VA.gov or selected other veteran-facing system.
- The solution must meet capacity of in-scope debt letters.
- The solution must interface with VBMS.

## Legislation
There are two (2) relevant pieces of legislation driving this work: the Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act of 2017, and the Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018. The first was the originating piece of legislation essentially directing the VA to do three things in a kind-of non-specific way: make their debt communications more clear, make them available electronically, and report in to Congress regularly. The second bill (which doesn't appear to have actually passed yet, although it is what the VA is citing as the driver for this work) gets more specific about how the VA will actually meet the objectives of clarity and digital called out in the first bill. Summaries, full text, and links to the official record for each are below.
### Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act of 2017 (H.R.3705)
https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3705

#### Summary
This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to collaborate with veterans service organizations to write a standard letter to be provided to individuals who owe debts to the VA. Such letter shall be written in plain language and shall include a notice of the debt and a clear explanation of: (1) why the individual owes such money, and (2) available options.

The VA shall develop a method by which individuals may elect to receive debt notification letters by electronic means and shall ensure that the letter is delivered: (1) by both standard mail and electronic means to individuals who have made such election, and (2) only by standard mail to individuals who have not made such election.

The VA shall: (1) notify Congress regarding the completion of such letter, and (2) study and report to Congress on the process by which it notifies veterans of debt collection efforts.
