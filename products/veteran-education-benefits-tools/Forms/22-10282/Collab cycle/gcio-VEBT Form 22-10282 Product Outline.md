## Overview
We are digitizing the existing PDF form to make it accessible for veterans, their families, and caretakers to sign up for IBM's free SkillsBuild training program. This initiative aims to help participants enhance their IT skills, preparing them for careers in the high-tech industry or enabling them to advance within the industry if already employed. By moving the form online, we streamline the registration process and ensure wider, more convenient access to this valuable resource.

## Problem Statement

How might we streamline and digitize the registration process for IBM's free SkillsBuild training program to make it more accessible and convenient for veterans, their families, and caretakers, so they can easily enhance their IT skills and advance their careers in the high-tech industry?

**Who:**
Veterans, their families (spouses, children), and caretakers who are interested in enhancing their IT skills through IBM's SkillsBuild training program.

**What:**
The current registration form for the SkillsBuild training program exists as a PDF, which limits accessibility and convenience.

**Why:**
By digitizing the form, we can remove barriers to entry, making it easier for users to sign up for the program. This will help participants prepare for careers in the high-tech industry or advance their existing careers by upgrading their IT skills.

**Where:**
The current form is not accessible, restricting potential users who prefer or need a digital solution. Making the form available online will ensure broader and more convenient access.
 
## Desired User Outcomes
**Why would a user want to use this?**
- To easily sign up for IBM's free SkillsBuild training program.
- To enhance their IT skills in preparation for entering or advancing within the high-tech industry.
- To access a valuable educational resource that can significantly impact their career opportunities and growth.

**With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?**
- Seamlessly complete the registration process for the SkillsBuild training program online, simplifying the process so they won't need a physical copy, though it will still be available if preferred.- Utilize a user-friendly, accessible platform that accommodates Veterans, their families, and caretakers, ensuring inclusivity.
- Improve their IT knowledge and skills through IBM's training, opening up new career pathways and advancement opportunities in the high-tech industry.
- Save time and effort, allowing them to focus more on their learning and career development rather than administrative hurdles.

## Assumptions
1. **Veterans, their families, and caretakers prefer an online registration process over a physical form.**
2. Users have reliable internet access and the necessary digital literacy to complete the online form.
3. The digital form will be intuitive and user-friendly, reducing errors and incomplete submissions.

**Most Risky Assumption:**

The most risky assumption is that **Veterans, their families, and caretakers prefer an online registration process over a physical form.** This assumption is crucial because if it is incorrect, the digital solution may not be adopted widely, rendering the effort to digitize the form ineffective.

**Solution Approach:**
To validate this assumption, our initial set of functionality will include:

1. **Data collection from digital form:** Collect data solely from interactions with the digital form (e.g. clickable prototype, wireframes, design in staging environment), focusing on user behaviors, completion rates, and any reported issues or suggestions submitted through the digital platform.

2. **Iterative Improvements:** Use insights gathered from the data collected through the digital form, including user interactions and feedback submitted via the digital platform, to iteratively improve the form's usability and functionality.

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
We are currently in the initial digitalization phase of creating this form. There are still questions that we need to have answered by our stakeholders, such as which fields should be required for the user to answer, are certain questions necessary to ask, and if so, how will the data we collect from this form help us understand who is seeking this educational opportunity. We might have to perform usability research with this form to guarantee that our form is straightforward to follow and accessible for those users who rely on AT.


<!-- - *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?* -->
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
We still need more information about conditional questions. Currently, the functionality for the questions that are intended to be conditional is displayed (for example, when a user selects 'yes', extra question(s) should follow).

<!-- - *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?* -->

<!-- ### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
