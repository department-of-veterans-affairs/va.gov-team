# Product Outline: Form 22-8794

---

## Overview
This form collects the names and signatures of individuals authorized to certify enrollment details for the Department of Veterans Affairs. This includes updates to the names and titles of all certifying officials.

## Problem Statement
How might we ensure that institutions accurately and efficiently update certifying official information to the Department of Veterans Affairs? The challenge lies in providing a clear, streamlined process for collecting and submitting the names and titles of authorized individuals whenever changes occur, ensuring compliance and reducing errors in enrollment certification.
 
## Desired User Outcomes
A user would want to use this form to ensure their institution remains compliant with VA requirements by accurately updating and maintaining the records of authorized certifying officials. This helps avoid delays or issues with enrollment certifications, ensuring a smooth process for both the institution and the veterans they serve.

## Assumptions
The most risky assumption is that institutions will consistently and accurately complete and submit Form 22-8794 with all required information (names, titles, and signatures) whenever changes occur. This assumes users understand the process, have access to the form, and can identify when updates are needed.

Our solution approach will validate this assumption by providing clear instructions within the form interface, implementing guided steps for completing updates, and tracking submission rates to ensure compliance. Early functionality will include user testing with a small group of certifying officials to confirm that the process is intuitive and meets their needs.

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
We are starting by building the initial wireframes for this process. This will allow us to focus on the core structure and functionality of the form. This helps ensure that the process is intuitive, the required information is easy to locate and input, and the user flow supports accurate and efficient form completion. Early wireframes also enable us to gather feedback from users and stakeholders, validating the design before moving into more detailed development stages.
