## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*

This form to apply for restoration of entitlement for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) education benefits used at a school that has permanently 
closed or had its approval to receive VA benefits withdrawn or, due to COVID-19 and between March 1, 2020 and June 1, 2022 has closed temporarily 
or suspended your program of study. For this form "school" is used interchangeably with "training facility", and "educational institution". Please respond 
to all required questions regardless of the type of school you were attending. 
With limited exception, the VA can restore entitlement only for the period of enrollment in which you did not receive credit (or in which you lost 
training time). Generally, this means that entitlement can only be restored for the single term you were enrolled in when your program was suspended, 
your school closed temporarily or permanently, or lost its approval to receive VA benefits, as described above. 

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*
