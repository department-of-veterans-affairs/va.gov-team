Engineering and Security Checklist - Form 22-10275 Principles of Excellence
Engineering Checklist
Product Description
Implementation of VA Form 22-10275 (Principles of Excellence) as a digital form on VA.gov. This form allows Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL) to submit agreements to Principles of Excellence, replacing the current manual pdf email submission process.
Motivation: Streamline the Principles of Excellence submission process, provide better tracking and validation, and reduce manual processing overhead for the Principles of Excellence Team.
Collaboration Cycle Request: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/111424

•	Documentation: Standard VA.gov API documentation patterns
•	Call Patterns: Single submission per agreement, low volume expected
•	Rate Limiting: Standard VA.gov rate limiting applies
•	Third Party Integrations: None
•	Scheduled Jobs: No new batch jobs required

External API Changes
•	External APIs: None
•	PII/PHI Transmission: No PII/PHI transmitted externally
Background Jobs
•	Background Processing: email sending
•	Error Handling: Standard Rails job error handling, including for failed sending of emails
Data Storage
•	Database Changes: Uses existing education benefits claims table structure
•	Indexes: Leverages existing indexes
•	PII/PHI: no PII/PHI
•	Data Volume: Low volume - estimated <1000 submissions annually
•	Database Impact: Minimal impact on existing systems
•	Data Expiration: Standard VA.gov data retention policies apply
•	Cleanup: none required
Libraries and Dependencies
•	New Dependencies: None - uses existing VA.gov technology stack
•	Updated Dependencies: None required
Metrics, Logging, Observability, Alerting
•	Key Monitoring Areas: Form submission success/failure, email sending
•	Custom Metrics: None beyond standard form metrics
•	Sensitive Data: No sensitive data in logs
•	Alerting: Uses existing Datadog education benefits monitoring, will set up email sending error logging and alerts
Infrastructure and Network Changes
•	Changes: None - uses existing VA.gov infrastructure
Test Strategy
•	Automated Tests: Unit tests, integration tests for controller and form validation
•	Front End: E2E cypress testing with platform's form tester utility, a keyboard only cypress test, and unit testing in excess of 80% coverage goal
•	Manual Testing: Form submission workflows, email sending
•	UAT: Testing with sample institutional data
•	Test Data: Sample institution data, test facility codes
Rollout Plan
•	Feature Flags: every form uses a boolean in the content-build repo registry.json file to turn on the form in prod/turn it off. We would have to make another PR for this repo and get it approved by platform to flip this "toggle".
•	Team Coordination: Principles of Excellence Team for email reception testing
•	Rollback Plan: Feature flags disabled
Internal Administration Tasks
•	Maintenance Tasks: standard VA.gov database maintenance, submissions monitoring
•	Administration Method: existing VA.gov administrative interfaces and Datadog monitoring
Security Checklist
Problem Statement
Form 22-10275 digitizes the Principles of Excellence submission process, allowing institutions to submit participation electronically rather than via email, improving security and tracking.
Monitoring Plan
•	Code Base Compromise Detection: Datadog monitoring, abnormal traffic pattern detection
•	Disabling Process: Feature flag capability
•	Process Execution: Runs within existing education benefits infrastructure with standard authentication
•	Process Isolation: Standard VA.gov application isolation
•	Additional Credentials: Uses existing VA.gov service credentials
Release Plan
Full roll out to PROD.
Endpoint Security
•	New Endpoints: (modified) POST /v0/education_benefits_claims/22-10275
•	Abuse Scenarios: 
o	Form spam submissions (mitigated by rate limiting)
o	Invalid data submission (mitigated by input validation)
•	Mitigation: Standard VA.gov security controls, input validation, rate limiting
Logging Data
•	New Logging: Form submission events, email sending
•	Data Captured: Institution identifiers, submission timestamps
•	Storage: Standard VA.gov logging infrastructure
Personal Information
•	PII/PHI: no PII/PHI
•	Encryption: Standard VA.gov database encryption
•	Data Scrubbing: Standard data retention and cleanup policies apply
Cookies
•	Cookie Usage: Uses existing VA.gov session management
•	New Cookies: None
•	Modified Cookies: None
Authentication

Product Links
•	Release Plan: No staged rollout fully rolled out once UAT is completed.
•	Product Outline: SCO form, The Principles of Excellence program requires schools that get federal funding through the GI Bill and other programs to follow certain guidelines. Compliance with the POE is intended to ensure an institution provides meaningful information to prospective and current military-associated students about the financial cost and quality of the institution; to assist those students in making choices about how to use their federal educational benefits; prevent abusive and deceptive recruiting practices that target the recipients of federal military and veterans educational benefits; and ensure that the institution provides high-quality academic and student support services to the respective group of students.
•	Incident Response: Included in product outline
•	Product Playbook: Included in this document.
