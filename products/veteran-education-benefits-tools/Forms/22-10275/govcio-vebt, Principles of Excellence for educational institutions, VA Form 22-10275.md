Engineering and Security Checklist - Form 22-10275 Principles of Excellence
Engineering Checklist
Product Description
Implementation of VA Form 22-10275 (Principles of Excellence) as a digital form on VA.gov. This form allows Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL) to submit agreements to Principles of Excellence, replacing the current manual pdf email submission process.
Motivation: Streamline the Principles of Excellence submission process, provide better tracking and validation, and reduce manual processing overhead for the Principles of Excellence Team.
Collaboration Cycle Request: [Link to be added]
UX Design Description
•	Digital form interface for institutional users
•	Multi-step form with sections for institution info, agreement type, participating locations details, and contact information
•	Confirmation screen upon successful submission
•	[Link to UX prototype/wireframes when available] 
Engineering Challenges: Form validation for complex institutional data, handling multiple agreement types (new/withdrawal).
Frontend Changes
•	New Function: Complete new form implementation for 22-10275
•	Design System Components: Leverages existing VA.gov form components
•	Shared Code: No changes to shared frontend code
•	Analytics: Standard form event tracking with GA, error monitoring via existing VA.gov analytics
•	Error Detection: Frontend validation errors, submission failures tracked via Datadog
Backend Changes
•	Infrastructure Dependencies: Uses existing education benefits infrastructure
•	New Connections: None - leverages existing VA.gov backend systems
•	API Polling: Not required
•	Error Handling: Standard form validation, database error handling, email delivery confirmation
•	Shared Code: No changes to shared backend code
•	Logging: Form submission events, PDF generation status, email delivery confirmation
•	User-uploaded Data: No user file uploads
•	Temporary Files: PDF files temporarily generated during processing, automatically cleaned up after email delivery
Internal API Changes
•	New APIs: (modified to add new form) POST /v0/education_benefits_claims/22-10275
•	Deprecations: None
•	Documentation: Standard VA.gov API documentation patterns
•	Call Patterns: Single submission per agreement, low volume expected
•	Rate Limiting: Standard VA.gov rate limiting applies
•	Third Party Integrations: None
•	Scheduled Jobs: No new batch jobs required
•	Schema Validation: Uses vets-json-schema validation
External API Changes
•	External APIs: None
•	PII/PHI Transmission: No PII/PHI transmitted externally
Background Jobs
•	Background Processing: PDF generation and email sending
•	Error Handling: Standard Rails job error handling, including for failed sending of emails
Data Storage
•	Database Changes: Uses existing education benefits claims table structure
•	Indexes: Leverages existing indexes
•	PII/PHI: no PII/PHI
•	Data Volume: Low volume - estimated <1000 submissions annually
•	Database Impact: Minimal impact on existing systems
•	Data Expiration: Standard VA.gov data retention policies apply
•	Cleanup: Temporary PDF files cleaned up immediately after email delivery
Libraries and Dependencies
•	New Dependencies: None - uses existing VA.gov technology stack
•	Updated Dependencies: None required
Metrics, Logging, Observability, Alerting
•	Key Monitoring Areas: Form submission success/failure, PDF generation, email sending
•	Custom Metrics: None beyond standard form metrics
•	Sensitive Data: No sensitive data in logs
•	Alerting: Uses existing Datadog education benefits monitoring, will set up email sending error logging and alerts
Infrastructure and Network Changes
•	Changes: None - uses existing VA.gov infrastructure
Test Strategy
•	Automated Tests: Unit tests, integration tests for controller and form validation
•	Front End: E2E cypress testing with platform's form tester utility, a keyboard only cypress test, and unit testing in excess of 80% coverage goal
•	Manual Testing: Form submission workflows, PDF generation, email sending
•	UAT: Testing with sample institutional data
•	Test Data: Sample institution data, test facility codes
Rollout Plan
•	Feature Flags: every form uses a boolean in the content-build repo registry.json file to turn on the form in prod/turn it off. We would have to make another PR for this repo and get it approved by platform to flip this "toggle".
•	Team Coordination: Principles of Excellence Team for email reception testing
•	Rollback Plan: Feature flag disable
Internal Administration Tasks
•	Maintenance Tasks: standard VA.gov database maintenance, submissions monitoring
•	Administration Method: existing VA.gov administrative interfaces and Datadog monitoring
Security Checklist
Problem Statement
Form 22-10275 digitizes the Principles of Excellence submission process, allowing institutions to submit participation electronically rather than via email, improving security and tracking.
Monitoring Plan
•	Code Base Compromise Detection: Datadog monitoring, abnormal traffic pattern detection
•	Disabling Process: Feature flag capability
•	Process Execution: Runs within existing education benefits infrastructure with standard authentication
•	Process Isolation: Standard VA.gov application isolation
•	Additional Credentials: Uses existing VA.gov service credentials
