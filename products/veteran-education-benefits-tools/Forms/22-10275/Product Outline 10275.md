## Overview
*Currently available as a PDF-only download, the 22-10275 form is used for the authorization to disclose personal information to a third-party regarding their education benefits. Digitizing the form will increase VA efficiencies and streamline and enhance the overall user experience.*

## Problem Statement
*How might we streamline and digitize the authorization to disclose personal information process for third parties to access and leverage the veteran’s personal information as it relates to their education benefits?*

Who: Veterans, their families (spouses, children) and third-party organizations who need to be authorized by the VA to disclose personal information. 

What: The current authorization form for the disclosure of personal information exists as a PDF, which limits accessibility and convenience. 

Why: By digitizing the form, we can remove barriers to entry, making it easier for users to be authorized to disclose their personal information. This will help improve the education claim process. 

Where: The current form is not accessible, restricting potential users who prefer or need a digital solution. Making the form available online will ensure broader and more convenient access. 


## Desired User Outcomes

- To easily and seamlessly complete and submit the authorization for the disclosure of the Veteran’s personal information relating to their education benefits.*


## Undesired User Outcomes
