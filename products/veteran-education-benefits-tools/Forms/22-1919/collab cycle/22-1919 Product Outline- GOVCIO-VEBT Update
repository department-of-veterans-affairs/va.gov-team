# Product Outline: Form 22-1919

---

## Overview
The solution is an intuitive and accessible online form that simplifies the process of reporting and identifying potential conflicts of interest for Veterans, VA employees, SAA employees, and proprietary school officials, ensuring compliance with legal restrictions while enhancing usability on VA.gov.

## Problem Statement
**Who**: Veterans, VA employees, SAA employees, and proprietary school officials involved in the education assistance process.  
**What**: They face challenges in accurately reporting potential conflicts of interest due to the outdated and cumbersome nature of the current PDF form.  
**Why**: The existing form is not user-friendly, making it difficult to ensure compliance with legal restrictions and process the required information efficiently.  
**Where**: The issue arises within the education assistance reporting process on VA.gov, specifically when dealing with proprietary school-related conflicts of interest.  

How might we create a user-friendly and accessible digital form on VA.gov that streamlines the process of reporting potential conflicts of interest, ensuring compliance with legal restrictions while improving the experience for Veterans, VA employees, SAA employees, and proprietary school officials?

Users should be able to easily report potential conflicts of interest, submit accurate and complete information, and navigate the form without confusion, ensuring compliance with legal requirements while minimizing administrative burdens.
