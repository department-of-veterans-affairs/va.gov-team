## Overview
We are creating a digitized version of VA Form 22-10215 so that school officials have an easier way to report their 85/15 calculations to stay in compliance with reporting regulations. 

## Problem Statement
Right now, the PDF version of VA Form 22-10215 is tedious to use and requires the person filling it out to perform a lot of calculations and then record them. How might we speed up this process and eliminate room for calculation errors by digitizing this form?

## Desired User Outcomes
Once this form is digitized, users should see the time it takes to complete this reporting requirement decrease. This will be a faster, easier way to report these numbers to the VA. 

Additionally, the number of calculation errors should go down since we are removing the need for the user to perform those calculations on their own. 

This effort will save time on both ends of the form: those completing it and those receiving and checking the reports.

## Undesired User Outcomes
We do not want users to become frustrated with learning this new form and give up to revert back to using the PDF form, we would like this to be the default experience and the user’s first choice as well.

## Desired Business Outcomes
Digitizing this form will save time on the business side as calculations and reported numbers should be much easier to check, and there will be no need to download and open PDFs anymore. 

## Undesired Business Outcomes
We do not want this to be more complicated on the back and make things harder for the people that are double checking these numbers and submitting these reports. 

<!-- ## Measuring Success -->



## Assumptions
This form is only for school officials to use, but will not be able to have an authenticated sign-in experience since school officials do not currently have VA logins. This is our riskiest assumption because we could potentially have unauthorized people fill out this form and submit it in the name of a school official who they are not, and report inaccurate information to the VA. This happens with the PDF version as well occasionally, so we will need to monitor this and stay ahead of solutions.

This form will not be very mobile-friendly, as it is a form that requires a potentially large number of entries, and we want to make this the best experience possible if you are filling it out on a laptop or desktop computer. We will include a warning to users that this form is best filled out on a computer, and try to discourage SCOs from trying to fill this out on their phones. We assume that most users wouldn’t do this on their phones or tablets anyways since it is only SCOs who will fill this out as part of their daily job, and school officials are aware of how much data they need to report and how tedious any sort of reporting would be on their phones. 


## Solution Approach
Right now, we are trying to match the PDF form as closely as possible to ensure that we are not distorting the meaning of any of the reporting requirements and getting inaccurate calculations or reports as a result. 

In the future, we would like to make this only accessible to school officials who have logged in, but that will not be possible until they have a way to login to VA.gov and can be verified as actual school officials. 

If SCOs get a login, and can fill this out while authenticated, we can work on future improvements such as prefilling the program names to save the SCOs time while filling this out in the future, since this is a form that may need to be filled out several times a year for every school.
