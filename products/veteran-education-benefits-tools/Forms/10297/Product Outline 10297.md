## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement

*How might we streamline and digitize the application for high technology veteran education, training and skills (HITECH VETS) program form?* (aka VET TEC 2.0)

Who: Veterans that wish to develop their skills to start or advance their careers through participation in high technology training and education programs.

What: The current application form for the HITECH VETS program exists as a PDF, which limits accessibility and convenience. 

Why: : By digitizing the form, we can remove barriers to entry, making it easier for users to submit their application for the HITECH VETS program. 

Where: The current form is not accessible in digital form, restricting potential users who prefer or need a digital solution. Making the form available online will ensure broader and more convenient access. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- *To easily and seamlessly complete and submit the application*
  
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*


## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Increase accessibility: Ensure that all Veterans can access the form*
- *Enhance user experience: Improve the overall user experience on VA.gov by offering a streamlined, efficient digital solution. Reinforcing our commitment to user-centric design*
- *Operational efficiency: Reduce administrative overhead and processing time associated with handling physical form submissions* 
- *Reputation and trust: Strengthen trust and reputation with our user base by demonstrating our dedication to modernizing services and addressing their needs effectively*
