## Overview
We are creating an accessible, digital version of the 35% exemption request form for the 85/15 rule, which allows schools to request an exemption for programs where less than 35% of students are receiving VA education benefits, enabling them to complete and submit the form directly on VA.gov for faster processing and improved accessibility.

## Problem Statement
How might we streamline the process for schools requesting an exemption under the 85/15 rule by creating a digital version of the 35% exemption request form? By enabling schools to complete and submit this form directly on VA.gov, we aim to enhance accessibility, speed up processing times, and improve the overall efficiency of the exemption request process for programs with fewer than 35% VA education benefit recipients.
 
## Desired User Outcomes
- **Why would a user want to use this?**  
  Users would want to use this because it simplifies and accelerates the exemption request process for the 85/15 rule. The digital form on VA.gov provides a more accessible and efficient way to submit requests, reducing the administrative burden and ensuring faster processing.

- **With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?**  
  Users should be able to complete and submit the 35% exemption request form directly online, which allows for quicker processing and fewer barriers compared to the previous manual submission method. This improvement ensures that schools can handle exemption requests more efficiently and accessibly.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
We should be able to process exemption requests more rapidly and accurately, minimize manual handling and errors, and provide a more user-friendly experience. This will result in improved operational efficiency and a more effective way to support schools navigating the 85/15 rule exemption process.

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
We are starting by developing the digital version of the 35% exemption request form for the 85/15 rule. This initial build will focus on creating a user-friendly interface on VA.gov that allows schools to complete and submit the form electronically. Weâ€™re starting here because this core functionality addresses the immediate need for a more efficient and accessible exemption request process.
