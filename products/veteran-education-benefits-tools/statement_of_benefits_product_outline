# Product Outline Template

## Overview

Statement of Benefits (SOB) allows Veterans to access their remaining entitlement available. Currently, the Transfer of Entitlement (TOE) data is not being displayed as it has been unavailable to pull in. With the creation of the new Claimant Service API (DGIB) the VEBT team is integrating with the service to provide that information within Statement of Benefits. The API on vets-api serves as a middleman to the service provided by AFS- these changes are so that AFS’s LTS SOAP service can be retired and VEBT can switch to the REST based claimant service.

## Problem Statement

How might we provide Veterans access to their transfer of entitlement information to ensure that the calculation for their overall entitlement remaining is more accurate on their Statement of Benefits.

## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this?*

- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

*Currently, Veterans are unable to access their transfer of entitlement information within the Statement of Benefits on va.gov. The inclusion of this information will report a more accurate representation of their total remaining entitlement.*

## Undesired User Outcomes

We believe that If the required data fields cannot be displayed, the Statement of Benefits does not give an accurate total for entitlement remaining. 

## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*

- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

•  Accurate totals displayed for remaining entitlement with the addition of Transfer of Entitlement information

•  Increased engagement from the Veteran’s

•  Enhances the credibility of the VA and institutions

## Undesired Business Outcomes

•  Veteran confusion

•  Decreased engagement

•  Risk of reputational damage

## Measuring Success

An accurate total is displayed for entitlement remaining for Veterans.
