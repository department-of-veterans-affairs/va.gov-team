# Conversation Guide for Debt Resolution Team, Wizard complete a subtask pattern, January 2025

## Getting to know you (10 minutes)

5-7 minutes

  

Welcome!

  

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

  

How are you today?

  

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

  

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

  

My goal today is to learn about your unique situation with VA copays or VA debt and how it applies to an experience we’re working on.

  

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

  

Next, I want to explain my role better.

  

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

  

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

  

Your comfort and wellbeing are very important to us.

  

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

  

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

  

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

  

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

  

Optional:

  

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?

  

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your on screen image.

  

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

  

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

  

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

  

Do you have any questions for me?

  

Just want to ensure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today?

  
START INTERVIEW
  
3-5 minutes

  

[Rapport building]

  

We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

  

[Add an icebreaker question]


Thank you for sharing! (personalize response)

## [VA debt or copay situation] (5 minutes)

  

Now we’ll start the more structured interview.

  

Before I share the prototype we’d like your feedback on, I’d like to hear about your situation with recent VA copays or VA debt.

  

If VA debt:

Can you walk me through how this debt has affected you recently, and what steps you have taken or would like to take to resolve it?

[establish baseline and common experiences to inform mental models] [mental models]

  

-   Some things to consider asking:
    

  

-   How did you find out about the VA debt or copay?
    
-   How did you feel when you found out about it?
    
-   What options were you given to pay or resolve it? What options do you know about?
    
-   If it were up to you, how would you like to address or resolve the debt or copay?
    

  

If VA copay:

Can you walk me through how VA copays have affected you recently, and what steps you have taken or would like to take to resolve them?

[establish baseline and common experiences to inform mental models] [mental models]

  

-   Some things to consider asking:
    

  

-   How did you find out about the VA debt or copay?
    
-   How did you feel when you found out about it?
    
-   What options were you given to pay or resolve it? What options do you know about?
    
-   If it were up to you, how would you like to address or resolve the debt or copay?
    

## [Prototype] 

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

  

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

  

In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please remember to comment on what is clear and unclear.

  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
