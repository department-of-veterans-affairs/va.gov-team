## Usability and comprehension study (60 minutes)

# AT Conversation Guide for Debt Resolution Team, Wizard complete a subtask pattern, January 2025

## Getting to know you (10 minutes)

  

Welcome!

  

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

  

How are you today?

  

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

  

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

  

My goal today is to understand how usable and accessible an experience we’re working on is.

  

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

  

Next, I want to explain my role better.

  

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

  

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

  

Your comfort and wellbeing are very important to us.

  

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

  

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

  

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

  

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

  

Optional:

  

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?

  

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your on screen image.

  

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

  

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

  

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

  

Do you have any questions for me?

  

Just want to ensure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today?

  

**START INTERVIEW**

  

3-5 minutes

  

[Rapport building]

  

We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

  

[Add an ice breaker question]

  

Thank you for sharing! (personalize response)

## [VA debt or copay situation] (5 minutes)

  

Now we’ll start the more formal interview.

  

Today I will be sharing a survey on VA.gov to help orient you to the right place depending on your unique situation with VA copays or VA debt.

  

Before I share the prototype, I’d like to hear about your situation with recent VA copays or VA debt.

  

If VA debt: [OPTIONAL - based on screener answer, if it applies]

  

Can you walk me through how this debt has affected you recently, and what steps you have taken or would like to take to resolve it? [establish baseline and common experiences to inform mental models]

  

-   Some things to consider asking:
    

  

-   How did you find out about the VA debt or copay?
    
-   How did you feel when you found out about it?
    
-   What options were you given to pay or resolve it?
    
-   If it were up to you, how would you like to address or resolve the debt or copay?
    

## Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

-   What device are you using today?
    
-   Does the device you're using have a screen to share?
    
-   What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)
    
-   How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it?
