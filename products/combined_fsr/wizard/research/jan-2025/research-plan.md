# Research Plan for [Debt Resolution, Complete a Sub Task (Wizard) and content pages, January 2025]


## Background

Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:

-   What problem is your product trying to solve?
    
-   Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
    
-   What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?
    

The "Complete a Subtask” release is focused on optional subtask experience at the beginning of the FSR that assists the user in determining the correct action to take based on their circumstances. In its current form, it is utilizing the depreciated [Wizard design pattern](https://design.va.gov/patterns/wizards). The latest version that we will be testing will utilize the improved [Complete a subtask design pattern](https://design.va.gov/patterns/help-users-to/complete-a-sub-task). This new pattern will move questions and answers to a one-thing-per-page format which is a better experience for screen reader users. This improved format reduces cognitive burden. In addition, we will be working with the Content Team on making questions and answers easier to understand.

### OCTO Priorities

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

This research supports these main [OCTO objectives and goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans can manage their health services online
    
-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
    
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
    

This research supports increasing these measures:

-   Usage of digital, self-service tools
    
-   Number of VA.gov users as a function of total Veteran population
    

This research supports decreasing these measures:

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
    

### Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

Debt can happen at any stage in [the Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) after the ‘Getting out’ stage. However, certain types of debt, such as Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, is more likely to occur at the ‘Finding something to do’ stage.

Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health
    

## Research Goals

What are you trying to learn from this research?

Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

**The purpose of this research is to find out:**

## **Usability, comprehension, mental models**
### 1. First impression & comprehension:

   What do Veterans understand the Wizard is for when they first see it?
    
-   Do they understand its purpose?
    
-   Do they understand the paths available to them and the actions they need to take based on the information provided in the wizard?
    
-   What mental models do Veterans have around the resolution options as they pertain to their unique situation?
    

### 2. Usability: How helpful is the information provided based on their prior knowledge and experiences, if any?

    
### 3.  Accessibility: How Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology navigate through the Wizard
    

### Outcome

How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

This evaluative usability study will allow us to make content structure and content refinements based on the level of comprehension. If the actions recommended to the Veteran in the Wizard are difficult to understand, we can make changes to the content in terms of copy, organization, and amount of content. If it is easy to understand, we can validate the experience.

### Research questions

Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:

-   What will I do with what I learn from this question?
    
-   Does this question serve the goals of my study?
    

  

1.  Understand baseline: What experience, if any, do Veterans have with seeking debt relief? What channels have they used to understand what they need to do?
    
2.  How easy is it for them to understand what they need to do through the information supplied in the Wizard in contrast to what they have done previously?
    
3.  Do Veterans understand the purpose of the Wizard?
    
4.  How easy is it for Veterans to navigate through the Wizard?
    
5.  How easy is it for Veterans using screen readers to navigate through the Wizard?
    
6.  For the paths they see, how understandable is the information on the last pages of the Wizard?
    
7.  For the corresponding links, how clear and understandable is the content? *
    

### Hypothesis

What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

-   Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!
    
> 
1. We hypothesize that the complete a sub task pattern will be easy to use by both sighted and blind/low vision Veterans alike.

2. We hypothesize that the information supplied through the different paths in the Wizard will be helpful and streamline the experience of information gathering.

3. We hypothesize that the recommended actions on the final page and subsequent pages may be a lot of information to digest.

4. We hypothesize that participants may not understand the selections, “Committee of Waivers and Compromises” and “Board of Veterans' Appeals”.

## Methodology

Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.

Examples of common research methods include:

-   The study will be a remote moderated usability study. The prompts will be mostly observational, allowing the Veteran to organically explore what is relevant to their situation (dependent on the type of debt they had/have and the actions they are interested in taking).
    
Additional resources:

-   Please review the [PRA primer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/what-is-paperwork-reduction-act.md) to educate yourself on how PRA impacts the research we do as a government project.
    
-   Review the [Perigean recruitment guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Recruiting-Participants.1958773044.html) to understand how Perigean recruits, and what types of research they can support.
    
-   If conducting testing on mobile, refer to the [mobile research guidelines.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Conducting-Research-Sessions.1958773061.html#ConductingResearchSessions-Researchingwithmobileusers)
    
-   If conducting [unmoderated usability research, refer to the guidance here.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Planning-Unmoderated-Studies.1904738369.html)
    
-   If conducting [research with disabled Veterans, refer to this checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-with-assistive-technology-users) and [follow disability etiquette guidelines.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/disability-etiquette)
    
-   In the rare event of an emergency during research, be prepared by reviewing guidelines for [research safety and emergency exit strategies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html).
    

### Location

Where will you be holding the research sessions? Be sure to include whether this is remote or in-person research. [Learn more about setting up in-person research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/planning-in-person-research.md)

-   Remote: Zoom
    

## Research materials

Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan – prior to submitting a recruitment request.

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

# Recruitment

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources.

-   [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research.
    
-   [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.
    

## Recruitment approach

Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?

Pro tip:

-   For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants.
    
-   Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups.
    
-   Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)
    

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

Inclusion is prioritized. We seek to over-recruit underrepresented groups that are often underrecruited in research. Moreover, since a primary goal of this research is to understand comprehension, we want to talk to Veterans that have cognitive considerations, lower literacy levels, and English as a second language.

We will have 2 cohorts: (1) non-AT sessions and (2) AT sessions

## Recruitment criteria

List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study.

  

We will have 2 cohorts: (1) non-AT sessions and (2) AT sessions


## Demographic must-haves for both COHORT 1 and COHORT 2

Note: The following demographic criteria is our goal, but we understand that historically it's been challenging to recruit participants with VA debt.

    
-   At least 5 of 12 people must identify as Black, Hispanic/Latina/Latinx, Asian, or Native American
    
-   At least 6 of 12 people must identify as having a cognitive consideration
    
-   At least 5 of 12 people must identify as other than male
    
-   At least 3 of 12 people are without a degree or professional certificate
    
-   At least 2 of 12 people are under 35
    
-   At least 5 of 12 people are over 55
    
-   At least 4 of 12 people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender
    
-   At least 2 of 12 non-native English speakers
    

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question. Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves) What criteria would strengthen your results?

## Timeline

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

****To be confirmed***

Cohort 1:

Tuesday 1/14 - 1/21

Cohort 2:

1/23 - 1/31 (X 1/27, X 1/29 or 1/30)

  

### Prepare

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

-   Pilot participant email: TBD
    
-   Date and time of pilot session: TBD
    

### Research sessions

-   Planned dates of research:
    

### Length of sessions

-   Session length: 60 minutes
    
-   Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
    
-   Maximum Sessions per day: 3
    

### Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Please request enough dates and at least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; 12 time slots for 6 participants). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
