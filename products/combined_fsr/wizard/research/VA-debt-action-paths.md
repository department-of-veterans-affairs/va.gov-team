Situation: You have the right to dispute all or part of your copay charges.

Fine print: You have 30 days to dispute the debt once you receive your bill. Debt collections specifics key dates (less than 90 days, more than 90 days, more than 120 days).

To avoid late charges, dispute the debt within 30 days of receiving your bill.

  

Fine print detail:

  

If we receive your dispute within 90 days from the date the charges first appeared on your billing statement, we won’t start any collection action until we’ve resolved your dispute.

  

If we don’t receive your dispute within 90 days, we may offset other VA benefits you may receive. This means we may reduce or withhold part of your VA benefits (like disability compensation, GI Bill payments, or Veterans pension payments) to pay your copay debt. We’ll continue with that process while we're reviewing your dispute. If we resolve the dispute in your favor, we’ll remove all late charges from your account and pay you back any money withheld from your VA benefits.

If we don’t receive your dispute within 120 days, we may transfer your debt to the U.S. Treasury for further collection action.
