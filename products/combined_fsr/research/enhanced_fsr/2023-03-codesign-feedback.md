## Co-design Feedback Summary and Findings
We spoke to 6 Veterans who work for the VA. Some Veterans worked directly with debt management. Veterans were asked about their service history, thoughts on debt management, and to interact with a shortened Financial Status Report form prototype. The Veterans we spoke to are a special sample, and not representative of the diversity of all Veterans. 
Codesign sessions are a part of the human centered design (HCD) famework, where users (Veterans) are placed at the center of the design process, in order to build an experience that meets their needs. The sessions are conversational and collaborative. It is important to get end Veteran feedback early and often. 
The purpose of the interviews was to get feedback from Veterans on the FSR enhancements before launching them into a formalized usability study, and verify that the enhanced FSR design changes are ready to share in the upcoming usability study. The interviews were a conversational walk through of a design prototype. This was not a formal evaluation. 

The sessions took place from 03/13/2023⁠–03/15/2023.

### The Prototype
All 6 Veterans looked at a shortened version of the enhanced Financial Status Report form. This was a prototype created in UXPin and contained the following items: 

 - Introduction/Steps 
 - Debt selection
 - Contact information
 - Employment history
 - VA benefits
 - Resolution options
 - Review 
 - Confirmation

### Emergent Themes in Feedback

-   The ability to see all debts and the status in one place is appreciated (1 participant spoke about the delay they experience when paying a debt, and receiving multiple notices that it has not been paid, even when they know the have paid it)
-   Intuitiveness is important (like using an iPhone, "you know how use it without any instruction" - P6)
-   Ease of use is important
	- Ease of use for less tech savvy vets P5
	- Thinks form must be **digestible** P6
-  Accessibility: Start your request now button needs to be bigger _(2 participants said this without prompting)_
-  Some Veterans will need help filling out the form - may need to fill out the form with VSO - P5
-  One participant would have liked the ability to download the FSR they have filled out before submitting the form


### Perceptions, mindset, mental models

 -  Language sensitivity
-   Some very logical, analytical mindsets, expect copy and directions to be this way too. Opinionated about wording, verbiage structured around priority insider knowledge about DMC _(one participant's comment about resolution option waiver option, suggested as last option (VA/business centered vs user centered)_
- Participant said they would only ask for debt forgiveness if they really have to (P3)
(personal opinions on finance and money, larger picture than just resolution process)
-   Have to jump through a lot of hoops with the VA for requests, paperwork, confirmations
-   Distrust of providing certain information to the VA - may question why they need to give the info
-   Used to submitting paperwork to the VA, a digital form is an improvement for tech knowledgeable


### Notable Quotes

> "The government made a mistake, why do I have to repay this?" P1

> "It should be streamlined and simple enough for any veteran to use it. A lot have traumatic brain injuries. We're all smart but we need something we can figure out. Like list of what we're looking for, maybe a number to call with a real person if we have issues." P3

> I think having the ability to fill out one piece of paperwork and have that work in multiple places is also very important. Cause' in the military you end up filling out paperwork, and then the next time you have to do something else, or here you need to fill this out, I'm like I filled this out yesterday. Oh, you gotta do it, this is for something else, you need to do that. So if there's a way to keep things down to a singular level, when completing forms, that is, would be a tremendous benefit to everybody, Veteran or not. P5
> 
> "I love this, I show this to everyone" (about debt selection page) P6

> "I like that it doesn't have multiple stuff on the page, makes it easier to read." P6
> 
> "Perception is a huge thing. Perception becomes reality, particularly when you've got someone, if you have a Vietnam era vet,
and they're doing this, they have a whole different mentality towards how the VA works versus someone who's served more recently. 
At least that's what I've found in my travels. Those are my thoughts." P5

### Updates to be made to the form as a result of this feedback

 -  Intro/Steps page: 
	 - Updated Submit your request section to 60 minutes instead of 30 minutes
	 - "Start your request" will become a button to give it more prominence (also an accessibility issue)
-   Employment History > Current Income question: "Monthly" was placed in bold: "What's your gross **monthly** income at this job?"
-   Resolution options: Updated language to "approve" instead of "accept". "If we approve your request..."

### Items to pay additional attention to in formal research study

 - Understanding the participant's baseline experience with debt
 - Intro/Steps page:
	 - VSO link - does it go where users expect it to?
	-   Thoughts on "Start your request now" button 
-   Summary cards - one participant suggested making delete smaller as less tech-savvy father might accidentally select it and feel frustrated
-   Do users consider insurance expense other than housing insurance? Add car insurance to expenses suggestion?

### Updates made to the formal research as a result of this feedback

 _After hearing feedback from a participant that they would pay their debt:_
-   Ask for participants income and whether they have experienced bankruptcy during formal usability screener
-   After asking participant's understanding of the form, tell them this is for Veterans experiencing financial hardship
