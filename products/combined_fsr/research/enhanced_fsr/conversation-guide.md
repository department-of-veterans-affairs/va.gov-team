Thank you for joining us today!

My name is Charlotte and Megan is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

**Today we're going to talk about your experience with a form called the Financial Status Report Form (FSR). This was previously a paper form you had to fill out by hand that has been made digital.**

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about [**1 hour**]. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
-   **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability.** We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
    
-   **You'll be interacting with the live version once you login, which is fully clickable.** Please remember not to submit the form at the end, and I will also remind you. Since you will not be submitting the form, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
    
**-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
    
-   **I want to let you know that I will not be able to answer any questions** about the prototype or the form because we are interested in your unbiased opinions about them. If we have time remaining at the end of the session, you can ask me then.
    
-   **Finally, we ask that you turn on your video for our meeting,** if you are comfortable. If not, please let me know. 
    
-   Perigean did ask for your **consent to allow observers**, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    
-   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
-   If yes: Admit observers.
    
-   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. **(This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)**
    
-   Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

-   **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    
-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    

Start recording.

**-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen, the video, and the audio as we talk today?**

## [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md#warm-up-questions-optional---x-minutes)Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5-10 minutes


Before we look at the form, let’s start with a few warm-up questions so that I can get to know you.

Background about their service history
-   If you’re comfortable sharing, could you please tell me briefly about the major parts of your service? (optional question)
   
  VA debt experience baseline
-   Are you currently employed, and if so, what type of work do you do?  
-   What has been your past experience with VA debt? [establish baseline]
-   What are your hopes for the process of getting help with this debt? Why? [establish hopes/desires]
-   What are your expectations? [establish expectations]
    > Enabling for account, do they need to have debt in order to turn on the FSR?
they will need either an unpaid overpayment (debt) OR an unpaid copay bill (copay needs to be within past 6 months

## [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md#first-task-task-name---x-minutes)Scenario and Overall Task: 
Imagine you have some VA debt that you would like help with.

We are going to go through a form and ask you to fill it out, as you would normally. I am going to observe silently, and I will ask you questions at certain times. Also, I will ask you to pause at certain sections and I will ask you follow up questions.

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers, we just want to learn from your experience with the early version of this digital form so that we can make improvements, as needed.

We ask that you think out loud as you are going through the form. You may use fake information to fill out the form.

## [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md#first-task-task-name---x-minutes)First Task: [Form comprehension questions] - 10 minutes
**Form comprehension questions**

*Screen: [Wizard]*

-   Please pause here.
    
-   Based on what you read, what is the FSR form for?

#### [Notetaker fills out success criteria] 

#### Testing: Comprehension

***Screen: FSR intro page describing the steps***
  
-   What would you do here?
    Testing: Would they actually read the page?
    
If they read through the page, ask:

-   What are your impressions of this page?
    
-   How are you feeling at this point in the form? [understand motivation level]
    
-   Is there anything that you’re unsure about?
    
-   How would you describe this section, in a few words?
    
-   Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?
  
**Testing: Qualitative feedback/ satisfaction**

**Debt Selection Question**

***Screen: [Debt selection screen]***

-   What would you do here?
   Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)
	-  Complete success: Participant completes task without any issues (can select a debt)
	-   Failure: Participant isn’t able to complete task (cannot select a debt)
  
#### Testing: Usability of debt selection UI

### Sub-Task [Step 1 of 7: Editing contact info]

##### Research goal addressed: Are Veterans able to easily edit their [contact information](https://preview.uxpin.com/552e9ad135f7d7ee943a92576feab45190b069f4#/pages/147887481/comment/no-panels?mode=i) on FSR?
  -   Please pause here.
    ***[SCREEN NAME: Contact Information]***
-   Can you show me how you would edit your mailing address?
   Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)
	-   Complete success: Participant completes task without any issues (can edit the above fields)
	 -   Failure: Participant isn’t able to complete task (cannot edit the above fields)
   
#### Testing: Usability of editing contact info UI
Research question addressed:

-   ##### Do they understand updates will only be applied to this request?
    
-   Now that you edited your contact information, where do you think the updates will be applied? (if confused, clarify: do you think the new contact info you entered will be applied only for this form, or for your VA services in general?)
    

Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)
*   Complete success: Participant says the contact info update will only be applied to this request, and that it will not be updated in other areas of the VA.
    
-   Failure: Participant says the contact info update will be applied to all areas of the VA.

#### Testing: Comprehension
###   
### Observational Task - usability of list loops [Step 2 to 7: Household income - Work history]
### (long task broken into sub-tasks)

##### Research goal addressed: Is the [new list loop](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/25881) design easy for Veterans to utilize?
  Researcher note:

Veteran/user should hopefully build proficiency as they complete more list loops - look out for areas of confusion. 
  -   Please fill out the form as you would normally. You may use fake information to fill out the form. Please remember to think out loud and comment if anything is unclear. Pause once you get to the additional job screen.
Observe participants as they fill out each list loop section. Ask them to pause at the end of each major list loop section Step and ask a few of the following questions for qualitative feedback:
	- What are your impressions of this section?
	- How are you feeling at this point in the form?
	- What is your level of motivation for continuing the form at this point?
	- Was there anything that you were unsure about?
	- Was there anything missing that you expected to see?
	- How would you describe this section, in a few words?
	- Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?
**[Testing: satisfaction]**

**Success criteria:**
- Notetaker Rate success for loop step 2 (Household income/Veteran employment), and loop step 4 (Household expenses) only - all other sections, only qualitative feedback

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for Veterans.

## Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

## Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
