## Research Goals

There are multiple resolution pathways a Veteran can select when resolving their benefit debt and now copay payments, including: requesting an extended payment plan, submitting a compromise offer, or asking for a waiver. All of these options require the submission of a Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655), which captures a monthly snapshot of the Veteran's household income and expenses. Veterans often struggle to include all the information needed to accurately represent their financial situation, including duplicating information.

The Enhanced FSR addresses issues that were mainly found during the last usability study and since the initial VBA launch on November 16, 2021 include the following:

-   Switching from card format to a more minimalist and easy to understand format when presenting debt/copay bills to users.  
    -   [Select debt/copay: after | before](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr/images/debt-cards-update.png?raw=true)
    
-   Allow Veterans to update phone number and address in addition to mailing address.  
    -   [Contact info: after | before](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr/images/contact-info-update.png?raw=true)
    
-   Improvements were made to list loops as the previous usability study showcased how Veterans had difficulty utilizing the list loop when it was presented as a dropdown. The updates also address accessibility issues that the dropdown version of the list loop had. List loops appear when entering employment and other income for themselves and their spouse, dependents, household assets, household expenses.  
      
    -   [Employment: after | before](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr/images/job-listloops-update.png?raw=true)
    
    -   [Dependents: after | before](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr/images/dependents-update.png?raw=true)
    
-   Ensure resolution options are easier for Veterans to understand.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports these main [OCTO objectives and goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans can manage their health services online
    
-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
    
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
    

This research supports increasing these measures:

-   Usage of digital, self-service tools
    
-   Number of VA.gov users as a function of total Veteran population
    

This research supports decreasing these measures:

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

Debt can happen at any stage in [the Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) after the ‘Getting out’ stage. However, certain types of debt, such as Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, is more likely to occur at the ‘Finding something to do’ stage.

Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

- **Confirm that enhanced FSR updates are easy to use:**
	-   Are Veterans able to easily edit their contact information on FSR?

	-   Are Veterans able to easily select a debt/copay bill?

	-   Are Veterans able to update their VA Benefits information?
    
	-   Do Veterans understand the resolution options?
    
	-   **Is the [new list & loop](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/25881) design easy for Veterans to utilize?**
    
		##### Definition: List loops as we are defining them:

		The selection process by which a Veteran selects sub-categories of an overall category and sees screens that reflect their selection.

### Secondary research goals:

-   Understand Veterans subjective experience with the form and the amount of effort (satisfaction)

-   Veterans feel confident and comfortable with the form (subjective experience)


## Research Questions


*Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:*
- *What will I do with what I learn from this question?*
- *Does this question serve the goals of my study?*
- *Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)*

1.  Do Veterans know what this form is for – do they understand it is for benefits overpayment and medical copays?  (comprehension)
    
2.  Do Veterans understand each resolution option? (comprehension)
    
3.  What do Veterans expect to happen after they submit/complete their request? (comprehension)
    	-   What communications do Veterans expect to receive about their request?

4.  Do Veterans understand what assets and expenses to include in each section? (comprehension)
    	-   Does clarifying content in the “Real Estate” and “Vehicle” section help Veterans understand what kind of property and vehicles to include?
    
5.  How understandable is the new list loop format, UI, and UX? (usability)
    	-   How learnable is it?
    
	-   What do Veterans think of the options (presented as checkmarks) on the new list loop?
    
	-   Are Veterans able to add custom items using the “Add additional …” action link?
    
6.  How understandable are other non-list loop specific changes (contact info, resolution options)? (usability)

7.  How do Veterans feel about the amount of effort this form requires? (satisfaction)
    
	-   Are Veterans overwhelmed by the amount of pages on this form?

## Methodology 

We conducted 75-minute to 90 minute long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on  **May 17-24, 2023**. Participants were asked to sign in to their MyVA accounts and fill out the enhanced [Financial Status Report](https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction) on VA.gov after their accounts had been whitelisted. One user filled out the form on staging after the moderator gave remote access and several filled out the form or were shown the form on [UXPin](https://preview.uxpin.com/f43733391f52c409c4d3152e9a4b101a392e29df#/pages/161460690/simulate/sitemap).


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

***Primary Hypothesis***

Veterans will be able to easily understand and fill out the form given the new list & loop pattern, be able to edit their contact information, view and edit their VA benefits, and easily view and understand the resolution options.

**Definitely true**
The new list & loop pattern was easy to understand and fill out in terms of UI.

Contact information was easy to edit.

Viewing VA benefits was easy.

**Maybe true:**
Viewing and understanding resolution options.

It is possible that the “waiver” language was oversimplified, as a few participants were confused by it. P7 thought this form was for a loan when reading the resolution options. P3 thought the amount would be deducted from his benefits and chose “compromise”.

**Unexpected finding:**
The Veteran’s attitude about VA debt, mental model about the VA and VA debt, and psychological frame of mind strongly affected their experience with the FSR form. Veterans that felt more neutral/positive about VA debt were more understanding of the length and depth of the form. Veterans that had negative attitudes about the VA in general had negative feelings about the form.

***Secondary Hypothesis***

The enhanced FSR format and language will be easy to digest, and most will be able to fill out the form independently (accessibility).

**Maybe true**
The FSR language may be harder to digest based on defensiveness and mistrust around providing certain information.

This finding is substantiated with the FSR usability study that was conducted in March 2021:
Is it clear to Veterans why they need to provide their financial information?
**Generally yes, but they still don’t like it.**
## Key Findings

***Usability Findings***

 1. **Participants found the enhanced FSR design patterns (including new list loops) easy to use.**
 
***Comprehension Findings***

 2. **Participants who understand the form's purpose (to help with debt) had an easier time filling it out and were more motivated to fill it out and supply all of the information, particularly if requesting debt relief.**

 3. **Some participants wanted more specific guidance with the form: specificity to understand what is meant by “dependent”, specific guidance on how to calculate monthly income and deductions, and more extensive help sections (additional information component).**

***Satisfaction Findings***

 4. **Resolution options could be more refined to increase understanding.**
 
 5. **Participants in this sample who had negative experiences with VA services felt a sense of distrust with the VA, hopelessness, and were skeptical about the debt resolution process. Participants experiencing homelessness were triggered by certain sections and questions. (2 of 7) A negative emotional state and past negative experience with the VA may also be correlated to a lower motivation/willingness to fill out the form.**
 
 6. **Some participants felt like the VA should know the answers to questions that were being asked. This was based on either information they had previously given to the VA (MyVA profile) or their SSN (IRS).**

 7. **Overall participants felt the form was too long. Some participants thought the form was invasive.**



## Details of Findings 


 1. **Participants found the enhanced FSR design patterns (including new list loops) easy to use.**

 Participants, overall, found the new list loop pattern easy to use. Without prompting, participants understood they were on a summary page and noticed the action link to allow them to add more items.  
Participants easily understood how to edit their contact information but a few believed editing their contact information on the form would not update their information elsewhere on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/). This was mainly due to their past experience of different aspects of [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) not connecting/communicating.  
Participants easily understood selecting a debt, reviewing their benefits.

- One participant questioned where certain expenses should go such as gym membership fees and subscriptions as they did not see them listed. This participant stated she did not want to “freestyle” and wanted very direct options with a miscellaneous section at the end.

- Due to a technical error, one participant filled out the form using the old pattern. He was later shown the new pattern and stated he preferred the new pattern.   

>"I prefer this layout [new list loop pattern]. This avoids having you to save prior to inputting the information. This is much easier. You don’t have to go through as many steps. I think if you have a Veteran that is not tech savvy the prototype that you just showed me would make it easier for them to go through." -P3

>“This is just a summary of everything I have just gone over. I think this is a great idea because if you see an issue you can edit it.” -P4

 2. **Participants who understand the form's purpose (to help with debt) had an easier time filling it out and were more motivated to fill it out and supply all of the information, particularly if requesting debt relief.**

Several participants acknowledged that the form was extensive and stated that they understood why it needed to be so thorough as it was for debt relief.

 > “Oh, whoa! The thought that hops into my mind, if you have all this stuff, then how do you have VA debt?! The stuff on the list makes sense, you’re just trying to get a good profile of the veteran.” -P10
 > 
 > "They are serious that they do not want to help you unless you really need help. this is good though because I think a lot of people are asking for help when they dont need help, they are not looking for help they are looking for a handout. - P4

 3. **Some participants wanted more specific guidance with the form: specificity to understand what is meant by “dependent”, specific guidance on how to calculate monthly income and deductions, and more extensive help sections (additional information component).**

 Participants often expanded the “Additional information” components. Several participants either wanted additional links and more extensive information on the existing “Additional information” components or wanted a component on every page.

> “My mom is my dependent, but she does not live with me. I guess that should be clarified more. I help her buy her medication." [Notices request for ages on next page] "They are asking for dependent dependents so I will put zero.” -P8


 4. **Resolution options could be more refined to increase understanding.**

 Resolution options could be refined. There was some misunderstanding of the term “waiver”.

>“Just trying to think of the best option for the amount owed. I just thought with all the information provided it would tell me which would be the best option. I hate the guessing game and hope I picked the right one. The monthly payment would just be another monthly debt, and what happens if you forget to make a payment.” -P3

>“I picked that one because of the amount I do not think they would grant a waiver, so I thought the easier option would be the compromise. I didn’t know that if they give you a waiver, they take it out of whatever benefits you have remaining so I would still go with the compromise”. -P3

>“It’s for a loan” -P7
 
 5. **Participants in this sample who had negative experiences with VA services felt a sense of distrust with the VA, hopelessness, and were skeptical about the debt resolution process. Participants experiencing homelessness were triggered by certain sections and questions. (2 of 7) A negative emotional state and past negative experience with the VA may also be correlated to a lower motivation/willingness to fill out the form.**

 -   Two participants who were experiencing homelessness described the form as “a waste of time”.

>“Having to list your household assets seems unnecessary. This information is none of their business. That information should not count against them in the decision process. It should be focused on the fact that the VA made an overpayment. That is on the VA to find a resolution instead of putting that on the Veteran. It should be on the person who issued the overpayment to fix the problem. I know plenty of people who would look at that form and let the debt sit there.” -P1

>"I don’t think it is going to solve the issue because the VA is going to receive their own information from the IRS. So, this would be a waste of time." -P5

>"Any debt we receive, the government isn't on our side, they are out to collect their money. As soon as you pay that debt they will leave you alone. It isn't as simple as a phone call or writing a letter to resolve the debt, it is days of work." - P5

>“It's a waste of time, they already know your information. I wouldn't fill out this form because it's aggravating. It triggers my stress.” -P7


 6. **Some participants felt like the VA should know the answers to questions that were being asked. This was based on either information they had previously given to the VA (MyVA profile) or their SSN (IRS).**

 Some participants felt like the VA shouldn’t need to ask some of the questions on the form because “they are the government” and can access information from other agencies such as the IRS. They thought that the answers could either be pulled up via their SSN or from their MyVA profile. One participant thought that the VA would cross-check their answers with other government agencies to see how truthful they were.

>“The VA already knows what your compensation is, and your education benefits are then they should know if the Veteran could afford that healthcare bill… VA employees act as if they are some kind of gatekeepers of all the help we need from them.” -P1

>If they have your social security number, why are they asking for all this information? It is the government, they would have this. This is a waste of time" -P7


 7. **Overall participants felt the form was too long. Some participants thought the form was invasive.**

Participants were overwhelmed by the amount of questions and effort this form required. Several stated that they thought the suggested time of 60 minutes was not long enough to complete this form. Some participants felt that the amount of questions were to be expected for debt forgiveness. On the other hand, some participants felt that the questions were invasive and wondered why the V.A. needs to know this information.

  
Several participants commented that they liked the one question per page format. They were not overwhelmed by the number of pages but by the amount and the type of questions that the form requires.
    

> “This is a very long form. I might have already stopped and figured out how to pay this bill because this is a lot of work. Even with you on the phone this is a lot.” -P4



## Recommendations


* Add more "additional information" sections. When a participant was unsure about a question, they looked for this component. 
 
* Provide reassurance and create a cohesive explanation throughout the FSR form that clearly states why the VA asks for this information, what will be done with it, and the limits.
    
* Provide more instruction on what the VA is looking for on the "Personal statement" section
    * _"This is where you will lose your audience because you are asking me for all my financial business and now you want a statement on why. You see that I am paying out more in debt than I make in a month. That should be obvious. I would put down something like I don’t make enough money to cover my monthly bills. Again, my thought behind it is I already gave you all the information to show I am not making enough money and I am quickly going into debt. The statement is far too open-ended."_ -P10
    
* Remove "overdue" input field on Credit Card section if possible. Many fields have been removed from the Credit Card section since the last study but it was still confusing to see an input field for "past due" amount as well as "overdue" amount.

* Pull information from user's MyVA Profile. (example: Spouse's name)

* Refine wording for Resolution options. Include "Debt forgiveness" with the term "waiver"

* Adding the word "average" to monthly deductions (and other sections)

* The Streamlined Waiver (shorter form and automatic approval) will help with Veterans experiencing financial hardship with copay debt. However, as copay debt tends to be smaller and benefit overpayment tends to be a larger amount, it is important that the Streamlined Waiver be expanded to benefit overpayments.


## Next Steps

- Investigate what information can be pulled from users' MyVA profile.


## Further research needed
- Recruit specifically for those we did not speak to in the next study (see: Underserved groups we haven’t talked to section).
- Card sorting study for common lists of expenses and assets.
