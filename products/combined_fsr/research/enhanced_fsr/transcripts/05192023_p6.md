# Usability & Comprehension Study:

### Conversation Guide Questions

  

Intro/preparation - 7-10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today!

My name is Charlotte and Megan and Joe are taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about your experience with a form called the Financial Status Report Form (FSR). This was previously a paper form you had to fill out by hand, and now a digital version has been created which we are testing today.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about [75 minutes and up to 90 minutes]. I want to be sure we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
    
-   IF USING UXPIN [You'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.]
    
-   We want you to know that what you fill out today is just for this study, and will not affect your VA profile, benefits, or any future form submission.
    
-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
    
-   I want to let you know that I will not be able to answer any questions about the prototype, the form, or VA Debt because we are interested in your unbiased opinions. If you have any questions related to VA debt after this interview, I encourage you to reach out to your VSO.
    
-   Finally, we prefer that you turn on your video for our meeting, only if you are comfortable.
    
-   Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    

-   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
-   If yes: Admit observers.
    
-   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    
-   Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen, the video, and the audio as we talk today?
    

### Baseline Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a few warm-up questions so that I can get to know you and your experiences with VA debt. This section should take at most 10 minutes.

Background about their service history

  

-   Firstly, if you’re comfortable sharing, could you please tell me briefly about the major parts of your service? (optional question)
    

  

-   I am going to ask you a few questions about your experiences with VA debt.
    

  

### VA debt experience baseline

  

Moderator memo: could be a small debt amount, or a large one

  

-   What has been your past experience with VA debt? [establish baseline]
    
-   What are your hopes for having your VA debt resolved?
    
-   What are your expectations for having your VA debt resolved?
    
-   What experience have you had with filling out forms on VA.gov, if any? [optional]
    

  
  

Thank you for answering those questions so completely. Now, we’re going to transition to the part of the interview where I’m going to ask you to fill out a form as you would in real life.

Imagine you have some VA debt that you would like help with.

  

We are going to go through a form and ask you to fill it out, as you would normally. I am going to observe silently, and I will ask you questions at certain times. Also, I will ask you to pause at certain sections and I will ask you follow up questions.

  

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers, we just want to learn from your experience with this digital form so that we can make improvements.

  

We ask that you think out loud as you are going through and filling out the form. Please comment on anything you like, and anything you don’t like, as well as anything that is clear or unclear.

  

Please make estimates on any information you don’t know.
