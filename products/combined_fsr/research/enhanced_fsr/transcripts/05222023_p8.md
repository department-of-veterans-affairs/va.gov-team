# Usability & Comprehension Study:

### Conversation Guide Questions

  

Intro/preparation - 7-10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today!

My name is Charlotte and Megan and Joe are taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about your experience with a form called the Financial Status Report Form (FSR). This was previously a paper form you had to fill out by hand, and now a digital version has been created which we are testing today.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about [75 minutes and up to 90 minutes]. I want to be sure we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
    
-   IF USING UXPIN [You'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.]
    
-   We want you to know that what you fill out today is just for this study, and will not affect your VA profile, benefits, or any future form submission.
    
-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
    
-   I want to let you know that I will not be able to answer any questions about the prototype, the form, or VA Debt because we are interested in your unbiased opinions. If you have any questions related to VA debt after this interview, I encourage you to reach out to your VSO.
    
-   Finally, we prefer that you turn on your video for our meeting, only if you are comfortable.
    
-   Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    

-   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
-   If yes: Admit observers.
    
-   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    
-   Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen, the video, and the audio as we talk today?
    You can record whatever you want.

### Baseline Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a few warm-up questions so that I can get to know you and your experiences with VA debt. This section should take at most 10 minutes.

Background about their service history

  

-   Firstly, if you’re comfortable sharing, could you please tell me briefly about the major parts of your service? (optional question)
    
I was 4 years reserves and 4 years active duty. I kept trying to be deployed because I was a combat medic. I tried to go into combat, but they did not send me. I was a great soldier. 
  

-   I am going to ask you a few questions about your experiences with VA debt.
    
Something happened where the GI Bill process changed where they send you a text or email at the end of each month would send me a text asking me if I attended my full course. I had stated no because I dropped a course, but they still paid me a few days later. I take responsibility for not saying anything, so I owe them now over $1,000. I set up a payment plan which is what I am currently in right now. I haven’t even checked to see if they started taking the money out yet.
  

### VA debt experience baseline

  

Moderator memo: could be a small debt amount, or a large one

  

-   What has been your past experience with VA debt? [establish baseline]
    
-   What are your hopes for having your VA debt resolved?
    I am going to resolve it. We both made mistakes. For them to give us payment plans is nice. I hope to pay it off sooner. With that amount it is stretched out over a long time. They are always really nice when I call them. The GI Bill people have their own line.
-   What are your expectations for having your VA debt resolved?
    
-   What experience have you had with filling out forms on VA.gov, if any? [optional]
    
If I have it has been a while. I am not sure. My memory is bad. Off the top of my head, I don’t recall what it would have been. My PebLob might have helped me fill anything out. They are the ones who help you when you are still on active duty. 
  
  

Thank you for answering those questions so completely. Now, we’re going to transition to the part of the interview where I’m going to ask you to fill out a form as you would in real life.

  
  

### Scenario and overall task

Please login to VA.gov using your VA.gov ID.ME login.

  

Once you are logged in, please share your screen on Zoom.

  

[Insert directions here]

  

[Sharing screen instructions as needed]

  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

  

Send direct link for FSR which will go to Wizard

[https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction](https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction)

  

Imagine you have some VA debt that you would like help with.

  

We are going to go through a form and ask you to fill it out, as you would normally. I am going to observe silently, and I will ask you questions at certain times. Also, I will ask you to pause at certain sections and I will ask you follow-up questions.

  

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers, we just want to learn from your experience with this digital form so that we can make improvements.

  

We ask that you think out loud as you are going through and filling out the form. Please comment on anything you like, and anything you don’t like, as well as anything that is clear or unclear.

  

Please make estimates on any information you don’t know.

  

Form comprehension questions

[https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction](https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction)

  

### Screen: [Intro → Wizard]

  

I’m going to ask you to make these selections on this questionnaire -

  

1.  What’s this debt related to? VA disability compensation or VA health care copay bills
    
    I like these questions because they give you options. A lot of us don’t know when you update this site. I like that you can tailor things to my VA debt. It is nice.

  

[Notice/observe if they skip intro page and ask about it]

  

-   Please pause here and take a moment to read this page.
    

-   Based on what you read, what is the FSR form for?
    

#### Testing: Comprehension

### Screen: FSR intro page with the 7 steps

Info page: [ Request help with VA debt for overpayments and copay bills ]

  

If they read through the page, ask:

  

-   What are your thoughts on this page?
    
I would absolutely read this. Sometimes the VA does things backwards. They should have put start the process at the bottom of the page to make us read the whole page. They should get rid of the first start of the process. Woosh 60 minutes. The monthly living expenses would be the part that would take the time. Oh, good it does show my debts right here. I wonder if it is my original debt, or if they have been taking my payment out of my account. 
  

Testing: Qualitative feedback/ satisfaction

  

Debt Selection Question

Moderator provides direction:

  

Reminder: If silent, [ Please make sure to think out loud, and pause and comment if anything is unclear and if there is anything you especially like. ]

### Sub-Task [Step 1 of 7: Editing contact info]

##### Research goal addressed: Are Veterans able to easily edit their [contact information](https://preview.uxpin.com/552e9ad135f7d7ee943a92576feab45190b069f4#/pages/147887481/comment/no-panels?mode=i) on FSR?

  

-   Please pause here.
    

  

[SCREEN NAME: Contact Information]

  

-   Can you show me how you would edit your mailing address?
    

  

Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)

  

#### Testing: Usability of editing contact info UI

  

Research question addressed:

-   ##### Do they understand updates will only be applied to their VA profile in all places?
    

  

-   Now that you edited your contact information, where do you think the updates will be applied?
    I would just click edit. It had me update my contact information, which is confusing because I have updated my address prior to this. 

  

-   (if confused, clarify: do you think the new contact info you entered will be applied only for this form, or for your VA services in general?)
    

  

Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through from the start until now?

  

How are you feeling at this point in the form?

  My mom is my dependent, but she does not live with me. I guess that should be clarified more. I help her buy her medication. They are asking for dependent dependents so I will put zero.

    Why are they asking me this, are they trying to take my care away from me.

-   Please click on where it says “What if I don’t know the estimated value of car or other vehicle?”
    Oh, good that is what I want to know. 
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    
-   Please enter estimates for the amounts.

-   Now go ahead and click on the back button. Is this what you expected to see?
    

  

### List loop observation task only (no success ratings, only qualitative feedback)

  

Pause here. (at end of household assets section)

  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through for household assets?

  It is kind of reaching. It seems a little much. I guess. Honestly if someone owes money, and they are asking for forgiveness on that debt the question should be invasive. I guess for this reason I don’t mind them asking these questions. We should be prepared to be asked these kind of questions.

How are you feeling at this point in the form?

  

Observational/can ask

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
  This is easier than I thought because I don’t really. I just wish they would give definitions. I don’t know what entertainment is because I don’t have a life. I just go to the gym. I guess movies. I guess it means I pay for my YouTube account. 

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

— End of List Loop Testing —-

Resolution options comprehension question - 10 minutes

-   What are your thoughts on these options, if any?
    It is asking me to review. I am at the end of this, but they never asked me about entering my credit card information or my $100 gym membership. Could I go back?
When you click back, is this what you would expect to see the page before?
Yes because they don’t know what page I am trying to get to. All this says is past due, but I pay all my credit cards off on time. Maybe the VA kind of messed up here because this is where you would add a credit card bill, but this is not overdue. For my gym membership I think I should add that to the monthly. Wait. Where should I add the gym? Could I add it for the monthly installments? That is where I would try to add it. Confusing. I am going to move forward because I don’t think that is the right place to add it. I am going to add it to health expenses. 
-   Which repayment or relief option would you select? Why?
    This seems like it is asking me to pay for 2 months of debts. It very well could be. I don’t pay enough attention to it. I called to make the payment plan but didn’t call to listen to anything besides my payment. I wish it would have shown me if I was making payments. Since I am making payments would that change the ability to use some of these options. I guess what we could do is try to get a waiver. I might come back and do this because I really need this.

  

# Supporting personal statement

-   What type of information would you include in this section?
    I would just be honest with them. I would explain how my bills are a lot for me, and I would explain my mental health state. I feel trapped in my rent because the cost of moving is a lot. They extended my payment plan to allow me to get my things together prior to taking my money. 

  

### Bankruptcy options question

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### Review page

### Review page usability question

  

What are your impressions of this section?

Is there anything that you are unsure about on this page?

Do you have any additional thoughts on this review page?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

### Review page editing usability question

  

[SCREEN NAME: Review page]

  

-   Can you show me what you would do if you wanted to edit a section?
    Just push edit. I think they could really improve those sections because they don’t have a place to add credit card information that is not past due. 
-   If you were given the option to edit your form directly on the review page or go to a separate page, which one would be easiest for you?
    
It is good because we slip up. If you were not on the screen with me, I would fly through. It gives me peace of mind that I entered all the correct information. They are going to the faith base. Obviously, I am not lying, but it is interesting they go off that.

Here it the good thing about this, I like that they show they want my full name. I like that they show me how it is entered in their system.

-   Can you show me how you would edit your dependents section?
    

  

#### Testing: Usability of editing info from review page

  

## Post-task questions

-   What was your overall experience with the FSR Form like?
    I like the fact that they allowed me to save it. I think previously if it did not go through all your information would be lost. During the day it crashes all the time because everyone is there. That was easy. There are places where it could be improved by explaining what exactly they want in certain places. It does seem pretty good.
How would you reword the credit card question?
Anytime there was a menu where I could drop down to get more information on that section I would. I don’t recall if they had that there. I don’t know the purpose of asking that question. Also have a different section asking for current credit card bill or just asking what your current credit card bills is and what is past due.
-   What did you like about the form?
    
-   What did you not like about the form?
    
-   What would you change, if anything? Was anything unclear?
    I like things to be in a very objective form. It needs to be clear on where each expense goes. That is the only thing I would change. Also have an explanation/definition on each page, to help us fill out this form out more accurately.
-   Overall, how difficult or easy was the form to complete?
    

-   1 being very difficult and 7 being very easy.
    

-   How did you feel about the overall length of the form? How would you approach filling out the form in real life, if you wanted to submit it? (in one sitting, with breaks, etc.)
    

-   Imagine you submitted your FSR form. What do you think will happen after?
    
I don’t think the VA website does this. I hope it will send an email to my email address to tell me that I have submitted it. I wouldn’t know if it was submitted if I don’t get that. Also, a timeline of what is expected next and contact information for who I would need to get more information from.
Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?
I think doing it online is great. It makes it easier for us to fill out.    

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

  

 Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
