# Usability & Comprehension Study:

### Conversation Guide Questions

  

Intro/preparation - 7-10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today!

My name is Charlotte and Megan and Joe are taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about your experience with a form called the Financial Status Report Form (FSR). This was previously a paper form you had to fill out by hand, and now a digital version has been created which we are testing today.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about [75 minutes and up to 90 minutes]. I want to be sure we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
    
-   IF USING UXPIN [You'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.]
    
-   We want you to know that what you fill out today is just for this study, and will not affect your VA profile, benefits, or any future form submission.
    
-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
    
-   I want to let you know that I will not be able to answer any questions about the prototype, the form, or VA Debt because we are interested in your unbiased opinions. If you have any questions related to VA debt after this interview, I encourage you to reach out to your VSO.
    
-   Finally, we prefer that you turn on your video for our meeting, only if you are comfortable.
    
-   Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    

-   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
-   If yes: Admit observers.
    
-   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    
-   Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen, the video, and the audio as we talk today?
    *Not comfortable recording*

### Baseline Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a few warm-up questions so that I can get to know you and your experiences with VA debt. This section should take at most 10 minutes.

Background about their service history

  

-   Firstly, if you’re comfortable sharing, could you please tell me briefly about the major parts of your service? (optional question)
    
I was in the Marine Corps as an equipment operator.
  

-   I am going to ask you a few questions about your experiences with VA debt.
    They’re slow. They take their time, and do not look over you like you need to be looked over. Some of the services I need are no longer available at the VA.

  

### VA debt experience baseline

  

Moderator memo: could be a small debt amount, or a large one

  

-   What has been your experience with VA debt? [establish baseline]
    I am service connected, so it is just slow. It is taking too long to get into the system. 
-   What are your hopes for having your VA debt resolved?
    To be financially secure. Stabled. The government is stable, but the enlisted are being forgotten about. We are being put on the backburner.
-   What are your expectations for having your VA debt resolved?
    I am still in debt. I am currently homeless. I am staying in the Veteran housing in the city I live in.
-   What experience have you had with filling out forms on VA.gov, if any? [optional]
    Yes, the website crashes all the time. 

  
  

Thank you for answering those questions so completely. Now, we’re going to transition to the part of the interview where I’m going to ask you to fill out a form as you would in real life.

  
  

### Scenario and overall task

Please login to VA.gov using your VA.gov ID.ME login.

  

Once you are logged in, please share your screen on Zoom.

  

[Insert directions here]

  

[Sharing screen instructions as needed]

  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

[https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction](https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction)

  

Imagine you have some VA debt that you would like help with.

  

We are going to go through a form and ask you to fill it out, as you would normally. I am going to observe silently, and I will ask you questions at certain times. Also, I will ask you to pause at certain sections and I will ask you follow-up questions.

  

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers, we just want to learn from your experience with this digital form so that we can make improvements.

  

We ask that you think out loud as you are going through and filling out the form. Please comment on anything you like, and anything you don’t like, as well as anything that is clear or unclear.

  

Please make estimates on any information you don’t know.

  

Form comprehension questions

[https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction](https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction)

  

### Screen: [Intro → Wizard]

  

I’m going to ask you to make these selections on this questionnaire -

  

1.  What’s this debt related to? VA disability compensation or VA health care copay bills
    
    

  

[Notice/observe if they skip intro page and ask about it]

  

-   Please pause here and take a moment to read this page.
    

-   Based on what you read, what is the FSR form for?
    It is about fees, copayments, how you want to make a payment, or request for an offset so they don’t take all your funds. They will garnish your check. 

A payment arrangement.

#### Testing: Comprehension

### Screen: FSR intro page with the 7 steps

Info page: [ Request help with VA debt for overpayments and copay bills ]

  

If they read through the page, ask:

  

-   What are your thoughts on this page?
    
That is what we have here, but they aren’t always here. They are usually at  conferences. Being since this is for the government, they should have all this information. 
  

Testing: Qualitative feedback/ satisfaction

  

Debt Selection Question

Moderator provides direction:

  

Reminder: If silent, [ Please make sure to think out loud, and pause and comment if anything is unclear and if there is anything you especially like. ]

### Sub-Task [Step 1 of 7: Editing contact info]

##### Research goal addressed: Are Veterans able to easily edit their [contact information](https://preview.uxpin.com/552e9ad135f7d7ee943a92576feab45190b069f4#/pages/147887481/comment/no-panels?mode=i) on FSR?

  

-   Please pause here.
    

  

[SCREEN NAME: Contact Information]

  

-   Can you show me how you would edit your mailing address?
    
I would go to the profile and open it up.
  

Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)

  

#### Testing: Usability of editing contact info UI

  

Research question addressed:

-   ##### Do they understand updates will only be applied to their VA profile in all places?
    
Email, phone number, and mailing address. No, it would not be updated through the whole set because they don’t communicate. I can tell you that for sure based on my experience. 
  

-   Now that you edited your contact information, where do you think the updates will be applied?
    

  

-   (if confused, clarify: do you think the new contact info you entered will be applied only for this form, or for your VA services in general?)
    

  

Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)

  

[Debt selection]

### Screen: [Debt selection screen]

  
  

-   What do you see here? What would you do here?
    
How much they have overpaid you. 
I see all the contact information for the Veteran.
  

#### Testing: Usability of debt selection UI

### Observational Tasks - usability of list loops

### Task [Step 2 to 7: Household income - Work history]

### (long task broken into sub-tasks)

##### Research goal addressed: Is the [new list loop](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/25881) design easy for Veterans to utilize?

  

Task description:

  

Researcher note:

Veteran/user should be able to build proficiency as they complete more list loops - look out for areas of confusion

  

-   Observe participants as they fill out each list loop section. Ask them to pause at the end of each major list loop section Step and ask the following questions for qualitative feedback
    

  
  
  

[SCREEN NAME: Household income]

  

### SUB-TASK A) Work history list mini loop

  
  

-   Please fill these pages out as you would in real life
    

  
  

Stop them at Gross monthly income at this job and ask:

  

-   What type of income are you entering here? [Answer: monthly]
This is your tax information. Whatever I get in a month. 
    

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (payroll deductions)
    If they have your social security, why are they asking for all this information. It is the government they would have this. This is a waste of time.

If you knew filling this information would help with your debt, would you still fill this out?
No because it triggers my stress. 
How are you feeling right now?
I am doing what I need to do, but it is not going to change. 
-   Is there anything you are unsure about?
    
-   [comprehension]
    

  

-   What time period are you using for these payroll deduction estimates?
    

[Answer: monthly]

  

-   How would you feel about having to calculate these monthly payroll deductions?
    

  

-   [Your work history summary screen]
    
-   Take a moment to look at this screen.
    
-   What do you notice on this page? What does this screen mean to you?
    All of this is taken out when you work. It is a time burden. All of the above. It makes sense, but it is just a time burden. If you look up my social security all this information would be disclosed. It is on the link of the home page. 
What does this page mean to you?
It shows how much you earn. It is like a LES.
-   Is anything clear or unclear?
    

  

### SUB-TASK B) Your VA Benefits

  

-   [Keep going]
    

  

### SUB-TASK C) Your other income mini loop

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (Your other income)
    
That is what you receive monthly from the VA. 
  

-   Please make any selections here that are relevant to you.
    

  

-   Is there anything you are unsure about?
    

  

-   [comprehension]
    

  

### SUB-TASK D) Spouse’s information mini loop

  

-   Please make selections here
    

  

-   [If this applies to you]
    
-   Is your spouse’s employment/work information something you already know?
    I don’t know why their information matters because they are just a dependent. This is about the Veteran. I don’t know how information because we don’t communicate like that. If I did know that information, I wouldn’t be homeless.

  
  

### SUB-TASK E) Dependents mini loop

  

Pause here. (at end of Household income loop section)

  
  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through from the start until now?

  I see your dependents rely on your for financial support, zero.

How are you feeling at this point in the form?

  

Observational/can ask

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

  

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  If you have debt with the government, they know all this information, so why do I need to disclose this information?

[Testing: satisfaction]

  

### Task [Step 3 of 7: Household assets] - 10 minutes

Qualitative observations and feedback only

### SUB-TASK A) Household assets

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your household assets, financial assets)
    
I think it depends on your situation that should automatically be deducted. 
  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### SUB-TASK B) Your real estate assets

  

-   Please click on where it says “Why do I need to provide this information?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    My thing is if this does not apply to you there should be a skip option. A lot of these don’t apply to my situation.
-   [Testing: satisfaction]
    

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

  

### SUB-TASK C) Your cars or other vehicles

-   Please click on where it says “What if I don’t know the estimated value of car or other vehicle?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    That’s crazy. Why doesn’t this just have one question to ask all this. It is time consuming. If you have a call or email, come in it would start this all over again. 
-   Please enter estimates for the amounts.
    

### SUB-TASK D) Your trailers, campers, and boats

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

-   Please enter estimates for the amounts.
    

### SUB-TASK E) Your other assets

  
  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your other assets)
    
It is asking for all your assets and valuables. 
  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

-   Please click on where it says “Why do I need to provide this information?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    It wants to know what your net worth is. You just asked that question and now you want to know the value of it all.
How are you feeling at this moment of the form?

Like stopping.

What about this time in the session?

I will keep going, but I am just being honest.

### List loop back button expectation Q & observation task (usability)

  

-   Pause here. If you were to click on the <back button>, where do you expect it would take you?
    

  

-   Now go ahead and click on the back button. Is this what you expected to see?
    

  

### List loop observation task only (no success ratings, only qualitative feedback)

  

Pause here. (at end of household assets section)

  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

### Task [Step 4 of 7: Household expenses] - 10 minutes

##### Research goal addressed: Is the [new list loop](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/25881) design easy for Veterans to utilize?

  

Task description

  

### SUBTASK A) Your monthly household expenses mini loop

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your other living expenses)
    
It varies so how do you. You don’t know how much you will pay for groceries, gas, childcare, and health insurance. Are they going to want receipts? That is more time that this will be delayed, and it will jam up the process. I think that is what they are trying to do, so we get frustrated and give up. That is why we commit suicide or go to other coping strategies. 
  They want to know all their business. If they want to know all about your business, why are you applying for assists. A lot of these don’t apply to me.

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### SUBTASK B) Your monthly utility bills mini loop

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your monthly utility bills)
    
It is like you are itemizing. 
  
  
  

### [SCREEN NAME: Add a credit card bill]

  

-   Please pause here [Add a credit card bill > enter your card bill’s information].
    

  

Testing [comprehension]

  

-   How would you feel about filling out this section? Would you need anyone to help you with this section?
    
They could get this from your credited report. You could just provide an updated credit report.
  

Testing [satisfaction] - expect that some Veterans may need help with this section

  

-   How would you go about finding this information? What would be your approach to filling out this section? Clarify: would you make estimations, or review receipts?
    I mean you might as well give them up your credit report since you are giving up all the information on your credit report. 

Testing [satisfaction]

  
  

### SUBTASK C) Your installment contracts and other debts

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  Does this apply to your situation?
No ma’am.

-   How would you go about finding this information? What would be your approach to filling out this section? Clarify: would you make estimations, or review receipts?
    


-   How would you feel about filling out this section? Would you need anyone to help you with this section?
    


### SUBTASK D) Your other living expenses

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    All of this applies. This is just like applying for a loan. They are questioning your integrity. Lord have mercy. 
  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through from the start until now?

How are you feeling at this point in the form?

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  

— End of List Loop Testing —-

Resolution options comprehension question - 10 minutes

-   What are your thoughts on these options, if any?
    I guess apply for a loan. That right there is a bunch of hot tooie. My GI Bill is no longer usable for me. I don’t know how to transfer to my daughter because she is graduating school. They do not provide that information. 
Any option here you would select?

This does not apply to me. They don’t send you a letter they will garnish your check. 
-   Which repayment or relief option would you select? Why?
    

  

# Supporting personal statement

-   What type of information would you include in this section?
    
I don’t think anybody ever reads that. You fill out a statement every time you fill out a claim. You have to explain what you are claiming. A lot of people don’t even know the experience of a Veteran because they are not Veterans themselves.
  

### Bankruptcy options question

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### Review page

### Review page usability question

  

What are your impressions of this section?
All your information they want to know about. All your business. A lot of Veterans can’t get a hold of their files because their files were destroyed in the fire in Kanas City. Over and over, you hear the same thing, we are sorry. 
Is there anything that you are unsure about on this page?

Do you have any additional thoughts on this review page?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

### Review page editing usability question

  

[SCREEN NAME: Review page]

  

-   Can you show me what you would do if you wanted to edit a section?
    
-   If you were given the option to edit your form directly on the review page or go to a separate page, which one would be easiest for you?
    


-   Can you show me how you would edit your dependents section?
    

  

#### Testing: Usability of editing info from review page

  

## Post-task questions

-   What was your overall experience with the FSR Form like?
    I guess that is the information you have to provide. All we have to do is comply.
-   What did you like about the form?
    
-   What did you not like about the form?
    
-   What would you change, if anything? Was anything unclear?
    Simplify the proof of your income, assets, dependent care, dependent information, none of that has nothing to do with the Veteran. The Veteran is the one with the debt not his family. I wouldn’t feel comfortable asking any questions that don’t apply to the Veteran.
-   Overall, how difficult or easy was the form to complete?
    

-   1 being very difficult and 7 being very easy.
    

-   How did you feel about the overall length of the form? How would you approach filling out the form in real life, if you wanted to submit it? (in one sitting, with breaks, etc.)
    

-   Imagine you submitted your FSR form. What do you think will happen after?
    

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?
    They have a lot of forms that don’t make sense. Like the housing application. All this information is a waste of paper. Clutter. You have to keep up with all your documents and you don’t fall behind. 

How do you feel about the paper form compared to computer form?

Computer forms are more convenient if you have access to a computer or tablet.

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

  

 Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
