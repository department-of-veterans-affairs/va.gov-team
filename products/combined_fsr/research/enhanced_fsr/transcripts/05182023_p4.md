# Usability & Comprehension Study:

### Conversation Guide Questions

  

Intro/preparation - 7-10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today!

My name is Charlotte and Megan and Joe are taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about your experience with a form called the Financial Status Report Form (FSR). This was previously a paper form you had to fill out by hand, and now a digital version has been created which we are testing today.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about [75 minutes and up to 90 minutes]. I want to be sure we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
    
-   IF USING UXPIN [You'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.]
    
-   We want you to know that what you fill out today is just for this study, and will not affect your VA profile, benefits, or any future form submission.
    
-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
    
-   I want to let you know that I will not be able to answer any questions about the prototype, the form, or VA Debt because we are interested in your unbiased opinions. If you have any questions related to VA debt after this interview, I encourage you to reach out to your VSO.
    
-   Finally, we prefer that you turn on your video for our meeting, only if you are comfortable.
    
-   Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    

-   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
-   If yes: Admit observers.
    
-   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    
-   Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen, the video, and the audio as we talk today?
    Yes.

### Baseline Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a few warm-up questions so that I can get to know you and your experiences with VA debt. This section should take at most 10 minutes.

Background about their service history

  

-   Firstly, if you’re comfortable sharing, could you please tell me briefly about the major parts of your service? (optional question)
    Active duty, 4 years, I was stationed at Fort Bragg, and 4 years in the National Guard in Florida.

  

-   I am going to ask you a few questions about your experiences with VA debt.
If it is close to tax time, they will take it out of your taxes. That was the worst of it. Typically, it is not that bad they will usually work with you to get a payment plan going.
How have they worked with you in the past? 
During Covid it was nice because there were payments coming up and they stopped payments for everyone. I work in the auto field, and I still had to go to work every day. There have been times where I had to do a payment plan.    

  

### VA debt experience baseline

  

Moderator memo: could be a small debt amount, or a large one

  

-   What has been your past experience with VA debt? [establish baseline]
    
-   What are your hopes for having your VA debt resolved?
    Hopefully I don’t have to worry about it again besides the one time it was pulled out during tax season. It was a tough time already, so they just took it out off the top of my tax refund.
-   What are your expectations for having your VA debt resolved?
    Since then, I just try to stay on top of it, so I don’t have to worry about it. most of my things have been taken care of because most of them have to do with my disability. Right now, I am not in  a position where I don’t have to worry about it. I am just doing primary care and some specialty. Right now, it is manageable. 
Did something happen to make you want to stay on top of it now?
It is easier now. I have 3 children, one who takes care of himself, another that almost takes care of himself, and then one I will have to worry about paying for college. My wife is really good at keeping on top of the bills. 
-   What experience have you had with filling out forms on VA.gov, if any? [optional]
    That long number that you have to put in every time is the worst part of it. Even when you already have an account set up with the VA.gov it does not automatically pull up your bill. It is not the same as a credit card company that pulls up how much you owe. That would be a nice change. That would be a good thing to add if you were going to add to it. I don’t know the form number, but when you go through pay.gov there is a long number with the last 5 letters of your name you have to enter. I am sure it is the same number every time.

  
  

Thank you for answering those questions so completely. Now, we’re going to transition to the part of the interview where I’m going to ask you to fill out a form as you would in real life.

  
  

### Scenario and overall task

Please login to VA.gov using your VA.gov ID.ME login.

  

Once you are logged in, please share your screen on Zoom.

  

[Insert directions here]

  

[Sharing screen instructions as needed]

  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

  

Send direct link for FSR which will go to Wizard

[https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction](https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction)

  

Imagine you have some VA debt that you would like help with.

  

We are going to go through a form and ask you to fill it out, as you would normally. I am going to observe silently, and I will ask you questions at certain times. Also, I will ask you to pause at certain sections and I will ask you follow up questions.

  

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers, we just want to learn from your experience with this digital form so that we can make improvements.

  

We ask that you think out loud as you are going through and filling out the form. Please comment on anything you like, and anything you don’t like, as well as anything that is clear or unclear.

  

Please make estimates on any information you don’t know.

  

Form comprehension questions

[https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction](https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction)

  

### Screen: [Intro → Wizard]

  

I’m going to ask you to make these selections on this questionnaire -

  

1.  What’s this debt related to? VA disability compensation or VA health care copay bills
    
    I think this is related to some kind of copay. The only reason I know what this is because I have a paper copy of this at home. This is also a prescription, but that would be a copay as well.

What is the form for? I am asking for help for paying the debt.

  

[Notice/observe if they skip intro page and ask about it]

  

-   Please pause here and take a moment to read this page.
    

-   Based on what you read, what is the FSR form for?
    

#### Testing: Comprehension

### Screen: FSR intro page with the 7 steps

Info page: [ Request help with VA debt for overpayments and copay bills ]

  

If they read through the page, ask:

  

-   What are your thoughts on this page?
    This is great because I always wanted to know what would happen if I overpaid.

  

Testing: Qualitative feedback/ satisfaction

  

Debt Selection Question

Moderator provides direction:

  

Reminder: If silent, [ Please make sure to think out loud, and pause and comment if anything is unclear and if there is anything you especially like. ]

### Sub-Task [Step 1 of 7: Editing contact info]

##### Research goal addressed: Are Veterans able to easily edit their [contact information](https://preview.uxpin.com/552e9ad135f7d7ee943a92576feab45190b069f4#/pages/147887481/comment/no-panels?mode=i) on FSR?

  

-   Please pause here.
    
What are your thoughts on this page? It is good. I think it is good to know the date is backwards, otherwise it is good.
  

[SCREEN NAME: Contact Information]

  

-   Can you show me how you would edit your mailing address?
    
I am just reading all this real quick. It is funny how they add all that stuff in there.
  

Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)

  

#### Testing: Usability of editing contact info UI

  

Research question addressed:

-   ##### Do they understand updates will only be applied to their VA profile in all places?
    

  

-   Now that you edited your contact information, where do you think the updates will be applied?
    Hopefully it will update throughout the whole VA. Knowing the VA it will probably only update on pay.gov. This is different because we typically pay through pay.gov and not VA.gov.

  

-   (if confused, clarify: do you think the new contact info you entered will be applied only for this form, or for your VA services in general?)
    

  

Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)

  

[Debt selection]

### Screen: [Debt selection screen]

  
  

-   What do you see here? What would you do here?
    
When did you start this job? Go ahead and look at the date. I have worked there since 1999.
  

#### Testing: Usability of debt selection UI

### Observational Tasks - usability of list loops

### Task [Step 2 to 7: Household income - Work history]

### (long task broken into sub-tasks)

##### Research goal addressed: Is the [new list loop](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/25881) design easy for Veterans to utilize?

  

Task description:

  

Researcher note:

Veteran/user should be able to build proficiency as they complete more list loops - look out for areas of confusion

  

-   Observe participants as they fill out each list loop section. Ask them to pause at the end of each major list loop section Step and ask the following questions for qualitative feedback
    

  
  
  

[SCREEN NAME: Household income]
  

### SUB-TASK A) Work history list mini loop

  
  

-   Please fill these pages out as you would in real life
    

  
  

Stop them at Gross monthly income at this job and ask:

  

-   What type of income are you entering here? [Answer: monthly]
    I am entering the generic income. I am entering monthly income. When I first read it, I would have assumed that it was talking about the annual income, but I continued to read and saw monthly income. They put it in bold there, so that is good. 


  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (payroll deductions)
    
-   Is there anything you are unsure about?
    
-   [comprehension]
    

  

-   What time period are you using for these payroll deduction estimates?
    What is the time frame they are asking for because some get taken out monthly and some are taken out every check. I wouldn’t be state tax maybe, but not federal tax, social security, or Medicare. I understand that may not be taken out if you are working part time. As a typically average American I may not know this, but because of my wife’s job I know this information. 

[Answer: monthly]

  

-   How would you feel about having to calculate these monthly payroll deductions?
    I don’t think this is a good page because my federal taxes would vary so I couldn’t tell you and the same with my retirement because it is a percentage. Same with social security. I would give a generic number. I am not on salary, so my federal taxes vary. I would have to guesstimate my average.

  

-   [Your work history summary screen]
    
-   Take a moment to look at this screen.
    
-   What do you notice on this page? What does this screen mean to you?
    This is just a summary of everything I have just gone over. I think this is a great idea because if you see an issue you can edit it.
-   Is anything clear or unclear?
    

  

### SUB-TASK B) Your VA Benefits

  

-   [Keep going]	
    

  

### SUB-TASK C) Your other income mini loop

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (Your other income)
    I think it is all legitimate. If it is not something the federal government knows about why would I tell the VA about it. 

  

-   Please make any selections here that are relevant to you.
    

  

-   Is there anything you are unsure about?
    

  

-   [comprehension]
    

  

### SUB-TASK D) Spouse’s information mini loop

  

-   Please make selections here
    

  

-   [If this applies to you]
    
-   Is your spouse’s employment/work information something you already know?
    
This makes sense because we help each other out with this so I think that is fair.

Is this information you don’t know?
I don’t know exactly. I could give a guesstimate and that would be on the low side.
  
  

### SUB-TASK E) Dependents mini loop

  

Pause here. (at end of Household income loop section)

  
  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through from the start until now?
Uno. 
  

How are you feeling at this point in the form?
This is a very long form. I might have already stopped and figured out a way to pay this bill without asking for help because this is a lot of work. Even doing it with you on the phone this has been a lot. 
  

Observational/can ask

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

  No.

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

  

### Task [Step 3 of 7: Household assets] - 10 minutes

Qualitative observations and feedback only

### SUB-TASK A) Household assets

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your household assets, financial assets)
    Pretty much just making sure you really need help and not just looking for an excuse not to pay your bill right now.

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### SUB-TASK B) Your real estate assets

  

-   Please click on where it says “Why do I need to provide this information?”
    Okay, that’s good because my house is worth way more than my debt. My 3 bedrooms is worth more than $50.
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    With a mortgage yes. They want to know the value, so they are not helping out the wrong people.
-   [Testing: satisfaction]
    

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

  

### SUB-TASK C) Your cars or other vehicles

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    They are serious about not helping you if you do not really need help. I think this is good because I think a lot of people are looking for a handout.

-   Please click on where it says “What if I don’t know the estimated value of car or other vehicle?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    
-   Please enter estimates for the amounts.
    I would google it.

### SUB-TASK D) Your trailers, campers, and boats

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    I do not.

-   Please enter estimates for the amounts.
    

### SUB-TASK E) Your other assets

  
  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your other assets)
    So what would we consider specialty equipment and technology? I am guessing technology would not be something that everyone would have in their house on a regular basis. I think more people would answer no than yes. Wow this is a lot because now I have to go through all my household expenses.

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

-   Please click on where it says “Why do I need to provide this information?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    

### List loop back button expectation Q & observation task (usability)

  

-   Pause here. If you were to click on the <back button>, where do you expect it would take you?
    

  

-   Now go ahead and click on the back button. Is this what you expected to see?
    

  

### List loop observation task only (no success ratings, only qualitative feedback)

  

Pause here. (at end of household assets section)

  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through for household assets?
This is a great question, but if you pay for it in one question is it asking for it separately or in one big go? I would put in the total amount for the month for all of the above. Depending on where you live you may pay individually for each of these things.
  

How are you feeling at this point in the form?

  

Observational/can ask

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

  

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

  

### Task [Step 4 of 7: Household expenses] - 10 minutes

##### Research goal addressed: Is the [new list loop](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/25881) design easy for Veterans to utilize?

  

Task description

  

### SUBTASK A) Your monthly household expenses mini loop

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your other living expenses)
    

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### SUBTASK B) Your monthly utility bills mini loop

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your monthly utility bills)
    They put down personal debts, does that include credit cards because they don’t say that? 
Would you go ahead and find the information you don’t know or what would you do? Yeah, I would have to do some looking up to put it in correctly.
If you added credit card debit with the other list on household expenses, really anything that you would pay monthly.
  
  
  

### [SCREEN NAME: Add a credit card bill]

  

-   Please pause here [Add a credit card bill > enter your card bill’s information].
    

  

Testing [comprehension]

  

-   How would you feel about filling out this section? Would you need anyone to help you with this section?
    
This is a long form. Again, it is just a lot of information. 
Anything that you were unsure about? No not really.
  

Testing [satisfaction] - expect that some Veterans may need help with this section.

How do you feel about the items listed here? I don’t know if everyone would know how much they would spend on certain things each month. It is a good list to have to know where all your money is going. If you were going through a financial class to help you stay financially stable this would help.

Do you find this helpful at all? It would have been helpful if I hadn’t gone through this already. I have something through my bank that shows me where I spend my money. It is nice. 
  

-   How would you go about finding this information? What would be your approach to filling out this section? Clarify: would you make estimations, or review receipts?
    

Testing [satisfaction]

  
  

### SUBTASK C) Your installment contracts and other debts

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

-   How would you go about finding this information? What would be your approach to filling out this section? Clarify: would you make estimations, or review receipts?
    


-   How would you feel about filling out this section? Would you need anyone to help you with this section?
    


### SUBTASK D) Your other living expenses

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    It is a good thing to have on there. 
  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through from the start until now?

How are you feeling at this point in the form?

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  

— End of List Loop Testing —-

Resolution options comprehension question - 10 minutes

-   What are your thoughts on these options, if any?
    I think that is a fair option to do it. I would have to imagine there are other options they would give you depending on the amount. 
-   Which repayment or relief option would you select? Why?
    I am the honest guy that still wants to pay my debt. 
Would you be filling this out on a phone or desktop? I would probably do it on my desktop if it is this long so I could open numerous windows to help.

  

# Supporting personal statement

-   What type of information would you include in this section?
    I would just be as honest as I could be about the situation. I would just explain that I couldn’t pay it now, but I could pay it at a later time. 

  

### Bankruptcy options question

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    Now that is a hard question because I don’t remember. 
How would you go about getting this information?
I would look it up in my file that I have at my house. It wouldn’t take long. 

  

### Review page

### Review page usability question

  

What are your impressions of this section?
Now you can go through and check and edit about everything you have already put down. I think a lot of people would skip through this because of the amount of time people have already spent doing this they would not want to review anything else.
Is there anything that you are unsure about on this page?

Do you have any additional thoughts on this review page?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

### Review page editing usability question

  

[SCREEN NAME: Review page]

  

-   Can you show me what you would do if you wanted to edit a section?
    You would go in and click on edit and hit update the page. 
-   If you were given the option to edit your form directly on the review page or go to a separate page, which one would be easiest for you?
    
I think that is a good thing instead of having to go back through to the page you would have to edit. I would be concerned that my information would be saved as I go back or if I would lose it. It is good they write it in red that you need to put your full name. 

-   Can you show me how you would edit your dependents section?
    

  

#### Testing: Usability of editing info from review page

  

## Post-task questions

-   What was your overall experience with the FSR Form like?
    Other than the fact that it is really long, it is not overly difficult to fill out. You may have to do some research to ensure you are inputting the correct information. I like the message that you have saved as you go.
-   What did you like about the form?
    It is fairly easy to navigate.
-   What did you not like about the form?
    Just the overall length in general.
-   What would you change, if anything? Was anything unclear?
    
-   Overall, how difficult or easy was the form to complete?
    

-   1 being very difficult and 7 being very easy.
    The form itself is not hard to fill out.

-   How did you feel about the overall length of the form? How would you approach filling out the form in real life, if you wanted to submit it? (in one sitting, with breaks, etc.)
    

-   Imagine you submitted your FSR form. What do you think will happen after?
    You will get an email that they have your request and they will get a timeline on when you will hear back from them.

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?
    

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

  

 Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
