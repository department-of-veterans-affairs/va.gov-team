# Usability & Comprehension Study:

### Conversation Guide Questions

  

Intro/preparation - 7-10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today!

My name is Charlotte and Megan and Joe are taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about your experience with a form called the Financial Status Report Form (FSR). This was previously a paper form you had to fill out by hand, and now a digital version has been created which we are testing today.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about [75 minutes and up to 90 minutes]. I want to be sure we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
    
-   IF USING UXPIN [You'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.]
    
-   We want you to know that what you fill out today is just for this study, and will not affect your VA profile, benefits, or any future form submission.
    
-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
    
-   I want to let you know that I will not be able to answer any questions about the prototype, the form, or VA Debt because we are interested in your unbiased opinions. If you have any questions related to VA debt after this interview, I encourage you to reach out to your VSO.
    
-   Finally, we prefer that you turn on your video for our meeting, only if you are comfortable.
    
-   Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    

-   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
-   If yes: Admit observers.
    
-   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    
-   Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen, the video, and the audio as we talk today?
    That is fine, yes.

### Baseline Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a few warm-up questions so that I can get to know you and your experiences with VA debt. This section should take at most 10 minutes.

Background about their service history

  

-   Firstly, if you’re comfortable sharing, could you please tell me briefly about the major parts of your service? (optional question)
    I was in active duty between 97 – 2000 and went into inactive duty in 2008. I served again active duty to deployed to Iraq and stayed in until 2011.
What do you like to do in your free time?
What free time? I like to garden, I love to hang out with my family, love to BBQ, hang out with my dogs, I find working in my yard relaxing. That is what I like to do in my free time. This year I have sunflowers, 7 different kinds of peppers, tomatoes, strawberries, watermelons, beans, and  squash.
  

-   I am going to ask you a few questions about your experiences with VA debt.
    
  

### VA debt experience baseline

  

Moderator memo: could be a small debt amount, or a large one

  

-   What has been your past experience with VA debt? [establish baseline]
    Mainly prescriptions copays. When I have a provider prescribe me medication, I have a copay. In the past, *tech issues*

My VA copays are between $40 - $50. Sometimes I get something in the mail, and it has been 30 days.

What do you mean it has been 30 days?
Sometimes I get something in the mail that my payment is due the next day and it has been 30 days. I think there is somewhere online to keep track of it.
-   What are your hopes for having your VA debt resolved?
    It is not a huge number, so by the time I get a notification I can get it paid. I don’t have the VA debt from education debt it is strictly medical copays. I always get them through mail. I don’t think I have it set up to receive through email.
-   What are your expectations for having your VA debt resolved?
Like I said, I don’t think it will ever be resolved. As long as I have insurance, I will continue to have copays for my VA prescriptions.     
-   What experience have you had with filling out forms on VA.gov, if any? [optional]
    
I have done a couple forms. When I did my GI Bill, adding my spouse when I got married, so I am very confident that I could fill out forms online.
  
  

Thank you for answering those questions so completely. Now, we’re going to transition to the part of the interview where I’m going to ask you to fill out a form as you would in real life.

  
  

### Scenario and overall task

Please login to VA.gov using your VA.gov ID.ME login.

  

Once you are logged in, please share your screen on Zoom.

  

[Insert directions here]

  

[Sharing screen instructions as needed]

  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

  

Send direct link for FSR which will go to Wizard

[https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction](https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction)

  

Imagine you have some VA debt that you would like help with.

  

We are going to go through a form and ask you to fill it out, as you would normally. I am going to observe silently, and I will ask you questions at certain times. Also, I will ask you to pause at certain sections and I will ask you follow-up questions.

  

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers, we just want to learn from your experience with this digital form so that we can make improvements.

  

We ask that you think out loud as you are going through and filling out the form. Please comment on anything you like, and anything you don’t like, as well as anything that is clear or unclear.

  

Please make estimates on any information you don’t know.

  

Form comprehension questions

[https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction](https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction)

  

### Screen: [Intro → Wizard]

  

I’m going to ask you to make these selections on this questionnaire -

  

1.  What’s this debt related to? VA disability compensation or VA health care copay bills
  I am going to select  VA healthcare copay bills. Honestly, I would not typically read all this if I would just start my application. Start my request.
    An idea is moving the start the request now after the reading part because most people would just click without reading any of that information. I would typically just go straight into the form.

  

[Notice/observe if they skip intro page and ask about it]

  

-   Please pause here and take a moment to read this page.
    

-   Based on what you read, what is the FSR form for?
    

#### Testing: Comprehension

### Screen: FSR intro page with the 7 steps

Info page: [ Request help with VA debt for overpayments and copay bills ]

  

If they read through the page, ask:

  

-   What are your thoughts on this page?
    

  

Testing: Qualitative feedback/ satisfaction

  

Debt Selection Question

Moderator provides direction:

  

Reminder: If silent, [ Please make sure to think out loud, and pause and comment if anything is unclear and if there is anything you especially like. ]

### Sub-Task [Step 1 of 7: Editing contact info]

##### Research goal addressed: Are Veterans able to easily edit their [contact information](https://preview.uxpin.com/552e9ad135f7d7ee943a92576feab45190b069f4#/pages/147887481/comment/no-panels?mode=i) on FSR?

  

-   Please pause here.
    

  

[SCREEN NAME: Contact Information]

  

-   Can you show me how you would edit your mailing address?
    I would just use the edit link there. 

  

Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)

  

#### Testing: Usability of editing contact info UI

  

Research question addressed:

-   ##### Do they understand updates will only be applied to their VA profile in all places?
    

  

-   Now that you edited your contact information, where do you think the updates will be applied?
    I am assuming nothing just on this form and not back on my VA profile. In full disclosure I could see how people could see if you update it here that it would update it across the system. Now I see the note, I didn’t read that to be honest. I don’t have a lot of confidence in the connectivity in the VA system.

  

-   (if confused, clarify: do you think the new contact info you entered will be applied only for this form, or for your VA services in general?)
    

  

Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)

  

[Debt selection]

### Screen: [Debt selection screen]

  
  

-   What do you see here? What would you do here?
    

  

#### Testing: Usability of debt selection UI

### Observational Tasks - usability of list loops

### Task [Step 2 to 7: Household income - Work history]

### (long task broken into sub-tasks)

##### Research goal addressed: Is the [new list loop](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/25881) design easy for Veterans to utilize?

  

Task description:
Going back, when I clicked yes and then continued, I noticed it goes straight into type of work. Looks pretty normal in terms of what you are asking. 
  

Researcher note:

Veteran/user should be able to build proficiency as they complete more list loops - look out for areas of confusion

  

-   Observe participants as they fill out each list loop section. Ask them to pause at the end of each major list loop section Step and ask the following questions for qualitative feedback
    

  
  
  

[SCREEN NAME: Household income]

  

### SUB-TASK A) Work history list mini loop

  
  

-   Please fill these pages out as you would in real life
    

  
  

Stop them at Gross monthly income at this job and ask:

  

-   What type of income are you entering here? [Answer: monthly]
    

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (payroll deductions)
    
-   Is there anything you are unsure about?
    I am just laughing because without having my paystub I am going to make these up. I remember on the first page you stated to have all this readily available. I would go back to my paystub to get this information. I could see someone getting frustrated if they are not used to IT, especially if using a mobile phone. Going back and forth to get information especially for older Veterans. If my dad were to do this, he would probably make me do it for him instead of him doing it.
What type of device would you use to fill out this form?
I would use my PC at home so I could have this up and all the other documents I would need.
-   [comprehension]
    

  

-   What time period are you using for these payroll deduction estimates?
    

[Answer: monthly]

  

-   How would you feel about having to calculate these monthly payroll deductions?
    

  

-   [Your work history summary screen]
    
-   Take a moment to look at this screen.
    It looks like I can edit a summary of what I entered. My question is could I add another field. Would I get a chance to edit those slots if I clicked edit. Oh, I can. This seems straightforward. 
-   What do you notice on this page? What does this screen mean to you?
    
-   Is anything clear or unclear?
    

  

### SUB-TASK B) Your VA Benefits

  

-   [Keep going]
    

  

### SUB-TASK C) Your other income mini loop

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (Your other income)
    

  

-   Please make any selections here that are relevant to you.
    

  

-   Is there anything you are unsure about?
    
Okay that seems correct. That seems to be drawn off the last one I received.
  

-   [comprehension]
    

  

### SUB-TASK D) Spouse’s information mini loop

  

-   Please make selections here
    

  

-   [If this applies to you]
    
-   Is your spouse’s employment/work information something you already know?
    
I don’t mind them asking, I was just curious about why they asked. Again, if you are really tied into the VA system, they would have this on file. So, I would need my spouse’s information as well. I understand why they are asking just. I have them but that may be a factor for not completing for other Vets. That kind of  information at their fingertips may be difficult. I understand why you need it, but I am just thinking out loud. Again, these numbers are made up. So, on the second job you are just considered about the current job
  
  

### SUB-TASK E) Dependents mini loop

  

Pause here. (at end of Household income loop section)

  
  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through from the start until now?

  I don’t have any of these. This seems like anything you would have in terms of other incomes. Yeah, that looks good.

How are you feeling at this point in the form?
It is mainly straight forward in terms of data entry. Ensuring the Veteran has all the information in hand. The question I have had is not through the UI design. The only way you can design it would be to create a stop sign to ensure they have all their needed documents. You could even prescreen participants to make sure you can tell them they need these things ready to fill out the form. How much effort are you trying to put into it? What is the cost of capturing that information. You would need to make those decisions. You did give the warning up front. I would probably preload information into this. Asking about my spouse’s income is more of a heavy lift, not everyone will have that handy.
  

Observational/can ask

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

  

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

  

### Task [Step 3 of 7: Household assets] - 10 minutes

Qualitative observations and feedback only

### SUB-TASK A) Household assets

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your household assets, financial assets)
    They all look like there is not. You may be double dipping because you already asked about pension within the income and not you are asking about pension again which could cause confusion.

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### SUB-TASK B) Your real estate assets

  

-   Please click on where it says “Why do I need to provide this information?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    
-   [Testing: satisfaction]
    

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

  

### SUB-TASK C) Your cars or other vehicles

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

-   Please click on where it says “What if I don’t know the estimated value of car or other vehicle?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    Wow you are going down to that level. What if I don’t know the value? It is a little bit invasive, but it makes sense if you are asking for help.
-   Please enter estimates for the amounts.
    

### SUB-TASK D) Your trailers, campers, and boats

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

-   Please enter estimates for the amounts.
    

### SUB-TASK E) Your other assets

  
  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your other assets)
    
Oh wow. The thought that pops into my mind is if you have all this stuff why you have VA debt. Makes sense for them to be on the list. You are trying to get a good profile.
  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

-   Please click on where it says “Why do I need to provide this information?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    

### List loop back button expectation Q & observation task (usability)

  

-   Pause here. If you were to click on the <back button>, where do you expect it would take you?
    

  

-   Now go ahead and click on the back button. Is this what you expected to see?
    

  

### List loop observation task only (no success ratings, only qualitative feedback)

  

Pause here. (at end of household assets section)

  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through for household assets?

  

How are you feeling at this point in the form?

  

Observational/can ask

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

  

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

  

### Task [Step 4 of 7: Household expenses] - 10 minutes

##### Research goal addressed: Is the [new list loop](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/25881) design easy for Veterans to utilize?

  

Task description

  

### SUBTASK A) Your monthly household expenses mini loop

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your other living expenses)
    

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### SUBTASK B) Your monthly utility bills mini loop

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your monthly utility bills)
    
Again, this information is all very easily at my fingertips, but if I was doing this for my dad it would be a different story. 
  
  
  

### [SCREEN NAME: Add a credit card bill]

  

-   Please pause here [Add a credit card bill > enter your card bill’s information].
    

  

Testing [comprehension]

  

-   How would you feel about filling out this section? Would you need anyone to help you with this section?
    
The language is fine. I don’t know if you could rephrase this differently because you are looking for bills that are past due. I have credit card bills, but none of them are past due. Looking at this it is confusing. You are asking specifically what is overdue. The only pieces that are required are unpaid balance and minimum month payment, if I don’t have any. Are you asking. I am going into a loop here. Do I have to put something in here if I don’t have an amount overdue. Credit card bills are different than past due credit card bills. You should ask do you have any credit card bills, what is your unpaid balance, minimum payment, and are you overdue/what is your overdue amount. That flow would make more sense if you worded that way.
  

Testing [satisfaction] - expect that some Veterans may need help with this section

  

-   How would you go about finding this information? What would be your approach to filling out this section? Clarify: would you make estimations, or review receipts?
    

Testing [satisfaction]

  
  

### SUBTASK C) Your installment contracts and other debts

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

-   How would you go about finding this information? What would be your approach to filling out this section? Clarify: would you make estimations, or review receipts?
    You have the same issue here because you are asking for the amount overdue. I would do that a little differently. Ask are you overdue on this account and if yes ask about the amount overdue. 


-   How would you feel about filling out this section? Would you need anyone to help you with this section?
    


### SUBTASK D) Your other living expenses

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through from the start until now?

How are you feeling at this point in the form?
It is a little long, but if I am applying for relief of debt, I expect it.
Was there anything that you were unsure about?

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  Understanding the situation. I feel that the direction of the questions wasn’t intrusive. There are a lot of questions, but I understand the reason why the amount. The main concern I had was the way you asked about credit cards and other debts. Just word it in a way that is clearer. 

— End of List Loop Testing —-

Resolution options comprehension question - 10 minutes

-   What are your thoughts on these options, if any?
    I am going to pick a waiver because I want to waive the debt completely. I imagine most Vets will pick that to get off the hook of paying the debt. I would definitely ask for a waiver on an overpayment because I didn’t ask to be overpaid.
-   Which repayment or relief option would you select? Why?
    

  

# Supporting personal statement

-   What type of information would you include in this section?
    This is where you will lose your audience because you are asking me for all my financial business and now you want a statement on why. You see that I am paying out more in debt than I make in a month. That should be obvious. I would put down something like I don’t make enough money to cover my monthly bills. Again, my thought behind it is I already gave you all the information to show I am not making enough money and I am quickly going into debt. The statement is far too open-ended.

  

### Bankruptcy options question

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### Review page

### Review page usability question

  

What are your impressions of this section?
Going back through all my information and it looks good.
Is there anything that you are unsure about on this page?

Do you have any additional thoughts on this review page?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

### Review page editing usability question

  

[SCREEN NAME: Review page]

  

-   Can you show me what you would do if you wanted to edit a section?
    I would click on the edit button in the blue.
-   If you were given the option to edit your form directly on the review page or go to a separate page, which one would be easiest for you?
    
It is fine as long as you can actually adjust any of the fields. I wouldn’t want to be taken back through the whole process again. That would be nerve whacking. 

-   Can you show me how you would edit your dependents section?
    

  

#### Testing: Usability of editing info from review page

  

## Post-task questions

-   What was your overall experience with the FSR Form like?
    It is sort of challenging from my mobile phone, but definitely is doable. It is a lot of information asked for on the form, but if I am applying for debt relief I understand. Making sure all the Veteran has all their income information, bills, banking information, and credit card information. I know you ask that up front, but maybe you should remind them throughout.
-   What did you like about the form?
    
-   What did you not like about the form?
    
-   What would you change, if anything? Was anything unclear?
    
-   Overall, how difficult or easy was the form to complete?
    

-   1 being very difficult and 7 being very easy.
    

-   How did you feel about the overall length of the form? How would you approach filling out the form in real life, if you wanted to submit it? (in one sitting, with breaks, etc.)
    I am a one sitting kind of guy. I have the form on one page and would be pulling up the information on the other screen to ensure I was capturing the data accurately. I know not everyone would do it my way. 

-   Imagine you submitted your FSR form. What do you think will happen after?
    If memory services, you will get a letter about it stating I completed the form, and it is being reviewed. That is what I would expect. In terms of timeframes on it being reviewed I am a little gun shy I don’t know how long that would take and I am sure it would not go through quickly. Hopefully this does speed up the decision-making process on the VA side.

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?
    

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

  

 Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
