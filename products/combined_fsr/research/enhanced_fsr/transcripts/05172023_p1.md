# Usability & Comprehension Study:

### Conversation Guide Questions

  

Intro/preparation - 7-10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today!

My name is Charlotte and Megan and Joe are taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about your experience with a form called the Financial Status Report Form (FSR). This was previously a paper form you had to fill out by hand, and now a digital version has been created which we are testing today.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about [75 minutes and up to 90 minutes]. I want to be sure we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
    
-   IF USING UXPIN [You'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.]
    
-   We want you to know that what you fill out today is just for this study, and will not affect your VA profile, benefits, or any future form submission.
    
-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
    
-   I want to let you know that I will not be able to answer any questions about the prototype, the form, or VA Debt because we are interested in your unbiased opinions. If you have any questions related to VA debt after this interview, I encourage you to reach out to your VSO.
    
-   Finally, we prefer that you turn on your video for our meeting, only if you are comfortable.
    
-   Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    

-   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
-   If yes: Admit observers.
    
-   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    
-   Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen, the video, and the audio as we talk today? Yup.
    

### Baseline Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a few warm-up questions so that I can get to know you and your experiences with VA debt. This section should take at most 10 minutes.

Background about their service history

  

-   Firstly, if you’re comfortable sharing, could you please tell me briefly about the major parts of your service? (optional question) I served 4 years active duty, my husband was in longer then me. I have dual experience with the military. All my stuff is related to state side issues.
    

  

-   I am going to ask you a few questions about your experiences with VA debt.
    

  

### VA debt experience baseline

  

Moderator memo: could be a small debt amount, or a large one

  

-   What has been your past experience with VA debt? [establish baseline] Honestly it has happened more with my stuff than my husband. I use community care a lot because the VA must refer me out for female care. There is always an issue with whether they did not put in the code correctly, or if the community care does not know how to identify me as a Veteran. It is always up to me to get all this taken care of before they continuously charge me.
What  is community care? It is anything I get see for outside of the VA that they approve me for.
    
-   What are your hopes for having your VA debt resolved? I mean I would just like not to have to do other people’s jobs. I have to do all the things on both sides of the care. I don’t want that sitting on my account. I spend a lot of time on an annual basis.
    
-   What are your expectations for having your VA debt resolved? Every single time I have had this happen in the past it has been resolved it is just time consuming. Sometimes I do not get notified that it was resolved. 
    
-   What experience have you had with filling out forms on VA.gov, if any? [optional] I think besides Urgent Care form, I don’t think I have done any forms on the VA website.
    

  
  

Thank you for answering those questions so completely. Now, we’re going to transition to the part of the interview where I’m going to ask you to fill out a form as you would in real life.

  
  

### Scenario and overall task

Please login to VA.gov using your VA.gov ID.ME login.

  

Once you are logged in, please share your screen on Zoom.

  

[Insert directions here]

  

[Sharing screen instructions as needed]

  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

  

Send direct link for FSR which will go to Wizard

[https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction](https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction)

  

Imagine you have some VA debt that you would like help with.

  

We are going to go through a form and ask you to fill it out, as you would normally. I am going to observe silently, and I will ask you questions at certain times. Also, I will ask you to pause at certain sections and I will ask you follow-up questions.

  

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers, we just want to learn from your experience with this digital form so that we can make improvements.

  

We ask that you think out loud as you are going through and filling out the form. Please comment on anything you like, and anything you don’t like, as well as anything that is clear or unclear.
I guess my first question, if I am direct to this page due to VA debt, not for the overpayment thing, if you’re incorrectly billed for something it feels weird to have to give all the financial information. In my experience typically when I give that information, they either say they do not need to help me, or they are giving me too much help due to my financial standing. I don’t think that is important information in this situation. I have experience with VOC Rehab, and it is like pulling teeth to get help, and if you get a bill saying you owe something that is a huge roadblock for Veterans. It is already hard for Veterans to ask for help so to receive a surprise bill for seeking help it huge. That information seems very invasive, and the average Veteran would get extremely frustrated. I would call the billing office because I have never filled out this kind of paperwork in prior issues. I would just need more information on why everything is out of whack.
What is this form for? It sounds like it is for any type of overpayment or underpayment of a bill. It looks like a roadblock. I don’t have 60 minutes to do this and nor do I want to share all this information. If the VA does not already have this information, then they shouldn’t need this information. There should be two separate forms. I think the wording is weird for the copay part. I don’t know if it varies depending on your rating. Our insurance just covers it. Maybe there should be another page for overpayment and health bills. With the healthcare part there shouldn’t be an appeals area because you wouldn’t be able to be seen if it was not approved by the VA. A  copay bill like this should not exist. I think if the VA is trying to rake money out of Veterans that should be a whole other issue. GI Bill issues is a very different situation. 

Please make estimates on any information you don’t know.

  

Form comprehension questions

[https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction](https://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction)

  

### Screen: [Intro → Wizard]

  

I’m going to ask you to make these selections on this questionnaire -

  

1.  What’s this debt related to? VA disability compensation or VA health care copay bills
    
    

  

[Notice/observe if they skip intro page and ask about it]

  

-   Please pause here and take a moment to read this page.
    

-   Based on what you read, what is the FSR form for?
    

#### Testing: Comprehension

### Screen: FSR intro page with the 7 steps

Info page: [ Request help with VA debt for overpayments and copay bills ]

  

If they read through the page, ask:

  

-   What are your thoughts on this page?
    

  

Testing: Qualitative feedback/ satisfaction

  

Debt Selection Question

Moderator provides direction:

  

Reminder: If silent, [ Please make sure to think out loud, and pause and comment if anything is unclear and if there is anything you especially like. ]

### Sub-Task [Step 1 of 7: Editing contact info]

##### Research goal addressed: Are Veterans able to easily edit their [contact information](https://preview.uxpin.com/552e9ad135f7d7ee943a92576feab45190b069f4#/pages/147887481/comment/no-panels?mode=i) on FSR?

  

-   Please pause here.
    

  

[SCREEN NAME: Contact Information]

  

-   Can you show me how you would edit your mailing address?
    

  

Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary)

  

#### Testing: Usability of editing contact info UI

  

Research question addressed:

-   ##### Do they understand updates will only be applied to their VA profile in all places?
    
It should be updated in my VA profile as well.
  

-   Now that you edited your contact information, where do you think the updates will be applied?
    

  

-   (if confused, clarify: do you think the new contact info you entered will be applied only for this form, or for your VA services in general?)
    

  

Rate each field individually for pass/fail (binary) 
Why does the VA need to know if I have held a job in the last two years. The fact that this is required. The VA already knows what your compensation is, and your education benefits are then they should know if the Veteran could afford that healthcare bill. For the overpayment, I think there would be a process to be able to appeal the issue. Healthcare, I do not think there should be a resolution because that would be on the VA. Most of the people I have interacted with seem to think the Veterans below to them, have some kind of hold of them. VA employees act as if they are some kind of gatekeepers of all the help, we need from them. 

  

[Debt selection]

### Screen: [Debt selection screen]

  
  

-   What do you see here? What would you do here?
    

  

#### Testing: Usability of debt selection UI

### Observational Tasks - usability of list loops

### Task [Step 2 to 7: Household income - Work history]
Caretaker income doesn’t make sense because if they are issued through the VA, they should know that information. That should show up on the previous screen.
### (long task broken into sub-tasks)

##### Research goal addressed: Is the [new list loop](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/25881) design easy for Veterans to utilize?

  

Task description:

  

Researcher note:

Veteran/user should be able to build proficiency as they complete more list loops - look out for areas of confusion

  

-   Observe participants as they fill out each list loop section. Ask them to pause at the end of each major list loop section Step and ask the following questions for qualitative feedback
    

  
  
  

[SCREEN NAME: Household income]

  

### SUB-TASK A) Work history list mini loop

  
  

-   Please fill these pages out as you would in real life
    

  
  

Stop them at Gross monthly income at this job and ask:

  

-   What type of income are you entering here? [Answer: monthly]
    

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (payroll deductions)
    
-   Is there anything you are unsure about?
    
-   [comprehension]
    

  

-   What time period are you using for these payroll deduction estimates?
    

[Answer: monthly]

  

-   How would you feel about having to calculate these monthly payroll deductions?
    

  

-   [Your work history summary screen]
    
-   Take a moment to look at this screen.
    
-   What do you notice on this page? What does this screen mean to you?
    
-   Is anything clear or unclear?
    

  

### SUB-TASK B) Your VA Benefits

  

-   [Keep going]
    

  

### SUB-TASK C) Your other income mini loop

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (Your other income)
    

  

-   Please make any selections here that are relevant to you.
    

  

-   Is there anything you are unsure about?
    

  

-   [comprehension]
    

  

### SUB-TASK D) Spouse’s information mini loop

  

-   Please make selections here
    

  

-   [If this applies to you]
    
-   Is your spouse’s employment/work information something you already know?
    

  
  

### SUB-TASK E) Dependents mini loop

  

Pause here. (at end of Household income loop section)

  
  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through from the start until now?

  

How are you feeling at this point in the form?

  

Observational/can ask

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

  

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

  

### Task [Step 3 of 7: Household assets] - 10 minutes

Qualitative observations and feedback only

### SUB-TASK A) Household assets

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your household assets, financial assets)
    
I don’t know a lot of Veterans receiving alimony, they are typically the ones paying it. Again, technically the VA already knows this information because it would automatically come out of their military retirement. I am not sure if the VA’s compensation can be touched by divorced. 
I would think they would know the age of your dependents. I am not sure if they age out like they do in the military. I think the VA would know some of this information.
Having to list your household assets seems unnecessary. This information is none of their business. That information should not count against them in the decision process. It should be focused on the fact that the VA made an overpayment. That is on the VA to find a resolution instead of putting that on the Veteran. It should be on the person who issued the overpayment to fix the problem. I know plenty of people who would look at that form and let the debt sit there. 

If there was someone who could help with filling out that form, how would you feel? It should be as easy as you input the overpayment, give an explanation, and then submit. Someone would review it and come up with a resolution. You shouldn’t have to dig into the Veteran’s information. Fill out something very simple. Like the first page, you click on what you have an issue with, you explain in a few sentences, and then just give them the option to make a payment or request a dispute. Like credit card companies have you request a dispute and have someone go over it prior to asking for all this extra information. It is just a summary page of the assets. I don’t know any Veteran who will want to share any of this information. 
  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### SUB-TASK B) Your real estate assets

  

-   Please click on where it says “Why do I need to provide this information?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here? Just because you own a property doesn't mean it is worth a whole lot. The government already knows if I own a house or not. If the VA messed up with an overpayment asking all this information is just a lot. Asking for the value of the property, none of this information should hold any bearing on whether the VA fixes an overpayment or a bill. Same with the car thing.
-   [Testing: satisfaction]
    

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

  

### SUB-TASK C) Your cars or other vehicles

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

-   Please click on where it says “What if I don’t know the estimated value of car or other vehicle?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    
-   Please enter estimates for the amounts.
    

### SUB-TASK D) Your trailers, campers, and boats

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

-   Please enter estimates for the amounts.
    

### SUB-TASK E) Your other assets

  
  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your other assets)
    Again, why do I need to share any of this information. If the VA is looking at this and someone is gatekeeping, they would see I own a collectable they would think sell that and pay this bill/overpayment even though they created this issue. Why should they have to guesstimate their values. Why should they have to do all this extra work? VA does not need to know any of this.

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

-   Please click on where it says “Why do I need to provide this information?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    

### List loop back button expectation Q & observation task (usability)

  

-   Pause here. If you were to click on the <back button>, where do you expect it would take you?
    

  

-   Now go ahead and click on the back button. Is this what you expected to see?
    

  

### List loop observation task only (no success ratings, only qualitative feedback)

  

Pause here. (at end of household assets section)

  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through for household assets?

  

How are you feeling at this point in the form?

  

Observational/can ask

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

  

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

  

### Task [Step 4 of 7: Household expenses] - 10 minutes

##### Research goal addressed: Is the [new list loop](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/25881) design easy for Veterans to utilize?

  

Task description

  

### SUBTASK A) Your monthly household expenses mini loop

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your other living expenses)
More of the same. I think the VA needs to be more concerned that they are in a home and not homeless not the mortgage payment. 
    

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### SUBTASK B) Your monthly utility bills mini loop

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your monthly utility bills)
    All this stuff should be under the first page, what is your debt-to-income ratio. All of this is a lot. 

  
  
  

### [SCREEN NAME: Add a credit card bill]

  

-   Please pause here [Add a credit card bill > enter your card bill’s information].
    

  

Testing [comprehension]

  

-   How would you feel about filling out this section? Would you need anyone to help you with this section?
    
Again, why does the VA need to know if I own a credit card and two the minimum monthly payment. Do you want to know what the credit card company has set as the minimum monthly payment? Either you have debt, or you don’t, and anything outside of the VA is responsibility for is none of their business unless they are providing financial counseling. Having that as a resource would be beneficial. 
  How would you go about finding this information out? I would go to my USAA account and somewhere on the page it would tell me, but again that is a lot of extra stuff.

Testing [satisfaction] - expect that some Veterans may need help with this section

  

-   How would you go about finding this information? What would be your approach to filling out this section? Clarify: would you make estimations, or review receipts?
    

Testing [satisfaction]

  
  

### SUBTASK C) Your installment contracts and other debts

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
I feel like the VA does not need to know about this. If I have medical bills or student loans the VA should already know about it. Any of this information should not matter to the VA. All this information I would want to see if I was asking for help from a counselor. If you  are dealing with a debt from the VA, they should focus on that and not on outside debt. 
  What if the VA goes back and reviews our financial situation and decides they want to use it against us in the future in a negative way. I know I don’t trust the VA with this information.

-   How would you go about finding this information? What would be your approach to filling out this section? Clarify: would you make estimations, or review receipts?
    


-   How would you feel about filling out this section? Would you need anyone to help you with this section?
    


### SUBTASK D) Your other living expenses

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
  This is all the stuff you fill out when you are filling out a budget form, unless the VA is concerned about if we are eating enough. 

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through from the start until now?
What exactly does a compromise look like? If they are willing to go for a smaller payment, why would you click on extended monthly payments. This would also be something you would have to have other information whether it was the Veteran’s fault, the school’s fault, or the VA’s fault. I think you also need to explain what a waiver is and how it could affect your future use of the GI Bill. This is why I think the healthcare bill and education overpayments should be two separate forms. There needs to be more hands-on debt counselors to help you with the options. 
When would you feel comfortable asking for a waiver? In the healthcare situation, I would because that is something that can be further looked at whose fault is it that I am getting charged for healthcare that I am entitled to. I don’t think on the healthcare side that copay exists because that is not how the VA works. If you are eligible for care, then you can get it. Sometimes it is as simple as they input the information incorrectly. 
How are you feeling at this point in the form?

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  

— End of List Loop Testing —-

Resolution options comprehension question - 10 minutes

-   What are your thoughts on these options, if any?
    
-   Which repayment or relief option would you select? Why?
    

  

# Supporting personal statement

-   What type of information would you include in this section?
    

  

### Bankruptcy options question

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
That is stuff I would review with a financial counselor, nothing the VA needs to know.
  

### Review page

### Review page usability question

  

What are your impressions of this section? Again, that is all the information I would share with a financial advisor not something I would share with the VA.

Is there anything that you are unsure about on this page?

Do you have any additional thoughts on this review page?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

### Review page editing usability question

  

[SCREEN NAME: Review page]

  

-   Can you show me what you would do if you wanted to edit a section?
    
-   If you were given the option to edit your form directly on the review page or go to a separate page, which one would be easiest for you?
    


-   Can you show me how you would edit your dependents section?
    

  

#### Testing: Usability of editing info from review page

  

## Post-task questions

-   What was your overall experience with the FSR Form like? That was super lengthy. That would take someone well over 60 minutes to just gather that information. So, on top of being lengthy it is all invasive information.
    
-   What did you like about the form?
    
-   What did you not like about the form?
    
-   What would you change, if anything? Was anything unclear? It was easy to work through. None of the pages were super long. If the pages were too long, it is shut off. Functionality was fine.
    
-   Overall, how difficult or easy was the form to complete?
    

-   1 being very difficult and 7 being very easy.
    

-   How did you feel about the overall length of the form? How would you approach filling out the form in real life, if you wanted to submit it? (in one sitting, with breaks, etc.) I think it was too long. I think you should have one for healthcare and one for overpayments. I hate not completing things, so I would do it in one sitting.
    

-   Imagine you submitted your FSR form. What do you think will happen after? I would help if there would be a confirmation page, an email, timeline of process, and contact information provided.
    

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?
    No.

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

  

 Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
