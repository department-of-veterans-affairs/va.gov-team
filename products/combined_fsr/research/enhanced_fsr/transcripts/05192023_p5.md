# Usability & Comprehension Study:

### Conversation Guide Questions

  

Intro/preparation - 7-10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today!

My name is Charlotte and Megan and Joe are taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about your experience with a form called the Financial Status Report Form (FSR). This was previously a paper form you had to fill out by hand, and now a digital version has been created which we are testing today.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about [75 minutes and up to 90 minutes]. I want to be sure we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
    
-   IF USING UXPIN [You'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.]
    
-   We want you to know that what you fill out today is just for this study, and will not affect your VA profile, benefits, or any future form submission.
    
-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
    
-   I want to let you know that I will not be able to answer any questions about the prototype, the form, or VA Debt because we are interested in your unbiased opinions. If you have any questions related to VA debt after this interview, I encourage you to reach out to your VSO.
    
-   Finally, we prefer that you turn on your video for our meeting, only if you are comfortable.
    
-   Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    

-   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
-   If yes: Admit observers.
    
-   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    
-   Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen, the video, and the audio as we talk today?
    *Participant opted not to be recorded*

### Baseline Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a few warm-up questions so that I can get to know you and your experiences with VA debt. This section should take at most 10 minutes.

Background about their service history

  

-   Firstly, if you’re comfortable sharing, could you please tell me briefly about the major parts of your service? (optional question)
    I served for 19 years with the Army National Guard. I was deployed including a deployment to Fort Riley, and I also had two deployments in Iraq. I also have support for Homeland Security in Fort Bliss in Texas. I have about 7 years in the active side.

  

-   I am going to ask you a few questions about your experiences with VA debt.
    

  

### VA debt experience baseline

  

Moderator memo: could be a small debt amount, or a large one

  

-   What has been your past experience with VA debt? [establish baseline]
    VA debt, my past experience, could you explain more? When you say overpayment, you mean a Veteran paying more than what is due? I have never received a notification from the VA directly because I am part of the lowest part of the VA. I have notified them I was experiencing hardships for VA payments I owed. I was at a hospital recently and asked for medication refill, but it was a small quality refill and they sent me the wrong medication in the mail, and I will now be charged for medication I will never used because I did not request it. VA is charging me for everything that I receive. I am sure that other Veterans have experience with the same thing, but having to pay for something I didn’t order it is going to take my time to get that reversed. That is some of the debt I am experiencing. Some of it is service level for seeing a specialist. I was referred to an outside provider and there was no resolution. Once again, I would have been charged for those visits. I am just reflecting back on those visits now that I am in this session. 
-   What are your hopes for having your VA debt resolved?
    I don’t know what will happen. I have the option to ask for debt relief for some of the debt, but on the same note there doesn’t seem to be a one-person solution for this issue. There isn’t a representative to talk to about my concern. Part of it is my fault because I have not done my part to file for disability rating.
How did you find out about debt relief? 
The VA billing office told me about it, and I have done some research on my own.
-   What are your expectations for having your VA debt resolved?
    
-   What experience have you had with filling out forms on VA.gov, if any? [optional]
    

  
  

Thank you for answering those questions so completely. Now, we’re going to transition to the part of the interview where I’m going to ask you to fill out a form as you would in real life.

Task description:

  

Researcher note:

Veteran/user should be able to build proficiency as they complete more list loops - look out for areas of confusion

  

-   Observe participants as they fill out each list loop section. Ask them to pause at the end of each major list loop section Step and ask the following questions for qualitative feedback
    

  
  
  

[SCREEN NAME: Household income]

  

### SUB-TASK A) Work history list mini loop

  
  

-   Please fill these pages out as you would in real life
    

  
  

Stop them at Gross monthly income at this job and ask:

  

-   What type of income are you entering here? [Answer: monthly]
    

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (payroll deductions)
    There are some people that receive irregular income or are unwilling to release some of this information. VA will ask for this information from the federal government to verify this information. If that is not accurate, they will pull that information from the government. The person would answer this as they want to answer it. Currently none of these apply to me.
-   Is there anything you are unsure about?
    
-   [comprehension]
    

  

-   What time period are you using for these payroll deduction estimates?
    

[Answer: monthly]

  

-   How would you feel about having to calculate these monthly payroll deductions?
    

  

-   [Your work history summary screen]
    
-   Take a moment to look at this screen.
    
-   What do you notice on this page? What does this screen mean to you?
    
-   Is anything clear or unclear?
    

  

### SUB-TASK B) Your VA Benefits

  

-   [Keep going]
    

  

### SUB-TASK C) Your other income mini loop

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (Your other income)
    

  

-   Please make any selections here that are relevant to you.
    

  

-   Is there anything you are unsure about?
    

  

-   [comprehension]
    

  

### SUB-TASK D) Spouse’s information mini loop

  

-   Please make selections here

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through from the start until now?

  

How are you feeling at this point in the form?

  

Observational/can ask

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

  

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

  

### Task [Step 3 of 7: Household assets] - 10 minutes

Qualitative observations and feedback only

### SUB-TASK A) Household assets

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your household assets, financial assets)
    
I have an account and a 401k but. I guess my thought is VA is acting as a, instead of servicing the Veteran they also want the Veteran to pay for services not being received. They want to know the amount of money in each account, why you are supposed to be servicing the Veteran. We have a high suicide rate in the Veteran population, but the VA is supposed to service us where does my assets come into play for servicing me? When did I have to start releasing all this information to the VA to help me with my VA debt. The paper form did not ask me these many questions.
  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### SUB-TASK B) Your real estate assets

  

-   Please click on where it says “Why do I need to provide this information?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    
-   [Testing: satisfaction]
    

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

  

### SUB-TASK C) Your cars or other vehicles

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

-   Please click on where it says “What if I don’t know the estimated value of car or other vehicle?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    I don’t have a big opinion on it expect I am not an owner of any of these items. This statement will never be in the Veteran’s best interest, but it will be in the best interest of the VA and government. They will send it off to collection and offset your return. Any debt we get from the federal government will never be on the Veteran’s side. That has been my experience because it is all about money.
-   Please enter estimates for the amounts.
    

### SUB-TASK D) Your trailers, campers, and boats

-   Please make a selection here. (yes or no)
    

-   Please enter estimates for the amounts.
    

### SUB-TASK E) Your other assets

  
  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your other assets)
    
This does not apply to me, but if a Veteran does own one of these the government is not tracking this information. They would only know if you told them. VA says they want to know the big picture, they are not wanting to work with you. They don’t want to work with you to help you.
  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

-   Please click on where it says “Why do I need to provide this information?”
    
-   What are your thoughts on what it says here?
    

### List loop back button expectation Q & observation task (usability)

  

-   Pause here. If you were to click on the <back button>, where do you expect it would take you?
    

  

-   Now go ahead and click on the back button. Is this what you expected to see?
    

  

### List loop observation task only (no success ratings, only qualitative feedback)

  

Pause here. (at end of household assets section)

  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

Task description

  

### SUBTASK A) Your monthly household expenses mini loop

  

-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your other living expenses)
    

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### SUBTASK B) Your monthly utility bills mini loop

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
-   What are your thoughts on the items on this list? (your monthly utility bills)
    
It is like what I was stating above. They are only interested in your income and what is going out. What is preventing you from paying this bill. The VA is not concerned about helping the Veteran. How can a Veteran receive care with solving the issue. They just want to see where you sit after paying your bills.
What does this page mean to you?

This is an example of what I am providing.
  
  
  

### [SCREEN NAME: Add a credit card bill]

  

-   Please pause here [Add a credit card bill > enter your card bill’s information].
    

  

Testing [comprehension]

Testing [satisfaction] - expect that some Veterans may need help with this section

  

-   How would you go about finding this information? What would be your approach to filling out this section? Clarify: would you make estimations, or review receipts?
    

Testing [satisfaction]

  
  

### SUBTASK C) Your installment contracts and other debts

  

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
My thoughts in general are that the VA says it would take 60 minutes to complete this form. For someone who has all their information available and organized I don’t know. 
  

-   How would you go about finding this information? What would be your approach to filling out this section? Clarify: would you make estimations, or review receipts?
    I would have to look this information up, and I think for most Veterans it would be. This would take a couple hours to complete this form with accurate information. I don’t know if the older Veterans would want to even start this application. 
I would want to do this in one sitting, but the VA is going to want proof. 
Is this a form you would consider filling out or not at all?
I don’t think it is going to solve the issue because the VA is going to receive their own information from the IRS. So, this would be a waste of time.

-   How would you feel about filling out this section? Would you need anyone to help you with this section?
    


### SUBTASK D) Your other living expenses

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    
  

END OF SECTION/CHAPTER SATISFACTION FEEDBACK

What are your thoughts on this section we just went through from the start until now?

How are you feeling at this point in the form?

Was there anything that you were unsure about?

Do you have any additional thoughts on this section?

  

— End of List Loop Testing —-

Resolution options comprehension question - 10 minutes

-   What are your thoughts on these options, if any?
    I am familiar with these options. I am currently behind on VA debt and not able to pay on time. It is a two-fold situation, one I have applied for disability which would offset some of these expenses. Right now, how much could pay to make this right, I would be able to pay $100 to pay off this bill. In the past the waiver option was not available to me.
-   Which repayment or relief option would you select? Why?
    

  

# Supporting personal statement

-   What type of information would you include in this section?
I will explain the situation. I would be upfront to the point where I have been seen multiple times with providers and they would not come up with a resolution of the issue.  Once there was a continuous issue with that problem to help resolve the issue  by seeing a nurse practitioner. I needed to receive care through an outside provider due to the multiple visits not helping me get a resolution.    

  

### Bankruptcy options question

-   Please make a selection that is relevant to you.
    

  

### Review page

### Review page usability question

  

What are your impressions of this section?
I see a lot of dropdown fields to verify the information that I have put in.
Is there anything that you are unsure about on this page?

Do you have any additional thoughts on this review page?

  

[Testing: satisfaction]

### Review page editing usability question

  

[SCREEN NAME: Review page]

  

-   Can you show me what you would do if you wanted to edit a section?
    
-   If you were given the option to edit your form directly on the review page or go to a separate page, which one would be easiest for you?
    


-   Can you show me how you would edit your dependents section?
    

  

#### Testing: Usability of editing info from review page

  

## Post-task questions

-   What was your overall experience with the FSR Form like?
    The actual form is straightforward and simplified. The ease of use is okay. I would prefer a website over a paper form. I would consider coming back in a week or so to revisit this form to resolve my debt. I would probably need a refresher to get back to this page.
How did you feel about the length of the form?
It was not too long, maybe just the right length. Just ask for monthly gross income and what are your living expenses at this time. They are more concerned about the assets you have. If it was more simplified and user friendly. How does my lifestyle come into play when you are talking about other debts I have to fulfill at this time.
-   What did you like about the form?
    
-   What did you not like about the form?
    
-   What would you change, if anything? Was anything unclear?
    
-   Overall, how difficult or easy was the form to complete?
    

-   1 being very difficult and 7 being very easy.
    

-   How did you feel about the overall length of the form? How would you approach filling out the form in real life, if you wanted to submit it? (in one sitting, with breaks, etc.)
    

-   Imagine you submitted your FSR form. What do you think will happen after?
It would go to VA directly and then the VA will pull their own records to see how truthful you’ve been answering the questions.
    

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?
    

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

  

 Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
