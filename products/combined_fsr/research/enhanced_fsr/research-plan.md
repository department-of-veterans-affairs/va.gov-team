# Research Plan for The Debt Resolution Team (Benefits Team 2), Enhanced Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655)

## Background

There are multiple resolution pathways a Veteran can select when resolving their benefit debt and now copay payments, including: requesting an extended payment plan, submitting a compromise offer, or asking for a waiver. All of these options require the submission of a Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655), which captures a monthly snapshot of the Veteran's household income and expenses. Veterans often struggle to include all the information needed to accurately represent their financial situation, including duplicating information.

The Enhanced FSR addresses issues that were mainly found during the last usability study and since the initial VBA launch on November 16, 2021 include the following:

-   Switching from card format to a more minimalist and easy to understand format when presenting debt/copay bills to users.  
    -   [Select debt/copay: after | before](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr/images/debt-cards-update.png?raw=true)
    
-   Allow Veterans to update phone number and address in addition to mailing address.  
    -   [Contact info: after | before](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr/images/contact-info-update.png?raw=true)
    
-   Improvements were made to list loops as the previous usability study showcased how Veterans had difficulty utilizing the list loop when it was presented as a dropdown. The updates also address accessibility issues that the dropdown version of the list loop had. List loops appear when entering employment and other income for themselves and their spouse, dependents, household assets, household expenses.

-   Ensure resolution options are easier for Veterans to understand.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports these main [OCTO objectives and goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans can manage their health services online
    
-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
    
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
    

This research supports increasing these measures:

-   Usage of digital, self-service tools
    
-   Number of VA.gov users as a function of total Veteran population
    

This research supports decreasing these measures:

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

Debt can happen at any stage in [the Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) after the ‘Getting out’ stage. However, certain types of debt, such as Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, is more likely to occur at the ‘Finding something to do’ stage.

Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

- **Confirm that enhanced FSR updates are easy to use:**
	-   Are Veterans able to easily edit their contact information on FSR?

	-   Are Veterans able to easily select a debt/copay bill?

	-   Are Veterans able to update their VA Benefits information?
    
	-   Do Veterans understand the resolution options?
    
	-   **Is the [new list & loop](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/25881) design easy for Veterans to utilize?**
    
		##### Definition: List loops as we are defining them:

		The selection process by which a Veteran selects sub-categories of an overall category and sees screens that reflect their selection.

### Secondary research goals:

-   Understand Veterans subjective experience with the form and the amount of effort (satisfaction)

-   Veterans feel confident and comfortable with the form (subjective experience)

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

1.  Confirm updates made to FSR (debt/copay selection, contact information update, VA benefit editing, list & loop pattern) are easy to use and ready for release.
    
2.  Compile a new list of possible updates for future iterations of FSR.

### Research questions
*Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:*
- *What will I do with what I learn from this question?*
- *Does this question serve the goals of my study?*
- *Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)*

1.  Do Veterans know what this form is for – do they understand it is for benefits overpayment and medical copays?  (comprehension)
    
2.  Do Veterans understand each resolution option? (comprehension)
    
3.  What do Veterans expect to happen after they submit/complete their request? (comprehension)
    	-   What communications do Veterans expect to receive about their request?

4.  Do Veterans understand what assets and expenses to include in each section? (comprehension)
    	-   Does clarifying content in the “Real Estate” and “Vehicle” section help Veterans understand what kind of property and vehicles to include?
    
5.  How understandable is the new list loop format, UI, and UX? (usability)
    	-   How learnable is it?
    
	-   What do Veterans think of the options (presented as checkmarks) on the new list loop?
    
	-   Are Veterans able to add custom items using the “Add additional …” action link?
    
6.  How understandable are other non-list loop specific changes (contact info, resolution options)? (usability)

7.  How do Veterans feel about the amount of effort this form requires? (satisfaction)
    
	-   Are Veterans overwhelmed by the amount of pages on this form?

### Hypothesis
*What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.*

**Assumptions**: 
- They have co-pay or benefit overpayment debt or both 
- They need/want to fill out the FSR form because of financial need/hardship
- They are already engaged with the VA in some form (receiving care from VHA,receiving benefits VBA)

Primary Hypothesis

Veterans will be able to easily understand and fill out the form given the new list & loop pattern, be able to edit their contact information, view and edit their VA benefits, and easily view and understand the resolution options. 

Secondary Hypothesis

The enhanced FSR format and language will be easy to digest, and most will be able to fill out the form independently (accessibility). 


## Method	
*Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.*

This moderated usability study will be conducted remotely via Zoom with some participants that are sighted, visually impaired, and use assistive technology.

### Location

Remote - on Zoom. 

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

## Recruitment	

We are aiming to have at least **6** Veteran participants complete usability testing sessions. We will recruit double, to account for no shows. We will be asking Perigean to recruit **12** participants.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 
    
-   All participants must be Veterans
    
-   All have a computer or smartphone and be willing to be complete their session on one of those devices
    
	-   During the session, be willing to share a web browser window on their device
    
	-   Have a working microphone on their device
    
	-   Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen

-   [6 of 12 of participants should complete the session on a smartphone.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125614/#:~:text=The%20rate%20of%20smartphone%20ownership,low%20levels%20of%20current%20engagement.)
    
-   6 of 12 of participants should complete the session on a desktop computer.
    
-   #### All participants must be LOA3 (identity verified) on VA.gov. Participants will likely not know what this means, so please confirm this prior to testing. This can be confirmed by having users sign into VA.gov and having them go to the VA.gov profile. If they are prompted to verify their identity, that means they are LOA1 and they are not suitable for testing. If they can see the profile, they are LOA3 and can participate in testing.
    
-   #### All participants must be comfortable providing the email address they use to sign into VA.gov. We need this information 2-3 days before the study begins in order to give participants access to the tool in production.
    
- **Participants should have either:**

	-   **At least 1 unpaid medical copay within the last 6 months** AND/OR
    
	-   **Unpaid VA debt (overpayment) that has occurred anytime**

-   While the FSR asks for financial information, we won't be asking our participants to provide exact financial information. However, we want to simulate a real experience as much as we can to ensure the experience is intuitive for Veterans.  
    Please confirm participants are comfortable providing an estimate of financial figures such as their monthly household income and expenses.
    

#### Demographic must-haves
Recruiting for this study will prioritize inclusivity. We aim to highlight voices that have been underrepresented and excluded in qualitative research, thus we will be using maximum variation sampling (MVS). Moreover, we will be recruiting users to account for edge cases in usability.

Note: The following demographic criteria is our goal, but we understand that historically it's been challenging to recruit participants with VA debt.

-   At least 2 of 12 people who use a assistive technology (screen reader)

-   [At least 5 of 12 people must identify as having a cognitive consideration](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2016/demo/Holder-2016-01.pdf)  
    
-   [At least 5 of 12 people must identify as Black, Hispanic, Biracial, Asian, Native](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHEQUITY/Race_Ethnicity.asp)
    
-   [At least 5 of 12 people must identify as women](https://www.womenshealth.va.gov/womenshealth/latestinformation/facts.asp#:~:text=Women%20Veterans%20Health%20Care,-Facts%20and%20Statistics&text=The%20current%20projected%20percentage%20of,years%20for%20their%20male%20counterparts.)

-   At least 4 of 12 people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender
    
-   [At least 3 of 12 people are without a degree or professional certificate](https://www.luminafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/veterans-without-degrees.pdf)
        
-   [At least 6 of 12 people are over 55](https://www.va.gov/VETDATA/docs/SurveysAndStudies/VETPOP.pdf)
     

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)

-   At least 3 of 12 people who live in a rural or remote area
    
## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

**Desired timeline: begin moderating sessions 4/26/2023 - 5/4/2023**

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
-   Pilot participant email: We will contact a VA employee who is a Veteran.
  
-   Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
**Planned dates of research: begin moderating sessions 4/26/2023 - 5/5/2023**

### Length of sessions

-   Session length: 60 minutes
    
-   Buffer time between sessions: 60 minutes 

-   Max number of sessions per day: 2

### Kickoff Call with Perigean: Availability

Friday 4/7/23: window 8am PT / 11am ET - 12pm PT / 3pm ET, 

Monday 4/10: window 1pm PT / 4pm ET - 2pm PT / 5pm ET

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 participants recruited, 18 time slots available, for 6 participants minimum***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
