## Debt Portal: Medallia Survey, Qualitative Feedback Analysis

Data from: 10/1/23 - 10/16/23

**Summary**

A qualitative analysis of Veterans answers to the questions ***Why did you select that rating?*** (VA.gov experience) and ***What task were you trying to do today?*** was performed for the first 200 Veteran responses from October 1 - October 16, 2023.

**The top 3 concerns described by Veterans:**

1.  Issues with **bill findability**. Veterans cited they were unable to find the bill amount on the portal. Some also cited inconsistencies between bills received in the mail and bills online. 
    
2.  Not understanding **why they received an email from the VA**. Not understanding where does this  debt come from. Not finding a message or statement related to the email they received and what they could find in the portal. 
    
3. A desire to see a **detailed statement** with details on the charges, not just the charge amounts.

Additional issues and concerns by a smaller number of Veterans:

*-   Sign in difficulty*

*-   The experience is not friendly for older Veterans (n = 2)*

*-   More difficult than in the past (n=1)*

**Veteran Qualitative Feedback** 
**1. Bill Findability**

> *Signed on, got code via text and could never find where to check my account balance.* (10/19/23)
>     
> *I need paper billing sent to me so that I can scan it and get reimbursed by my insurance.* (10/16/23)
>     
> *Can't find bill online. must wait for delivery of bill from USPS. How silly is that?* (10/16/23)
>     
> *This is crazy. I know I have an amount due to the VA for copays but I cannot see how much it is for under MyhealthyVet and I cannot see it when I go to pay at pay.gov. Your system is so unorganized and
complex. I simply just want to see how much I owe and pay it and there is not a way to do this. You have to go through three different systems.* (10/13/23)
>     
> *I haven't been able to find anywhere a bill for my copays that actually tells me what I owe.* (10/12/23)
> 
>  *How can I do something about my debt if it's hidden away where I can't see it? Nothing shows me what the debt amount is. I have been charged for disability related medications before.. so I have to see what I am being charged.* (10/2/23)
>     
> *I finally received my bill in the mail informing me what the 39 dollar payment was for since I could not view my bill on your website will not pay a bill unless I know what it is for never received a online bill.* (10/1/23)

**2. 'Why did you email me/where does this debt come from?'**

> *The message from the VA inducing me to make this contact was needlessly frightening. I thought that I had somehow incurred a huge debt.* (10/20/23)
>     
>  *Signed in in response to an email. Today is 10/19/2023 and it says it is updated as of 10/21/2023. Get the data right or don't solicit
> veterans to sign in.* (10/19/23)
>     
> *You sent me this link and nothing more. I donâ€™t as far as I know.* (10/15/23)
>     
>*I don't know! YOU contacted ME! This 'process' is bureaucratic lunacy. You put me through 20 minutes of multiphase 'verification' codes and I still don't know what the hell you messaged me for!*  (10/15/23)
>     
> *You sent me a message that you had important information for me to find on your website. Logged in, cannot find any messages or  information. Why is this so complicated? Just send me an email or text message.* (10/15/23)
>     
> *Not sure how any of this applies to me. Why did I receive this email?* (10/14/23)
>     
> *Follow Up on the information in the email. There's no statement of a debt.* (10/14/23)
>     
> *I pay all my bills monthly and have no debt with the VA. I find this intimidating and a form of elder abuse by the government.*  (10/14/23)
>     
>  *Got an email that said, "You have information available from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Please sign in to https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/ to view details." But I didn't find  any information and I don't know what I am supposed to be looking for. This is VERY confusing. (10/6/23)*

**3. A desire to see a statement/ detailed charges**

> *Actually see what the charges are for. All it shows is an amount with no explanation. Not a helpful site. (10/16/23)*
>     
> *See the current statement for my co-pay. Not just the balance, but an actual copy of the statement that will be sent to me later this month.
> (10/16/23)*
>     
> *I don't need this reminder every month about my V.A. bill. Just send me a statement like you have done for years and I will pay my bill. VA is the one that stopped sending statements for whatever reason. That's why I didn't make any payments for several months. When I called VA I was told if I didn't get a statement, I don't owe anything. You need to straighten out your system. (10/13/23) I normally receive my statement in the mail. Today I receive an Email stating I owe $103.00 with no explanation, more or less indicating I am delinquent. (10/11/23)*
>     
> *Received email notice and online instructions to PAY A BILL for which I have received NO BILL via POSTAL MAIL. I received an email "notice
> to pay" on 7 October 2023, for a STATEMENT (future) DATE OF 9 October  2023, and NOTHING, NO BILL via mail. IT'S ANNOYING. Additionally, VA
> is billing me in OCTOBER for an AUGUST event. (10/11/23)*
>     
> *I want to easily see my current Statement which reflects the amount of my monthly copay. (10/10/23)*

**Additional Feedback
Sign in difficulties**

> *Log on. I couldn't accomplish this due to the complex and confusing identity requirements. I can get on to the my health vet website just
> fine but not the VA debt site.* (10/11/23)
>     
> *Creating an account and being able to sign in using LOGIN.GOV was a nightmare. I wasted half an hour doing what should have taken 2
> minutes.* RIDICULOUS. (10/19/23)
>     
> *I can never remember my password because I have too many passwords for too many programs and it is more work than it is worth to me to
> sign in.* (10/16/23)

**Not friendly for older Vets (n = 2)**

> *I think you are trying to chase older vets away.*(10/9/23)

**More difficult than in the past (n = 1)**

> *More complicated than in the past. Before I received a simple statement telling how much I owed. It was a simple matter of signing in and setting up payments. Now there is so much information I have to scan through that has nothing to do with my co-pay.* (10/19/23)

**To Consider**
-  Findability study or navigation study to address the findability of bills.
    
-  Re-working the outreach email to be more trauma informed.
