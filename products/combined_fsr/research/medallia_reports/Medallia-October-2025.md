## *Data time span: October 1 \- 31, 2025*

Responses (surveys) received: 438

# **Standard Medallia Survey Data on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)** 

Veterans currently submit regular feedback about their [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) experience while visiting the site through [two different surveys.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/accessing-and-utilizing-contact-center-data#AccessingandUtilizingContactCenterData-WhattoDoWiththeData) 

This portion of the report analyzes the two open field text responses gathered from these two surveys.

1. **Medallia Feedback Survey:** Accessed by clicking the blue ‘feedback’ button located at the bottom of most [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) pages. In reports this is known as `VA.gov VFS Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks, “What task were you trying to do today?”  
      
2. **Medallia Intercept Survey:** Randomly intercepts 5% of [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) visitors who have had a 20-second or more session.  In reports this is known as `VA.gov A11 Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks, “Why did you select that rating?”

All survey responses analyzed here are from respondents who visited and referenced pages in any part of the /manage-va-debt/ experience.

The following section aggregates the themes from the two above open text field questions.

## **Most responses convey a high level of general satisfaction with site usability and information accessibility.  Many say that it is easy and they find what they need.**

*89 responses*

* "Information easy to find, accurate. Site functions quickly"
* "The website is functional and easy to navigate. Reviewing upcoming and past appointments for my calculations on timeframes since I've been treated has been easier than I expected. My whole experience with the VA has been affirming and far better than I expected. This includes VA.gov which I understand is separate from my care providers. I have no notes. Everyone has been so helpful that I'm actually kind of overwhelmed and overcome with gratitude about it. I know some vets have a hard time with getting their care or long wait times and stuff but that hasn't been my experience. I know that's not related to the website, but it's a totality of experience for me. At my civilian doctor's office before I enrolled in VA care, their patient portal was unresponsive and sometimes confusing. The VA resources have been stellar in my opinion and by comparison with what I've experienced from civilian healthcare. Thank you!"

### **Findability**
* "I would like to see a more detail of my debt review. I see what I owe and how much I'm paying off but I don't see the over all debt that I did owed and how much I currently paid off or when I made those payments. Unless it's there somewhere, it which case, it needs to be easier to find."
* "I WANT TO PAY MY VA DEBT, BUT I AM UNABLE TO FIND THE NUMBERS ON THE FORM. SINCE THE VA ALREADY KNOWS I NEED TO PAY THIS DEBT, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE PROCESS HAS TO BE SO DIFFICULT"
* "Difficult finding info i want on community care.  I also saw that there are coopay based on tiers, where do i find pout what tier i'm in? ..."



*12 responses*

### **Not current/updated enough**

* "The Copay subtitle states: "Updated on October 5, 2025. Payments after this date will not be reflected here."  It doesn't give me any information as to where the updated online information can be found."
* "VA does not post payment when made"
* "Easy to sign in & navigate. I paid for a recent subscription through the recommended website but the payment does not show, I called VA & told not to worry as this is a common issue?"
* "most of it's good. however, the co-payment statements are a month behind. I always pay my co-payment when I receive it. I paid September bill on the 7th and balance shows I still owe the full amount.  I don't need this added stress."
* "The website never seems to have up to date or accurate information about my copay debts or claims which resulted in a delay in recieving my benefits at discharge and now is showing a copay that has been paid."
* "Where is my August and September bills?"
* "Because this copay bill was paid on the 2nd of October 2025. Paid using my USAA credit card.  USAA shows it paid.  Your representative who took this information failed to send me an email showing the confirmation number on the same date.  Plus my balance $140 and you're showing $148 plus change owed.  You're showing it unpaid.  And at eighty-two years old I shouldn't be going through this upset because your end failed to do their job. That's the reason I gave a very poor grade."

### **Other specific comments on Debt Portal**
* "Going through 5 or 6 pages to view and pay a co-pay bill is just plain stupid."
* "pay.gov site is ridiculous.  Why make the individual leave the va.gov site and fill out a completely separate form to make a VA copay?  Get with the program and make this more simple."
* "It seems impossible to get ANY information on how my "debt" is calculated, there is NO ability to get payment history on this website. How on earth does this allow veterans to track if the government is calculating the correct amount of debt if I can't see a repayment history and I have no clue how much is being applied each month. It's almost like you want to make it IMOSSIBLE for vets to be able to make sure the government isn't taking their money"
* "status update of debt relief inquiry not visible"



*27 responses*
### **Service design**
Comments outside of VA.gov
* "Recent VA hospital stay was overall above average."
* "No one will speak to me because I am not a fudicuary but I have POA of my dad. I can't get ant resolution and they cut off his benifits. Now they say hes was over paid and her wasn't. There has been an error within the VA. I did means paperwork for my dad back in 2021 0r 2022. There shouldn't be any problem. I would love a phone call back asap [redacted]."
* "I have received an email that I had to verify my enrollment but none of the hotlines are working because of the shut down."
* "I just got my VA rating not long ago and informed you guys that I was going to be on active status until November, yet I was paid for October. I thought someone made a comment on my file noting this. Now we're in a government shutdown and I'm having to worry about this on top of everything else?"
* "No change to claim filed on 3 sept. I also never received any letters from the same claims filed 28 June and 8 Aug that were closed/denied. Was told and tried to re-add my dependants changes/updates via phone. I was later told that I wasn't allowed to do that. This issue I have been working to correct since 27 June."
* "Difficult finding info i want on community care.  I also saw that there are coopay based on tiers, where do i find pout what tier i'm in?  I delayed using va because of all the bad stories! I have been denied services at American lake due to lack of capacity and offered community care.  Now it has been two months and 2 or the 3 Referals the doctor wrote the va says they never recieved. This disposer me talking to the va and the provider numerous times and refacing the Referal numerous times.  So far the reasons I avoided the Va are all proving to be true.  Also I am on hold for 1 to 1.5 hours with VA every time I call."
* "The VA closes an appeal with no information as to their decision. Veterans at people waiting to know and understand what going on with their claims. Why keep them waiting."
* "It is very difficult getting my claims approved to the point it is causing me mental health and suicidalthoughts. Claims that should be approved without question."


* A few Veterans had issues preventing overpayments
  * "I just got my VA rating not long ago and informed you guys that I was going to be on active status until November, yet I was paid for October. I thought someone made a comment on my file noting this. Now we're in a government shutdown and I'm having to worry about this on top of everything else?"
  * "No change to claim filed on 3 sept. I also never received any letters from the same claims filed 28 June and 8 Aug that were closed/denied. Was told and tried to re-add my dependants changes/updates via phone. I was later told that I wasn't allowed to do that. This issue I have been working to correct since 27 June."
  * "Dealing with a VA debt that is a result of the new military service reporting the VA is using to cut off benefits. I retired just after I came off my last set of orders with the Air National Guard. The VA turned off my benefits when I went on those orders but never received notice from the national guard that I came off those orders so my benefits have still been off to this day. This is a change from past practices. In the past the VA would get a report at the end of the year of all military days worked throughout the previous year and subsequently withhold benefits for that many days."

# **Custom Financial Management Medallia Survey for Financial Status Report (VA form 5655\)** 

In addition to the two standard surveys, the Financial Management Team has created a custom survey to monitor the experience for VA form 5655, a financial status report form, which a Veteran submits to request help with VA debt for overpayments and bills.

To access the custom survey, Veterans first complete and submit the [Financial Status Report (5655)](http://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction). On the confirmation page, Veterans may click on a blue “Provide feedback” button to access the survey, which consists of four questions. Responses are optional. In reports this is known as `VA.gov Debt Portal Questionnaire`.

#### **Form improvements**

* "So im not sure why but theres an option to do the pdf seperately so i spend a couple hours filling it out only to have to resubmit all the information in the request online becasue there is no where to just submit the form itself. it really frustrates me as the same thing happened in my VA claim."

#### **Status**
