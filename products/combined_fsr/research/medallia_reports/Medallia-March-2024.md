## Medallia Feedback: March 2024


## Debt Portal Feedback

Notable events that may impact current and future feedback: 
- Copay email copy was updated on **02/14/2024**. Copay emails were suspended on **2/21/24**.
- Authenticated landing page was previously shown after users logged in to the Debt Portal. This repeated information users saw right before they logged in. After a Platform update, the link from the authenticated landing page to the Debt Portal Summary page was easy to miss. This may result in comments stating that they cannot find information related to copay and overpayments. We hypothesize that the number of comments. related to findability will decrease after the authenticated landing page was removed from being shown after logging in on **03/28/2024**.

69 Veterans left feedback on the debt portal pages in March 2024.

*The majority of challenges described include:*


**1.  Debt Letters are not available and wanting more information about their debt**

> Paying off a debt is so confusing, and there are no debt letters available to me.

> I understand how much I owe, but I would like the math emailed to me. How did it get over 20,000?

> To see my current debt, current amount being deducted from my pay, a list of past deduction transactions and balances after the deductions, my time left to pay and monthly amount.

> I have a Debt listed, but when I select to view debt letters the system states that I don't have any debt letters. I was trying to view the information to adequately budget and cannot due to system limitations.

> Inquiry about an unknown debt. Noticed my disability changed so I logged in to see why. DMC not answering during listed hours and my alleged debt letter is "missing". WTF over? You can't just send snail mail of this importance and hope an pray it was received AND forget to upload a copy to your website AND not answer the damned phone during your own listed hours.

> Find out why I am being asked to pay the VA money. Does this happen to all veterans? Like when I was told I had 36 months of GI bill and was then I had to get a student loan? I am a disabled Native American veteran. Can't I get some help?

**2.  Complicated path to pay (includes Pay.gov)**

> Feels like a somewhat convoluted system to simply check co-pay balance amount

> I was trying to pay my VA CoPay bill and you folks send me to the Pay.gov website which is awful and ridiculously frustrating. Here is the feedback I sent to them as follows: "WHY do you make it so difficult, complicated and annoying just to pay a VA Co-Pay bill??? All the 5 boxes for a very long Account number is RIDICULOUS! And, after filling-in a box for the Account #, then you have to hit the "Tab" button (on my laptop) in order to move to the next box, RIDICULOUS! And then do that 4 more times. RIDICULOUS! This could be automated and save your users some time and frustration! So many websites out there make it so easy for their customers to pay their bills online in just a few seconds. You people make it a real hassle and frustrating experience to use your website for paying. RIDICULOUS, HOW MANY TIMES DOES THIS NEED TO BE SAID??" Now, VA, please make it easier for your veterans to simply login to VA and easily, simply and w/o frustration pay our bills? That should not be too much to ask!!

**3.  Desire to see details on copays and overpayments**

> I am trying to see (download or see a copy of my monthly co-pays. It is impossible to navigate the new system to find out what I owe, and what payments were made last month.
*(Comment made on landing page)* 

>Trying to see how much I have been paying monthly towards my debt. View a statement of some type for my debt. Maybe if there was some type of way to view activity on the debt account on the site.
*(Comment made on landing page)* 

>To see my current debt, current amount being deducted from my pay, a list of past deduction transactions and balances after the deductions, my time left to pay and monthly amount. 
*(Comment made on overpayment summary page)*

> I wanted to confirm that I don't have any outstanding co-payments. Why can't there be a link showing copays with dates billed and dates paid?? This whole site is incredibly cumbersome to navigate.
 (Comment made on summary page) 


**4.  Payment update discrepancy (an issue described in previous reports)**

> Most recent co-pay balance has not been updated since Jan 5, 2024

> I'm checking on the account balance of my CoPay which still shows a balance due from Jan. 3, which I have paid. When is this going to be updated??? What does it take for someone just make the correction??? How long must someone wait???

> I wanted to review my copay balance that I had paid in Jan., still no updated amount has been posted. This is unreasonable to have NO change now for there month. What does it take for someone to update this????
