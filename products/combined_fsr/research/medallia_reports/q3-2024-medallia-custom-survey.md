**Responses total: 152**

**Everything is fine, no suggestions**

Approximately 63 Responses 

Most responses included "None" and "N/A".

>"None, the changes that were made from the previous time I requested assistant make it easier to file a claim."

>"I would not change a thing. The form is extremely easy to fill out and provides the necessary feedback, if required, to direct the applicant in the right direction. The form also lets you know where you stand and what condition form approval is or lack thereof. 10 out of 5 stars"

>"I found no issues and far more effiecient than the paper for with prefilled information from my veteran profile."

>"No, it was pretty straight forward. Older vets 70+ might have tech difficulties, but that's because they didn't grow up with the technology."

>"much appreciated system I am down due to brain damage and physical damage from a accident on a bicycle I have not worked for 3 1/2 years I appreciate this ability to get some help right now while I recover"



**Service Design: Veteran's interactions outside the digital FSR form and other changes needed outside of digital form**


Approximately 43 Responses 


The need to fill out the form multiple times

>"I wished it would include current and future debt relief all in one form. The chances of my situation (financially) changing are about a million to one."

>"why do i have to do this every month? I used to get copay and travel, Im still on SS and two small IRA accounts but for some reason after 4-5 years I was cut off ???"

>We have completed this form more than once. Each time we go back to check on it, there's something else that we need to fill out and submit, even though the first form states that there is nothing else we need to do."


How to report changing circumstances

>"The ability to input our bills vs income. You ask the income info but you do not ask household bill info. Also, no place does it ask if there is a change. I have been off work since April 1st due to medical issues but you only ask what normal monthly income would be,"

>"Overdue credit card debt". I have credit card debt but my payments on it are up to date. Right now. If I lose my disability those payments WILL become overdue. So it's not clear"


Filling out FSR to dispute debt

>"This form should have an option to have the debt reviewed/disputed for reasons other than our financial information. This debt is based on inaccurate data."

>"I was told by a debt management employee to fill out this form to dispute the debt. When I tried to check that box it said I didn't need to use the form but that I instead needed to call the debt management. Thus, I was unable to include dispute in box 3 as I was advised. Additionally, I have several letters from the VA that support my disputation (or waiver) claim, but I was not able to include attachments with my form submission."


Dependents/Spouse

>"There are people who are dependents, but not necessarily in a marriage, I would like that to be a consideration"

>"Maybe a check box for Spouse outside of house hold and does not want to provide info."

>The spouse marriage option. I feel like separation should be added to it.

>Add "Widow or Widower" in marital status


Expenses

>"When it comes to reporting expenses, I have a hard time figuring out what to include and not include to get a idea of the total a month. I don't calculate my expenses in categories. I figure it out moment by moment based on my income and my bank account. I only keep tabs on monthly bills only."

>"Monthly bills change from month to month. So it's hard to enter a solid dollar amount."



Other
>"There was no way to put monthly expenses, and unable to put in the net for my husband's pay since he doesn't get a check stub and his pay is only a stipend and it will stop this summer due to lack of funding."

>"The employment section required a start and end date but if an end date is not applicable, why make it a requirement?"

>"Some one to actually talk to and not require me to fax things to some one"


**Suggestions for Improvement: Digital FSR Form-specific**

Approximately 35 Responses

Income
>"Make it where you can select your pay stub information as bi-weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly so not as much math has to be done to enter the amount. Plus the retirement account amount is limited to $70,000. Make it more."

This limit was previously requested by stakeholders.  Thanks to comments that Veterans have made via Medallia surveys, a recent review by stakeholders took place and this limit will be removed. 

>"There is no reason you should have to itemize a paycheck like that. Just ask for the gross then the net pay and you'll KNOW what the difference is. An Excel sheet would do better than this. Nightmare!"

>"Income: no place accurately states long term disability payments Expenses: cell phone and internet not listed? Needed in today's world Relief options: what are benefits/cons of options?"


Expenses

>"There should be distinction made for income going to nursing homes. This is not clearly stated on the form and when the veteran's income is going to a nursing home for nursing home care that needs to be a section by itself."

>"expenses credit cards don't really have a beginning balance do they? would that be 0 or the max of a credit card or the max someone had charged it to?"

>"I did not know if vehical lones should go"


Edit personal information

>"Being able to edit birthday. It appears it is formatted in the screen as mm/dd/year and my birthday is backwards the day is in the month position and the month is in the day"

>"Allow me to change personal information directly through this page"


Other 

>"Error messages should be larger text. I could tell color change till my kid ask about it."

>"Uploading supporting dcoumnetrs not supported."

>"If an area is missed, a written pop-up note should show. Guiding the individual on what's missing or what to do next."

>"Make it so that you can't keep submitting new forms, so that we know when the form is offically submitted. Its hard to determine if the form is truly submitted because it continues to say processing even when "submitted"

>"YOU SHOW "PENSION" IN TWO DIFFERENT SECTIONS"

^This is asked in both the income section and assets questions.



**FSR Form Bugs**

Approximately 3 Responses

>"I was not able to enter information on my IRA account. The form would not advance to the next page."

>"I don't have a computer and use the mobile app, occasionally it's a little wonky."

>"Could not update my mobile phone number."


**Sitewide**

Approximately 3 Responses  

>"Make the form easier to find. There are a few formms associated with this function and one isn't sure which one is required."

>"Provide more flexible repayment options that are a blend of decreased amount and smaller monthly payments. Also make the link on the MyVA page to complete the Form 5655 functional. I had to go back into the site as if I was starting over before I was able to access my form that was previously started. I wasted nearly an entire week trying to regain access to the partially finished application because the phone representatives were useless and only sending me on a wild goose chase for assistance."

>"It was challenging to find the form. I do not have the URL but one page showed FAQ's and I think I clicked on debt relief but kept going in circles. I can retry it and take a video of the steps if that helps."
