### The majority of challenges described include:

### 1. Sign in difficulties N = 5

> 
> Access to VA account to see balance and pay for monthly stmt.

> HAVING a SIGNOFF on the page of confirmation of payment - (pay.gov) 
> Needed to LOG ON to SIGNOFF ???  Only wanted to go in to VA and log
> out of VA

### 4.  Findability and navigation issues N = 3

> Information can be hard to find,  can never get letters to work or
> download.
> 
> I was to see Myhealthvet messages and pay a 2 bills. Could it be any
> harder? I would ask why is there a new login WEB Page to a page that
> is not ready for prime time, and just sends me to MyHealth Vet to
> login. Mesage access was fine. Just look at paying a bill without a
> physical statement.  How about filling out the form since VA has most
> of  the information.  I can supply the bank/acrd information. The VA
> information is spread all over, print too small, too many pages, and
> just not friendly.
> 
> Just not useful. Every portion of the VA is segregated to make
> everything difficult. I would never recommend anyone joining the us

# Financial Status Report (FSR)

## Summary and opening:

115 Veterans left qualitative and/or quantitative feedback on the FSR pages in April 2024.

52 left feedback from a Mobile Device and 60 left feedback from a Desktop. 3 were using a Tablet.

The majority of respondents (n = 111) all responded to only two measures of satisfaction:

**General VA Trust:**

Average: 3.6

Mode: 5

**Trust in VA Commitment to Veterans**

Average: 3.7

Mode: 5

Overall, the trust in VA commitment to Veterans across the sample of respondents to the survey in both the FSR and debt portal suggests Veterans have high trust in the VA (5 is the most commonly occurring value). This value should compared across other VA.gov teams to corroborate this finding.

**Only 6 Veterans left qualitative feedback, all under <What task were you trying to do today?> and it is listed here:**

> request a waiver for va request for return on overpayment during the
> covid period of time
> 
> Trying to lower my payment
> 
> Dispute a post 9-11 GIbill debt.  The VA needs to have a digital
> response, dispute system, or a way to upload the dispute rather than
> physically writing it out and mailing it. This is a massive efficiency
> issue that needs to be fixed.
> 
> request help with my co pays
> 
> Requesting assistance with debt
> 
> your program does not allow proper or complete answers for section II
> Income payroll deductions, gross and net pay. I was only able to
> provide VA and military retired pay as a total.
