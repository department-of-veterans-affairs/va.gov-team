In reporting spreadsheets, this survey is known as `VA.gov Debt Portal Questionnaire`.

Only appears on the FSR confirmation page (blue button > modal)  
At the end of the form after confirmation or approval message (positive), less of a negative response bias

Open text field provided.

N = 13

### Positive feedback left

N = 9

Example quotes: 

> I thought is was quite easy. [State specified] unemployment could definitly take advice on how to take car of a website. 2 1/2 applying for unemployment yesterday

> This was super simple to complete

> The form was simple to fill out.  My wife and I have not seen each other since October of 2016 and we do not share money or bills.  She has her own and I have my own.

> I think the firm is very easy to understand and accessible. It is also short. I donâ€™t think it needs changing.

> Great interactive (for me) form. Very easy to use

> First time using this it would not be fair to leave feedback at this point

### Top of mind concerns

> On all of the information I received prior to filing out the form, as well as on the first (but not second part) of the form today, it said that I had until May 27th, 2025 to submit. When actually going through, the date a few screens past it (don't remember the exact amount) said April 27th, 2025! Alarming. I have screenshots if you want to see.

N = 1

### Notable feedback to make expenses section more all encompassing 

> Asking the ages of dependents if you have over 5. Sometimes forget an age or two and have to go check to make sure youâ€™re correct. The expenses part, well itâ€™s so much more than just whatâ€™s asked that taking care of a family has to handle. For example I donâ€™t have a car right now. I use uber everywhere. Kids birthdays and vacations and trips for the kids. Everything costs.

> I feel it asks you about expenses but doesn't necessarily cover all expenses. Should be a section for all other expenses and a spot to list them.

> How about monthly bills, they should be here too.

> When it asks about expenses, I wasnâ€™t very sure where to put my car insurance, phone bill, internet because those are a monthly payment and thought they would go with contracted paymentsâ€¦ but then some of those things were listed as personal expensesâ€¦. So I added them to both. So that part was a bit unclear.

> there were no question give to cost of living.  Like rent. utilities & food

N = 5

### Needing guidance on best relief or help option

> To find out this relief from payment is available.

> Unsure which initial option to choose

N = 2

### Service design feedback 

About timeliness of form processing: (N = 2)

> There's no sense in having this form if you can't process it before it's deducted from our disability compensation. Really, I would like someone to explain to me how this form helps veterans in any way.

> I've been approved for debt forgiveness but I don't see the balance I owe showing zero.

About including other debts:

> This does NOT include fill ins for other debts... NOT an all encompassing form. Last night the site crashed & wouldn't let me submit.

About wanting to include financial hardship info and personal issues:

> I wish there was a place to add financial hardship info. and personal issues such as death of a spouse.

Misc:

> HOLD THE VA EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR MISTAKES/INTENTIONAL ABUSES OF VETERANS, such as was done to me.


### Notable feedback about optimizing UX efficiency on form, navigation, and findability of the form

> A quick link for each section would be helpful to avoid having to use the on-screen back button. The review contained a quick link for all sections. Perhaps include this throughout the form. I was initially unsure where to put my home loan and tractor loan. I finally figured it out. Otherwise, the form was very easy to understand and complete.

> It was very hard to find the form and then it confusing to find it again. I almost gave up on it. (lines 145 of spreadsheet)

> A navigation bar or tabs would be useful when going thru the review.  Currently you have to click "continue" when it takes you back to a section to edit upon review.

> It's a bit challenging to actually get to this page.

N = 4

### Marriage options (recurring theme in previous monthly reports)

> My Wife Social Security shouldn't be held against me since we are separated. When you are asked if you are married you should have an option to state Separated.

> ASK YOUR MARRIED STATUS IF YOU ARE SEPARATED FROM YOUR WIFE. IF SEPARATED YOUR WIFE INCOME IS NOT AVAILABLE TO YOUR SUPPORT
> Veteran information for spouse. There should be a space for those that are separated.

N = 3

### Uploading supporting documents (uplading documents to forms is a theme we heard in the most recent study as of June 2025)

> Perhaps a way to upload supporting documents

N = 1 

### Notable feedback and ideas to streamline  

First name misspelling: 

> My middle name is spelt wrong in the system, itâ€™s spelt [omitted] in the system but itâ€™s actually spelt [omitted]

Requesting pre-filled information 

> basic information that almost certainly does not change from previous completions was not automatically inserted or simply asked for verification: married with children is expected to change on a frequency of 13-18 years according to 2018 length of marriage data.

N = 2

### Misc

(lines 100 and 130 of spreadsheet)

> The information I entered was not reflected correctly on the completed form

> This is the 3rd time filling it out with no responses 

N = 1

## 4. I would recommend completing this form online instead of paper to another Veteran?

## Debt Portal Specific Feedback

## VA.gov VFS Questionnaire and A11 Questionnaire

## What task were you trying to do today?

### Negative feedback about changes

> Review past bills, duplicate the bill and make a payment and not have to fill out the entire form again including payment info that was previously stored. This new web site portal is terrible.

> You're doing all this work and making all these supposed changes, however, all you have done is make things more difficult to get to where I want.  You haven't changed anything.  Everything that was accessible before is still accessible.  So what's the point?

> hate the changes you made

### Findability issues

> I was looking for my balance of what I owe the VA for my meds. I finally found the info but it sur was alot of trouble locating it.

### Payments are not up to date

> The information shown is not up to date.

### Issue: 'no debt' on portal (recurring issue, both VBA debts and copayments)

> I received a letter in the mail, telling me I need to repay $4000, I cant afford this and I am trying to submit form 5655 along with a letter on the website, people at the VA number I called for debt relief told me to go to this website to do this but its telling me I have no debt... yet, they told me I need to do this by friday or I will have consequences. I am unable to submit the waiver for this. Please help me submit this form. my email is

> The information on the page is incorrect.  It shows that I have NO debt to pat, but when I call they tell me I still have an education debt.

> COPAY bill was never current or updated. As a retired Veteran , I always had to drive to VA Hospital  to find out my current status of my doctor's bill whether it's due or past due. On va.gov website , my copay bill was never current and was never updated .

### Login issues

> trying to pay medical copay, alot of information was miss placed, tried to correct to no avail. last time i tried to log on it said i didn;t have an account'


### Ideas for improvement

#### Wanting to see all past debts

> I would like to be able to see all past debts and payments I made. In 2025, it shouldn't take 4+ months to receive a printout of that. I should be able to log in and see it. It would most definitely reduce cost for the VA. Instead of paying people to send us the info, we could just log in and see our relevant account info. Why is that not an option? I feel like I'm back in the 1980s...

> I WAS TRYING TO VIEW THE STATUS  OF MY OVERPAYMENT / REPAYMENT PROGRAM. I GUESS I WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT I AM FINISHED PAYING THIS HOWEVER, I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE MY PAST PAYMENTS AND TOTAL AMOUNT. I WOULD ALSO LOVE TO SEE A CONFIRMATION THAT I FULLY PAID THIS AMOUNT. YOU ALL TOOK A PORTION OUT OF MY COMPENSATION IN ORDER TO PAY THIS AMOUNT BUT LIKE I SAID I CANT FIND HISTORY OF MY DEBT AT ALL. I LOVE ON THE MOBILE APP YOU ALL HID THE PERCENTAGE AND AMOUNT :)

### Payment issues

Double charged

> Double charged $87 on my co-pay for prescriptions

Difficulty understanding the payment system

> it took a couple of min. to figure it out but its now I know how to open the page so I can make payments on my co pay

> Making a payment is awful.  I have to fill out 3 pages of info every time - a WHOLE lot of numbers.

### Feedback specific to: <va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/combined-statements>

> Cannot see details or payment history of debt. Combined statement does not download either.

> Where in the [expletive] is the list of ALL ACCOUNT STATEMENTS?

> The online portal is not very simple to use or navigate. I was trying to find out if I had a copayment due, and I am still trying to figure it out. I have a Bachelor degree in computer science and a masterâ€™s of science but I feel real dumb when I cannot figure out something that is so simple

> Pay co-pay balance Hasn't been updated

### Service Design issues

> Very difficult to get a human being to speak with you over the phone in
