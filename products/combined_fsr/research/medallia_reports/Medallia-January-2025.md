# Monthly Medallia Report: January 2025

With the addition of Custom Survey dataset shares since December 2024, the team is segmenting future monthly reports by survey for additional clarity by survey and by product. 

# FSR Custom Survey 

The FSR custom survey appears on the confirmation page of the [Financial Status Report (5655)](http://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction). To access this survey, users click on a modal button that asks for feedback towards the top of the page to launch the survey. All responses are optional, there are no required questions so users can decide on their own which questions to respond to. 
In reporting spreadsheets, this survey is known as `VA.gov Debt Portal Questionnaire`.

Only appears on the FSR confirmation page (blue button > modal)  
At the end of the form after confirmation or approval message (positive), less of a negative response bias

## Why did you select that rating? 





**Service design**


> The VA does not care about Vets. All they care about is getting their money back by ruining Vets lives with extreme debt. There is a reason why Veterans have the highest suicide rates in the nation. It all can be traced back to the way the VA treats them.


**Login difficulty**

> I have followed every step attempting to log in and I have not been able do so.  I have used my drivers liscense and my VA identification card and neither one has been accepted.

> The new sign in process is incredibly way to complex. I have considerable networking experience -albeit a bit outdated. I had to do the verify and send my id (drivers license) stuff in several times. one does not have to have much imagination to figure how much frustration you are bringing on to your staff. I can only see the younger -more tech-savy vets having no issues with this new logon stuff. Get ready for a flood of complaints and "P-Oed" vets who are not tech savey. these probably are going to be the older vets


> Signing up and getting verified using ID.me is horrendous. It took me multiple tries over a month period.

> verification, navigation and payment is all so complicated and unnecessary


**Copay Page Feedback**

> Where is the blue button and other options that used to be here?


**Billing Code Confusion**

> I tried to access my VA debt several times today. On several successive attempts to access my debts I received a notification that file was not accessible. It said the problem was on the VA website. Also, when I got in, I tried to fill out the form so I could pay my debt but the form asked for a six digit code but the associated code on my bill was seven digits long. Do I use the first six digits of that code or something else? I'd hate to fill in the wrong code and screw up my payment.


**Payment Discrepancy**

> Payment system is never correct. Payment posted and cleared bank on 12/24/24. Still showing due on site but when you call in it shows paid.


> your online billing sucks my last balance update was december 10 it is now almost  feburary and still no new update.


> My copay is paid, your records do not reflect that. My bank statement does


> I am constantly  being  torn  I  owe a copay for  a bill that was paid December  2025


> copay bill 3 months behind and then you charge me late fees


**Positive Feedback**

> The help and guidance from the VA and website is amazing I want to thank you for all your help.


> It was easy to maneuver through the website to locate what I was looking for.


**Feedback outside of debt portal**

> For the most part it's a good site, but parts of it are very confusing. This is especially true in the Pharmacy area. Script tracking will make a person crazy, because you can't tell if a script has been filled or not.

## What task were you trying to do today?


**Service design issues**

> Trying to view info about debt but page states "you don't have any current VA benefit debt". I have received multiple letters from Debt Management Center, tried to call phone# listed on letters but it becomes a circle leading to nowhere, calls get transferred multiple times but unable to get a clear answer as representatives do not seem to have thorough knowledge of the system or the ability to look into accounts. Site does not seem to be maintained or up to date however it is being presented as a way to view accurate and current information.


> Confirm if I owe any co-pay vs my travel expenses I've claimed. Your system is not current so I am unclear about status. My Billing Office at [name] remains CLOSED so I couldn't try to pay/resolve debt there. Frustrating.  Much of the site works well or I would be "Dissatisfied".


**Status of debt: lack of clarity**

> Hello,  I disputed the debt, but never heard from the VA.  I have no idea where I am in the process of my debt.  Is there a payment plan set for me?  if so, how much?  Thanks 

> I wanted to check the status of my debt, but the site is unclear on the date on the debt. It says current, but last updated in March 2024. It would be great if you had links to the debt correspondence sent (you have a page that shows when letters were sent, and the subject, but not digital versions of the letters). Still better than two weeks ago when debt information was not available. Thanks for continuing to work on the website. :)

> Verify that the $81 bill was marked as paid. Its not. I have the verification e-mail that its paid. How can I send you a copy of it?



**Paying multiple times**

> Payed my balance twice already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

> I have 2 debts.  I paid one!!! Trying to pay the other - it disappeared.....

**Wanting to see debt letters**

> I just want a download copy of both Debt letters. I have spent over an hour trying to get a copy of these letters yet no where to be found. No real explanation of why I have a debt. I recieved another debt letter in the mail for 83 days of service in FY23 which I belive I already paid in NOV of 24 now I have two letters for over 10,000 dollars that I'd like to know why.

**Positive feedback**

> I was just checking out the new website and noticed that you can check all of the copay balances.  This is a very nice feature that I have been wanting!
