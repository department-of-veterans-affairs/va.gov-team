*Data variability is apparent between respondents since all questions are optional (not required).

**New Medallia survey embedded in confirmation page copy:**

* As of 12/20/23 the Debt Resolution team has created an updated Medallia feedback survey to go live in January 2023 designed to increase the amount of feedback. The CTA will be embedded in the copy of the confirmation page. 

* We will likely see more feedback responses, mostly from Veterans who are successful in submitting the form.

* This is preferable to an intercept survey, from a UX perspective, to avoid interrupting flow/concentration and for a digital-first approach.

**Debt Portal - Summary, Miscellaneous**

-   Some Veterans state they would prefer to receive a bill by mail
    
-   Financial hardship, needing help but unsure of how to find it
    
* Large amount of debt (n = 1)

	-  	 [Agency name] says I owe --,--- in overpayment on CRDP, Why when the CRDP was off set from my retirement
	-   Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay

**Veteran Qualitative Feedback** 

**1. **Why did you email me/where does this debt come from? (VHA notification) N = 36/90****

-   Some Veterans who receive the email notification express negative emotions due to the confusion:
> "Find out why you sent me a scary email about owing the VA money.”
> 
> “I got an official VA email about "managing your VA debt," and my blood pressure spiked because I was certain I had no VA debt. So I checked, and sure enough, I don't. I know VA means well, but it's probably unwise to send such emails to excitable ex-GIs who pay bills promptly and don't accumulate debt.”
> 
> “Received another email saying that I owe, but when I signed in, it says that I owe nothing. Why am I still getting emails, saying that I do owe???? Please fix this system, as I and my wife are getting real tired of being frightened for no reason!, as we are on a **fixed income.**”

-   Some Veterans also report that it is a waste of time:
> "I do not wish to receive these email messages, as my prescription bills are paid by personal check as soon as I receive them and reading these messages wastes my time.”

**2. Veterans report that the debt portal does not update bills and payments in time, causing frustration N = 9/90**

> *"Get the "debt" that still shows a balance of $-- removed! I have confirmation from the VA and my bank that it was paid! This $#@%%^ system is the WORST! I've tried for weeks to get things fixed...can't even contact a LIVE ONE at the intake center. On a scale of 1 to 10? -50*"
> 
> *"Your billing system is very poor and slow. I make my payments and still get notifications saying it is overdue. I tried to call but after 20 minutes I gave up. I submitted feedback via this site and never heard a peep!*"
> 
> *"I keep getting these, and I pay every bill I get from VA in full every time. Also, this one says updated 11/4/23, and today is 11/2/23.*"
> 
> "*Why is this portal 2 months behind? It is no help, when it is this old.*"

**3. Negative emotions due to the fear that they might have  debt, N = 7/90**

> *"Find out why you sent me a scary email about owing the VA money"*
> 
> *"No action was required, why did you send this alarming email? Thanks for the additional stress. Fools"*
> 
> *"I got an official VA email about "managing your VA debt," and my blood pressure spiked because I was certain I had no VA debt. So I checked, and sure enough, I don't. I know VA means well, but it's probably unwise to send such emails to excitable ex-GIs who pay bills promptly and don't accumulate debt."*

**Misc: Veterans state they would prefer to receive a bill by mail N = 5/90**

> *Send me a paper bill, not a message. You always send me a paper bill.*
>     
> *Send me a bill in the mail and I pay it. I am not going to pay online or give my bank account information to anyone. Not going green, send
> bill i pay it*
>     
> *I have to receive a paper copy of my bill each month showing payments made for my Hud Housing Program!!*
>     
> *what the (bleep) are you sweating me about $--.-- for. I pay as I go.Just send my bill by mail and leave that alone.I may or may not  look at a email, SO, just send a bill like you have been doing.**
>     
> *Send me a bill by usps and I will be glad to pay it*

**Misc: Confusion about when something is past due, especially for copays**

> Check on debt. However, I owe for my last month’s prescriptions. One month and it is not past due. Worthless to contact me when I have been paying my bill monthly.
> 
>    Why are you dunning me for things in the future! It is $-.-- and I just got the medication. I think I will talk to my Congressman about this since it happens ***EVERY MONTH***!
>    
>    I get these messages once a month. I check the message and it says I don't owe anything. I pay my balance ***every month***. The system needs to screen who it sends the emails.
>    
>  Check my copay amount. This page has not been updated since the end of September. Today is Thanksgiving.
>        
> Finding a statement that shows copay activity is terribly hard to find

**Misc: Financial hardship, needing help but unsure of how to find it**

> [Explains medical reason] haven't been able to work since then. [Explains medical reason], I hope to go back to work by Jan 2024. Whatever help you can assist me with would be greatly appreciated. Thank you
> 
> I can't pay this bill, I'm 72 years old and I lost my job 2 years ago and I can barely pay rent and I depend on church pantries to eat. I don't know what to do. I'll be evicted soon.
> 
> You people must be crazy. You were paying me because I DIDN'T have any money. What do you not understand about that??? Does anyone have an IQ over 30 at the VA???

**Veteran Qualitative Feedback**

**1.  Requesting “debt relief”, “debt waiver”, or “help with copays” (n= 17)**

This is consistent with the purpose of the FSR form. 

**2. Debt portal does not update bills and payments in time N = +2**

> I have paid my copay amount that was requested by the VA. I actually paid it twice.. but the VA still says that I have an amount that I need to pay.
> 
>   One page says I have a credit another page say I owe. That leaves me totally confused.

**3. Problems reaching the appropriate agency**

> *Trying to get in touch with Debt Management to see what was going on with my claim/wavier I put in reference #[omitted] done Nov. 04. Reason for my feedback is that I receive a letter from VA Dept Managment say that my dept was sent to the IRS because I did not get in contact with them. Calls are not going thru to the department.*
> 
> *its so difficult for an 85 year old to do this without help. i need help and got somebody to help me with these forms. i am weak and tired and cannot go through all these problems over and over. there was a time when care was simple and now its form and more forms. this form has been helped with from a neighbor.*
> 
> *I am trying to help my Iraq war veteran son with a creditor collection agency; I called the 866-400-1238 number twice and it hung up on me twice!*

**4. Form submission error, n = 5**

> **Request help on my bill and it won't let me submit a financial status report. It says "we're sorry. something went wrong on our end." I have called in and still have been unable to complete it by the11/25 due date*
>     
> *I need to fill out the 5655 to dispute a charge which is wrong. I used the "fill out online" feature, but it asks you a few questions
> and doesn't submit anything. Guess I'll use the paper copy.**

**5. Expressing anger, n = 6**

> *You people are unbelievable. I called up to the VA less than 3 months ago and specifically asked how much I owed you and your reply was $- and some change. I also explained that I was retired and on a fixed income and could not afford to pay large bills. I asked that VA please bill me monthly so, I could afford to pay my bills and here we are with a $----.-- bill. I don’t even get that much from my retirement monthly. So how am I expected to pay my bill???????!!!!!! Once again, VA drops the ball and doesn’t give a rip what kind of problems you cause for us Vets. Thanks for nothing.*

> *This is a mess. You took something that worked just find and did what you do best, [expletive] it up.*

**Positive feedback:** 

The majority of the feedback left by Veterans in these surveys describes pain points in the current service and user experience. This feedback should help determine product roadmap priorities to improve the current debt resolution experience for all Veterans. 

2 quotes from Veterans that left positive feedback on their experience: 

> *“Everyone is very knowledgeable and very kind.”*

> *“Effortless interface.” 
> *Samsung Galaxy user, debt summary page, 12/10/23**

## Recommendations

-   Understanding the disconnect happening in the email notifications
    
-   Investigating and reviewing current knowledge about Veteran mental models about debt, adding to that body of knowledge with a formative study in an effort to better communicate expectations in a way that aligns with mental models
    
-   Findability study or navigation study to address findability (still an issue)
