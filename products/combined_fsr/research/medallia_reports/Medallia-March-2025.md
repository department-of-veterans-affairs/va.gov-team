# Monthly Medallia Report: March 2025

With the addition of Custom Survey dataset shares since December 2024, the team is segmenting future monthly reports by survey for additional clarity by survey and by product. 

Across all three surveys, we had 205 responses from Veterans in March. 

Out of 62 responses, 20 (32.3%) said they were able to complete their task, while 42 (67.7%) said they could not. 

Out of 205 Veterans who filled out these surveys, 119 were using a Desktop device and 79 were using a Mobile Phone. 7 were using a tablet.

**52 Qualitative Responses total**

### None, no suggestions

16 Responses

Responses included "None" and "N/A".

### Suggestions for Improvement, FSR Form-specific: 

### Expenses Section


### Including basic living expenses for Veterans with limited income

>Expenses section should be simpler & include basic living expenses. There should be a way to include paper products like toilet paper, as this is an expense that is necessary, but can be expensive to provide on a limited income.

### Internet, cellphone as a monthly expense >> Being updated!
 
>I would break down monthly expenses to include internet which is vital for everyone. 
 
>The needs to be a option for phone or internet on there. I didn't know where to put my phone monthly payment amount.  I was told that I did not have a co-pay because of my income and expenses. Now I know that isn't true. What other hidden cost do I have that I will fond out later. I have to now ask how much it will cost to be seen and see if I can now. This will greatly impact my medical care. With the current administration I am already see the decrease in care for Veterans and the access to care.

>I was unable to add phone and internet expenses to the utility section

>There was not an option to add a cellphone expense which I feel is a basic expense similar to utilities.


### Relief options
>Offer a monthly payment option, not just a waiver or one time payment option.

>it only allows for one option. If the option that was selected is denied what happens then? there should be a waterfall option. If waiver isn't approved then it should be a reduced payment option, and then on to extended months of repayment instead of just allowing only one option to be selected.


>A way to link your bank information to the application for review.  Along with your credit history as an option.

### Marital Status

>Under marriage status I would as widowed. It was hard to say I wasn't married anymore.

### Adding supporting documents

>Wished there was an option where supporting documents could be added to the request.  I had some and could not add them to the request.



### Difficulty determining car value

>I would ask about the veterans car situation. People may have a car but it might not be working or it may be causing the person more harm than good wise.
>I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO FIND OUT THE VALUE OF MY CAR


### Automatic updates
>Automatically update dependent options

### Service Design Feedback

>If you only use drop downs to fill information it causes people with anxiety like me to freak out when I can't remember exact dates and details. Filled this and that paperwork out only to still be sent to collections. Online and in person don't seem to matter I just can't catch a break.


### Misc

>it would have been a lot easier if the link worked for continuing the application   I finally found a work-around.   Thanks

>The VA clerks we talk to should really want to help vets and use common sense when discussing the issues at hand.

>The other format was simple this is too convoluted

>take the docket number off. I do not have it and would speed up the process

>I was looking to find if my Health information had been added but couldn't find the location.


>I want to speak with someone

>I'm so appreciative of the support from the VA This is all new to me. It's  impressive and uplifting, it really gives so hope. T/Y for caring



>Please make it easier to update the expense portion or put a portion in for child support payments.

>Hard to figure monthly medical expenses  monthly debt if trying to go bankrupt but cannot afford it cannot figure monthly payment

## What task were you trying to do today?

### Service design issues

>LOVE my VA care...just cant afford. (lost   Salary pension & much more)…

>Cant pay these bills...wife(much cancer)...have $7500.00 annual healthcare "co-pay" for one of my 3 jobs...lost ( salary pension)?  and I cant pee.  please help before me homeless

>VA Form 5655 does not indicate where a veteran must send it.  Furthermore, the form cannot be filed unless establishing an account in va.gov.  Provide an address, fax number, or email address so that a veteran or family member can submit the form easily.  Thank you.


### Cross-checking payment records with debt portal

>My records show that my charge for $39.00 was paid by my [Bank] in [place]. on Dec 12, 2024 confirmed by [name] at [Bank].

# VA.gov A11 Questionnaire (intercept survey)

56 responses

Decline percent : 74%
Submission percent: 4.61%

## Why did you select that rating?

### Service Design Challenges

> It's not the website just the services. It took me nearly a year to have my son removed as a dependent. Because it took the VA so long to process, I now have a debt. Very frustrating!

> I received a letter in the mail stating i have an outstanding debt. I went to va.gov/manage-va-debt I then logged in and the site says i have no outstanding debt.

> When they give you a debt letter it should be simultaneously uploaded to the website and mailed.  Why only mail?

> I paid my copay before the due date and it is not noted on my myhealthevet data/info/notice.

**Understanding copays**
> I got a bill saying I owe money with no explanation of for what . I do not remember seeing a dr. or anything in December. Takes way to long to get a bill

### Navigation and Wayfinding

> I still can get a touch confused making my way around in here.  I mean, am I supposed to be at My VA or at Healthy vet??  And why do they look so different??

> couldnt get to my acct to make a co payment

> The site is still somewhat confusing and sometimes youâ€™ll can click a link and not have any means to return to the page you came from, I believe terms and conditions on one of the pages is an example

> Getting to this site was a extremely hard for me

### Login Challenges

> getting confused with all the different logins

> since you left myhealthevet.com, it took a while to get set up on ID.me, and now, I have to signe in twice to get through Every Time.

### Positive Feedback

> Whether phone or this site always have helped me.

> speedy feedback on my claim and an understanding of my condition.

> whether phone or this site always have helped me.

> Everyone is compassionate and extremely helpful

> Very easy app to navigate, and Iâ€™m 73 years old. Good work my fellow Veterans.
