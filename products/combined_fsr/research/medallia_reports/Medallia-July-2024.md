# Important Findings:

*Due to small number of respondents, these findings are anecdotal, but nevertheless noteworthy because they are likely issues encountered by other Veterans using the debt portal*

## VHA/Copay Summary page:
***va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/copay-balances***

   **Due to inaccurate/delayed balance due, Veterans that have recurring copay bills are reporting that they are having difficulty tracking how much they truly owe**

`I've been trying to have a copay removed from online account for months.  I called and was told I don't owe anything yet it still remains.  I even paid it 2 times and it still remains. I recently had a couple of refills and since I paid twice for an old one do I have a credit or owe again?`

**-   Month to month, we are hearing about the dissatisfaction with payments due being inaccurate. This further reinforces the necessity of a more accurate and recent balance due.**

`The VA accounts & billing info needs a total makeover with accurate up to date information. The site has improved and getting easier to understand with use.`

`What I like about the website is, I was able to order prescription meds online - hopefully, I'll get the meds.  What I didn't like about the website, is that I paid my co-pay last week online, but the co-payment does not show up on the website. It says the payments will be updated with the monthly cycle, which I take to mean once a month. If this is true, this is substandard for a website. The VA should try to get co-payments updated immediately, or at the very least, the next business day.`

**-   There are also recurring difficulties with findability and navigation on the VHA copay paths. This increases cognitive burden and makes it difficult for Veterans to complete their task/action, such as making a payment.**

`I forgot what acct I selected and called for help.  I was told I couldn't make the copay online at this time so I was transferred around then to payments.  While I was on hold found the copayment section. My suggestion is to have a tab one could select to directly to co-payments.`

`It is very difficult to pay my bill even though I have a premium account. It makes me fill out all my information every time.`

`The "Current copay balances" page needs to be more easily accessible. It took me almost 30 minutes of frustration to find it. The information on the "Current copay balances" page also needs to be included on the 'pay.gov' website. The 'VA Medical Copayment Form' needs to include the billing reference number on the 'pay.gov' website. This also will help reduce confusion. ... I paid $8.00, but I don't know what it was specifically for.`

`Pay copay payment for medications  I am not happy with the new system.  I will be going back to paying by phone .  My time is to valuable to waste on a system that is not friendly to a veteran who spent the last 35 yrs.  working on computers.`

**-   There may be a bug on the copay pages**

`figure out co pay owed  just have a spinning circle, maybe a time out feature ?` *(07/24/2024)*

`Easy to use`

**-   2 Veteran said their situations do not match what is in the portal, which says they have no debt. This confuses the Veteran.**

***There might also be a bug on this page.**

`I had been sent a letter saying that i owe debt from my suspended gi bill for dropping a college class and i wanted to pay off my remaining debt as instructed by the mail I've gotten but not only is it repeatedly saying I have none, it keeps reloading the page whenever and with other text that I'm not able to read` *(07/18/2024)*

`Page is showing I have no debt but all of my disability rating of 100% is being taken to repay a separation payment I received from the army in 2021. I have been receiving VA compensation for some time. Now I am paying back all this money and it shows I have no debt? I haven't received any payments for 3 months and about to be homeless! This is crazy. And I can t get any help. I just want to negotiate a payment arrangement but am not able to become I have no debt. But I do. Every dime of monthly income is gone. So how do I have no debt.` *(07/18/2024)*

**Misc:**

**-   Positive feedback about a DMC representative:**

`I spoke to one of the VA debt center representative via phone (07-10-2024) and i want to put a positive word of commendation for her professional and kind help. The lad helped me understand the process and was very kind throughout the process.  Any supervisors out there, please commend this kind person for her amazing help.  God bless you all.`
