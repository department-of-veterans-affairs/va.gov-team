# **Standard Medallia Survey Data on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)** 

Veterans currently submit regular feedback about their [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) experience while visiting the site through [two different surveys.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/accessing-and-utilizing-contact-center-data#AccessingandUtilizingContactCenterData-WhattoDoWiththeData) 

This portion of the report analyzes the two open field text responses gathered from these two surveys.

1. **Medallia Feedback Survey:** Accessed by clicking the blue ‘feedback’ button located at the bottom of most [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) pages. In reports this is known as `VA.gov VFS Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks,“What task were you trying to do today?”  
      
2. **Medallia Intercept Survey:** Randomly intercepts 5% of [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) visitors who have had a 20-second or more session.  In reports this is known as `VA.gov A11 Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks, “Why did you select that rating?”

All survey responses analyzed here are from respondents who visited and referenced pages in any part of the /manage-va-debt/ experience.

The following section aggregates the themes from the two above open text field questions.

## **Most responses convey a high level of general satisfaction with site usability and information accessibility.  Many say that it is easy and they find what they need.**

94 responses

* “**Easy** to find any information.”  
* “Site works **intuitively** and smoothly.”  
* “This site is **always on point**.”  
* “**VA is the best website for all age groups**, provides simple information to navigate through each process with telephone numbers in conjunction to speak with a live agent if necessary. VA representatives nothing outstanding; calls are always routed to the appropriate offices. Thank you, Veterans Administration\!\!\!”  
* My expectations in terms of quality and service were meet not only on the website but in the few visits to the VA hospital in Miami, Fl.”

## **The majority of critical responses express frustration with debt information not updating to reflect their payments. As a result, many call support to check balances and some report double paying the same invoice.**

36 responses

* “I made a payment online on 8/28 for $30.00 and **it was not updated**. I received another invoice with the same co-payment due with a statement of 9/4/2025. **I believe this is the reason no one trusts the quality of the VA**. I want to believe different so I will pay the co-pay again. What a mess.”  
* “Check overdue??? Paid by check sent 7/29/2025. **It was cashed by VA. You need to remove a past due notice.”**   
* My statement has not been updated since May and shows a balance due. I have paid that balance and it continues to show the past due amount. **Why can't this account be updated and reflect the correct amount owed?”**  
* Your billing is always incorrect. I pay my bills as soon as sent but they are still listed 2 months later as I still owe it. **I call every time**.”

## **Some wish they could pay their bills more directly instead of [pay.gov](http://pay.gov) \- and at minimum their account information should automatically be transferred over when paying.**  

12 responses

* “\[There are\] **too many sites**. If you go pay.gov you can not see your current balance. You have to go to a different site.”  
* “Why is this process so antiquated?  The system knows the amount I owe, it knows my account number, it knows my name and address.  **Why can't this just be pre-populated into the payment portal?”**   
* “Why do I have to fill in all of the information every time? Can't you do like the **public sites like banks do and store certain information** including payment info?”  
* “The process seems a little **cumbersome compared to other payment options on other platforms. My request is for automatic payment options**. Doesn't seem like much (medicine copay) but I wind up with late charges.  I would like to see a email with current charges and a 1 tap payment option.”

## **Some are unable to find details about their debts and complain that the navigation is unintuitive compared to other comparable payment platforms.**

11 responses

* “**I have an IT degree and it took me 4-5 minutes to find the outstanding invoice sooo I'm guessing most 75 year olds are not able to do it.**  Just copy every other Myychart website.  It's not hard.”  
* “**Unable to see my debt when I clicked it.** I know I have an educational debt, but cannot see any updates on current balances or where it came from.”  
* “Using this website is a bit frustrating. **Finding my bill information, understanding what the bill is for, and paying the bill are all separate things** that require extra knowledge of the website and how it is set up.”  
* “I can’t find what I owe anywhere. **How am I supposed to know what to pay if I don’t know what I owe.** It’s stupid.”

## **Some complain that they either can’t– or it takes too many steps– to find what they’re looking for.**

11 responses

* “Sometimes difficult to navigate. Sorry I can’t be more specific. I just know that while I eventually find what I’m looking for, it often feels like **it takes a long time to get there**.”  
* “Can't find what I am looking for.”  
* **“Too many steps** to find what I need.”

## **Some receive debt notifications and then are confused when the site or a VA representative informs them that they have no debt.**

10 responses

* “I got a letter saying I have debt, but the website says I have no debt. **I want a clear answer,** **and to understand the process**, not being redirected to calling multiple phone numbers to find out what is going on.”  
* “**The system indicates I have overdue bills,** when I call to pay them, I am told I don't have any outstanding balances.”  
* “Received letter stating I have a debt and how to pay online.  **Online says I don't owe anything.”**

### **A few responses mentioned the following difficulties:** 

* Trouble logging in  
* Long hold times or no response from call centers  
* Claim status not being available

# **Custom Financial Management Medallia Survey for Financial Status Report (VA form 5655\)** 

In addition to the two standard surveys, the Financial Management Team has created a custom survey to monitor the experience for VA form 5655, a financial status report form, which a Veteran submits to request help with VA debt for overpayments and bills.

To access the custom survey, Veterans first complete and submit the [Financial Status Report (5655)](http://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction). On the confirmation page, Veterans may click on a blue “Provide feedback” button to access the survey, which consists of four questions. Responses are optional. In reports this is known as `VA.gov Debt Portal Questionnaire`.

# **Monthly CSAT Score for Debt Portal (Quantitative data from all 3 surveys combined)**

Our report tracks the data recorded in the CSAT score dashboard in the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) [Domo tool](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1545882322).  We have filtered directories by ‘manage va debt’ to include all of the surveys referencing /manage-va-debt.

CSAT data includes all of the quantitative measures from the standard questions on the 3 surveys: the Veteran ranks each Survey question on a 1 \- 5 scale. The cumulative percentage of responses out of 100 becomes the CSAT measure.
