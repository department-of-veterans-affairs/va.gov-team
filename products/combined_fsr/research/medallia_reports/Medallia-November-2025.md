Responses (surveys) received: 485

# **Standard Medallia Survey Data on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)** 

Veterans currently submit regular feedback about their [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) experience while visiting the site through [two different surveys.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/accessing-and-utilizing-contact-center-data#AccessingandUtilizingContactCenterData-WhattoDoWiththeData) 

This portion of the report analyzes the two open field text responses gathered from these two surveys.

1. **Medallia Feedback Survey:** Accessed by clicking the blue ‘feedback’ button located at the bottom of most [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) pages. In reports this is known as `VA.gov VFS Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks, “What task were you trying to do today?”  
      
2. **Medallia Intercept Survey:** Randomly intercepts 5% of [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) visitors who have had a 20-second or more session.  In reports this is known as `VA.gov A11 Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks, “Why did you select that rating?”

All survey responses analyzed here are from respondents who visited and referenced pages in any part of the /manage-va-debt/ experience.

The following section aggregates the themes from the two above open text field questions.

## **Many responses communicate general satisfaction with the website, including being able to easily find information and get tasks done, particularly ordering prescriptions.**

* “I always have an easy time refilling the prescriptions my Doctor has me on. It's a pretty easy site to navigate. Helps that you can see your co-pay amount at a glance without having to contact the VA Hospital. I'm very grateful for the VA and this website.”

* “​​Great improvement over previous website. Now it is much more user friendly.”

* “Found a great deal of information and pretty easily.”


## **Many responses communicate frustration with making payments, especially having to reenter account information**

* “Tried to pay my bill.  Got frustrated and quit.”

* “When paying you Online bill, would be nice to tick a box next to what you need to pay, and use a pin or password to pay it, or allow us to paste and cut our Account number.”

* “Pay my Co-Pay bill. You have all of my information but after I click the link above at Pay.gov, I have to enter ALL of my information again. Irritating.”


## **Many express confusion and frustration about out of date payment history information. They mention calling customer support or double paying the same bill when trying to resolve the issue.**

* “I have a bill that I paid and its still on this web site. I called and they confirmed I paid it but said there was nothing they could do to remove it from this web site.”

* “Billing payments being posted is so far behind I paid for same services 2 times thinking that I made an error.  Now I have prepaid for Rx and not sure if that will be an issue.”

* “Looks like I overpaid unless someone can explain past charges; or perhaps I have made a mistake. I don't know and that's the problem since the perceived error is too old (last September/a couple of months ago).”

* “My Balance of $ 24 was paid on October 27, 2025 and you show that I still owe that amount\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! Information here is NOT timely.”

## **Some responses state the website is confusing to navigate and it is more difficult to find information.** 

* “The website is actually pretty confusing to use until used a lot to figure out. So please keep it simple with all upcoming updates.”

* “Confusing and can't find old information\! BAD\!”

* “Too many hoops to jump through to get to where ya want to be.”

## **Some responses express gratitude for VA staff, especially VA Healthcare staff.**

* “Today I received informative correspondence from the Oklahoma Dept. of Veterans Affairs. The overall experience has me feeling better about my health.”

* “I never have a problem with VA. I called for Renewal on 2 meds, and they were kind and courteous. fast service.”

* “I have in past and now & future VA has my favorable choice of my mental illness & physical health care . Thank you.”

## **A few responses report difficulties logging in and having their identities verified.**

* “Because of not being able to log in.  Had no problems previously to these new requirements.  Not all of us have up to date phones etc.  I go to the VA  health center and have no problem being identified.”

* “I log on through ID.Me, and go through the verification process.  Then the system logs me out when trying to compose a message to my PAC whci requires looking up info and files and I have to go through the process all over again.”

* “Because there is too much red tape to go through just to be able to check something with either my VA healthcare or other items/issues.  How about just issuing CAC Cards like we had in the military along with CAC Card readers we can plug into our computers? all of this I.D. me stuff sucks.” 

# **Custom Financial Management Medallia Survey for Financial Status Report (VA form 5655\)** 

In addition to the two standard surveys, the Financial Management Team has created a custom survey to monitor the experience for VA form 5655, a financial status report form, which a Veteran submits to request help with VA debt for overpayments and bills.

To access the custom survey, Veterans first complete and submit the [Financial Status Report (5655)](http://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction). On the confirmation page, Veterans may click on a blue “Provide feedback” button to access the survey, which consists of four questions. Responses are optional. In reports this is known as `VA.gov Debt Portal Questionnaire`.

# **Monthly CSAT Score for Debt Portal (Quantitative data from all 3 surveys combined)**

Our report tracks the data recorded in the CSAT score dashboard in the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) [Domo tool](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1545882322).  We have filtered directories by ‘manage va debt’ to include all of the surveys referencing /manage-va-debt.

CSAT data includes all of the quantitative measures from the standard questions on the 3 surveys: the Veteran ranks each Survey question on a 1 \- 5 scale. The cumulative percentage of responses out of 100 becomes the CSAT measure.
