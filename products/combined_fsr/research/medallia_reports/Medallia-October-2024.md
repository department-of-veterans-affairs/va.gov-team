## Important Findings:

### VA.gov Experience: Why did you select that rating?


**Service Design challenges:**

> I've been trying to get help with a debt and I haven't received any of my disability compensation for over 2 months. I'm stressing out and have a family to provide for and I don't know what else to do. I have called the debt center and the regional office and they keep telling me I need to wait. It's been over 2months already and I'm going on my 3rd month without disability compensation. please help I don't think I can hold it together anymore.

> Received a refrad order in July 2024, and at the same time received notification that benefits were terminated. Now fighting to reinstate my benefits.

> Because service agents lie to veterans about their debts by telling them not to worry, it will be paid with their next payment. Then turn it over to the Treasury and they add an additional 30% to it.

>Incorrect Billing, no communications - must try to call (good luck)


> I need to find out why you increased my debt even I  keep trying to add my current wife to my claim and you're already taking money from my check i just resubmitted my request to add [name] a few weeks though  and haven't heard anything instead I keep seeing my debt increase even when I'm not getting my proper pay to begin with.

**Several Veterans left positive feedback.**

> I was able to login quickly.

> Easy access

> Easy to read.

> I can find info pretty easy.


**Misc issues:** 

> I can't sign into VA Debt Management website with my CAC.

> Some of the information was dated in the future.


### What task were you trying to do today?

**Reporting of a bug related to the debt portal telling Veterans that they are not enrolled in VA healthcare:**

> Check my account, pay a bill. It keeps telling me I can't check my account because I am not enrolled in VA health benefits. I am and have been enrolled for years.

> Logged in with [Login.gov](http://login.gov/) and it says I am not enrolled in VA health care. I have been for over 20 years. Thought we were supposed to transition from VA specific to this site.

> View my medical copay bill. I keep getting a statement that says I am not enrolled in VA health Care which is total BS because I've been in enrolled in health care for over 20 years at the VA Healthcare System.

**A few comments related to payment history:**

> Check to see if I had paid my bill, if it is on the page or another link I can't find it.

> Download payment history, and debt information to apply for benefits in State

> Trying to obtain my LAST monthly bill for September, since I had not received it. I CANNOT find specific bills on the web other than the most current. I am not refuting a bill....I just want to see it before I pay the subsequent month.

> Trying to find my copay balance monthly up to this date.

**Feedback related to payments not processing and updating in the portal in time (an existing issue)**

> Billing is wrong. Paid my bill completely in September but as of yesterday, 10/17/24, it displays as not paid. Tried calling, left two messages for a callback and nothing. VA payment system is totally incompetent.

> Your site shows 71.00 owed, that was paid on 8/10/2024. Your site shows last update as of 8/5/2024. Very poorly run!

**Service design challenges:**

> I was trying to pay my copay that was sent to collections. I was unaware of this copay until I received a collection notice. The lady I spoke with on the phone was not very sympathetic to my issue so she said I have to just take it up with the collection agency.

> Unfortunately, what I needed was not an option.  Dispute the effective date of my dependents in relation to this debt.  Per DFAS there is no record of a change in my dependents, they search back until 2009.  If there is no change how is there a date.  The debt is collected but DFAS cannot return the funds withheld from my retire pay to offset the disability payment.  VA needs to enter this change into the system with the actual effect date.  Can you assist?
