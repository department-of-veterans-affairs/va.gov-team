# **Standard Medallia Survey Data on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)** 

Veterans currently submit regular feedback about their [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) experience while visiting the site through [two different surveys.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/accessing-and-utilizing-contact-center-data#AccessingandUtilizingContactCenterData-WhattoDoWiththeData) 

This portion of the report analyzes the two open field text responses gathered from these two surveys.

1. **Medallia Feedback Survey:** Accessed by clicking the blue ‘feedback’ button located at the bottom of most [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) pages. In reports this is known as `VA.gov VFS Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks, “What task were you trying to do today?”  
      
2. **Medallia Intercept Survey:** Randomly intercepts 5% of [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) visitors who have had a 20-second or more session.  In reports this is known as `VA.gov A11 Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks, “Why did you select that rating?”

All survey responses analyzed here are from respondents who visited and referenced pages in any part of the /manage-va-debt/ experience between August 1 - 31, 2025.

The following section aggregates the themes from the two above open text field questions.

## **Many responses and most complaints express frustration with Veterans’ payment and debt information not being up to date, despite having made payments.**   

* “I paid my CO Pay bill on 8/152025 and it still shows that I owe money.**This should update like all commercial accounts within 72 business hours**.”  
* “I made a payment, and it has come out of my account, and yet on your page **it doesn't even track pending.  and it still shows I owe it, you need to get up with Tech, I am okay if there is a waiting period before paid off, but you should at least show pending,** it made me think I didnt hit the submit button.”  
* ‘I noticed a bill for $5.00. I've paid it. I have a receipt for the transaction.  No options available except to call the VA or come in. **Ridiculous waste of my time because your records aren't correct.”**  
* All good for my purposes today, except my **co-pays never seem to be updated in the "What You Owe" section\! I am current \- VA is always saying that I am overdue.** Please fix that at some point. TY.

## **Many responses communicate the desire to understand individual debts in more detail and review real-time payment history against debt** 

* “Please make a page that shows payments that were made against VA debt. I can see my debt going down but have **no way to track when the VA takes my GI bill money as payment.”**  
* “**Where can I see payment history**?”  
* “I have a bill with absolutely **no explanation regarding breakdown** or anything else.”  
* “I wish this page was easier to navigate. **I'd like to see the debt repayment plan** but instead I only see the amount. I would like to see how they came to the exact amount.”

## **Many responses convey a high level of general satisfaction with site usability and information accessibility.  Some praise and express gratitude towards VA staff who have helped them on the phone and in person.**

* “All of my interactions with the VA personnel both on person and on phone have been **exceptional**\!”  
* “**Easy** to use\!”  
* “Gave **great information**, and it was easy to follow”  
* “I feel the va.gov website is the **greatest thing ever**\!  It is so simple to use, easy to navigate, and everything I need to know is at my fingertips.  Even using the email to contact people is an excellent tool to use for quick responses.  **I'm grateful for this website and for all the VA accomplishes for us Vets**.”

## **Some responses complain about needing 2FA with phones to login and wish there weren’t as many reroutes and logins.**

* “**I find it harder to manage where I need to go between VA Health Net and va.gov I am older now and signing in is difficult** now and I find it difficult to go to where I find my bill my co-pay bill  
* “Multiple logon options creates confusion with usernames and passwords. why are there so many different logon options. keep it simple. and each logon takes you to a different page. Additionally, I have a debt but there's zero explanation of why the debt exists or what caused the debt. **How hard is it to itemize and provide an explanation of a debt? Make it make sense.”**  
* “I HATE the new log-in system. **I'm not a kid, attached to my cel phone.** I don't want to have to get up, and get my phone, just so I can log into my desktop.”  
* **“Routing to another website to pay my co-pay is inefficient and can be remedied by a few lines of code.”**

### **Some respondents are unable to pay bills because they can’t access key required information** 

* “It shows I owe for co-payments but I have not received any bills for these charges.  And **without the bill, it is not possible to make a payment online as the form requires information that would only be found on the bills** that I have not received.”  
* “Pay my debt but **no one has given me my receivable number.** And when I tried to follow the instructions, nothing works.”  
* “Pay VA education debt. **The info on my page apparently does not match the payment info that I need to input in order to access they payment portal and I have been locked ou**t from trying to pay online.”  
* “I have not received the debt/demand letter; therefore i cannot make a payment online because **I have not been provided a file number**.  The notice states that they will reduce my monthly payments until the debt is paid; however, there is not amount t listed for the reduction each month and the length of time is not specified.  I have no recourse but to sit back and wait.  This appears to be a lack of competence by the VA to provide detailed information to the veteran.”

# **Custom Financial Management Medallia Survey for Financial Status Report (VA form 5655\)** 

In addition to the two standard surveys, the Financial Management Team has created a custom survey to monitor the experience for VA form 5655, a financial status report form, which a Veteran submits to request help with VA debt for overpayments and bills.

To access the custom survey, Veterans first complete and submit the [Financial Status Report (5655)](http://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction). On the confirmation page, Veterans may click on a blue “Provide feedback” button to access the survey, which consists of six questions. Responses are optional. In reports this is known as `VA.gov Debt Portal Questionnaire`.

# **Monthly CSAT Score for Debt Portal (Quantitative data from all 3 surveys combined)**
