# Debt Portal & eFSR Medallia Report: August 2024

## Debt Portal

**Summary and opening:**

Similar recurring issues are being echoed by Veterans filling out the Medallia feedback form month-to-month, in the past year, since October 2023.

Since May 2024, the VODA team has been working with VBA and VHA SME's and stakeholders to create a solution to address the problems voiced by Veterans.

The top issues described by Veterans that recur every month are mainly 
**1) issues with findability and navigation and 
2) issues with payments made by Veterans not posting to the debt portal**

The new solution created by the team will address these difficulties for  both  the VBA path and the VHA path by:

-   Re-organizing the information architecture (IA) with one thing per page to improve findability and navigation (minimizing the clutter on the debt details page by separating debt details and ways to resolve)
-   Adding a payment history table where Veterans can view their recent transactions (payments made) and pending charges, in addition to the latest statement data.
-   Specific to VHA, adding VHA copay details that do not currently exist in the portal and simplifying the VHA copay details that are available in the debt portal so that they are easy to view and understand.

The first of 3 incremental releases for VBA payment history will happen this month (September 2024). Veterans will be able to see balance increases and decreases for VBA overpayments.

The VHA payment history usability & comprehension study will take place this month, allowing us to validate this path and achieve consistency across both streams (VBA and VHA).

2 responses (qualitative and/or quantitative)

The findings on the VHA copay pages mirror the findings in the July 2024 report.

**Due to inaccurate/delayed balance due, Veterans that have recurring copay bills are reporting that they are having difficulty tracking how much they truly owe**

**Month to month, we are hearing about the dissatisfaction with payments due being inaccurate. This further reinforces the necessity of a more accurate and recent balance due.**

> Current balance is 3 weeks old

> Check in my Debt balance. Unfortunately it is wrong. I've had a ZERO balance for months now, because I keep it paid by checking on my balance with the VA Billing Department.  Why can't this screen show ZERO when there is NO outstanding debt ?

> I paid my $70  bill why doesn't it show ? Could you please explain ?

**There are also recurring difficulties with findability and navigation on the VHA copay paths. This increases cognitive burden and makes it difficult for Veterans to complete their task/action, such as making a payment.**

> Looking for path to find how much I owe and need to pay. Could not find it.

> it is still hard to find information on the site

> I wanted to see my current copay balance; it was nowhere to be found.

> This site is very hard to navigate. The login process is almost impossible to get thru sometimes.

**Account number difficulty**

> Can't pay my bill without an account number which I have no idea what that is because I never received anything regarding it

> I do not have a hard copy of my Co-Pay bill since traveling out of USA.  I can find what I have due, but cannot make payment because I don't have all the account numbers from the statement.

> paying co-pay online, should transfer information.  I shouldn't have to look up my number.

**Site is down (N = 2)**

> Kind of hard to pay co-pay if site is continuously down. And the fact that NO One at the VA gives a damn about it nor do they fix the issue.

> website is incredibly slow to load and times out

> I was trying to find my priority group to figure out what health benefits I have. I could not find this information.

7 responses (qualitative and/or quantitative)

**A desire to see debt letters explaining the overpayment charge details (N = 1)**

> Trying to see the letter explaining why I received notice of previous overpayment and subsequent amounts now due.  Site should include the letter sent.  Not going to pay the overage until I see the letter with details.  Very willing to pay if there was an error but give me access to the letter.  Thanks.

**A few respondents left positive feedback**

> It has all the information I need in one place.  Easy to use. Very helpful

# eFSR

Central Tendency

General VA trust:

For 44 respondents, the average is a 4.29, the mode is a 5.

Trust in VA Commitment to Veterans

For 43 respondents, the average is a 4.16, the mode is a 5.

We received 10 qualitative responses for the eFSR pages.

**Respondents expressed wanting financial help**

> I tried to pull up form 5655 to complete because I was not made aware of any charges for my medications and need help. This was a disaster and the rep. was absolutely useless AND the website WAS NOT USER FRIENDLY!

> Get financial help to pay my bill like a payment plan. I have had no job since April.

> I'm currently unemployed due to PTSD...  I Need help with my bill

**One respondent expressed difficulty with the account number (also voiced in feedback on the debt portal pages)**

> I was trying to pay my $15 copay bill from March. I believe I already paid by check. Was trying to pay via pay.gov. It wouldn't accept my account number. Whoever designed your website wasn't a Vietnam era vet. It doesn't work for me.
