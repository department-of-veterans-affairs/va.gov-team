## Debt Portal & Financial Status Report Form (eFSR): Summary

152  Veterans left qualitative and/or quantitative feedback on the debt portal pages and FSR pages in May 2024 - consistent with the amount of feedback left in April 2024.

## Quantitative Findings

**Likert Scale: Satisfaction Ratings**

Veterans can leave quantitative feedback on their experience with VA.gov on a scale from 1 to 5, the ordinal data ranges from [not at all satisfied = 1] [dissatisfied = 2] [neither satisfied or dissatisfied = 3] [satisfied = 4] [very satisfied = 5].

**Central Tendency**

Across the measures of satisfaction with VA and VA.gov, on a scale of 1 to 5:

-   The highest measure is for VA.gov Experience, with an average value across [20] respondents 4.15, which is higher than the previous month (April 2024: 3.8 average for 26 respondents). The mode (most commonly occurring rating) is a 5.

Followed by:

-   VA.gov Understanding, with an average across [19] respondents 4. The mode is a 5.
-   General VA trust, with an average across [104] respondents 3.65, which is higher than the previous month. The mode is a 3.

-   Trust in VA Commitment to Veterans across [103] respondents 3.63, which is slightly lower than the previous month. The mode is a 5.

-   Overall Satisfaction with this Site across [38] respondents 1.97, which is lower than the previous month (April 2024: 2.2 average for 34 respondents). The mode is a 1.

## Qualitative Findings

53 respondents left qualitative feedback overall.

28 respondents said they were not able to complete their tasks.

12 respondents said they were able to complete their tasks.

The numbers above are equivalent to the amount of qualitative feedback and whether Veterans were able to complete their tasks in April 2024. This shows that the type of feedback and satisfaction left month-to-month is stable.

# Important Findings:

A few Veterans left feedback describing significant life stressors  that have led to the accumulation of their debt:

**Veteran Feedback:**

`Unable to access debt record and respond to debt letter. As a Gold Star surviving spouse receiving this debt letter and then having to go through this process is horrible. My family has a much bigger debt taken by the loss of my husband rather than a seven hundred dollar education benefit debt. The website was not helpful and unable to provide information that is directly mentioned in the letter as a point of reference.`

This Veterans points out a discrepancy in information provided in the debt letter received and the information on the website.

- This feedback highlights the importance of the principle of consistency across all channels of communication with the Veteran (information contained in VA debt letters, on the debt portal, and in call center communications should match and be consistent to avoid confusion and inspire trust)


**Veteran Feedback:**

A Veteran describes difficulty with balance and debt details findability, and the impact of not receiving housing allowance which resulted in them being unable to finish an education program.

`Trying to check the balance and details on a debt that I shouldn't even be paying. Someone please explain this to me. I am paying a debt because I only went to [redacted] school for two months before I stopped but during those two months I never received any housing allowance which is over $2000. Which is the main reason I quit because I couldn't afford childcare Without housing allowance. Yet Somehow I am the one that owes you all money, but you never paid me my housing allowance and that is bull crap. Not to mention the fact it was during Covid. The mother of my children just up and left me with my two sons three and four years old at the time but I guess that's not good enough reason to help a unemployable veteran in a horrible situation. You guys really [expletive] me with VA G.I. Bill Benefits. Since I've struggled to go to school, I've owed and paid more money to you all than you all have paid to any school. I actually paid for a school that you approved in my letter of eligibility. I paid cash out of my hand for that school and you never paid me back. No housing allowance while I was in that [redacted] school no money back for tuition. It's disgusting.`

**Veteran Feedback:**

A Veteran describes how a new claim decision took too long to resolve which resulted in a debt.

-   Further research is needed to understand why a Veteran can incur new or additional debt while in the claims process.
**-   Additional clarity may be needed to highlight important deadlines and increase Veteran comprehension on the process from end-to-end**

`new claim decision took too long resulting in a debt. it was semi easy to begin a claim.`

**Veteran Feedback:**

**We note that Veterans are cross-referencing information contained in the different VA channels of communication for validity and reassurance, further highlighting the importance of consistency across channels noted above.**

`Confirm validity of a copay statement`

# Overall Findings + Misc. Feedback:

## Needs debt accounting details N = 3

`Need accounting / visibility of my debt and I'm unable to get any details.`

`Look for a breakdown of my debt. There is no such thing`

## Findability and navigation issues N = 6

## Unable to download debt letters or statements N = 3

`I want to get a copy of all 2024 copay statements. The statements I receive by mail have been misplaced. Even though online with Va says this can be done, the path is tortuous`

`I'm attempting to download VA debt letters, but every time I click on the link, I get an error stating I don't have any debt letters.  Clearly I do, as I receive them from the VA every month for performing duties as a reservist.  The VA desperately needs to update their system for better accountability and show all electronic documents.`

`There should be a simple link on the first 'page' that opens 'Get your VA Statements'. It seems like every month I need to seach like I'm looking for and Easter Egg.`

## Payment update discrepancy (an issue described in previous reports) N = 2

`Your copays are about 2 months behind.`

## Sign in difficulties N = 1

`Please disable password change every 6 months. It is completely unnecessary when there's two step/multi factor authentication every time I log on. This required process of changing password every 6 months make this site undesirable, on top of renewing 5 security questions. Also, why can't we use our email as part of the multi factor?`

`I just want to see how much my bill is and keep getting pushed from site to stie, logged out, no good information to tell me where I need to go to actually view my bill but was able to find some form to sign up to pay my bill. It feels as if the VA doesn't care about actually showing the balance but makes sure to collect money. Why is it so difficult to have a single link from the myhealthevet site? Why is it so difficult to complete one task? Needs an overhaul by far. The website and layout is much worse than it was only a few months ago.`

## Information is not prefilled on pay.gov (whereas it used to be) N = 1

`I attempted to pay a VA invoice & it then directed me to PAY.GOV. I then had to fill out ALL the details. In the past when going directly to PAY.GOV I seem to remember that once your ID was established the program remembered your payment method. This time I had to fill out all the details of the payment method.`

## Account number findability difficulty N = 1

`I am logging in, and i noticed I have a outstanding copayment I need to make. I have either not received my bill yet, or misplaced it. I would like to make the payment online, however I cannot find my account number. I am logged into my account on VA.gov, and nowhere online can i find my account number. Please make this easily accessible.`

## VA Medical: VA copays are more expensive than civilian care provided by Medicare N = 1

`You have a $15 copay shown as unpaid. I paid it online on 04/20/24.  I also want to know why I get multiple co-pays for using the VA?  Last year I spent $300 to $400 on co-pays but can go to my civilian Doctor and pay no co-pays after Medicare deductible is met.  I'm told you can't bill Medicare. I want to know why a Veteran has to spend more money on the VA than for Civilian healthcare? This is not fair and sucks for all Veterans. Get the VA to be able to bill Medicare because we paid for it!`

# Steps being taken by VFS Debt Resolution team

The VFS Debt Team is currently working with VHA and VBA to implement payment history on the debt portal. The addition of payment history will result in a significant UX improvement for Veterans utilizing the portal to resolve their VA debt, addressing issues such as: finding debt information, finding account number information, viewing payment history, and streamlining actions the Veteran can take to address the debt by making the action links more prominent.
