## Medallia Feedback: February 2024

## Debt Portal Feedback

**Summary and opening:**

More than 300 Veterans left qualitative feedback on the debt portal pages in February 2024.

*The majority of challenges described include:*

**1.  How much do I owe**

*I can't see what my amount due is.*

*just trying to find out what I owe. why can't a government agency function like a private company. why make it so hard. What do I owe? My time is more valuable too waste time trying to find out what I owe.*

*I have no bill at this time. How much do I owe. Check? Where do I send.*

**2.  Preferring to receive bills by mail**

*Haven't received any billing for copays. Have no idea what is due. I PAY by bills. Send me a bill please.*

*Find out why I wasn't billed for the co-pay that was included in this application and what it was for??*

*I can't pay a bill that you haven't send to me ? Send a bill, I'll always pay it !*

*I usually receive a paper bill in the mail when I have a balance due. I want to continue with paper bills.*

**3.  Needing to wait for the bill in the mail to know the amount owed**

*In response to my email notification I signed in to review the details of my outstanding VA copay. Unfortunately, this site just directs me to pay.gov, which I have no problem doing that BUT it is impossible to pay when I don't even know what the outstanding amount is!! Logically, one would think if you receive an email that says sign in to review details of the copay then the details would be provided. Why even email if I still have to wait to get a copy of the bill in the mail before I can pay it? Am I missing something here??*

*Statement for CoPay was never mailed to me this month. How am I suppose to pay something when I don't know what or how much it is? I've NEVER been late with CoPay payments.*

**4.  I always pay my bills on time - why do I get these notifications?**

*I want to know why they keep sending me a debt management message because I haven't paid a bill WHEN I HAVE PAID MY BILLS. I ALWAYS SEND MY PAYMENT IN THE DAY AFTER I RECEIVE MY BILL, BUT I KEEP GETTING THESE HARASSING MESSAGES ABOUT A PROBLEM WITH PAYING MY DEBT. I'M TIRED OF THIS. MY BILLS ARE BEING PAID. WHY DO YOU DO THIS? IS IT BECAUSE YOU JUST LOVE TO HARASS VETERANS FOR NO REASON WHAT-SO-EVER? AM NOT IN DEBT. QUIT HARASSING ME. YOU PEOPLE ARE SENDING THESE HARASSMENT MESSAGES OUT BEFORE I EVEN GET THE BILL. WHY????*

*Stop idiotic emails about VA debt ... i pay my VA benefits health care "debt" on time every month. i am never late. stop disrespecting me and spamming my email account with bogus debt collection notices!!!*

*I received an email saying I owe a copay. I pay my copays EVERY month. The email led me here "to find out about the copay balance" Instead of helping me this site want to make me sign up for some bullshit. HOW MUCH DO I OWE, AND FROM WHEN? I DO NOT WANT TO SIGN UP FOR THIS BULLSHIT.*

**5.  Desire to see details on copays to understand why they are being billed**

*It would be nice if dates of appointments were given. No way I can go back in my records to verify I paid or did not pay the copay. All of my visits have have been paid by credit card.*

*Trying to ask about a copay bill. I wanted to see the details of what the copay is for and can't find a way to see the original bill. I never received this bill. There are a lot of -- is this a mistake?*

*Identify the VA debt. please ITEMIZE bills so I can understand what I owe.*

**6.  Payment update discrepancy (an issue described in previous reports)**

*It says I have a copay due! I paid it January 21, 2024! It is currently February 19, 2024. And no way to correct that or state I have paid it! Only to wait until Monday thru Friday and call the 800 number! This is unacceptable it's almost 30 days out! It took my money out the day I paid it.*

*Why do I get emails telling me I have a balance due only to be told on this page I have no balance ?*

**7.  Phone support difficulty** 

*Been hung up on after lengthy wait times 3 times now. The website you refer me to just refers me back to this number.*

*I would like to pay my Copay. However I have dialed the 866 number multiple times and was on hold. I find it difficult to fill out the GovPay form each time to pay my bills. My banking ACH info should already be on file .*


## FSR Feedback

Less than 20 Veteans left qualitative feedback on the FSR pages. 

**Quotes from feedback:**

*I am trying to get financial and legal assistance. I have been homeless and jobless for over three years now. I have medical and legal bills that I need help to paying. I did not do these crimes. So far this site has been very helpful for me. Thank you very much.*

*We cannot pay bill because we don't know how much it is or what it is for.*

*I have been making payments on my outstanding VA statement but never being able to pay it off in full. I am an 80 year old handicapped Veteran on a limited budget and pay what I can. For the first several years I was not charged for VA medical service. Then in the past I was refund what I paid in the previous year but that has not happened for year 2024. Please review my account and offer any help for future and past payments. Thank You*

*I am disturbed that a year old charge has appeared several times. I thought I had paid for those sessions earlier-I thought I remembered some of those sessions were paid for, previously.*
