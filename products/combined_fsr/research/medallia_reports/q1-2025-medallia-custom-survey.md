**FSR Form Bugs**

Approximately 12 Responses 
> "The section about prior employment wouldn't let me input dates. I also had to try and submit the request 5 different times. It kept telling me I couldn't do it and there was an issue on the VA's end of things"

*Submitted on 10/25/2024*
^ This is a known error that was fixed on 1/7/2025. 

> "The form blanks out the mortgage payment amount every time it is submitted online so it does not factor into the claim"

*Submitted on 11/14/2024*

> "The descriptions for Extended Monthly Payments and Compromise are swapped/inversed, so I made an error due to this, and had to fill out a 2nd time and resubmit."

*Submitted on 12/6/2024*
^ This content error has been fixed.



**Service Design**

Approximately 12 Responses 
>"I wish I could fill 5655 once a year and not have to submit every month to request relief. My income doesn't change and a complete waste of resources."

> "I wish I could have a yearly exemption"

> "why do I keep having to fill this out. Info doesn't change"

> "We have "assets" but with both of us unemployed for 4 months it would help to clarify which relief I'm applying for - I'm requesting help for my bills until we can get back to a normal predictable income. Husband is starting a new job but I'm still job searching. My current gig is very physical and I don't know how much longer I can do it, as a disabled veteran. It may be more hurt than the income is help."

> "Had a part-time job currently but next month will not be able to work no more due to physical abilities"

>"I was not able to access my bankruptcy information.I do not have the case number and could not find it online. I filed in [location] in 2008 but have no records."
