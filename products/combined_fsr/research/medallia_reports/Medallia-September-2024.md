# Debt Portal & eFSR Medallia Report: September 2024

# Debt Portal

## Summary and opening:

Similar recurring issues have been echoed by Veterans filling out the Medallia feedback form month-to-month, in the past year, since October 2023.

Since May 2024, the VODA team has been working with VBA and VHA SME's and stakeholders to create a solution to address the problems voiced by Veterans.

The top issues described by Veterans that recur every month are mainly 

1) Issues with findability and navigation 

2) Issues with payments made by Veterans not posting to the debt portal

3) Issues of life hardship and financial hardship

The new solution created by the team will address the difficulties pertaining to issues #1 and #2 for  both the VBA path and the VHA path.

- The VBA payment history initiative was tested in a usability and comprehension study with Veterans in July 2024 with positive results. 
Development started in September and the first of iterative releases happened in September. 

- The VHA payment history initiative is currently being tested in a usability and comprehension study with Veterans and will be reported on later this month. 
If it tests positively as well, development can begin shortly after. 

We expect that the solutions offered by the changes we are making to the VA debt portal including the additions of timely payment transactions reflected in the portal, copay bill description details surfaced sooner and more prominently in the portal, the break out of separate pages for resolution options and debt/copay bill details, will result in significant enhancements to findability, navigation, and understanding of Veteran VA copay bills and VA debt and the issues we are aware of today. 

The other piece that will be important to tackle will be the service design component to assist Veterans with life hardships or special needs better navigate the resolution process so they don't face further financial hardship related to VA debts and copay bills. 

## Overall Feedback

## Qualitative Findings

### Were you able to do your task today?

Yes = 7

No = 37

## Important Findings:

**VA.gov Experience: Why did you select that rating?**

- **Character limit confusion on the account number (an issue we are aware of and working to resolve)**

> The characters for entitled member (7) and the input of the information on the pay.gov (6 characters) have a mis-matched.  need to get this fixed.

- **Several Veterans left positive feedback.**

Examples:

> most of this i can understand easy enough.

> Easy to use.

> I had no problem logging in or finding what I needed

> I found what I wanted, quickly.

> User friendly

> found the site easy to navigate to complete my transaction

- **At least 2 Veterans said the information on the website is inconsistent with information they receive from customer support or communications from VA:**

> Because information on the website is inconsistent with letters or information that customer support personnel may have.

> The information from my email link is different than what is stated when I log into my account. That's confusing.

- **One Veteran says that while waiting for an itemized breakdown for their overpayment debt, their overpayment debt was escalated to the Department of the Treasury:**

> I have been trying to get an itemized breakdown for my overpayment debt for a year now to check the numbers for accuracy. I have been stone walled and delayed and still do not have an answer. The last few times I have called I have asked if I should pay the debt while I am awaiting an response as to the days of overpayment. I was told that the case would not be sent to debt collection or the treasury and would not incur additional interest while I awaited an answer. The debt has now been referred to the treasury and has more than doubled from the best estimate I have. I have paid the debt today and will be seeking restitution for this overcharge while I await the originally requested breakdown of debts. I have lost all trust for the VA debt management center.

- **A Veteran describes how their co-pay increased, which they find out about on the debt portal. This did not match up with what they received in the mail:**

> Because I recently paid a Co-Payment amount and then today I received a bill in the mail stating that I owe $73.52 still and that it is being handled by a collections company, I go on line to try to figure this out and the va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/copay-balances says the amount owe is $459.34.  The VA is so screwed up right now. I recently had a travel claim rejected and then when I brought it to their attention is was paid in full, with an apology. Why can't the VA get people who can do their jobs correctly? Not everything is bad, I like the folks I work directly with and the medical is decent. That's why I rated "Somewhat bad."

- **Issues with payments posting late:** 

> The record of copays is significantly late in showing posting of payments made.

> Items and Information not updated regularly, and system is slow.

- **Silent error report:**

/manage-va-debt/summary/debt-balances/details/30403

> links that just go in circles

> New system has a lot of starts and stops.. "please wait while we load.." also jumps around a lot to empty pages or "authenticating.. please wait" Flow of app from one page to another is not smooth.

- **A Veteran says their dependents change was unsuccessful and resulted in an overpayment:**

> I tried several times to get my ex wife off of my dependents list and it never took. Finally when it did take effect my three sons were also removed even though they should have remained. Why is it that I have to provide proof numerous times of my divorce? Why is it that my kids were removed as dependents when they are still my dependents? The ONLY person that should have been removed is my ex wife. The web site is flawed and frequently does not work. Now you claim that I owe you money?! This is garbage. I want a representative, but when I try to reach out I get no responses. Y'all are pissing me off.

- **Having to enter the payment form every time:**

> It's frustrating having to redo the payment form every time I want to pay my bill.

- **Difficulty for seniors:**

> to hard to navigate (too many steps) especially for seniors.

### What task were you trying to do today?

- **A Veteran says it would be helpful to speak with a financial advisor:**

> I'm looking to talk to somebody about financial decisions. Whether I should do consolidation or bankruptcy or if they have other options. You talk hardship it's only about owing you money? Loans are only about homes but you say in one area and then you have the same thing under homes. I just want to sit with somebody and ask them what they think by my situation it would be best if I get a consolidation loan and how to get one in my situation or go into bankruptcy. All I'm seeing is about houses or people coming back from war in transition I don't see a generic or general way to speak to a financial advisor

**Comment:** *Being able to speak to a financial counselor for personalized help on the best option for them is an idea that we have also heard in our studies with Veterans.*

- **Frustration with filling out the form for paying a copay and the account number not being prefilled on the next page:**

> Pay my copay. Why is it so hard to "fill out the form?" If I'm clicking the link from my account, then my 5 part account number and name should be filled in already. Why is it so hard to find my 5 part account number? Do you guys even test or use the website after you cobble it together? What a joke. I regret ever serving, you guys make it abundantly clear you don't give a crap about us based on the myriad of issues we encounter daily, most of which have simple and easy solutions. But the miniscule budget for the VA makes mountains out of molehills.

- **Issues with findability:**

For copay pages: 

> Find my monthly copay bill for pharmacy

> hello having a issue locating copay payment history...  : (

For VBA debt pages:

> View my debt letter.

- **Payments made not posted even though a few months have gone by:**

> see if the $45 I sent the check in for back in July had been posted , this page still shows $45 prescription co-pay outstanding. Why ?

> Check on a bill I have already paid. Dated June 10. Paid June 19

> I've made 2 payments on Pay.gov, and they seem to not reflect here.  I'd like my information to be updated.  I have the bank records to prove this has happened.  Please correct the information so it doesn't reflect I'm behind in my payments.  Thank you.

> Why doesn't my PAID co pay ever get updated?

> Clear the existing balance of payment due on my VA account of $23.00..I contacted the VA and spoke with [name], who informed me that my balance was 0....I then asked why it continues to show on My VA as $23.00 due?....she responded that it will always show up..I asked why the balance due was not corrected....she responded that's how it works....does not update....

> I have paid this copay 2 times and it still shows I owe $30.00 Why?!

- **Life and health hardships and the added burden of financial hardships and debt**

> I have 5-7 medical office visits 200 mile round trip going back a year. I received $0 in travel pay. The system is so backed up antiquated or just plain doesn't work. I also tried to get My mother My God Bless her soul. Removed from my award in Late December again in early January. I called back again in March. Trying to get this taken care of now nearly  10 months later I have a debt. I pretty sure if I get compensation for these 208 mile round trips. [Name of city]TO [Name of city] I'll probably be in the black. It took me half the day to get verified and to get 1 of these systems to let me in. I filled out travel pay at the v.a. [city name] at the kiosks now I don't have the dates times etc. all just so slow and behind but the veteran has to be held responsible regardless of how responsible we try to be in informing the V.a. of what's going on and what we need done on our file. So not only am I still mourning my mother literally I've cried today multiple times but now I have a debt that despite taking hours to get in the system I can't even see the debt. It's unavailable. Even though you guys sent me a email. I have anxiety and a diagnosed heart condition. This is really unacceptable.

> Resolution and waiver of final debt. I'm 35 years service connected disabled. VA has been siphoning my disability since 2015 for a 15 year old debt that should not exist. over 60k has been stolen thus far. I'm PTSD triggered by this and suicidal. tis last 10K must stop asap.

- **Wanting to see a record of past copay payments**

> Obtain a record of my VA copay payments for the year 2023. They cannot be viewed online and calling 800-400-1238 only got me to a representative who told me the only way to obtain my information is to wait for it to be mailed to me via USPS which is very slow. Why isn't this available to me online?

- **The balance of money owed to the Department of the Treasury ($0) is not matching with what a Veteran sees in the V.A. debt portal.**

> Collections have been taken out of my military LES. Where can I see how much money I have paid back to the V.A.? The Department of Treasury was holding deductions out of my military pay and sending to the V.A... Department of Treasury shows I have a $0.00 balance, but the V.A. still says I owe $622.53. I want to see all the monies the V.A. was sent from the Dept of Treasury. Where can I find how much I have paid the V.A. back?

- **Expecting to see a bil in the mail, finding out about an outstanding balance only after signing on to the website:**
  
> I am looking at my statement for September wondering why I have not received a bill in the mail yet.  I had no idea I had an outstanding balance until  I signed on to the website.  I have never had any issue with receiving invoices in the past.

- **Account number findability if they don't have their mail.**

> Where can I find my account number if I don't have mail?

- **Difficulty with making a payment and ensuring the payment has been received by V.A.:**

> Make a payment to settle my co-pay debt. When I try in person, the cashier is not there, and now it is permanently closed. I sent a check for 100.00 and got a check back for 52.00 and my bill remained. I don't know or trust the govt anymore. I also don't know how to resolve the problem. I just leave it hoping you will take the amounts from my disability, which you sometimes do, but I keep having to pay fines, overages, and office fees and whatnot. In short, your system sucks.
