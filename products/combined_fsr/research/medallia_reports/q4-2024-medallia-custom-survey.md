Approximately 66 Responses 
Most responses included "None" and "N/A".

>"The VA has streamlined this process so well. I have seen personally over the years it get easier to complete! Thank you!" 

>"So far none. I like the VA.gov site better than myhealthevet. The graphics aren't hodgepodge like the other, looks more polised and much easier to navigate. Myhealthevet is a mess. Good job! Stay safe!"

>"The online form is very straightforward and simple to complete. In my opinion, nothing on the online form requires change."

>"None it was easy for someone who does not no much about computers"

**Suggestions for Improvement: Digital FSR Form-specific**

Approximately 21 Responses
>"Under Household expenses there was no where to indicate phone/internet or tv. Also under the assests you asked for the value of my home, but not for how much I owed on it."

>"Allow a section for explanation of why I cannot pay my co-pay due to limited income"

>"I pay my mortgage w/ taxes & insurance in escrow. It would be easier if the mortgage & escrow were an option for data input."

>"Would like to see a change to the expenses part to include affidavit of support from uscis also include an over time section also for the relief option the box would not update when I typed and saben to review so i don't know the issue there"
>
Credit card debt
>"Add a place for credit card debts, add life insurance payments, remove the educational benefits portion for the reviewing agreement statement."

>"The expenses line only allows for loans when a lot of debt is also in credit card debit. Adding this in will contribute to a more open field of understanding where debt and payments are going."

**Service Design: Veteran's interactions outside the digital FSR form and other changes needed outside of digital form**

Approximately 13 Responses 

>"I filed for MST and was told because of this I would not have a bill"

>"I do find it confusing why you ask how much I have in my checking account on the first question, then the second question is how much money I have in my checking and savings accounts. In my case, I only have a checking"

>"WHO SAVES BANKRUPTCY INFORMATION FOR MORE THAT 10 YEARS....VA MORTGAGE LOAN OFFICE HAS HISTORY OF IT"

>"The Form isn't the issue, it is that the [redacted] VA who said that I'm only a tier 3 Veteran and that even though I am unable to work since 10/23 there is no actual way to take care of the issue that my ONLY income is what the VA gives me but They keep trying to take it because my taxes say I made $20,000 in 2023 and they just can't help me until 2025 WTH and you wonder why Veterans are having so many mental health issues. The VA treats vets like they should be happy to be treated by crap by staff. Customer service reps need to either be reminded they need vets to keep their jobs and get some better training for customer service. Please forward to the person that can actually do that. So far everyone i run into says it's not their job. UGH... Thank you"

Spouse
>"Be able to choose more than one option for solutions if open to more than one. Add an option for separated in the married or single section."

>"Add separated for the Veteran when putting income as my husband has disability and receives all the funds as I have none at this time."

**Sitewide**

Approximately 6 Responses  

>"Make is easier to find and simpler to use. The website is too bright why is there no dark mode? this site hurts my eyes"
