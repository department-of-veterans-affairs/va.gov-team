# **Monthly [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) Medallia Survey Data Report: December 2025**

## *Data time span: December 1 \- 28, 2025*

# **Standard Medallia Survey Data on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)** 

Veterans currently submit regular feedback about their [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) experience while visiting the site through [two different surveys.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/accessing-and-utilizing-contact-center-data#AccessingandUtilizingContactCenterData-WhattoDoWiththeData) 

This portion of the report analyzes the two open field text responses gathered from these two surveys.

1. **Medallia Feedback Survey:** Accessed by clicking the blue ‘feedback’ button located at the bottom of most [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) pages. In reports this is known as `VA.gov VFS Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks, “What task were you trying to do today?”  
      
2. **Medallia Intercept Survey:** Randomly intercepts 5% of [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) visitors who have had a 20-second or more session.  In reports this is known as `VA.gov A11 Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks, “Why did you select that rating?”

All survey responses analyzed here are from respondents who visited and referenced pages in any part of the /manage-va-debt/ experience.

The following section aggregates the themes from the two above open text field questions.

## **Many responses report general satisfaction with the website, stating they “found what they needed,” and describing it as “user friendly” and “easy.”**

* “It’s progressively user friendly everytime I come back to the site”

* “​​Simple, Understandable, Quick, and Easy”

* “I find it easy to navigate and find what I am looking for”


## **Many responses express confusion and frustration about inaccurate balances and out of date payment history.** 

* “I thought I had paid this bill long ago, but I just paid it again.  I’m not sure if it didn’t go through months ago?”

* “I have been billed for medications related to hypertension and have repeatedly requested it be corrected. Only started I think this year not sure about previous years. This causes financial stress as I'm on fixed income. The account billing information is always not up to date seems its intentional to generate late charges.”

* “Cannot identify what co-pays I owe. I already paid the bill that they say I owe.  Can you update the system?”

## **Many responses report difficulty accessing debt documentation. Some expect all debt letters will be available online, and others report they are unable to understand debts with available documentation.**

* “Trying to view my VA debt. It says I have two but only shows one. When viewing the one it shows dates letters where sent out, but no way to download them if you no longer have a copy (there is no copy in your VA claims document section either, already checked). Information about debts are inaccurate. Should also add payment history put toward debt each month so veterans have a transparent view of where they stand and projected payoff date. Outside of calling the debt line there is no other way to get accurate updated information. This section could use an overhaul to be honest”  
    
* “I'm trying to see My Va communication letters in reference to a debt I'm told I owe. As a widow, I can't see what I need to see. Y'all should be embarrassed  censoring info from widows”  
    
* “I don't understand my debt. The letters are confusing and I dont understand what is actually owed”

* The VA claims I owe a debt but did not provide much in the way of determining why I owe it. I had to sit down and talk with my VA representative at my school, a luxury I will not be able to do with my next university, to figure out the details. An itemize receipt would be greatly appreciated in the future. Receiving a vague 30 day till due notice, during my Thanksgiving dinner of all things, without details regarding exactly was/is frustrating. Please send a secured link with an itemized bill or detailed instructions next time”

## **Some complain about the payment process being difficult and confusing and ask for a more seamless experience.**

* “Finding the payment page is very confusing, hard to find.”

* “Pay my copay bill. I attempted to complete the form but it would not allow me? I left va.gov and went to my other account at pay.gov and completed the transaction. Something is wrong at va.gov?”

* “Please allow me to save my payment information and use AUTO-PAY for an VA payments I need to make. I risk being late, because I do not get notified except by USPS I have an outstand payment amount.”  
    
* “Why do I have to keep logging in when I try to pay my medication bill? Make this all function as one.”

## **Some responses state the website is difficult to navigate and slow.** 

* “The new website is extremely difficult to navigate, the old one was much easier”

* “The form was easy but the site was slow and took several days and attempts to finish.”

* “Site needs a good "geek update", go through and modernize the site while keeping it secure to match walgreens or Kroger's pharmacy setup online and how it let's you autofill and is more user friendly in many ways”

## **Some responses express gratitude for VA staff, especially VA Healthcare staff.**

* “The staff at Chalmers P. Wyle always takes very good care of me. I am very happy with the service I receive here. Keep up the good work, thanks.”

* “So far I have been happy with my VA. The Doctors are very competent and the bill pay works great.”

* “Since i have been in the va health system you all have treated me in a very great manner and always provided the best everyone was and is very respectful, attentive to all my needs, caring and most of highly professional.”

## **A few responses report difficulties with login**

* “Repetitive login is troublesome and a pain”

* “SEEMS LIKE ALOT OF STEPS TO GET IN TO MY ACCOUNT”

* “Why do I have to keep verifying my identity over and over and over\! Absolutely ridiculous\! The stupidius Most life draining process\! I'm so pissed off” 

# **Custom Financial Management Medallia Survey for Financial Status Report (VA form 5655\)** 

In addition to the two standard surveys, the Financial Management Team has created a custom survey to monitor the experience for VA form 5655, a financial status report form, which a Veteran submits to request help with VA debt for overpayments and bills.

To access the custom survey, Veterans first complete and submit the [Financial Status Report (5655)](http://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction). On the confirmation page, Veterans may click on a blue “Provide feedback” button to access the survey, which consists of four questions. Responses are optional. In reports this is known as `VA.gov Debt Portal Questionnaire`.

* “Nothing, Very simple and fast.”

* “Your form is clear, and easy to use.”

**Some reported confusion about how to capture income when factoring in VA benefits or that there were errors in their income.**

* “It was confusing because My monthly disability money is around $770.00. Their should be a question like, "What is your normal amount of income. And then, "Was your normal amount reduced as repayment for a debt with the VA?" "If so..what is your normal amount paid to you?"

* “The income field used my old income and not my updated award which may result in my waiver being rejected. The website also kept kicking me off and losing my place.”

* “The SS income says how much do you receive, so I am assuming that is with Medicare already taken out.”

A few requested quicker follow-up from the VA about 5655 status

* “This is the second time I filled out this same form in 30 days, with no response from the first request.”

* “Please let the vet know the decision asap.”

# **Monthly CSAT Score for Financial Management**

Our report tracks the data recorded in the CSAT score dashboard in the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) [Domo tool](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1545882322). We have filtered directories by ‘manage va debt’ to include all of the surveys referencing pages with /manage-va-debt.
