Open text field provided.

**45 Qualitative Responses total**

### None, NA, N/A, no suggestions, positive feedback

17 Responses

> Honestly best experience Iâ€™ve ever had filling out a VA form

> Keep the form as it is.

> Very easy process

> I think the process was very easy.


### Suggestions for Improvement, FSR Form-specific: 

### Final Review

> The mandatory check box selection That shows up to complete this waiver mentions an education debt and the debt that I have is not education. There was no way to correct this and the only way to complete this waiver request is to select the wrong thing.

### Bankruptcy Section

> My Bankruptcies are in the distant past, more than 20 years ago. I no longer have any records of these.  Also, my credit cards are not listed in the expenses. And I have an high interest line of credit with CashNetUSA that I did not know how to input to this form.

> Date of BankRupsy

> Closed bankruptcy shouldnt require details unless it is a current bankruptcy. No one has those details memorized. Also how much my 23 year old truck is worth shouldn't matter. Living expenses versus assets doesn't mean squat when you don't have the money. The assets are ready made cash.

> bankruptcy history does not allow a bankruptcy over 15 years

### Income

> An example of a paystub with deductions listed.


### Expenses Section

> to remember that not everyone lives in a home .. many live in mobile homes that have different bills to pay.

> Better number to call with correct extension when help is needed with the hours of operation so not to waste time or add to queue.

> It would be nice if it remembered the answers from last time.

> It is hard to correlate a one month period and provide reliable assets. It all depends on the billing cycle for  any given month.

> I wasn't sure if you were looking for all my credit card debt or not.  It seemed to ask the question... "are you behind on any credit card debt" which I am not, but it never seemed to ask what my credit card debt was.  A  section seemed to ask for my personal loan and auto loan information.

### Reliefs Options

> Explain fully what i need to do before things get worse for myself and my family before it keeps getting worse.


### Assets

> The assets questions are very vague as it allows a person to list assets but no liabilities attached to it. You should change that question to allow a person so say, yes, I own a travel trailer but there is a loan I am paying on it. Same for car loans.

### Misc

> Maybe some more personal data like um assistance from neighbors

> Left out the option of living with someone or parents

## 4. I would recommend completing this form online instead of paper to another Veteran?

## VA.gov VFS Questionnaire

N = 44 (qualitative responses)

## Recent payments made not reflected on debt portal, processing delays, N = 14

> I made an online payment - I copied your confirmation of payment details - your site IS NOT UPDATED YET ..

> Balance data is confusing.  I've paid this.  It doesn't need to show any longer.

> Wanted to check the balance for my co-pays.  I was not able to do that as the data is old.  Today is 4 Apr 25 and the last update was 8 Feb 25.

> Payment information has not been updated since Jan 2025.  Shows I still owe and I have made all my payments.

> Wanted to check the balance for my co-pays.  I was not able to do that as the data is old.  Today is 4 Apr 25 and the last update was 8 Feb 25.

> reviewing my co-pay and rx bill states i may be overdue. but it also states" if paid after the posted date it will not reflect here". this page should reflect all payments made to clear a "bill over due statement" even after the posted date.

> Pay bill for medication.  I have been signed in and  verified several times.  Was told I never used VA healthcare!  Was told I had no account.  This website never works for me and I have Id.me and login.gov accounts .  Also phone is not answered for     copay phone just goes dead



## Ideas and more detail requested

> I would like to the the payment history of what is currently being taken out each month and the amount owed or the history each 

> Reconcile my account. you show 3 statements only?

> Can you please email me when a payment is due and when a payment has been made. My account shows a payment due and late, but I think I made the payment but there is no way of knowing.

> I was attempting to pay my prescription co-pay.  However, the only time I know how much I owe is if I got to the VA site and I am informed I have a past due bill.  Is there anyway I can keep my credit card on file and have copay placed directly on my credit card when I owe something not being informed after it is overdue?


> Check my co-pay amount due.  Would like to see confirmation of paid bills.

> Pay copay. It's confusing. To me it doesn't make any sense.  Why not have a detailed bill, which shows total amount due?  It truly sucks!

> Checking my debt re my meds ordered. It says I owe money and I do not. System does not update as all other financial systems do. Also it would be better to be available on the phone app to see instead of having to use a computer to find it!

> you make everything so F'n difficult that I can not even pay a debt without filling out form. I will just wait the 60 days and you can bill me automaticlly. I thought the VA was suppose to make thing easier. it's NOT!!!!!!!!!!

## Inconsistent messaging

> Trying to find out why money is being taken out of my disability check if you say I don't have any VA debt??

> It says I have 2 VA debts but when I click on it it says I do no owe the VA any money

> Clown show! Looking for a debt to VA I supposedly owe. last statement I see is from Jan 2025 One place shows a debt of $105.27 another page says I have no debt. a phone call to VA was told I actually have a credit!!!!  SMH! (copay)


## Service Design issues

> My bank account shows a withdrawal of $4,180.97 which I can't see ever receiving, this was my wife's previous monthly check {  } I have to borrow this to get my checking account back above negative. DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN!!!


> I am trying to request my prescription bill be submitted to my new insurance.  I have new insurance as of 1/1/2025.  I brought my card to my appt. 4/4/2025, so it could be updated in the system, but so far this year none of my prescriptions were run through my new insurance.  I call the 1-866-290-4618 number for statement questions at 9:15am PST today, but no answered. Please help me determine how I can have my 2025 prescriptions submitted to my new insurance. Thank you, 

## Misc


> Find out my priority group for my VA medical coverage and the things that would or would not be covered.  Nothing but generalized information.

> Dispute your copay charges - this procedure is incorrect for  [ ]. , OR VA per

> Had i not been just looking around, I would have never noticed the 44 I owe you.  You guys are or have been really good with billing.  I received no such bill this time.....

> See my VA balance and make a payment.  Afer 15 years, it tells me I am not enrolled for VA Health care.

> Identify who put in the wrong mailing address and who corrected it.
