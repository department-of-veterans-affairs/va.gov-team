# Important Qualitative Findings:

## Service Design challenges:


> My account is currently under audit review. They have screwed up my claim since the file date of 2 Aug 2022. I have filed a congressional complaint request for help!

> I've been trying all the month of December to get answers to why my benefits were used to pay medical debts that were not my financial responsibility! I demand answers!

> UPLOAD A WAIVER REQUEST AS A VSO USING MY VA.GOV EMAIL ACCOUNT FOR A CLIENT WITH A DEBT.  VA STATES THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO SUBMIT A WAIVER REQUEST FOR OUR CLIENTS, BUT I DO NOT SEE IT EVEN WORKS.

> We need to achieve a resolution regarding this ongoing inquiry regarding my VA compensation matter.  I submitted a Congressional argument in June to get this mess resolved. No contact has been received by any means from the VA in attempt to resolve this matter nor communicate with me the status or pending resolution. To make matters worse, VA just issued a check for retro-compensation dated Jan 23-22 thru Jan -28-22 in the amount of $[0000.0] on Nov 29 2024. Why would the VA issue a compensation check when there is allegedly a debt. Furthermore, according to this source, the debt has been reduced yet no correspondence from the VA. Someone call me!!!!

> VA USES AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT REFERENCE NUMBERS for referencing a single bill. VA hospital uses two or three, then PAY.GOV USES ANOTHER REFERENCE NUMBER FOR SAME hospital event / treatment / same date / SAME PRESCRIPTION. Then, PAYMENTS ARE LEFT ONLINE AND NEVER UPDATED FOR MONTHS, ONLINE. VA payments agenda is a confusing mess, which requires EXTREMELY CLOSE ATTENTION, so one does not overpay or pay twice.

> I got my bill, paid late, but was also sent to collections. was there another bill , I did not know about,


## Not enrolled in VA health care error message

N = 3 

12/5 - 12/9

>The system tells me I am not enrolled when I am.

> I have a debt to pay, it doesn't show on the debt portal that I have a debt to pay. I got sent in the mail about an overpayment on education benefits.

## VA copay not on debt portal

> I am trying to pay my VA copayment but is not showing up. This site is unfriendly and difficult to sign in. I do not want to be charged a fee because the bill is not showing up. This is my second try, and I am still waiting.

> I got a letter saying I owe $27.64 for co pay. Yet this site says I don't owe anything. What's going on. I've been trying to pay but it says I don't owe anything. Very unhappy with this my healthy vet web site.

## VA debt email / records not accessible

> I was notified via email at 1844 local that there was new information in regards to my debt. I attempted to sign in at approximately 1852 local, only for your system to tell me that my records are not accessible. The VA has an approved FY 2025 Budget of $301 BILLION! Why can you not get a working system, especially one that has had so much money poured into it?!?

> Received a letter saying I owe you money. Is it a scam?  Could not access the website to find this out.

## VA copay records not accessible

12/21 - 12/24

> how can I pay my bill if everytime I log in it says Can't access you copay records

> trying to find out current copay amount and the page keeps saying can't access your financial information at this time, But I have tried several work days last week and got the same message??  This needs to be fixed so I can pay you what I owe you??

> I have been trying for 3 days to access my VA CoPay among due, it keeps tells me that I don't have any and then right below it says it can't access my records? I'm not get any bills so I'm concerned

## Login Difficulty

> The simple act of logging in to the new system and re-ordering a med. Love the VA but c'mon. Glad the co-pay is finally available but the change for the sake of change must have messed up a lot of VETS who are living by themselves and not very fluent in confusing program adaptations when they were able to navigate through the old system just fine.

> Was trying to pay bill though the link on here.  I thought I paid it and suddenly VA.gov asked me to log in again.  Very strange.

## Copay balance discrepancy and expectation 
### (an existing issue repeatedly reported by Veterans for over a year):

> reconcile that my debt was $0 balance. My balance still shows' I owe however I have a 3 week old cashed check showing I have satisfied my debt. There is no reason why in todays electronic world that financial records cannot be reasonably timely recorded. THREE weeks to post to an account is Ludacris.
