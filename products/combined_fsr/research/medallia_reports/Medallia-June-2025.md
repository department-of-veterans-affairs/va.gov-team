## 3. What specific changes, if any, would you like to see in the form to make it more user-friendly and easier?

Open text field provided.

### None, NA, N/A, no suggestions, positive feedback

N = 7

### Positive feedback left

Example quotes: 

> This is one of the easiest forms I have filled out. No changes neccessary.

> form was easy to fill out and has all info I guess they need to decide the outcome.

> None, asked everything I guess they needed.


### Timely feedback given Financial Management team's recent discussions

> In the relief options there is no mention if other relief would be given if the original planned choice does not become approved.


### Top of mind concerns

> Allow for a response on why the veteran is having difficulty paying the debt.

> More specific areas to respond with explanation.  For example, I have a mortgage in my name as the Veteran but do not make any payments due to the divorce decree.  The student loan section could have an explanation section to put, "forbearance" instead of just $0.

> Completing online is lacking a way to correct errors such as expenses.

Accessibilility: 

> Make sure the form is actually accessible. I have tried to access this form on two separate occasions and have been unsuccessful due to system issues.



### Notable feedback to make expenses section more all encompassing 

> There was no option to put on the for the car payments.

>Area for additional expenses

> I pay child support which is a debt I didn't see an option under expenses.


### Banruptcy

> IT DID NOT ASK ME ABOUT MY BANKRUPTCY

> Bankruptcy should have a statue of limitation on timeframe last completed.

> When a bankruptcy is over 25 years old, it's difficult to remember details. I've had an auto accident with brain damage and have cognitive issues so I do NOT remember the details for this question.

> The ability to append a notes such as:  Bankruptcy was Filed 4/21/2025 (Case #


### Income

> Spouse does get benefits, but income is included

### Service design feedback 

> I would like it,if someone  actually responds to me already update me on my status I never receive  any communication  back..and am nit getting the assistance  that I'm needing.

> The fact is I qualify for medicaid as of 3/1/2025 and you have me enter all this data that is not neccessary to solve my issue

> Does not indicate how to apply for permanent relief. I am destitute



### Notable feedback about optimizing UX efficiency on form, navigation, and findability of the form

> ask less information

> would like to see less redundancy when filling out the application. Some of the same information requested is requested again on the form. In this day and age, information should auto format once filled in prior.

### Improving ease  - ideas

> IT WOULD BE BETTER IF A PDF VIEW OF FORM 5655 COULD BE SHOWN AS YOU ARE FILLING OUT THE ELECTRONIC VERSION

> inform the 'reader' to READ! It was so much easier after I READ the instructions.

> For some reason it did not have my benefits or amount on there.


### Marriage options (recurring theme in previous monthly reports)

> Add a section for people that are legally separated

### Uploading supporting documents (uploading documents to forms - recurring feedback in the most recent study as of June 2025 and in May 2025 Medallia Report)

> The form is good as is but I believe it can become more user friendly if it had a place where you could attached supporting documentation.

### Misc

>  Spot to list credit card debt as a lump sum

> If someone feels the mistake was on rthe other party why does the option to have a deduction from each month was not found here

### Explore possible bug 

> I had to constantly go back, refresh the page, and re-log in to get the page to work. Several times throughout, the page would redirect to a "sorry, this page could not be found" banner if I clicked too fast.

> Does not let me fill expenses and a persona statement.  Cuts me off to add this info.  Why?

> Sometimes changes made don't save and that can cause headaches when having to reload a page or something.

## 4. I would recommend completing this form online instead of paper to another Veteran?

# Major Themes in Veteran Debt Portal Feedback (June 2025)

## Positive Feedback 

Number of Positive Comments: 10

Theme: Ease of Use and System Efficiency

Veterans appreciated when the debt portal provided a straightforward, efficient experience that allowed them to complete tasks quickly.

Supporting quotes:

"Easy to do."

"I got the help I needed."

"Just doing some review of my account. Everything looks great"

"Ease of use and speed"

"Computer background and appreciate well designed site."

"requested information was supplied quickly and clearly."

"I had to check my medications, and I had no trouble finding what I was looking for."

"Accessed information quickly"

"Kinda easy"

## 1. Payment Status & Update Delays

* Veterans report significant delays in payment status updates
* Payments made are often still showing as unpaid after weeks or months
* Discrepancies between actual payment status and what appears in the system

> **Example quotes:**
> * "I paid my bill and it still shows as unpaid"
> * "I found that I actually indeed did pay my co-pay, but why does it take so long for the website to be updated Really wow man"
> * "This debt was paid earlier this year and then all of a sudden I get this notification that I still owe money."

## 2. System Navigation & Usability Challenges

* Complex navigation requiring multiple steps to complete simple tasks
* Lack of intuitive design features (like auto-fill for repeat users)
* Need for improved organization of information

> **Example quotes:**
> * "It is just OK. I pay here regularly, yet it doesn't auto fill, which would be helpful. And there is no tab at the top to direct me to the need, I must scroll down."
> * "Pay a VA co-pay. Why do I have to go to a separate site, login, manually enter my account number, manually enter my address and phone number, manually enter the amount of the bill, and manually enter my payment info."
> * "The information I really need takes a long time to sort through things I don't need, just to locate a clinic phone number, to cancel an appointment."

## 3. Lack of Debt Information Transparency

* Difficulty accessing detailed information about why debts were incurred
* Inability to view debt letters or history of payments
* Limited explanation of charges and services

> **Example quotes:**
> * "Was trying to find out specific details about a comp and pen debt... Would like to know what exactly the debt if for, when it started and how much is being taken out each month."
> * "unable to get information about debt. Website does not explain why I have incurred a debt."
> * "What the hell does re-establish mean and why is it on my bill?"

## 4. Feature Requests & System Integration

* Requests for better integration with other VA systems
* Desire for automated payment options
* Need for electronic statements and saved payment methods

> **Example quotes:**
> * "Would like an automated way to pay for prescriptions."
> * "How do we sign up for electronic statements instead of by mail. I already pay online and sign up to get things online every chance I get."
> * "Needs to be added to the VA app"

## 5. Communication & Customer Service Issues

* Problems with contact information (incorrect phone numbers)
* Challenges resolving discrepancies without calling
* Difficulty getting timely assistance for payment issues

> **Example quotes:**
> * "Talk to someone about the debt. the number on the website is not working and sends me to a recorded message about receiving a free device."
> * "I do not have time in the day to call some number just to do something as menial as ask someone something that can easily be displayed on this section of the website."
* "I originally called on March 28 to stop my benefits as I was starting active duty on April 1... Now I'm receiving letter demanding to be paid back!"

## CSAT Data Analysis

The June 2025 CSAT scores show notable improvement over the baseline weighted averages across all metrics:

* **VA.gov Experience Rating**: 73.15% (compared to 49.01% baseline) - significantly higher than overall VA.gov average (54.94%)
* **Overall User Satisfaction**: 25% (compared to 13.61% baseline) - slightly below VA.gov average (26.71%)
* **Users Understanding**: 75.79% (compared to 49.64% baseline) - well above VA.gov average (58.89%)
* **Trust in VA's Commitment to Veterans**: 71.69% (compared to 64.01% baseline) - above VA.gov average (57.76%)
* **Trust in VA Generally**: 44.58% (compared to 33.33% baseline) - above VA.gov average (34.18%)

Month-over-month comparison shows improvements in most areas:
* Experience rating increased from 67.08% to 73.15%
* Overall satisfaction dramatically improved from 17.94% to 75.79%
* Understanding increased from 69.01% to 75.79%
* Trust in VA's commitment remained stable (71.6% to 71.69%)
* General trust in VA declined slightly (50.3% to 44.58%)

These scores, gathered across pages with substantial traffic (565,129 total page views in June 2025 for manage-va-debt,	summary	debt-balances,	copay-balances, 49,400 clicks for pay.va.gov and pag.vo)
), suggest that despite the specific issues identified in the feedback, Veterans' overall perception of the debt portal has improved significantly compared to baseline measures. However, the verbatim feedback highlights critical areas where users continue to experience frustration, particularly with payment processing and information transparency.
