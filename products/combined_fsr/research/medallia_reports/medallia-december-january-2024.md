# Medallia Feedback

## Debt Portal 

## **Summary and opening:**

156 Veterans left qualitative feedback on the debt portal pages in December of 2023, and January of 2024. The majority of challenges described include 

**1. The inability to retrieve debt letters,** 

**2. Missing information such as copay bill details and account number retrieval making paying the bill or the debt challenging, and**
 
**3.  Payment update discrepancy (an issue described in previous reports).**

The following quote encapsulates the difficulty of making smart financial decisions without accurate information, highlighting the importance of timely and coherent financial information being communicated across the different channels (on the debt portal, in the mail, and by phone/live support).

> "View debt, view payment history and see what debt is remaining. This
> application has not been updated since 2019. This is a problem for
> veterans. How can we budget and make smart financial decisions without
> accurate information." (Veteran response to *'what task were you trying
> to do today?*', January 2024)

The Debt Resolution team is currently implementing new copy on the debt portal to inform Veterans that payments made may not be reflected immediately, which will alleviate worry and concerns. The team will also be implementing a payment history feature this year.


## **Tasks described by Veterans:**

-   Check debt status
-   Make a payment
-   See details of copay charges
-   See details of compensation related debt
-   Find account number
-   Dispute a debt
-   Paying recurring copays

## Challenges

**Distress, fears, resulting serious consequences**

   - Psychological distress, described as anxiety or hopelessness.
-   Documentation needed to complete certain transactions: I.e., buy a house for which a debt letter was needed, expect to be able to download the debt letter and can't.  (n = 1)
-   Fixed income, debts mean the difference between being able to afford groceries
-   Prescription copay debts that are unaffordable mean they quit refilling their medication (n = 1)
-   Being unaware of their debt and fear that this will affect prospective employment (n = 1)

## **Top issues:**

- Difficulty retrieving debt letters

> I was told I was in debt to the VA but was unable to pull up the debt
> letter(s). I suspect the reason was my Wife died in (month) and they
> overpaid me a couple months. Not a good way to do business.
> Interesting that the VA is so quick in recovering the few dollars they
> overpaid me, but they have been [expletive] around with my request to
> have my disability reevaluated for almost a year. I would say the
> priorities are wrong. (January 2024)
> 
> I was trying to download my VA debt letters, but they were
> unavailable. The letters are never available and haven't been for the
> past 6 years. Fix this. (January 2024)
> 
> See my debt letters. I have not been able to access these letters, and
> the VA continues to assert debts, despite already having been paid
> over $--,---. (December 2023)

-   Difficulty making a payment due to missing information (details of bill or account number findability challenges)

*Bill details missing:*

> Pay my co-pay. I never received a bill, so I have none of the
> information needed to pay. All I got was a notice. (December 2023)
> 
> Got a message saying I owe money, signed in to pay online, and all my
> account information on bill was missing (December 2023)

*Account number retrieval difficulty:*

> I owe $ --- to you due to an overpayment. I do not have any problem giving you this money but your payment system is so [expletive] retarted I can not pay it online. I am currently overseas on a deployment > and am out during your business hours so I have not been able to call. All I want to do is provide you my [expletive] credit card number and have you guys bill that like every other website where I pay
> someone. But here I need my hard copy bills to give you a [expletive] number that you already have. Problem is, the bills are not available online, so send it to collections and let me get a credit score
> hit over $ --- because the VA web site is the worst. (January 2024)


 *  Payment not updated

> I was trying to see if my November payment has reached you yet. My Dec
> statement still shows owing $--. My bank shows this payment has been
> received my VA. I tried several phone calls and either was
> disconnected or as in the last case on hold for over 10 minutes.
> (December 2023)
> 
> Checking VA Statement. The amount that is showing due was paid 30 days
> ago. It would be much better if the amount due was updated sooner. It
> can also be difficult and time consuming to navigate to the this page
> that shows VA monthly statements. (December 2023)

  * A need to see copay charge details (need: dispute copay charges)

> Review my prescription co-pay. It would help if I could see the copy
> of my bill as I need to dispute the charges. I'll just wait for the
> bill to come in the mail. (December 2023)
> 
> There was a CO-PAY listed due for --.--. It was the same amount as
> last month. I think your records are not up to date. The bill should
> at least note what I am being charged for. (December 2023)

   A need to see compensation-related debt accounting details

> Review the details of my compensation-related debt. i can see the
> total debt, but cannot see the accounting of how that debt was
> calculated. This is a basic service all financial institutions and
> creditors provide. (December 2023)
> 
> I was trying to view my current debt payment plan but there is no
> option to see that. It would be 100% beneficial to all veterans if we
> were able to view all details and not just letters. the letters do not
> have the current information I'm seeking. the main page only shows the
> amount owed. (December 2023)
> 
> There is insufficient detail to make a reasoned decision as to whether
> or not to pay this bill! (December 2023)

# FSR

37 Veterans left qualitative feedback on the financial status report form (FSR) in December of 2023 and January of 2024.

The most prominent theme out of these qualitative feedback entries are related to difficulty with findability - of the debt amount or the FSR form.

In the following entry, a Veteran describes that they aren't able to find their debt in the system, and they ask that it be easier to find debt on the website:

> I needed to fill out a 5655 form. I have debt and it isn't showing in the system. I didn't know I had the debt until now due to the information not showing for months. I'm worried that this may affect a tentative job offer. Please make it so that all debt shows on the site or somehow make it easier for us to be aware that we actually have a debt. (December 2023)

3 Veterans describe having difficulty finding the FSR form.

A Veteran describes how they feel that they should not be responsible for the overpayment. They further describe how they would have expected a phone call about it, not just letters in the mail that they describe as untimely:

> I don't feel as if I should be responsible for your mess up. I have no control of the over payments that is said to have taken place. I don't know what I am supposed to receive it is never a set amount. It is out of my hands if you maybe who ever in in charge should be more responsible. For me to be almost $2000 in debt over this happening is a is insane. I did not receive a phone call about it. Only letters in the mail a month later. I ask that you waive the debt and maybe figure out why y'all are overpaying me and fix the problem. I will not be in debt due to a constant mess up on your end. (December 2023)

-   Another Veteran describes an issue that another Veteran surfaced in the debt portal feedback, about mail being sent to a mailing address that they don't have access to:

> I never received the form indicating what I owe. It was sent to a residence I no longer reside at. I'll just send a blank check and you fill it out. (January 2024)

Another Veteran describes a need to see an explanation of copay charges, as described in the debt portal finding (A need to see copay charge details (need: dispute copay charges):

>ATTEMPTING TO HAVE VA PROVIDE EVIDENCE (CALCULATIONS) OF COMPENSATION OVERPAYMENT. VA HAS A POSTING OF "CURRENT DEBT" WHICH ICANNOT ACCEPT WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION/CALCULATION. I HAVE ALSO BEEN AWARDED 100% DISABILITY AND PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION FOR MY SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY SHOULD BE GROUP 1. I ACTUALLY AM WILLING TO PAY MY COPAY PORTION, HOWEVER, VA's SERVICE HAS BEEN LESS THAN SATISFACTORY, THUS I MIGHT AS WELL GET THAT OFF MY CHEST. (January 2024)

Veterans expect to see details of copay and overpayments charges so they may understand what they are, and decide how they would like to proceed with managing or resolving the debt.

Another Veteran says that their waiver will not be there by the deadline because the site 'never works when you need it to'. They describe a sense of hopelessness:

> I was trying to send a request for waiver for a overpayment. Because your site is unreliable it will not be there by the deadline. Thank you for letting me down. You really do not care about veterans. This is the worst site I have ever used. It never works when you need it to. My life is coming to a close. I hope you are satisfied. Yet I am wasting my time because you could care less.  (January 2024)

1 Veteran was unable to submit the form due to a technical error:

>  We're sorry. Something went wrong on our end. You are unable to submit a Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655) because something went wrong on our end. Please try again later. (January 8, 2024)

A Veteran describes that they are unable to pay for their medication and they quit refilling them:

> I have no money no job no transportation I have no money to pay for my meds so I quit refilling them (December 2023)
