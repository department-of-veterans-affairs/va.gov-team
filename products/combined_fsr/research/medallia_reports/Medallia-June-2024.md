# Medallia Report: June 2024

## Debt Portal & Financial Status Report Form (eFSR): Summary

75  Veterans left qualitative and/or quantitative feedback on the debt portal pages. 

103 Veterans left predominantly quantitative feedback on the FSR pages (not qualitative). 

The majority of the issues and concerns described by Veterans in June corroborate previous findings, including but not limited to:

**Unable to look up or download copay statements** 

**Payment update discrepancy (an issue described in previous reports)**

**Wanting to see payment history** 


## Quantitative Findings

**Likert Scale: Satisfaction Ratings**


Veterans can leave quantitative feedback on their experience with VA.gov on a scale from 1 to 5, the ordinal data ranges from [not at all satisfied = 1] [dissatisfied = 2] [neither satisfied or dissatisfied = 3] [satisfied = 4] [very satisfied = 5].

**Central Tendency**

Across the measures of satisfaction with VA and VA.gov, on a scale of 1 to 5:

-   The highest measure is for Trust in VA Commitment to Veterans, with an average value across [29] respondents 3.82, which is higher than the previous month (May 2024: 3.63 average for 103 respondents). The mode (most commonly occurring rating) is a 5. Since the proportion of respondents is lower for June, this is not a meaningful increase, overall.

Followed by:

-   VA.gov Experience, with an average across [31] respondents 3.7. The mode is a 5.
-   VA.gov Understanding, with an average across [29] respondents 3.55, which is higher than the previous month. The mode is a 5.

-   General VA Trust [29] respondents 3.17, which is slightly lower than the previous month. The mode is a 5.

-   Overall Satisfaction with this Site across [37] respondents 1.75, which is slightly lower than the previous month (May 2024: 1.97 average for 38 respondents). The mode is a 1.

Veteran Feedback:

Feedback #1 on page [ [https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary)] using Desktop:

`-   Trying to pay my $45 copay. The page requires 5 sections of my acct # but my acct # from my statement fills in 4 sections?`

Feedback #2 on page [ [https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/copay-balances#how-to-pay](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/copay-balances#how-to-pay)] using Desktop:

`The link to download copayment statements isn't available on PC, only my phone. Also, the account number on the statement is not long enough to complete any of part 5.`


The team is already aware of this issue and opened ticket  [87678](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/87678)  (VHA - Format account number to match pay.gov)

On staging it looks like weâ€™re missing a section of the account number on the Copay detail page but the full account number is present on the Copay PDFs.

Copay detail page:

0000000000000000

Copay PDF:

000 0000 0000 00000 LLLLL

**There is a continued theme, month to month, of life stressors and financial hardship.**

The following Veteran describes the passing of his wife resulting in an overpayment debt, despite his calling VA a day later to let them know.

`I informed the VA of my late wife passing on 0/00/2024 now why am I being charged for overpayments I was told I am not responsible also when I called on 6/20/2024 to check if it had been cleared the operator told me I was listed as deceased when I asked operator what day did I passed away she said 2/19/2004 I did what I was told to do so why am I being punished she passed on 0/00 I called on 0/01/2024 (the next day)`

The following Veteran describes how they are still trying to resolve a VA copay debt 30 years later.

`I am not paying anything. The VA owes me for serving me for serving my country not the other way around! I have been trying to finalize this for almost 30 years! Enough said. The next step is a congressman to get involved, I'm tired of fighting. Maybe someday this issue will be resolved before I die!`
 
Recommendation:

-   VA copay debts being addressed within a few months to a year may be an incorrect assumption, as per the anecdote above. We can deduce that outstanding copay debts can also extend beyond a year, like we see for VA overpayment debts, which in some cases can arise several years later.
-   Use cases and user journeys should be refined.

**(4) Veterans reported that the VA DMC was closed or unreachable.**

`- I was trying to call the VA Debt Management service line and it was closed.`

`- I tried to contact VA debt management. I called the phone listed. got a recording telling me to use the online svc. then they just said that they were closed. it was 12 noon Arizona time on June 14, nothing saying why they were closed`

`- I was being told by email that I have a debt of some sort on my medical bills or didn't that I needed to call the number I called the number and you're closed already but anyways I don't know anything because I was never told about being billed for anything medical when I was at appointments at all.`   

`- Could not get through on telephone  trying with this website to pay for medication`


**Payment update discrepancy (an issue described in previous reports)**

The team is currently working on implementing VBA debt payment history on the debt portal. This will help Veterans receive timely acknowledgment of their payments and track their payments.

**There are reports of difficulty looking up or downloading copay statements. One Veteran reported that the copay statement does not print beyond the first page. Another reports that the link to download copay statements is only available on mobile.**

## Misc. Feedback:

A Veteran mentions that they do not have enough resources to help understand and resolve VA STEM scholarship overpayment debt:

`VA STEM scholarship sent letter I have overpayment/debt. Debt does not show in debt management services, the VA STEM Department is not following regulations and procedures to help avoid causing financial crisis to veteran. No resources for reporting or contacts for management of VA STEM only one email address, they have threatened me with loss of all benefits which are only means of income. I am facing possible eviction and homelessness despite timely response, waiver request, hardship statement, they have continued to avoid or provide any update. Cannot see any help for STEM scholarship debt issues through VA or debt management. NO RESOURCES for help.`

A Veteran wants to know if they can access compensation from someone else's deposit, and what they can do if their personal documents are destroyed:

`If A Veteran loses access to compensation in someone else's direct deposit or has their personal Documents destroyed what should they then do?`

A Veteran mentions that Care centers are not informing Veterans how to submit claims for mileage travel reimbursements in a timely manner:

`Some staff members at Care in the Community section are not informing veterans how to submit claims for mileage travel reimbursement claims in timely manner.
