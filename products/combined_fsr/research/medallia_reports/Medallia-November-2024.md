# Important Qualitative Findings:

## Service Design challenges:

> Inconsistent information with VA.gov. Profile is correct but any document out of system is incorrect.

Page:

[https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/debt-balances](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/debt-balances)

>I have a bill for medication and the VA will not bill outside insurance

> I have been having ongoing issues with receiving education pay (Post 9-11) housing allowance. There were 2 checks I was supposed to receive in August and am still waiting for them. 2 checks were sent to the wrong address by mail and have not been located or sent to me via direct deposit, as expressed that they would by 2 VA Reps. The information on the website is quite confusing and is not the same as what the representatives see on their side in the system. I now see an overpayment debt and I'll be calling for a 6th time to attempt to resolve this issue.

> I had a copay regularly for years.  There wasnâ€™t any notice that failed the means test so I would have to pay regular.  I think that I was billed untimely, and billed too much.  After many years a bill appears from where?  It goes into collection, and again I failed a means test and thereâ€™s the same amount billed to me again.

> The information does not match information provided by telephone

> I show that I have no money due on VA.gov copay link.  Yet a $29 copay from 9/23/2023 STOPPED MY DISASTER LOANS.  For Hurricane Milton and Hellene . DNP (Do Not Pay) sent from Veterans Health Administration to SBA.  After 6 hours on campus and 2 hours on hold with the US Treasury .  $32 payment.  For interest.  VA is capable of texting me for appointments.  But can only notify payments are due by US postal service.  That was probably mailed out when I was on active duty and not in my home.  Please look into this issue.  I wasted a day from work and could have used this SBA loan last month before getting hit by 2 Hurricanes

## A Veteran on a debt summary page left a concerning message:

>YOU HAVE FAILED ME.......YOU HAVE FAILED ME ... YOOOOU HAVE FAILED ME............... YOU HAVE FAILED ME.........YOU HAVE FUKK=.. IM NOT AFFAIRD TO TAKE A STAND

## Login issues:

N = 4

> Your website is "clunky" and confusing in creating an "ID.me" login.  My HealtheVet  system was working just fine

> I got kicked off the site to this survey before I did anything. Other than taking 10-15 minutes trying to log in.

> Still a little confusing.  I logged in to the my health page that I've always used.  Everything appeared normal but, no appointment information was available.  However, there was a link to the "new" my health page and my appointments were available on the new page.  So, it appears that I should no longer use the old my health bookmark.  Probably need to automatically redirect anyone trying to log into the old page to the new page and then have a notice page telling them to change their bookmark to the new link.  Other than that, all interactions with VA health have been positive.

> The sign-in process REMAINS TO BE VERY CONFUSING!!! I have had my ID.me sign-in for a very long time and all of a sudden I to try multiple times to get a code to complete my sign-n.  t shouldn't be this HARD & CONFUSING!!!

## One report of a fast login:

> I was able to login rather quickly

Page: [https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/copay-balances](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/copay-balances)

## Copay balance (an existing issue reported by Veterans repeatedly for over a year, highlighting the necessity of payment history in the debt portal):

N = 8

> There's a Co-pay Balance due on the website. However, I made a $65 pymt on 10/4, ck 304, and another $65 pymt on 10/31, ck 305. So why the discrepancy?

> A BETTER WAY OF PAYING AND SEEING YOUR CO PAY BALANCE. THIS DOES NOT HELP ONES SANITY . THEY SHOW YOUR BALANCE, YOU MAKE A PAYMENT CANT SEE ANY OF THOSE PAYMENTS OR WHAT YOUR BALANCE IS AT. PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF OUR VETREANS MAKE THIS MORE MANAGABLE

> Check my statement for medical bills. I am looking at the PDF of my payment for 37.48 on 9/28/24 at 4:00 pm. But I still show a balance, and I got a letter from a collections agency. This is not the first time this has happened.

> I'm trying to see my Copay balance. It hasn't been updated since October 3rd.

> I received a letter stating that the VA has been trying to contact me to no avail regarding the $41.00 balance on my account showing online. I haven't moved nor has my telephone number or email changed. According to the person I spoke to at the VA accounting office, my balance is $0. So, I ask again...why is the website still showing a $41.00 balance? I've cleared my caches and history so that shouldn't be an issue.. I'm still here!

> I'm trying to accurate read of any copays I owe. The VA online portal is useless for this. Months after I have paid my copays via pay.gov., the copay history shown on the VA homepage still has them as overdue/unpaid. This should not be a difficult bug to address. Please fix it. TY.

> TRYING TO SEE MY BILL BUT THE LAST ENTRY IS FROM JULY 2024???? WHAT WAS THE CHARGE FOR OCT 2024 MEDICATION THAT I GOT ON 18 OCT 2024? THANKS

> Review my current copay bill. Unable to get an up to date amount though as it only updates once a month. Should update daily or even weekly would help.

## A desire to see letters in the portal:

> Find all letters that have been sent to me. The website used to have copies of all letters (claim, debt, notification) that was ever sent. It seems that now i can only see the claim letters. Please update to where I can download a copy of all letters that have been sent.

## Not enrolled in VA healthcare bug:

> I cannot locate my records on this site because it says I am not enrolled in VA health care. I am enrolled and have been for many years.

> says im not enrolled in va healthcare  .  WRONG

## Possibly an education debt bug:

> I was directed to sign in to access information regarding Education Debt, but once I log in, I get an error message that says the VA can't access the information. Just disappointed.

N = 1

##  Improvements on VA site:

> It's easy to use now that the VA has improved the site.
