>"The form was easy to fill out."

>"None, it was straight forward. I did like that it saves your work so if you have to finish later, you don't have to start over. Nice feature."

>"I didn't see anything that needs to be changed. It was very easy to understand and complete."

>"this is a very sensible application process, well done VA !!"

>"I thought it was very user friendly and easy to complete."

Review page

>"It seemed like I was unable to make changes to the information that I had previously entered for items like assets and other things."

>"If you have a "Final Review", then at that point, there should be a way to edit prior entries. For example, I remembered that to survive due to VA cut my income to ZERO, I have asked friends for loans. I remembered a few others, not on the expenses form..."

*^ As of publication, this issue has been resolved*

> "The form never asked me about my Expenses, so all the boxes are zeros."

> The form needs a colored or bold type on the final screen to indicate an error. I messed around for a. Minute trying to figure out when it wasn't. Submitting.

Personal statement section (not on SW)

>"Why are you requesting this medical hardship?would help."

Clarification 

>"Not sure if it's considered owned if you owe money on it"

>"ask if i own a vehicle, but what if making payments on it. techinally you dont own them. better clarification. also about bankruptcy, it could be 1-,15,20 ago and finding the paperwork could be difficult, so you could not ask this question."

>"specify if income is before entitlements ie LES has base pay which was used to submit income but later ask for cost of housing which is an entitlement that happens in addition base pay. unsure if correctly reflected"

>"Maybe give some tips to help navigate exact amounts for certain expenses. Ex: State and Federal taxes."

>"Credit debt vs Personal Debt clarification."

>"Nothing on the form that is difficult to answer. It is knowing what to put based on the paystub and how to differentiate each types of deductions and allotments-confusing a bit."

>"The form asks for income from last month, which doesn't necessarily represent accurate income. Last month my income was higher, but next month and moving forward it will be lower due to the dependency adjustment. Perhaps put income (from last month OR projected future income) so the monthly net can be calculated more accurately. Also, with assets and expenses, maybe specify if it's my portion or the total amount. For example, half of my savings belongs to my girlfriend. Do I put the full amount in the account, or just my portion. Also, for expenses, such as Rent, do I put my total rent obligation per my lease agreement, or do I put the portion of rent I actually pay? Lastly, after submitting the form, I can't seem to locate anywhere on VA.gov that it was actually submitted, or anywhere for me to review my submission. I got an email, but there's no apparent proof I can see on my VA.gov profile/page."

>"I had a hard time tryin to decide what was the right answer to alot of the money questions. I think you need help or to be pretty smart to do this."

Other 
>"Time for previous problem exceeds time limit for credit problems"

>"More space to fill-in information such as employer, address etc. Also didn't have a 'Back' button to review and complete previous pages."

>"it's not giving me the options that I want to select to dispute the debt"

Approximately 45 Responses 

Spouse

>"Marital Status (Married/Single) should have a comments line. Someone can be married, but separated, and the "spouse" offers no monetary income to the household at all--and this should be able to be explained"

>"spouse information more clear there was no space to say if you're still married or divorced or widowed and I'm recently widowed"

>"Thank you for the opportunity to share my situation and ask for help. I am currently separated. We have not proceed with legal action. This form did not give me an option to enter this, I would have preferred to skip any of her information."

>"Spouse information. I am separated and we do not speak so I am not certain that information is accurate that I provided because it was from when we spoke a year ago"

>"Didn't ask for my spouses signature but the paper form indicates its required."

Bankruptcy
>"The Bankruptcy portion is kind of outdated as my Bankruptcy was 55 years ago and I was unable to remember what court i filed in or year or date."

>"Most of some people do not complete bankruptcy and there is not an option to explain that it was not discharged, but dismissed"

>"Bankruptcy so long ago no records so had to answer no system will not let u say yes unless u have info"

>"My bankruptcy filing was approximately 30 years ago. I no longer have any information on that filing. The 5655 form doesn't allow me to state that."

Granted relief but still getting bills &

The need to fill out the form multiple times

>"I am not required to ever pay a co-pay based on my disability rating and Tier 1 rating , not sure what this is about"

>"I've submitted multiple 10-10EZR's and yet I seem to constantly have to fight for relief.."

>"I was already granted relief, my payments were to be $50.00 a month. So why am I having to file for it again?"

>"If you are accepted for co-pay debt relief, why do you need to keep filling out the form. When you reach retirement age or older-I'm 81, the income will not usually change."

>"Give an option to clear the debt entirely. I am in this position because a lot of my disabilities are not rated or services connected even though I have been fighting for the past 19 years to get them that way."

>"Add comment box. I am 100% Permanent and Total so I should not be receiving copay bills any longer."

>"Why would I get a letter saying I don't have any debt to get help with yet an email saying I have a bill or even an outstanding bill. Why can't I get it permanently waived as I don't have enough to pay rent or any basic living costs but have to ask for waivers every bill?"

>"Was very difficult to even access information that would inform me on why I had a debt, how to resolve the debt I should never have received a bill in the first place for my service connected disability!"

Other


>"You should have a box for returning veterans who were released from prison and may have a debt related issue. Their information is different from the rest of veterans."

>"VA needs a more effective way to prevent overpayment. I submitted my Active orders via fax and mail but still continued to get paid. as orders were extended I called to inform VA but was told to await payments stopping and pay back. during this time I also had to PCS and go back on active duty where I accumulated alot of debt with sustaining a mortgage and rent overseas. I used my over payment before I could pay VA debt then started having active wages garnished."

>"ALLOW VETERANS TO USE THEIR MEDICARE RX PLAN FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. IT'S WIN\WIN AS THE VA WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY PART OF THE DRUG COSTS AND FOR THOSE VETS IN A SITUATON SUCH AS MINE (GOING CATASTROPHIC IN FEBRUARY), THE COPAY SLATE IS WIPED CLEAN AND THE MEMBER GETS HIS MEDS AND DOESN'T HAVE TO GO HUNGRY OR HOMELESS, ETC."

>"Adding other insurance information to cover co-pays."

>"Form is easy. The letters are a nightmare. Even when referred to Department of Treasury, there's no good phone number or email... It's like you guys just want to send mail, not email or call. It's extremely unreliable to try to sort this through."

>"Faster updates I need to know if I'm gettting financial help. Stress is high.."

>"Regarding debt issues, they ask about the previous 2 years of employment history but that has no bearing on our current situation where our duty station has results in us losing $60-70,000 in annual income but we are not able to reflect that in our requests. So from the VA point of view it is going to seem like we are making significantly more money than we are."
