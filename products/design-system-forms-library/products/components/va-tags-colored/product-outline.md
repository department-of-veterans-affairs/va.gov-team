- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/afurtw4iqQe6y4gXfNfkkk/branch/As3gh7VNu3IcCFQ6hg5nMu/VADS-Component-Library?m=auto)
- [Experimental Design [Colored tags]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/2993#top)

## Summary
- Colored tags originates from an experimental design request from a team working on a staff-facing application to help users dealing with a lot of data regularly to quickly identify key pieces of information. 
- We will be bringing in colors that align with the [VADS Alerts](https://design.va.gov/components/alert/#examples---standard) that are already being used. The colored tags will have the same semantic meaning that aligns with the alerts.
  
## Objectives
- Use colored tags that aligns with alerts to provide additional semantic meaning, primarily to convey 
	- Helpful information 
	- Warning 
	- Success
	- Error

## Key Features of the Component:
- Use of color to convey semantic meaning. 
- Colored tags will align with alerts
- Accessibility: Ensures compliance with WCAG standards and maintains ease of use for all users.

## Timeline (TBD)
March
- Discovery completed by previous DST

May
- Sprint 3 (May 12 to 25)
	- Design: Add colored tag designs in Figma, review with PO, designers and developers and finalized designs for web.

June - work paused on this for the time being. 



## Success Criteria
- TBD
- Positive feedback from users and stakeholders regarding usability and accessibility.
