## ADR: 001 - Define the meaning for colored tags

### Status: Accepted
- Date Raised: 2025-02-25
- Decision Date: 2025-04-08

### Context
We had a experimental design request submitted and approved by the Design System Council to add different color variations for the tag component. One of the main concerns the Design System Council raised was addressing the colors that would be added so that each color has specific meaning and intent. We did a discovery to audit the exisiting use of color in the design system, review how other design systems were using color, and make sure the colors aligned to our current use of color in the design system.

- [Color discovery audit in Figma File](https://www.figma.com/design/5y1gpQBX0zZ83i8vsX9xCE/Colored-tags?node-id=0-1)

## Decision
We will be only applying colors to the tags that align with the current alerts in the VA Design System.
- Status (Default) - Used to show the status of a process.
- Informational - Used to provide helpful information or something that warrants a user’s attention. Not used for negative consequences.
- Success - Used to indicate success.
- Warning - Used to warn a user, such as when there are negative consequences, or when something has gone wrong.
- Error - Used when there is a problem or something destructive is about to occur.

### Consequences
Applying colors to tags can introduce a few different interaction issues that we will need to test for. 
- Colors can make tags look more like buttons.
- Making sure the colors are applied appropriately can be challenging. We will need to make sure guidance is added and tied to alerts.
- Color can communicate a priority when we don't mean it to. 

## ADR: 002 - Tag styles

### Status: Accepted

- Date Raised: 2025-12-05
- Decision Date: 2025-05-25

### Context

Tags can come in a variety of styles and we needed to finalize a final design for the colored tag options. There were a few different routes we could take for the design. 

**Design options that were researched**

- [Colored tag use cases](https://www.figma.com/design/5y1gpQBX0zZ83i8vsX9xCE/Colored-tags?node-id=1-323)
- [Design options considered](https://www.figma.com/design/5y1gpQBX0zZ83i8vsX9xCE/Colored-tags?node-id=50-367)
- [Mockups with tag design options](https://www.figma.com/design/5y1gpQBX0zZ83i8vsX9xCE/Colored-tags?node-id=58-391)
- [Design System audit](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1747766690440/cc2b1b4eb7c707954968bac635886fbb34129c27?sender=uc445c662daeb45814b8d8356) - An audit of tags in other design systems was completed

1. **Experimental design:** The original experimental design submitted has a variety of color options and a border around the tags. The tags are slightly bigger than the original USWDS/VADS tags. The alert tag versions included a icon that matches the icons used for the alerts.
2. **Mobile design:** The mobile design uses the same colors as the alert backgrounds and has a large border radius with a border.

### Decision
1. **Colors:** The tag color options will match semantic color meanings with alerts decided in ADR 001.
2. **Spacing and size:** The size and the spacing of the tags will remain the same as the current tag already added in the VADS.
~~3. **Border:** Both the mobile and the experimental design included borders with the design but looking that the mockups with the tags used with the tags, we decided that the border makes the tags look more like buttons. So to avoid any confusion with buttons we will be removing the border.~~
4. **Icon:** To make the tags accessible we need to make sure that color is not the only way that the tag is conveying the status. We will include the same icon that is used in the alert to convey the meaning the of the tag beyond color.

### Consequences
Currently, we only have a single tag color. Going forward we will have a variety of options for teams to choose depending on the status of the tag. It is challenging to forsee the different ways the tags will be used. This could have consequences if the colored tags options are used in ways we did not account for. 


## ADR: 003 - Accessible Colors

### Status: See ADR: 006 for more info

- Date Raised: 2025-05-25
- Decision Date: 

### Context
The tag background must meet 3:1 color contrast against the page background

**Reasoning:** 
- The colored background of the tag carries semantic meaning (warning, error, success) and is not decorative, so it functions as a “graphical object” under WCAG. 
- [WCAG 1.4.11 (non-text contrast)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-contrast) sets a minimum 3:1 contrast between any meaningful graphical element and its adjacent background so that users with low vision can reliably perceive the shape and color cue. 
- [USWDS also recommends 3:1 contrast on tags](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/tag/accessibility-tests/)

### Decision
- The team recommends adding the border to the tag. This marks a 3:1 ratio contrast. The other option is to use a solid color that creates the 3:1 ratio.

### Consequences
It may make the tags look like buttons. Usability testing would help us understand if users think these are buttons.

## ADR: 004 - Uppercase text

### Status: See ADR: 006 for more info

- Date Raised: 2025-05-25
- Decision Date: 

### Context
During the [tag usage audit](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1755032896804/d24a5a32988c08139ddf73a67e589c7fa9e9f22d?wid=0-1755893916029), we identified teams using tags with sentence case instead of the standard uppercase format. Teams cited improved readability and accessibility as their primary motivations for this deviation. We evaluated the pros and cons of uppercase text vs. sentence case for tags. 

Tags with uppercase is a **good choice** for:
- Visually distinguishing tags from buttons
- Drawing attention to the tag to make them more noticeable and easily scannable

Tags with uppercase is **not a good choice** for:
- Long strings of text because it reduces readability and can harm accessibility
- When the tone should be conversational or friendly

### Decision
**Recommendation:** Maintain alignment with [USWDS tag component](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/tag/) standards by continuing to use uppercase text for tags.

**Rationale:** This approach preserves design system consistency and alignment with the USWDS tag component while leveraging the functional benefits of uppercase formatting for short-form, categorical content.  

### Consequences
- Current tag implementation may not accommodate all existing use cases optimally
- Some teams may need to evaluate whether tags are the appropriate component for their specific content needs

## ADR 005 - Icon Size Update

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date Issue Raised:** 2025-10-02  
**Decision Date:** 2025-10-02  

### Context
Originally, the icon size was going to match the font size (16.96px) for consistency. However, the smallest token size in USWDS is 24px, and designers identified that a larger size would improve legibility and better align with the design system.

### Decision
Increase the icon size for status tags to **24px x 24px**.

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Improved legibility and alignment with USWDS token standards  
- **Negative:** The new icons increase the overall size of the tag, making them more prominent, which may be too much for some use cases  
- **Risks:** Minimal; potential layout adjustments may be required in tight spaces

## ADR 006 - Tag Color Alignment

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date Issue Raised:** 2025-10-02  
**Decision Date:** 2025-10-02  

### Context
The original plan was to align tag colors with [Alert](https://design.va.gov/components/alert/) component colors. During review, the team discovered that the mobile team is creating a "blue sky" version of status tags with a different palette. Aligning with mobile ensures cross-platform consistency.

### Decision
Update tag colors to align with the **mobile blue sky status tag palette**.

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Visual consistency across web and mobile platforms; alignment with ongoing mobile design efforts  
- **Negative:** Divergence from alert colors may reduce direct color association with alert messages. The new palette is darker and more solid, which may make tags look like buttons and potentially confuse users  
- **Risks:** Moderate; if users attempt to click tags as buttons, we may need to revisit color choices to reduce the perception of clickability

## ADR 007 - Text Weight

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date Issue Raised:** 2025-10-02  
**Decision Date:** 2025-10-02  

### Context
The mobile blue sky designs used a semibold font weight, which is not supported in our type system. Readability was a concern for smaller status tags.

### Decision
Use **bold font** for all status tag text.

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Improves readability and provides a close match to the intended semibold weight  
- **Negative:** Bold text may appear slightly heavier than intended, but impact is minimal  
- **Risks:** Combined with darker colors, bold text might feel visually heavy in some use cases  

### Open Questions
- Should we explore adding semibold font support in the future?

## ADR 008 - Sentence Case

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date Issue Raised:** 2025-10-02  
**Decision Date:** 2025-10-02  

### Context
Some tags may be longer than 1–2 words. Using all caps or title case reduces readability and scanability for longer text.

### Decision
Adopt **sentence case** for all status tag text.

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Easier to read and scan, especially for longer phrases  
- **Negative:** Inconsistent with other components that may use all caps for emphasis (original tag component)  
- **Risks:** Users may perceive sentence case as less "badge-like" compared to all caps  

### Open Questions
- Should other components (e.g., badges, chips) also adopt sentence case for consistency?  

---

## ADR 009 - Warning Tag Color

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date Issue Raised:** 2025-10-02  
**Decision Date:** 2025-10-02  

### Context
All status tags were originally mapped to the alert color token scale. However, the **warning tag** needed special consideration to avoid confusion when used with the Critical Action component.

### Decision
Map the **warning status tag** to the **critical alert color token**.

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Ensures visual and semantic cohesion between Critical Action alerts and status tags when displayed together  
- **Negative:** Creates a strong connection between the Critical Action and the status tag that may not be desirable in all situations  
- **Risks:** Potential confusion if users expect warning and critical states to remain visually distinct  

### Open Questions
- Should the warning status tag and Critical Action always be visually aligned, or are there situations where they should differ?  

---

## ADR 010 - Dark mode

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date Issue Raised:** 2025-10-10  
**Decision Date:** 2025-10-14  

### Context
The current Status Tag component designs are optimized for light mode only, with semantic colors chosen for visibility and WCAG contrast compliance on light backgrounds. To be fully integrated as a Mobile app component we would need to add color options for dark mode.

There is some discovery work done to merge the mobile app and the VADS tokens into a single place so that we have cohesive colors being used between the two platforms. 

### Decision
Defer implementation of dark mode support for dark mode till the tokens for Mobile app and web have been completed. 
- This will prevent duplication of work
- Create a more cohesive and consistent color experience when we can look at the color combinations as a whole

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Ensures visual and semantic cohesion between the mobile app and web
- **Negative:** The mobile app might need to use the Status tags before we can implement light and dark mode options cause visual differences in the design.
- **Risks:** Potential diversions if the dark mode can't be implemented in time 

### Open Questions
- Does the mobile team already have assigned dark mode colors for the semantic colors?
