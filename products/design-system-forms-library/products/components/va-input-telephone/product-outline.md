## va-input-telepone: Support international phone number 

### [Design Decisions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/design-system-forms-library/products/components/va-input-telephone/design-decisions.md)

## Summary
- The va-input-telephone component is being developed to enable support for international phone numbers across the VA.gov ecosystem.
- This enhancement is critical to improving accessibility and usability for veterans and users residing outside the United States.
- The updated component will ensure consistency, flexibility, and compliance across all platforms, including My VA Profile, VA.gov forms, and VA mobile applications.
  
## Context
- As part of the migration of My HealtheVet (MHV) to VA.gov, it was identified that the current My VA Profile does not support international phone numbers.
- This limitation presents a significant blocker for the migration of My HealtheVet
  - Prefill-enabled online forms: Many forms rely on user profile data and currently cannot accept international phone numbers. This will be handled in a new pattern coming out later, but for the interim the user will receive an error message that the phone number can only be 10 digits before they can continue
  - PDF-based forms: Many forms do not accept international phone formats, will need to work with form owners to update the PDF.

## Objectives
- Create a Shared Component: A single, reusable va-input-telephone component will support international phone numbers and be integrated across all VA.gov platforms.
- Enhance Input Flexibility: Customize formatting to support both domestic and international phone numbers, based on specific form requirements.
- Streamline Adoption: Ensure integration with My VA Profile, VA.gov online forms, and mobile applications.

## Key Features of the Component:
- Customizable Formatting: Allows flexible display and validation for phone numbers.
- International Support: Handles international formats alongside domestic numbers.
- Accessibility: Ensures compliance with WCAG standards and maintains ease of use for all users.

## Integration Plan
- My VA Profile: Replace the existing domestic-only phone input field with the shared component.
- VA.gov Forms: Audit and update all forms using prefill or standalone fields to adopt the va-input-telephone component.
- Mobile Apps: Provide a React Native-compatible version of the component for seamless integration.

## Timeline (TBD)
- April: Conduct an audit of all prefill-enabled and PDF-based forms to identify necessary updates.
- May/June:  Develop and test the shared component.
- June:  Begin integration across My VA Profile, VA.gov forms, and mobile applications.
- June: Complete full integration. Target deadline for adoption is August 2025.


## Success Criteria
- All prefill forms and applications accept international phone numbers without errors.
- Reduction in the rejection rate of forms due to invalid phone numbers.
- Positive feedback from users and stakeholders regarding usability and accessibility.
