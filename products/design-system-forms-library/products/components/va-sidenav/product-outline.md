## Summary
The Sidenav component provides a consistent, accessible, and responsive side navigation panel for web applications. It is designed to help users quickly navigate between major sections or features within a page or application. The Sidenav is intended for use in layouts where persistent or easily accessible navigation is essential, such as dashboards, admin panels, and complex workflows.
  
## Objectives
- The Sidenav component organizes navigation links, section headers, icons, and potentially sub-menus into a vertical layout that is both space-efficient and easy to scan.
- The component supports highlighting the active section, collapsing or expanding menu groups, and adapting its display for various screen sizes (responsive behavior).
- Users will use the sidenav to jump directly to different areas of the application, understand their current location, and maintain orientation as they navigate.

## Key Features of the Component:
- Accessibility: Ensures compliance with WCAG standards and maintains ease of use for all users.
- Responsiveness: Adapt gracefully to a range of device sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices; support collapsible modes as needed.
- Customizability: Allow for configurable menu items, icons, section headers, and states (active, disabled, etc.).
- Integration: Facilitate easy integration into existing layouts and work seamlessly with other design system components such as headers, footers, and content areas.

## Tasks / Things to consider
### Research
- Audit existing patterns - [examples from other design system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo6vLp1LqF1LYz828__bkv3LwiQRrScnsZCI4-HpXjk/edit?usp=sharing)s 
- Reached out to Raquel to get requirements
  #### What problem does this component solve?
     - It helps organize related settings—like notification preferences and paperless delivery—into a single, easy-to-find group. This reduces clutter on the profile page and makes it easier for users to manage their communication settings.
   #### Where and how will it be used in the product?
   -  It will be used in the profile section of the product. Specifically, it will appear as a side navigation menu with sub-navigation options under a new "Communication Settings" category.
  #### Specific use cases
   - For example: A user wants to update how they receive VA communications and can easily find both paperless delivery and notification preferences in one place.
A user navigating through their profile will experience a cleaner layout, with fewer top-level options and clearer grouping of related settings.

### Design & UX
- What are the different states (default, hover, active, disabled, loading)?
- Are there existing design patterns this should follow or extend?
- Does it need to support themes (e.g., light/dark mode)?
- How should it behave responsively (mobile, tablet, desktop)?

### Content Considerations
- Is there new content that needs to be run by CIA?
- Error states, hint text?

### Structure & Content
- What are the required and optional props/inputs?
- Are there any interactive states?
- What variations or configurations are needed (e.g., size, layout, icon options)?
- Are there edge cases to consider?

### Accessibility
- What are the ARIA roles, properties, or patterns needed?
- How will it be usable with keyboard navigation and screen readers?
- Are there any color contrast or focus management considerations?

### Technical Requirements
### Testing & Documentation
- What test coverage is required (unit, integration, visual regression)?
- How will usage examples be documented?
- What controls and props will be exposed in tools like Storybook?

### Versioning & Lifecycle
- How might this component evolve over time?
- Are there plans for deprecation of similar components?
- How will backward compatibility be handled?
