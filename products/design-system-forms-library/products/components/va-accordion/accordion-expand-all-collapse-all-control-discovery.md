# Accordion Expand / Collapse control discovery

This document summarizes government design systems that **support global “Expand All / Collapse All”** functionality for accordion components, focusing on **differences in implementation and accessibility reasoning**.  

Systems without this functionality (e.g., Canada.ca, NHS, NZ) are excluded.

## 📊 Comparison Table

| **Design System** | **Control Type & Behavior** | **Accessibility Implementation** | **Notes / Philosophy** |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 🇺🇸 **USWDS (USA.gov)** | Optional per accordion — Two buttons (“Expand all”, “Collapse all”) or single toggle configurable per accordion. Each accordion manages its own state independently. | Accordion headers use `<button>` with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`. Expand/collapse all controls are regular `<button>` elements. Keyboard: Space/Enter toggles. | Designed for flexibility; developers decide whether to include controls. |
| 🇬🇧 **GOV.UK Design System** | Built-in single toggle — One dynamic button switches between “Show all sections” / “Hide all sections.” Updates automatically based on state. | Section headers use `<button>` with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`. Global toggle has visible text + screen reader (SR-only) enhancements. Fully keyboard accessible. | Dynamic label communicates current action to users; avoids redundant or inactive controls. |
| 🇦🇺 **Australian Government / NSW / QLD** | Optional — Two visible buttons (“Expand all” / “Collapse all”) or a toggle version. Always shown; affects all sections in the group. | Headers use `<button>` with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`. Global buttons are standard accessible `<button>`s. Includes focus/keyboard navigation. | Emphasizes clarity through always-visible controls; both actions remain explicit to the user. |

## 🧩 Detailed Descriptions

### 🇺🇸 U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)

**Implementation:**  
- Each accordion can optionally include global expand/collapse buttons.
- Controls can be two static buttons or a single toggle button.

**Accessibility Reasoning:**  
- Each header uses `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`.
- Keyboard support: **Enter** and **Space**.
- Global controls are standard buttons with visible text, providing clear actions to assistive technology.
- Focus remains on the triggering button to avoid unexpected shifts.

**Notes:**  
- The focus is on developer flexibility, allowing implementers to decide whether to include expand/collapse all functionality.

### 🇬🇧 GOV.UK Design System

**Implementation:**  
- Includes a single dynamic global toggle.
- Button label updates between “Show all sections” and “Hide all sections” depending on current state.

**Accessibility Reasoning:**  
- Header buttons use `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`.
- Screen reader users hear the label of the global button, which communicates the current action.
- Dynamic label changes serve as an explicit announcement of the action.
- Keyboard accessible: Tab to navigate headers; Enter/Space to toggle.

**Notes:**  
- Avoids presenting “dead” controls; the single button communicates the valid action at all times.
- Hidden SR-only text further clarifies the purpose of the action to screen reader users.

### 🇦🇺 Australian Government (AGDS / NSW / QLD)

**Implementation:**  
- Optional global control with two visible buttons: “Expand all” and “Collapse all.”
- Both buttons are always displayed, affecting all sections in the accordion group.

**Accessibility Reasoning:**  
- Header buttons use `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`.
- Global buttons are standard `<button>` elements with visible text.
- All actions remain explicit and predictable to screen reader users.
- Keyboard navigation and focus handling follow standard best practices.

**Notes:**  
- Showing both buttons simultaneously provides a consistent, explicit representation of all available actions.
- This pattern can enhance comprehension for users of older assistive technologies or users who benefit from stable layouts.

## 🎯 Accessibility Considerations Across Approaches

### Single Toggle Button
- Communicates one valid action at a time.
- Requires dynamic label updates to be announced to assistive technologies.
- Reduces visual clutter but may require ARIA/live region handling to ensure screen reader users perceive changes.

### Dual Buttons (Expand / Collapse)
- Both actions are always visible, giving a clear state readout.
- Provides explicit, predictable controls for screen reader users.
- Can create “null actions” if a user activates a button when all panels are already in that state; can be mitigated with announcements or `aria-disabled`.

### Key Differences Highlighted by Accessibility Experts
- Single toggles rely on **dynamic label updates** to communicate current state.
- Dual buttons prioritize **persistent, explicit actions** for all users.
- Both patterns meet WCAG requirements if implemented correctly:
  - Clear labels describing actions.
  - State changes programmatically conveyed (`aria-expanded`, optional `aria-live` updates).
  - Focus does not move unexpectedly.
- Choice often depends on audience needs:
  - Dynamic toggle works well with modern AT and cognitive load minimization.
  - Dual buttons may be preferred in environments with older assistive technologies or when explicit visibility of all actions is critical.

## 📚 WCAG 2.4.5: Multiple Ways

**Guidance:**  
- **Success Criterion 2.4.5**: More than one way is available to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages except where the Web Page is the result of, or a step in, a process.

**Intent:**  
- The intent of this Success Criterion is to make it possible for users to locate content in a manner that best meets their needs. Users may find one technique easier or more comprehensible to use than another.

**Specific Benefits:**
- Providing an opportunity to navigate sites in more than one manner can help people find information faster. Users with visual impairments may find it easier to navigate to the correct part of the site by using a search, rather than scrolling through a large navigation bar using a screen magnifier or screen reader. A person with cognitive disabilities may prefer a table of contents or site map that provides an overview of the site rather than reading and traversing through several Web pages. Some users may prefer to explore the site in a sequential manner, moving from Web page to Web page in order to best understand the concepts and layout.
