## Architecture Overview

The high-level vision behind the componentâ€™s architectural direction which could include how it will handle properties/data, present markup, its flexibilities and constraints. This might also be a good place to list features.

## Future Considerations

- Should we have different sizes? For example: `small`/`default`/`large`.
- Should we allow icons in with the labels?
- Should we allow icons alone as the label?
