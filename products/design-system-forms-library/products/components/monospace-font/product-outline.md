## Summary
A monospace font is a scalable, accessible font that applies a monospace typeface to designated text elements. It can be configured for font size, weight, and fallback options. It ensures that all characters occupy equal horizontal space, improving legibility for code and structured data.
  
## Purpose & Context
A monospace font ensures consistent character spacing, making it ideal for displaying code, technical data, and tabular information. It provides clarity and alignment in interfaces where precision and readability are critical.

### What Problem Does the Monospace Font Solve?
It solves problems with inconsistent alignment and readability when presenting text on a page. Non-monospaced fonts can cause character misalignment, making content harder to read and understand.

### Who are the primary users of this component?
VFS teams building applications and content for Veteran facing products

## Tasks / Things to consider
### Research
- Audit existing patterns
- Talk to teams/ stakeholders requesting it

### Design & UX
- What are the different states (default, hover, active, disabled, loading)?
- Are there existing design patterns this should follow or extend?
- Does it need to support themes (e.g., light/dark mode)?
- How should it behave responsively (mobile, tablet, desktop)?

### Content Considerations
- Is there new content that needs to be run by CIA?
- Error states, hint text?

### Structure & Content
- What are the required and optional props/inputs?
- Are there any interactive states?
- What variations or configurations are needed (e.g., size, layout, icon options)?
- Are there edge cases to consider?

### Accessibility
- What are the ARIA roles, properties, or patterns needed?
- How will it be usable with keyboard navigation and screen readers?
- Are there any color contrast or focus management considerations?

### Technical Requirements
### Testing & Documentation
- What test coverage is required (unit, integration, visual regression)?
- How will usage examples be documented?
- What controls and props will be exposed in tools like Storybook?

### Versioning & Lifecycle
- How might this component evolve over time?
- Are there plans for deprecation of similar components?
- How will backward compatibility be handled?
