### **Problem Statement 1: Inconsistency Across Experiences**

Veterans interacting with VA digital services often encounter inconsistent user experiences due to a lack of standardized design patterns and components, which can lead to confusion, frustration, and decreased trust.

---

### **Problem Statement 2: Barriers to Accessibility**

Many VA digital experiences fail to fully meet accessibility standards, creating significant barriers for Veterans with disabilities and preventing equitable access to essential services and information.

---

### **Problem Statement 3: Fragmented Development Workflows**

Designers and developers across VA teams frequently recreate UI elements and forms from scratch, leading to wasted effort, inefficiencies, and inconsistent implementation of best practices.

---

### **Problem Statement 4: Slow Time-to-Value**

Without a shared, scalable foundation of design and form tools, digital teams face delays in building and launching new services, reducing the VA’s ability to rapidly respond to Veteran needs.

### **Objective**

To accelerate the creation of accessible, consistent, and Veteran-centered digital experiences by scaling and evolving a shared design system and forms platform for VA teams.

---

### **Problem Statements**

- Inconsistent design and form experiences confuse users and reduce trust.
    
- Accessibility gaps create barriers for Veterans with disabilities.
    
- Duplicate work across teams leads to inefficiency and slower delivery.
    
- Lack of clear guidance or shared tools hampers quality and innovation.

### **Core Hypotheses**

1. **If** we provide a comprehensive, well-documented design system and forms library,  
    **then** design and engineering teams will adopt it more readily, reducing duplicated work and increasing consistency.
    
2. **If** the system is built with accessibility as a foundational principle,  
    **then** Veterans of all abilities will have a more equitable experience across VA digital services.
    
3. **If** we create strong feedback loops with product teams and stakeholders,  
    **then** the system will evolve to better meet real-world needs and foster a culture of continuous improvement.
    
4. **If** we integrate form best practices and common workflows into reusable patterns,  
    **then** teams will deliver form-based interactions faster and with higher quality.

## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up

Check in on people and product progress

- Monday at 11:45am ET. Wed/Thurs at Noon ET, Tues/Fri async
    
- 15 min
    
- Review issues in progress or review/QA to discuss what has been done and if there are any blockers 


#### Retro + Sprint Planning/Grooming

During rero, the team review saccomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improved, what questions people have, and any action items. During planning we outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- Retro: Monday after the sprint ends
    
    - 60 minutes
        
- Planning: Monday the first day of every sprint at noon ET
    
    - 60 mins
        
- Grooming
    
    - The team assesses and updates the workload for the sprint
        
    - 2nd Momday of every sprint at noon ET
        
    - 60 mins

#### Demos to OCTO PO
- Every other Friday on the last day of the sprint at 2:30pm ET

#### Issue Etiquette

For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate (when possible)
    
- Title that explains task
    
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria (optional)
    
- Labels: platform-design-system-team (add appropriate corresponding labels to the ticket for example: “va-textinput”, “dst-engineering” or “dst-design”)
    
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
    
- Nested in an Epic
    

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

#### Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off
    
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
    
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
    
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
    
- Let’s have fun and do great work!
    

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

Private Team Slack channel: #design-system-forms

Public Design System Slack channel: #platform-design-system or #veteran-facing-forms

#### GitHub

GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things

- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub
