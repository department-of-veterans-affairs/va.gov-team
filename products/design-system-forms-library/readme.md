# Design and Forms Systems

The Design System and Forms System are managed by the [Design & Forms Systems team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/design-forms-systems)

"To empower teams across VA to build consistent, accessible, and user-centered digital experiences for Veterans and their families by providing and evolving a scalable design system and forms library that is rooted in quality, collaboration, and innovation."

## Problem Statements

### **Problem Statement 1: Inconsistency Across Experiences**

Veterans interacting with VA digital services often encounter inconsistent user experiences due to a lack of standardized design patterns and components, which can lead to confusion, frustration, and decreased trust.

---

### **Problem Statement 2: Barriers to Accessibility**

Many VA digital experiences fail to fully meet accessibility standards, creating significant barriers for Veterans with disabilities and preventing equitable access to essential services and information.

---

### **Problem Statement 3: Fragmented Development Workflows**

Designers and developers across VA teams frequently recreate UI elements and forms from scratch, leading to wasted effort, inefficiencies, and inconsistent implementation of best practices.

---

### **Problem Statement 4: Slow Time-to-Value**

Without a shared, scalable foundation of design and form tools, digital teams face delays in building and launching new services, reducing the VA's ability to rapidly respond to Veteran needs.

### **Objective**

To accelerate the creation of accessible, consistent, and Veteran-centered digital experiences by scaling and evolving a shared design system and forms platform for VA teams.

### Additional problem statements

- Inconsistent design and form experiences confuse users and reduce trust.
- Accessibility gaps create barriers for Veterans with disabilities.
- Duplicate work across teams leads to inefficiency and slower delivery.
- Lack of clear guidance or shared tools hampers quality and innovation.

## **Core Hypotheses**

1. **If** we provide a comprehensive, well-documented design system and forms library,  
    **then** design and engineering teams will adopt it more readily, reducing duplicated work and increasing consistency.

2. **If** the system is built with accessibility as a foundational principle,  
    **then** Veterans of all abilities will have a more equitable experience across VA digital services.

3. **If** we create strong feedback loops with product teams and stakeholders,  
    **then** the system will evolve to better meet real-world needs and foster a culture of continuous improvement.

4. **If** we integrate form best practices and common workflows into reusable patterns,  
    **then** teams will deliver form-based interactions faster and with higher quality.

## **Key Features & Components**

- A library of reusable, WCAG-compliant UI components & patterns
- Configurable form patterns and templates for common VA workflows
- Figma design tokens and web/mobile component library
