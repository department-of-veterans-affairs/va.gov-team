# Component Checklist Feedback Report  
*Date: September 2025*  

## Executive Summary  
User feedback shows that the **component checklist** is not a primary decision-making tool but can provide value if improved. Key takeaways include:  
- **Low usage overall**: Designers and Engineers rarely use the checklist day-to-day, but see value during audits (especially accessibility).  
- **Trust depends on accuracy**: Users question whether statuses are updated; adding “last updated” dates could build confidence.  
- **Status clarity is needed**: Current maturity and color states are confusing; users want clearer definitions and phase-based statuses.  
- **Accessibility and layout matter**: Red/green icons are not inclusive; users had mixed preferences for accordion vs. summary-at-top layouts.

## 1. Awareness and Use  
- **Checklist is not a primary tool.** Many users said they rarely consult it, unless doing audits or checking accessibility.  
  > *“I don’t think I’ve ever really looked at the checklist stuff… almost never actually.”* – Engineer  
  > *“Whether or not I use a component is at the very top: is it deployed, is it green? I’m good.”* – Designer  
  > *“I don’t really check it unless I need to for accessibility or if someone asks me about maturity.”* – Designer  

- **Value for audits and external reviews.** Some noted that it can still be useful for accessibility or demonstrating robustness to outside stakeholders.  
  > *“The accessibility section could be crucial for auditing and for external government entities to assess maturity.”* – Engineer  
  > *“If I had to show someone outside the team that the system is solid, the checklist could be a good way to prove it.”* – Designer

## 2. Accuracy and Trust  
- **Completion status is questioned.** Users were unsure how closely the checklist is maintained or how often it is updated.  
  > *“How closely is that tracked and how often is that updated? That can get lost in the abyss.”* – Engineer  
  > *“If no one is maintaining it, then it doesn’t mean much.”* – Designer  

- **Perception of staleness reduces reliance.** If the information does not feel current, users may skip it in favor of maturity indicators.  
  > *“If it feels as stale as it does, I don’t even care about completion status. I’ll just go look at maturity.”* – Engineer  
  > *“I’d rather just see a simple status at the top. If it’s old data, the numbers don’t matter.”* – Designer  

- **Proposed fix: show last updated date.** Adding timestamps was suggested as a way to make the checklist more reliable.  
  > *“Maybe we could add a date so people know the accuracy.”* – Designer  
  > *“Even just showing when the checklist was last reviewed would help.”* – Engineer

## 3. Status Indicators and Clarity  
- **Disconnect between top-level maturity and checklist detail.** Some noticed that a component could be marked “green” overall, while details showed incomplete items.  
  > *“It says at the top everything is green, but then at the bottom mobile isn’t even here.”* – Designer  
  > *“It feels inconsistent when the overall maturity doesn’t match what’s in the checklist.”* – Designer  

- **Unclear meaning of caution/orange states.** Users said it wasn’t obvious whether “orange” meant new, incomplete, or something else.  
  > *“Orange could mean a lot of things — maybe it’s new, maybe it’s buggy. It’s not clear what it actually means.”* – Engineer  
  > *“Caution doesn’t tell me enough — I need to know if it’s because research is missing, or development isn’t done.”* – Designer  

- **Interest in phase-based statuses.** Several suggested distinguishing between design complete, development in progress, or research pending.  
  > *“There needs to be some sort of differentiator — is the design done, development in process, or neither?”* – Designer  
  > *“Breaking maturity into stages would make it way clearer than just a color.”* – Engineer  

- **Accessibility considerations.** Red/green icons alone were seen as insufficient for users with color vision deficiencies.  
  > *“My devs who are red-green color blind would not be able to tell the difference.”* – Designer  
  > *“It would be better to have an icon or label instead of just a color.”* – Designer

## 4. Layout Preferences  
- **Mixed reactions to accordions vs. flat lists.** Engineers leaned toward compact accordions, while some Designers preferred either an overview at the top or everything visible.  
  > *“I’d probably say accordions… I don’t really care about the completion status.”* – Engineer  
  > *“I’d prefer just a compact list at the top with a link down if I need details.”* – Designer  
  > *“I don’t mind if it’s long, as long as the most important stuff is at the top.”* – Designer

## 5. Proposed Improvements  
1. **Add “last updated” dates** to increase trust.  
2. **Clarify status meanings** (e.g., design complete, development in progress, deprecated).  
3. **Improve accessibility** of status icons with text labels or alternative markers.  
4. **Prioritize warnings/in-progress first**, instead of listing all completed items.  
5. **Offer flexible layouts** (accordion for compactness; summary at top for scanning).
