# Find a Form engineering README

## Architecture

High level: 
* **Forms DB** is the single source of truth for Form PDFs and Forms metadata. [Forms DB Contacts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/find-a-va-form#va-forms-contacts)
* Forms data (including URLs to PDF files) is migrated nightly from the Forms DB to Drupal CMS, into the VA Forms content type, via Drupal migration.
* VA Forms API in Lighthouse then pulls Forms data from the Drupal CMS nightly, via sidekiq job.
  * `https://api.va.gov/services/va_forms/v0/forms`: Owned by Lighthouse
* [VA.gov Find a Form](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/) makes calls through vets-api to pull form data from the Lighthouse Forms API.
  * `https://api.va.gov/v0/forms`: Public Websites-owned vets-api proxy to the https://api.va.gov/services/va_forms/v0/forms endpoint
* VA.gov Form Detail pages (e.g. https://www.va.gov/find-forms/?q=21-0966) display data housed in Drupal CMS.

### Ownership
**Forms DB** [Contacts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/find-a-va-form#va-forms-contacts)
* Forms DB infrastructure is owned by Office of Information Technology (OIT).
* Forms DB content is owned by Forms Managers from each VA administration.
* Form PDFs are stored on servers managed by OIT. Form downloads from VA.gov point to PDFs on OIT servers.

**[Public Websites team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/README.md#team)** is responsible for:  
* VA Forms content model in Drupal
* Data migration from Forms DB to Drupal
* Drupal CMS editorial experience
* Display of Forms data in VA.gov, specifically Find a Form & Form Detail pages.
* Vets-api endpoint `https://api.va.gov/v0/forms` and triaging related issues.

## Forms DB migration into Drupal CMS: Data Flow & Documentation
[Migrations: Forms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/master/READMES/migrations-forms.md) - describes the data path from the Forms DB > Drupal CMS > Lighthouse > Front-end. 

[Relationship Between VA Forms DB/Lighthouse API/Drupal](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/5702) - 2/2020 Discovery re: Forms architecture and ata storage decision points. 

The import uses Row ID as the unique identifier to map importing content to Drupal nodes. Some fields in Drupal may be customized from within Drupal after import, visible on each node within “Forms DB data” expander.
* [VA Forms Content Flow Topic Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuPI8DB7aR0) - describes the import process in more detail
* [VA Forms - Flagged content dashboard](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/content/flagged?type=va_form&workbench_access_section__section=All) - CMS dashboard of imported/updated Forms content, intended to be used for Editors to update / modify after import as necessary. Not recently used.

## End-to-End Flow to LH Forms API
The path for data calls from `Veteran > VA.gov > vets-api > Lighthouse > delivery to Veteran` is circuitous at best. Much infrastructure is implicated.  

9/2023 - Info provided from Lighthouse team in [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CBU0KDSB1/p1695326998602989?thread_ts=1695043056.784489&cid=CBU0KDSB1)

## Vets-api / Lighthouse Key & rate limits
* Vets-api: VA Forms Code: [vets-api/modules/va_forms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/tree/master/modules/va_forms)
* VA Forms API Documentation: https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/va-forms - Documentation for API that indexes data sourced from VA.gov, Lighthouse

### **API user/key:**
Find Forms uses an API key that belongs to the **`VAGOV` consumer**. This key is used when routing through vets-api to get Lighthouse data. 

**As of 9/2023**: The `VAGOV` consumer has a single API key & rate limit used for all of the following APIs: 
* Decision Reviews API (V1/V2)
* VA Forms API (V0)
* Appeals Status API (V0)
* Benefits Reference Data API
* Address Validation API

**This API key is shared** [Background on shared API keys (Slack)](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CUB5X5MGF/p1695666665300929) The rate limit for this API Key is shared across all of those APIs. If one API has a spike in traffic, that will affect the rate limit for all other APIs using the same key. 

### **Rate limits**
Rate limits are applied _**per consumer**_ to _**all APIs**_ accessed by that consumer.
As of 9/23, the API rate limit is **1,000 requests/min.** (The 1,000 requests/min. rate limit applies to the collective traffic across all APIS accessed by the consumer/key.)

If/when we request rate limit changes, that rate limit will be set for all APIs accessed by the `VAGOV` API consumer (listed above), even if products are using different API keys. And, other products' rate limit requests may affect the Forms product.

More info on [rate limit changes (Github)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/engineering/troubleshooting.md#request-api-limit-increase).

### Error messages
When API hits a rate limit, an error message will be displayed to end users, "We're sorry. Something went wrong when we tried to load the search widget." That message originates from Drupal in a React widget on the Find-Form node:
