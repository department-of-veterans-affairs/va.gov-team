# Find a Form engineering README

## Architecture

High level: 
* **Forms DB** is the single source of truth for Form PDFs and Forms metadata. [Forms DB Contacts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/find-a-va-form#va-forms-contacts)
* Forms data (including URLs to PDF files) is migrated nightly from the Forms DB to Drupal CMS, into the VA Forms content type, via Drupal migration.
* VA Forms API in Lighthouse then pulls Forms data from the Drupal CMS nightly, via sidekiq job.
  * `https://api.va.gov/services/va_forms/v0/forms`: Owned by Lighthouse
* [VA.gov Find a Form](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/) makes calls through vets-api to pull form data from the Lighthouse Forms API.
  * `https://api.va.gov/v0/forms`: Public Websites-owned vets-api proxy to the https://api.va.gov/services/va_forms/v0/forms endpoint
* VA.gov Form Detail pages (e.g. https://www.va.gov/find-forms/?q=21-0966) display data housed in Drupal CMS.

### Ownership
**Forms DB** [Contacts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/find-a-va-form#va-forms-contacts)
* Forms DB infrastructure is owned by Office of Information Technology (OIT).
* Forms DB content is owned by Forms Managers from each VA administration.
* Form PDFs are stored on servers managed by OIT. Form downloads from VA.gov point to PDFs on OIT servers.

**[Public Websites team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/README.md#team)** is responsible for:  
* VA Forms content model in Drupal
* Data migration from Forms DB to Drupal
* Drupal CMS editorial experience
* Display of Forms data in VA.gov, specifically Find a Form & Form Detail pages.
* Vets-api endpoint `https://api.va.gov/v0/forms` and triaging related issues.

## Forms DB migration into Drupal CMS: Data Flow & Documentation
[Migrations: Forms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/master/READMES/migrations-forms.md) - describes the data path from the Forms DB > Drupal CMS > Lighthouse > Front-end. 

[Relationship Between VA Forms DB/Lighthouse API/Drupal](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/5702) - 2/2020 Discovery re: Forms architecture and ata storage decision points. 

## End-to-End Flow to LH Forms API
The path for data calls from `Veteran > VA.gov > vets-api > Lighthouse > delivery to Veteran` is circuitous at best. Much infrastructure is implicated.  

9/2023 - Info provided from Lighthouse team in [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CBU0KDSB1/p1695326998602989?thread_ts=1695043056.784489&cid=CBU0KDSB1)

### Vets-api / Lighthouse Key & rate limits
* Vets-api: VA Forms Code: [vets-api/modules/va_forms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/tree/master/modules/va_forms)
* VA Forms API Documentation: [VA Forms API](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/4621) - Documentation for API that indexes data sourced from VA.gov, Lighthouse

#### **API user/key:**
Find Forms uses an API key that belongs to the `VAGOV` consumer. This key is used when routing through vets-api to get Lighthouse data. 
The VAGOV consumer has access to 5 APIs (as of 9/2023).
**This API key is shared** with at least one other product. [Background on shared API keys (Slack)](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CUB5X5MGF/p1695666665300929)


#### **Rate limits**
Rate limits are applied _**per consumer**_ to _**all APIs**_ accessed by that consumer.
Meaning: if/when we request rate limit changes, that rate limit will be set for all APIs accessed by the `VAGOV` API consumer, even if products are using different API keys. And, other products' rate limit requests may affect the Forms product.

More info on [rate limit changes (Github)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/engineering/troubleshooting.md#request-api-limit-increase).

#### Error messages
When API hits a rate limit, an error message will be displayed to end users, "We're sorry. Something went wrong when we tried to load the search widget." That message originates from Drupal in a React widget on the Find-Form node:
