### What is The Problem to be Solved?

Search research indicates that the VA forms page consistently gets high organic search traffic. However it has almost no or very little conversion value. Because this page already gets high organic traffic and has high potential to provide better conversion:

- We want to redesign experience on this page to the new VA.gov look and feel.
- We want to create new content on this page to drive traffic to top tasks and to the top digital versions of form applications.
- We want to add analytics tracking to all links and downloads.

### Our Bet: Find a VA Form

If we make the VA form search experience more intuitive and user-friendly and provide highly-visible links to relevant content pages and tools, veterans and their care givers will be able to more quickly access PDF forms, online form equivalents, and form-related content.

The Find a VA Form search tool **is**:

 - A tool to help Veterans and their caregivers locate the forms required to apply, or provide data supporting existing applications for Veterans benefits.
 - A tool for finding an online equivalent on a form where one exists.
 - A tool for learning details about a given VA form, along with related forms when applicable
 
The Find a VA Form search is **not**:
- A comprehensive catalog of all VA forms.
- A tool for creating, modifying or deleting VA forms.
- A tool for locating non-VA forms.
