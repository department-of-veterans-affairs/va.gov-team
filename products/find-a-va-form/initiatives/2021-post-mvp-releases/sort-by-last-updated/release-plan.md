# Release Plan Template

So! You're thinking about how you want to launch your product. You know you'll perform usability testing and you'll QA the heck out of it in staging, which are both very critical components of product development. But they don't tell you how people will naturally use your product when you're not there to guide them to it, how any submitted data will get to VA, whether that data will be easy or difficult for VA to process, whether people will be likely to submit duplicates, abandon partway through, or encounter bugs unique to the production environment. All of which could be very detrimental to users, which is the antithesis of what we're here to do. 

So: **how might we craft a release plan to test our product "in the wild" at a smaller scale, and learn how it'll actually be used, and what problems it actually might have or create, and then fix/adjust prior to going live to millions of VA.gov users?**

That's what this Release Plan Template is for!

## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: Jan 25 - Feb 5, 2021
- Desired number of users: 4
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: This minor change will be tested by the Product Team members.
- How you'll conduct the testing: On Staging
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: Provide link to Staging

### Results:
- Number of users: 4
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: 0/0
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: N/A
- Types of errors logged: N/A
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? No
- If yes, what: 

## Phase II: Staged Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)
**Not applicable**

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
