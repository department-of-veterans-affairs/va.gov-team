## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy, and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about getting VA forms online.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not lose your stipend or be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

- I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. **How would you prefer to receive the URL?** 
  - I could dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, email it to you, *(only if on a phone)* text it to you.
    - *(if email)* Is your current email XYX *(get from participant roster)* ?
    - *(if text)* What is your mobile phone number?

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- For screen reader users, if already hearing their screen reader on Zoom, don't check "share computer audio"
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" or  your web browser.
  - *(on a phone)* You will be asked to select what you'd like to share. Please choose "Screen" and then "Start now". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.
  - Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
  - Phone: On the far right is a More button or 3 dots. Tap that and then on Chat or the conversation bubble. 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
