# Release Plan


## Go Live!
**This is the addition of a feature to an existing unauthorized product.**  It has already been instrumented for analytics, and we will not be conducting user testing for this release.  It will be a full, 100% go-live after having been fully tested on Staging by the PO, PM, FE engineer, Lighthouse engineer, and two VA Forms managers.

### Planning:
- Desired date: 07/06/2021
- We will compare search refinement rate and conversion rate before and after launch.  We will consider this a success if the search refinement rate decreases and conversion rate increases.  
## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?  
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
