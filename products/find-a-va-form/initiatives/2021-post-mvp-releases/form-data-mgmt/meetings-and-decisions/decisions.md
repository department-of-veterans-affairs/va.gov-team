# Decisions Related to Form Data Management

## Form Detail Pages to receive "When to use" verbiage 2021-04-08
- DECISION - We are going to ask the Content team to write "When to Use" verbiage for the top 100 searched forms over the past 8 months, and going forward, anything that gets 250 searches a month will have "When to Use" text added.  See [related meeting notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/form-data-mgmt/meetings-and-decisions/meeting_notes.md#2021-04-08-when-to-use-discussion) for further details.

## Duplicate Data Records in Forms API database
- DECISION - Forms that became orphaned in the Forms API database can safely be removed without causing issues for other users of the Forms.
