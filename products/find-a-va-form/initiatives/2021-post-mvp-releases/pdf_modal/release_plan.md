## Guidance

_This Release Plan Template is intended to help ensure your new VSP product or feature is ready for launch and will deliver the desired user outcomes._
* _In Phase 1, you will test your product to learn how it'll actually be used, what problems it might create, and then fix/adjust if necessary prior to going live._
* _In Phase 2, you will define the launch communications plan and post-launch KPIs. **You can close this ticket once you have completed Phase 2**._
* _Phase 3 is optional - you may use it to document post-launch results._

_Fill out the **Planning** sections to start, then the **Results** sections as you complete each phase of testing._
