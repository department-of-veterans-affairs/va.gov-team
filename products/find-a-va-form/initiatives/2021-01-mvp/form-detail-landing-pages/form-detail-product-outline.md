# Mini-product outline for form detail landing pages

This is a brief description of form detail landing pages. Form detail LPs are a part of the larger forms search product. They are different from the forms themselves. 

Form (pdf) URL vs. _Form detail landing page_: 

__A URL to a VA form:__ https://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/10-10EZ-fillable.pdf 

__A URL to a VA form detail _landing page_:__ www.va.gov/vaforms/form_detail.asp?formno=10ez { [see screenshot of legacy page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-va-forms-redesign/forms-landing-pg-10-10EZ.png) -- all legacy form pages are now redirected to the modern exp}

Search research indicates that the VA forms and many legacy form detail LPs have high organic search value. However it has no conversion value for online tools and content. Therefore, we have identified for MVP, the top 30ish forms that correspond to a VA.gov tool or online application. With this MVP:

- we want to redesign experience of the form detail landing pages to the new VA.gov look and feel.
- we want to add helpful contextual information on the detail landing pages, like what benefit/s it's related to, or related benefit content. 
- we want to add links to the matching online tool or application when one is available. 
- we want to add analytics tracking to all links and downloads.
