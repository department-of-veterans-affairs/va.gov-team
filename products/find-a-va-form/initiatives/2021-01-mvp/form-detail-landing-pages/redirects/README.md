## This folder contains the spreadsheet of legacy form detail page URLs to redirect

Based on discussions with Mikki Northuis, we will 1:1 redirect a certain number of high search value form pages plus our top mvp forms. The cutoff was set at 10,000 page visits over a 1 year period. 

The remaining form detail pages will be bulk redirected to the modern form search page. 

### Redirect request is in [ticket #5549](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/5549)
