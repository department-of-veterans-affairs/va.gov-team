### Notes
- Janel, Nancy were not in attendence today
- Are there VHA people invited, or are they just not showing up?
- 2-pronged approach with PDF issues - how to save/format & some user insructions
- Yvette - Missy and some other folks should be involved.
- There is a direct relationship with Adobe
- Is this meeting long enough? Always feels rushed to me.  Maybe we should have a quartely meeting for planning that is separate from this?
- Stressed importance of keeping PDF names the same so we don't lose our important search engine ranking that drives so much of our traffic.

### Metrics related to slide deck
#### Pageviews
- Overall pageviews on VA.gov - down 1.40%
- myhealthevet down 6%
- eBenefits pageviews down 4%
- Facilities down 32%
- Bounce rate across VA.gov - 42%
- Downloading locally is not a sure fix.  The user must have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed and set as the operating system's default.  Mac (Mac OS 11.5% and iOS 11.5% of our users in April), for example, uses its own reader unless that default is changed. This is the modern equivalent of the "best on Netscape" from circa 1995.

#### Browsers used (Re: PDF instructions to use IE)

## 2021-05-04 *Form Fundamentals* Meeting with Kayce White VBAVACO

### Attendees
- Kayce White
- Marci McGuire
- Zach Morel

### About Kayce
- Has been working with forms for 8 years
- Robert Parks is Casey's chief
- Tends to train new forms managers
- PCO - Publication Control Officer - Kayce's title.  She's also a Program Manager

### Questions I have
- Who is able to run the "sync" that creates a new CSV file for the merge?
- Any plans to create online forms for all of the forms out there?  She doesn't know.
- You mentioned 800 forms - we have a little less than 500.  Are the rest internal?

### Roles and Who We Need to Work With
- Kayce will send us her list of contacts
- VA Clearance Office is out of VACO proper Maribel and Dorothy work with the Federal Register and OMB
- List down to VHA is VBA.  The four at the top (Nancy, Yvette, Moneke, Karl) do all of VBA, but they own these three forms -  10206, 10207 and 10208 

### Form Numbering and Managers
- Forms starting with 10- is VHA - their person who upload forms to the web site, Kayce is not sure who that is.  She can forward us the info. 
- VBA - broken down into different business lines (all prefixes start in 20's)
- Office of Admin Review (OAR) - 20- (0995 and 0996 were recently updated; they also own 0998) - Shireen Lackey and Alphonso Bruce.  Form 10182 has no prefix.  10207 or 10208 - Kayce can help with
- Compensation Service (21- prefix) - 10206 - FOYA form is one.  Kayce White, Nicole Hayes (backup), Robert Parks (Chief)
- Pension (21P- prefix) and Fiduciary Service (21PF - prefix)  Some of theirs also start with 21- because they forgot to put the P.  If it's obvious pension, it's them.  For now, check with Kayce
- Education (22- prefix)
Office
- VHA - (10- prefix)
- VACO - VA Central Office
- 20- forms are used by multiple lines of business.  Nancy Kessinger knows more than anyone.  It's either owned by her or she knows who owns it.
- 22- Education
- 25 - OTED - doesn't have any forms yet
- 26 - Loan Guaratny
- 27 - Email all three of them if you have questions
- 28 - Veterans Readiness and Employment
- 29 - Insurance
- 10 - Reach out to Janel Keyes first
- BVA - Sue Hamlin
- VACO - Brian Mano & Missy Vaccaro
- NCA - Cynthia Harvey
- If a form has no prefix, it will probably belong to BVA, VACO or NCA
     - Board of Veterans Affairs 
     - Death Related - NCA
     - VACO - HR related, general specific forms that are not benefit-related, hospital or death related

### Tier Definitions of Changes for Forms
- Tier 1 - Clarification (ie changes to content already within a form) - No OMB (no version date change)
- Tier 2 - Non-Substantive Changes (i.e., formatting) - No OMB (no version date change)
- Tier 3 - Substantive Changes (i.e., new content, removal of content or put through as an extension) - OMB needed
- OMB only cares about a change to the burden or cost to government. Version date is changed to when OMB approves.

### General Form Info
- Forms that don't ask questions are not controlled by OMB.  They don't get updated very often.  If they are updated, the month and year will reflect when it's revised.
- Internal VA site includes ALL forms
- VBA has 850 forms
- All VA-wide there are 1500-1600 forms
- The ones on VA.gov are required for the public to have.  They are specifically just for the use of the agency.
- Expiration date is just an indicator to Kayce that it needs to be looked at.  They still accept them after their expiration date.  An extension is to extend its viability beyond the current expieration date (usually 3 years)
- The OMB number is a control number that never changes as long as a form exists BUT multiple forms that are grouped together can have the same control number.
- FL Forms are really old; they are generally batch printed and mailed out.

### Form Content
- Date in the bottom left is the month and date OMB approved it
- Form number is in the bottom left in a larger typeface
- Version date is NOT the same as last update.  Version date is ONLY month/year.  

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR info)
- OCR has been included in forms for 6 years.  Kayce and Nancy Kessenger originally added them.  This is where things are broken down into little blue boxes per character.

### Forms Process
- Kayce has created flowcharts - she will send to us.
- Workgroup and Systems implmentation adds time to the normal 9-12 months 

### OMB Forms Process
- Five phases
- 9-12 months beginning to end.  Some can take 18+ months. One took 4 years (15 pages)
- Nancy, Moneke, etc. are Kayce's drafters
- OMB Desk Officer - OMB is under the White House, officer is a lawyer.

### Upcoming Changes
- They can usually give us a 90-day heads up that a form is going to be updated.


### Possible Ways We Can Help Them
- Troubleshoot/test new/updated forms for potential issues
- Figure out a way for us to provide announcements on upcoming/recent changes

### Other Notes
- Forms is ramping up; a lot more will be coming
- ðŸ”´ Let Kayce know about the form I saw that had bad alignment - reach out to the PCO for the business line and 
- Let Janel about 10-10CG - the fillables overlap in section 1
- They may not be aware that users cannot save the form.
- ðŸ”´ Send Kayce the info about Adobe LiveCycle support.  She did not know about the issues with the XFA format.
- She has no other way to get forms drafted other than OAF.  Kayce just creates a draft in Word, and she turns that into OAF and they draft it into whatever they are supposed to draft.  Kayce will be our Liason to OAF until they say otherwise.

## 2021-05-04 Meeting with Kayce White VBAVACO

### Attendees
- Kayce White
- Nichole Harris
- John Hashiomoto
- Marci McGuire

###  Discussion about updates
- Kayce doesn't mind providing updates or info, but she wants it to be as up to date as possible.
- There are some APIs and some consumers of the forms who have hard-coded logic around the forms. 
- LH was thinking about building it.  Maybe it makes sense to have the link near the form on the web site near the search.
- Kayce already sends out updates to the VA users
- We'll give it some more thought about how we'd capture this and what it would look like.  We'd build it in the CMS and hand the keys to the CMS to the right people to update the page.
- John considers this good intake and a good idea as we look at the rest of our roadmap.
- Kayce - you'll definitely need more people involved.  Who wants to be involved, who is willing to update the content.
- Per John, the CMS team is swamped for the next few months working on the VAMC sites and the medical center sites. 
- Kayce - if we could road map this out and do this by end of calendar year?
- John - it would be difficult for him to answer due to the CMS dependency.  It may be possible next year. Let us unpack it, break it down and build out the requirements.  What does it look like, is there a simpler or easier approach, the priority and value.
- Kayce - we could use the a company that created it as an example - CPKM portal.  Kayce will send that to us.  
- Kayce works on comp service forms.  For other lines of business, kayce could bring them in and introduce us and then I can reach out to them seperately.
- Kayce wants to be sure that whatever is out there is understandable and uses generic terms.
- Kayce is making a non-substantiative change, and it will affect several systems that Nichole's users own.  She would like to give them 10 business days lead time before the change is released.
- Since we are not VA employees, that presents a challenge.  Kayce will talk to her boss.  Since it's a minor change, she may not be able to give us 10 days.
- Compensation Services is one of the most-used. 
- Nichole would like to bring this forward and take it to the others that she talks to.
- Brian McCarthy was the VSO for VHA - Janel is the Deputy Director there.  She is also Kayce's contact.  VBA has different business lines that manages their forms (which is why they have to have someone to make 
- Kayce can give us a high-level overview of VHA - process flow for updates to forms, OMB updates, differences in types of changes.
- VA.gov - several people were invited to test, give their opinions
- Kayce asked for "Issue date" to be removed, but doesn't get as many questions with "last updated".  Revision Date and Version Date should match.  Revision vs. Version should be the same.
- Form Last Updated makes more sense
- Let's not refer to revision date.  The version date
- Maybe this can be build into whatever new thing we come up with.
- For right now, whether it was updated in December doesn't really matter.
- Can we remove the date? Nichole's users do need the date
- The web admin people - some of the forms get updated when there's no change on their end.
- Kayce 8940- Says 10/29/2020 - she knows that form has not been updated in two years.  Nobody can make a change to a form without coming through her.
- Revision date doesn't necessarily mean version date.  She would not be opposed to having a version date field, which would be the month and year (in the lower-left corner of the form)
- va.gov/find-forms/ - 850 forms that VBA owns reference the old web site that doesn't.  They were not told that a new URL was going to be created - - va.gov/vaforms/ (was probably changed to improve search engine ranking). This is not a big deal.
- Kayce will provide us with a list of all the VCOs.  They may tell us what's coming, but they don't necessarily need other people to know yet because it could change.
