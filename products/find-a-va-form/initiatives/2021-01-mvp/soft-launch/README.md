# MVP Find a VA form soft launch of search experience

## Description
We will publish the Drupal page, but prevent it from showing in search results. We will share with stakeholders to evaluate the search functionality while the page is 'hidden' to the public. We will continue to iterate on design during the soft launch, and iteratively add other aspects of the forms experience (such as form detail landing pages).

- Find Forms search page is published to www.va.gov/find-forms
- va.gov/robots.txt contains a record for /find-forms indicating search engines should not index the page
