# Centralized Forms Iteration (WIP)

## Background

Find a form was redesigned in 2020 with the goals of 
- aligning the page with the VA.gov look and feel
- driving traffic to top tasks and to the top digital versions of form applications with new content (because the page already had consistently high organic search traffic and the potential to provide better conversion)
- adding analytics tracking to all links and downloads

Four years later, the existing benefit-centric IA cannot meet the needs of the changed landscape.                           

### History and resources
- [2021-README](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-01-mvp/README.md#mvp-search-landing-page-status-and-decisions) has timeline of changes and overview of decisions.

## Outcome Summary

The goals of this iteration are
- to create a centralized place for all digitized forms and form-related tasks (i.e. form search, pdf download, pdf upload, online completion)
- to eliminate the need to categorize by benefit or create unique spaces (i.e. /supporting-forms-for-claims/) for each new group of forms
- to eliminate the duplication of content that exists for benefit applications between the form detail page (about pg), the how to apply page, and the introduction pages of the online forms
- to reduce the number of pages fighting for search ranking 
- to allow for growth of and wider contribution to the digital forms space

## Problems to solve

- We are no longer digitizing forms that just support a single benefit for a single audience.
  - Teams are now digitizing forms that support multiple benefit types, aren't related to benefits, allow multiple audience types to submit, or are for non-Veteran audiences.  
- There is an entire library of forms, all of which do not fit into the benefit hub and spoke structure.
- Some forms require follow up reviews/approvals from non-Veteran audiences

### Screens in the Find a form flow

- [Find a form landing page](www.va.gov/find-a-form/)
- Detail page - example: About VA Form 10-10EZ](www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-10-10ez/)
  - In 2021, the Find a Form Team determined that the Top 100 most searched forms were the ideal scope for Details Pages and declared that only new Veteran-facing forms and selected non-Veteran facing forms averaging more than 200 Find a Form searches a month would receive Details page treatment
  - Today, CAIA determines if a form needs a detail page and if so, they add the relevant details (i.e., when to use, related forms)

## Proposed future experience

This iteration proposed a centralized forms experience where online forms and applications live, rather than in the hubs.  
The landing page includes search field, search result, and quick links to key forms. 

## Governance
The following areas will need clear decisions and documentation 
- Criteria to determine which types of pages are created, expected content for the page, and the team responsble for creating them
- Expectations for search results (i.e. what actions are displayed within the search results vs available on the detail page)

### Questions
Answers to the following questions will influence the next iteration

** Veteran experience**
- Are Veterans negatively impacted by the duplicative content included in the flow? If so, how?
- What role does the Find a form tool play in finding and using digitized forms? What is the typical user flow?
  - How might changing the existing experience impact Veteran usability?

** Content and IA strategies**
- What is the strategy for the "About" pages? What is the criteria for whether or not a page is published?
  - They perform well in search results but also compete with the form and with "how to apply" pages.
  - An "about" page might be redundant if there is a digital form.
  - Without a detail page, search results could just point to the appropriate page - but not every form has a home.
- What info should live with form vs benefit? And where does that content fit within the journey?
- Where does the online version of a combined form live? Should the individual form live with a combined form?
- What forms (if any) should remain in the benefit hub space?
- Should authenticated forms live in the new central home with an authenticated widget back on intro page?

** Forms and audience landscape **
- How many forms support more than one benefit?  
- How many forms don't relate to benefits at all?
- How many forms have more than one audience?
- How many forms have non-Veteran audiences (and who are they?)
- How many Veteran-facing forms also require actions from non-Veteran audiences?  


## Measuring Success

### Desirable user outcomes
- Improved time to find and use forms
- Reduced cognitive load by eliminating the need to understand how a form relates to the benefit hub IA to know where to go to find it
- Increased findability of forms and form related tasks by having a single common location that all entry points lead to and can be easily bookmarked for return visits
- Improved and simplified search results by reducing the number of pages competing for ranking for the same form

### Desirable business outcomes
- Reduced maintenance of duplicative content
- Reduced need for IA maintenance (i.e. form movement) as the site and digitized forms space grows
- Increased "self-service" placement by providing a simplified IA structure and related guidance on placement of digitized forms within the experience
- Increased ability for wider contribution to the digital forms space
- Decreased number of search best bets needed to highlight the most valid option in search
