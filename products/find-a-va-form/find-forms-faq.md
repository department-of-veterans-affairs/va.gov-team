# Find Forms FAQ
<hr> 

### A form is added to the forms database, when will it be available on the frontend?
The content management system (CMS) syncs with the database during the nightly migration at 12:00AM EST, so it becomes aware of the new form once this is complete. 

<hr> 

### A newly added form was uploaded to the forms database, but the form details page is not available. Where is it?
The new form is initially set as a draft in the CMS system. The Sitewide Content team owns decision making around which forms can / should be published to have their own form detail pages. Once the form has been reviewed and is set to *Published* by the Content team, the forms details page will be able to be statically generated, and will be live on VA.gov after the next content release. 

Until then, the result may show in *Find VA Forms* search, but the hyperlink to the details page will not be available. The link will become active in search results, after the next nightly migration from Drupal to Lighthouse.

### In the CMS dashboard, a form title was edited. How long until the change is reflected on the frontend?
The `content-build` repository is built for production once an hour(ish) between 9:00AM EST and 5:00PM EST, Monday through Friday. Changes to the CMS are applied during each of these builds. 

#### Example 1) 
  - A form title was edited in the CMS at 1:24PM EST on Tuesday. The change will be applied and reflected in the frontend around 2:00PM EST Tuesday.

#### Example 2) 
  - A form title was edited in the CMS at 11:47PM EST on Thursday. The change will be applied and reflected in the frontend around 9:00AM EST Friday.

#### Example 3)
  - A form title was edited in the CMS at 9:10AM EST on Saturday. The change will be applied and reflected in the frontend around 9:00AM EST Monday.

### A form name was changed upstream in the database. Will this cause an outage?
No, a form name update in the database should NOT cause an outage. The RowID is the unique identifier across the forms database, the CMS, and Lighthouse.

### A form filename was changed upstream in the database. Will this cause an outage?
Yes, a form filename update in the database WILL cause an outage. The length of the outage depends on what time the file name was changed. 

**Note**: *The filenames of forms should NOT to be edited by the forms database team, but they are fairly often.*

#### Example 1) Short outage
  - A form filename was changed from [VBA-22-1990t-ARE](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-1990t-ARE.pdf) was changed to [VBA-22-1990t-ARE-ZZZ](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-1990t-ARE-ZZZ.pdf) in the database at 11:15PM EST on Monday. The CMS will not know about the change until the nightly migration at 12:00AM EST on Tuesday. Lighthouse will not know about the change until it's nightly pull at 3:00AM EST Tuesday. Then it will not appear correctly until the first `content-build` build at 9:00AM EST on Tuesday, thus resulting in an outage of this form for ~9.75 hours.

#### Example 2) Medium outage
  - A form filename was changed from [VBA-22-1990t-ARE](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-1990t-ARE.pdf) was changed to [VBA-22-1990t-ARE-ZZZ](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-1990t-ARE-ZZZ.pdf) in the database at 2:00PM EST on Tuesday. The CMS will not know about the change until the nightly migration at 12:00AM EST on Wednesday. Lighthouse will not know about the change until it's nightly pull at 3:00AM EST Wednesday. Then it will not appear correctly until the first `content-build` build at 9:00AM EST on Wednesday, thus resulting in an outage of this form for ~19 hours.

#### Example 3) Long outage
  - A form filename was changed from [VBA-22-1990t-ARE](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-1990t-ARE.pdf) was changed to [VBA-22-1990t-ARE-ZZZ](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-1990t-ARE-ZZZ.pdf) in the database at 3:00PM EST on Friday. The CMS will not know about the change until the nightly migration at 12:00AM EST on Saturday. Lighthouse will not know about the change until it's nightly pull at 3:00AM EST Saturday. Then it will not appear correctly until the first `content-build` build at 9:00AM EST on Monday, thus resulting in an outage of this form for ~66 hours.
