## 2021-04-09 Monthly Stakeholder Meeting

#### Attendees
- John Hashimoto, PO
- Marci McGuire, PM
- Janel Keyes
- Adrienne Hooten
- Robert Parks
- JP (John P DiMartino)
- TB 
- UU

#### Notes
- Would like some metrics on how many of each form is being processed on paper and digitally.
- We went through the slide deck - enhancements, metrics, next
- Looking for a stakeholder who can help us with getting the legacy forms publishing turned off
- Discussed possible POC for managing forms through the Drupal CMS
- Janel is hearing about managing the forms through Drupal for the very first time
     - We could do discovery work, conversation, understanding better how it works now and potential opportunities in the future. 

#### Decisions
- We can put the CMS POC idea on the back burner until 2nd half of the year.  Janel is stretched thin. We will bring this back up in the fall.

#### Action Items
- Provide slide deck to attendees
- Distinguish traffic from internal network searches (VA employees vs. non-VA)
- We need to get someone from the VBA forms team on the call.  Adrienne will get us a contact.
