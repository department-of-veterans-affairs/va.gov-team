# Meeting Notes

## 2021-04-07 Content Updates Meeting
### Attendees
- John Hashimoto, PO
- Marci McGuire, PM
- Selina Cooper, Content Writer
- Randi Hecht, Senior Writer
- Beth Potts, Sitewide Content Lead

### Notes
- John gave background
- We are not going to add descriptions to all 500
- Initial philosophy was that only the most important Veteran facing forms would have descriptions
- Every form in the database has a PDF
- Anything that gets published form the CMS gets at least a minimal detail page
- Some of them we add additional information (related benefits, related forms, when to use this form)
- John is of the opinion that all the veteran facing forms should have a description of what the form is used for
- Beth - biggest question is how to prioritize the work when she knows that soon-ish that Randi and Selina will be working on other things in the pipeline
- Beth would also like to look at one of the pages and think about the components. 
- Beth wants to be clear that the work they have slotted for the content team members on this call will ramp up and this will become a lower priority, so she would rather have them focus on what we really want to get done
- It would be good to know which forms are associated with which SMEs and where the drop off is for the forms that are most searched.
- With the SMEs, it's hardly ever getting it back in two weeks.  It could be two weeks, a month, two months.  There will also sometimes need to be a back and forth via email, but it depends on the person.
- The pieces of data can be done piecemeal.

### Decisions
- Getting the "When to Use" this form is the most important
- Related Forms is an exception, and probably the hardest part to track down
- We draft the detail page, and it needs to get in front of a SME
- At some point there's diminishing returns
- John and I will provide mroe specifics about which forms and which content is most important for them to focus on first
- John and I will tee up all the communication to the SMEs
- We will make sure there is clarity around the Helpful links
- We could put some draft stuff in a document and have a SME review before we put into the CMS. Selina thinks it was done in Word copydeck first and then it was done in Drupal
- John and I will also be responsible for the Online Tool component.

### Action Items
- Update the content request with more details on areas of focus
- Create a copydeck for the SMEs that, for each field includes
    - Form name
    - Draft description
    - SME
    - Space for SMEs to add related forms (if applicable).
    - Reconvene with Content team to review updated request.
