https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2020/05/12/electronic-signatures-in-the-coronavirus-covid-19-era

### Initiative Name
Find a Form - e-Application/Digital Signature Option

### Problem Statement / How Might We statements
How might we make it easier for Veterans and their caretakers to apply for a wider range of benefits without the complicatons of using a download and print paper form?

### What Sprint Teams Are Associated with this Discovery? 
* Decision Tools (Find a Form)

### Background 

More than 20 years ago, the landmark Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce (ESIGN) Act was passed in the U.S. to address the growing need for a consistent standard for electronic signatures. While this legislation certainly paved the way for the use of electronic signatures in government, it wasnâ€™t until the COVID-19 pandemic when agencies were truly forced to use this innovation for meeting citizen needs during a challenging time. 

Docusign has an Enterprise License Agreement with VA to digitize many of the VA's paper intensive processes such as consent and privacy docs.  VA has the opportunity to test the desirability and viability of electronic signature transaction -- which has become common in the consumer sector (e.g. Home Loans, legal agreements, etc.) -- using the new modernized Find a Form tool as the test bed.

**Benefits of e-Signature solution**

An e-Signature solution should provide the following benefits:

- Legally binding signature
- Can support multiple signatures (e.g. Veteran and Spouse, Dependents, Attorney) 
- Application can not be submitted without completion of Required fields 
- Attachments can be included for supporting documents
- Can automatically add up loan amounts and use of funds amounts to take the burden off the applicant
- Allows user to save and return later to complete process
- Is Secure, encrypted in transit and in rest
- Is accessible to those using screen readers
- Requires no special plug-in or helper application
- Success metrics would include:
  - Evidence of user preference over standard digital download and email/fax
  - Reduced "error rate" in submitted documents
  - Reduction in labor costs associated with manually keying in form data
  - Faster speed to outcomes

## DISCOVERY PLANNING

### Project Details

* What do we know?
   - There are currently ~1500 VA Forms on the VA Intranet, ~400 PDF forms available on Find a VA Form, ~40 of which have a web-based alternative
   - It would be extremely time consuming and labor intensive to build web-based interfaces for every form
   - Several of the current web-based alternatives ultimately insert user-entered data into a PDF form in the background
   - The VA has been incorporating digital signature into forms for several years and more recently has been utilizing dynamic XFA-based digital signature fields as a result of updating to Adobe's current PDF creation tool
   - The VA plans to continue incorporating digital signatures into forms.
   - According to Adobe, PDF forms that utilize dynamic XFA are incompatable with modern web browsers.  Further research indicates this incompatibility occurred because XFA is  was dropped from the ISO's PDF 2.0 standardard in 2017.
   - The addition of dynamic XFA to an existing VA form can cause web-based form-filling applications to unexpectedly stop functioning.  As a workaround, some teams supporting the VA have opted to create a "flattened" copy of the PDF form stored outside the VA database.  Having multiple copies of the same form introduces the risk for out-of-sync versions of forms.
    - As of June 2021, users who downloaded PDF forms from Find a VA Form used the following browsers and operating systems:
        - Chrome on Windows: 36.97%
        - Edge on Windows: 26.31%
        - Internet Explorer on Windows: 9.55%
        - Safari on Macintosh: 8.11%
        - Safari on iOS: 6.05%
        - Chrome on Android: 4.53%
        - Chrome on Macintosh: 3.04%
        - Chrome on Chrome OS: 1.53%
        - Chrome on iOS: 0.74% 
    - The behavior of dynamic XFA forms varies depending on the browser and user's system settings and the manner in which the PDF is downloaded and opened.  The form may display a "Please wait" error message, or it may open in the browser, and unbeknownst to the user, fail to render the digital signature fields or other dynamic XFA fields.
    - The only completely reliable way to fill out forms containing dynamic XFA is to save them locally and complete them in Adobe Acrobat Reader
    - There is an attribute currently used on Find a VA Form that will instruct the web browser to **download** a PDF form rather than attempt to open it within the browser window
    - The above-mentioned attribute works only if the form is hosted on the same domain as the web page containing the link.  Some PDF forms available on Find a VA Form are hosted on a VA subdomain (ex vba.va.gov), which prevents the use of the download attribute. In those cases, if the user does not have Adobe Acrobat Reader set as their default for opening PDF files, the file may open in the browser, another PDF reader, or may display an error message in the browser.
    - PDF forms present challenges to those who rely on screen reader technology including users who are blind or have low vision
    - Multi-step instructons -- download Adobe Acrobat Reader, download the the PDF form, locate the form it on the user's local device, and then open -- may confuse, overwhelm frustrate older users and those with mental health conditions, cognitive issues or tramautic brain injury
* What don't we know?
    - If a user has Adobe Acrobat Reader installed, or if it is set as their default PDF reader
    - How many users actually succeed in completing and sending in a PDF form after having clicked a PDF link or downloaded a PDF
    - How many users who download and open a PDF in their browser vs. those who download and save it locally
    - What pecent of users are willing or able to follow multi-step instructions for downloading a PDF (and Adobe Acrobat Reader if they don't already have it)
* Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?
     - Yes
* How are we going to find out answers? (There are tons of different methods to choose from depending on your project goals, resources, and time constraints. Checkout the methods and templates provided in the [Discovery Toolkit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) and consult the [Research Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/research).)
     - We plan to conduct a research study with users wherein they will be asked to download specific PDF forms selected due to their varying behavior in different browsers
     - We will inquire about the feasibility of using analytics to distinguish between those who downloaded a PDF into their browser vs. on their device
* What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem (bonus points for our personas)?
    - All users should benefit in some way from improved ease-of-use and form behavior predictability, but it should be particularly beneficial to those who:
        - Do not use the Internet often, or have no/limited familiarity with PDFs
        - Have never downloaded and installed a helper application like Adobe Acrobat Reader
        - Only have access to a work or public computer that does not allow them to download files or install Adobe Acrobat Reader
        - Have difficulty locating a file once they have downloaded to their local device or computer
        - Use a screen reader due to low vision or blindness
        - Have suffered a traumatic brain injury or have other mental health conditions affecting their congnitive abilities
* Who do we needs to talk to (stakeholders, Veterans, MHV Coordinators, etc.)? (Try to get a wide variety of people to get a range of perspectives â€“ both higher ups and people on the ground doing the work. Meet with people in person whenever possible.)
    - OMB Personnel to better understand the overall form creation/approval/modification process
    - VA Forms leadership to better understand the end-to-end workflow from form design to the processing of submitted forms
    - VA Forms Managers to better understand their workflow in adding new or updated forms to the VA system
    - Other technical teams that fill out VA forms in the background as part of their web applications
    - VA personnel who key/OCR paper forms that have been emailed, mailed, or faxed in (Centralized Mail)?
    - VA personnel who make decisions based on the information provided in forms
    - People who manage the database(s) where the form contents are ultimately stored
    - Veterans so that we can observe their experience with using PDF forms
* What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?
* Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?
* Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?
