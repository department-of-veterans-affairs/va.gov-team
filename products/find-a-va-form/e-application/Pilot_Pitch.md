## DISCOVERY SPRINT BRIEF


### Initiative Name
Find a Form - e-Application/e-Signature Option

### Problem Statement / How Might We statements
How might we make it easier for Veterans and their caretakers to apply for a wider range of benefits without the complicatons of using a download and print paper form?

### What Sprint Teams Are Associated with this Discovery? 
* Decision Tools (Find a Form)

### Background 

More than 20 years ago, the landmark Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce (ESIGN) Act was passed in the U.S. to address the growing need for a consistent standard for electronic signatures. While this legislation certainly paved the way for the use of electronic signatures in government, it wasn’t until the COVID-19 pandemic when agencies were truly forced to use this innovation for meeting citizen needs during a challenging time. 

Docusign has an Enterprise License Agreement with VA to digitize many of the VA's paper intensive processes such as consent and privacy docs.  VA has the opportunity to test the desirability and viability of electronic signature transaction -- which has become common in the consumer sector (e.g. Home Loans, legal agreements, etc.) -- using the new modernized Find a Form tool as the test bed.

**Benefits of e-Signature solution

An e-Signature solution should provide the following benefits:

- Legally binding signature
- Can support multiple signatures (e.g. Veteran and Spouse, Dependents, Attorney) 
- Application can be submitted without completion of Required fields 
- Attachments can be included for supporting documents
- Can automatically add up loan amounts and use of funds amounts to take the burden off the applicant
- Allows user to save and return later to complete process
- Is Secure, encrypted in transit and in rest
- Success metrics would include:
  - Evidence of user preference over standard digital download and email/fax
  - Reduced "error rate" in submitted documents
  - Faster speed to outcomes

### Project Details

* What do we know?
* What don't we know?
* Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?
* How are we going to find out answers? (There are tons of different methods to choose from depending on your project goals, resources, and time constraints. Checkout the methods and templates provided in the [Discovery Toolkit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) and consult the [Research Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/research).)
* What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem (bonus points for our personas)?
* Who do we need to talk to (stakeholders, Veterans, MHV Coordinators, etc.)? (Try to get a wide variety of people to get a range of perspectives – both higher ups and people on the ground doing the work. Meet with people in person whenever possible.)
* What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?
* Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?
* Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?
