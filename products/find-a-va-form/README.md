## Find Forms Product Brief

### Overview
[Forms overview topic dive](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/sitewide/topic-dives#71024---find-a-form)

### Problem Statement
Search research indicates that the VA forms page consistently gets high organic search traffic. However it has almost no or very little conversion value. Because this page already gets high organic traffic and has high potential to provide better conversion:

- we want to redesign experience on this page to the new VA.gov look and feel.
- we want to create new content on this page to drive traffic to top tasks and to the top digital versions of form applications.
- we want to add analytics tracking to all links and downloads.

## Important technical constraints and dependencies

### Lighthouse API

The forms endpoint on the Lighthouse Forms API has a rate limit. That limit was hit in August 2023 when a PACT Act deadline drove a huge surge in demand for a particular form. The presence of a rate limit is difficult to detect because the errors are masked by the many layers of the VA network stack. In practice, a rate limit could be experienced as 502 response codes occurring on the vets-api endpoint (https://api.va.gov/v0/forms), and 429 response codes on the Lighthouse endpoint (https://api.va.gov/services/va_forms/v0/forms).

Rate limit history:
- 240 requests / min = the orignal rate limit  ([slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CBU0KDSB1/p1691433561014359?thread_ts=1691430186.980299&cid=CBU0KDSB1), from Kristen Brown)
- 500/min = New rate limit as of 8/8/2023, after our increase request

## VA Forms Contacts
Within VA, all administrations have an internal process to review & approve forms being published. When approved, forms publishing rolls up through the list of **VA forms stakeholder working group contacts** below, per admin / program. Final forms are mastered in the Forms DB, which is managed by OIT. The VA.gov Drupal CMS migrates form data nightly from the Forms DB. Any corrections must be made upstream in the Forms DB.

### Corrections
If you discover that a specific form PDF has a problem (dead link, incorrect info, problems being fillable, incorrect metadata, etc.), the correct process to mitigate is: 
* Reach out to the Forms manager for the administration in question (e.g. VBA, VACO, VHA) by email.
* cc Michelle Middaugh, the OCTODE Product Owner of the Forms DB integration into Drupal and VA.gov
* Provide the link to the form on VA.gov, and or the direct link to the PDF in question, and request that the Forms Manager correct the PDF and upload a new version to the Forms DB, or correct the form metadata, etc.

### Forms managers
Forms managers provide an administrative function to manage Forms data entry and final approved PDFs per administration in the Forms DB.
