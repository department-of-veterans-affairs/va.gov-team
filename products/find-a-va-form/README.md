## Find Forms Product Brief

### Overview
[Forms overview topic dive](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/sitewide/topic-dives#71024---find-a-form)

### Problem Statement
Search research indicates that the VA forms page consistently gets high organic search traffic. However it has almost no or very little conversion value. Because this page already gets high organic traffic and has high potential to provide better conversion:

- we want to redesign experience on this page to the new VA.gov look and feel.
- we want to create new content on this page to drive traffic to top tasks and to the top digital versions of form applications.
- we want to add analytics tracking to all links and downloads.

## Lighthouse Forms API dependency

### Data flow
Find Forms is integrated with the Lighthouse Forms API. 
* Drupal pulls Forms DB data nightly
* Lighthouse then pulls Forms data from the Drupal CMS
* The VA.gov front-end then queries Lighthouse for Form data to display on the FE

[Forms migration docs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/main/READMES/migrations-forms.md)

## VA Forms Contacts
Within VA, all administrations have an internal process to review & approve forms being published. When approved, forms publishing rolls up through the list of **VA forms stakeholder working group contacts** below, per admin / program. Final forms are mastered in the Forms DB, which is managed by OIT. The VA.gov Drupal CMS migrates form data nightly from the Forms DB. Any corrections must be made upstream in the Forms DB.

### Corrections
If you discover that a specific form PDF has a problem (dead link, incorrect info, problems being fillable, incorrect metadata, etc.), the correct process to mitigate is: 
* Email to the VA Forms Managers group email (VAFormsManagers@mail.va.gov), copy the relevant Forms manager (below) for the administration in question (e.g. VBA, VACO, VHA), cc Michelle Middaugh (suzanne.middaugh@va.gov), the OCTODE Product Owner of the Forms DB integration into Drupal and VA.gov
* Provide the link to the form on VA.gov, and or the direct link to the PDF in question, and request that the Forms Manager correct the PDF and upload a new version to the Forms DB, or correct the form metadata, etc.

**Forms managers**
Forms managers provide an administrative function to manage Forms data entry and final approved PDFs per administration in the Forms DB. 

|Form prefix | Administration | Forms POC|
|----|----|----|
|"10-" (e.g. 10-1234) | VHA | Bennett, Grant <Grant.Bennett@va.gov>: VHA Forms manager|
