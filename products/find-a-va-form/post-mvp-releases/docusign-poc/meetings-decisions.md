# Meetings and Decisions

## Digital Signature at VA with John

### Attendees
- John Hashimoto
- Marci McGuire

### Notes
- Would it be worthwhile to do a research study and observe  that we know are problematic so we have research data that backs ups a change is needed?
- Cody Reinhold - USDS engineer.  In the identify space.  Also connected to the privacy office.  
   - Skeptical that we need DocuSign to fulfill the OMB requirements for the 1-5 form use case
 - We are going to team with Cody for a couple of weeks
 - Docusign wallet is $4.00 per wallet - a propery ROI study could be done.
 - One-click signing and sending a confirmation are two things DS cannot do.
