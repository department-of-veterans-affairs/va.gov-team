# Search Logic Brainstorming 2021-03-29

## These changes can't be tested in Staging 
- Review what Chellin/Nick were
- Zach has looked at the logic that John provided
- We already do some of the filtering that they are doing on Resources and Support
- Unpluralization could be added
- Ours is more about the popularity of a form and how we figure that out
- We are not sure if we can hit Drupal directly
- We would need an expert (Steve) to say that is how it should be done
- VA.gov is too busy; too much traffic
- Popularity would be based on number of PDF downloads
- ACTION - Search the top text-based phrases and evaluate the quality & determine featured forms; re-check quarterly
- Popularity would need to be added to the sorting
