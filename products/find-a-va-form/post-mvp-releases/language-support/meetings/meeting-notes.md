- Setting the language attribute is at the page level
- They can also set the language attribute of links
- Other than, th
- Ultimate solution will be a tree of React component.  The children will have access to JSON key value pairs, and the front end can change language on the fly
- We are making this change on the front end now, but the ultimate solution will be on the back end.  Sharon's team is working with Danielle to present to Chris and the CTO in late June.  Will then depend on what kind of approval and funding.  Late this year, likely early next year.
- If they put in a request to add the language attribute in the CMS, 
- Per Zach, but it looks like they actually care about the HTML metadata at the type of the page in the template.
- Fareez - they are able to set the parentmost content div dynamically.  There is an HTML tag, and the div with the ID content.  What they are struggling with is adding that at the field level vs. the page level
- Sharon's team could potentially do a translation of the "when to use this form" text
- We need a translation on the Spanish templates also
- I can find out if there can be a seperate template in Spanish.
- I also need to define the scope - how many forms are related to those 11 Spanish forms?
- We may come to a conclusion in two weeks that this can't be done, or we decide we can do the 11 short-term until we have a longer-term solution.
- Next steps - Sharon will catch up with Danielle & we'll get back together.
- I'll post my findings in GH this afternoon
