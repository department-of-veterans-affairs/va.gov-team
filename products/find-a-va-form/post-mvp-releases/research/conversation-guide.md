## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy, and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about getting VA forms online.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" or  your web browser.
  - *(on a phone)* You will be asked to select what you'd like to share. Please choose "Screen" and then "Start now". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.
  - Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Veteran Tasks
Imagine that you just learned that you can complete VA forms electronically. I’m going to give you some forms to find, and I’d like you to fill them out to submit to the VA. I'll have you start from a website that I'm going to put into the Zoom chat for you to click on (https://staging.va.gov/find-forms/).
