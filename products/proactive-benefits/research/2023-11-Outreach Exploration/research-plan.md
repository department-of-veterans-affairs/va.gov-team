# Research Plan for Proactive Benefits, November 2023

## Background

[Link to product brief](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Proactive%20Benefits/Brief-701b%20Active%20Cancers%20Use%20Case.docx?d=wb2c5defa1c3944fe955e576842b94e23\&csf=1\&web=1\&e=otDhfW)

In August of 2022, Congress passed the PACT Act, which is a law that expands VA health care and benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances for Veterans in the Vietnam War, Gulf War, and post-9/11 era.  The PACT Act adds to the list of health conditions that we assume (or “presume”) are caused by exposure to these substances.

Section 701b of the PACT Act required a benefits modernization plan from VA, and one idea noted in that plan was scanning VBA and VHA records to find Veterans that are likely eligible for benefits but are not receiving them, and proactively reaching out to Veterans to get them those benefits.

After conducting some preliminary secondary research to determine an initial cohort for this proactive offer, we have decided to focus on Veterans with a VHA diagnosis of prostate or breast cancer and Gulf War service history, as we believe they are extremely likely to have disability compensation granted, and would benefit greatly from it: if a Veteran has an active cancer diagnosis for a service-connected cancer, they are automatically and temporarily bumped up to a 100% overall rating. ($3600/month). 

Our assumption is that Veterans with active cancers now presumptively related to their service may not be familiar with the changes in the PACT Act, and therefore may be missing out on compensation. We aim to bridge this gap by identifying a cohort of users who may benefit from a proactive claim solicitation because of their past service history and health status and design a workflow in which the Veteran receives a notification, is invited to submit a claim, and that claim is tracked through award.

We are in the early exploratory stage of this project, and our research is focused specifically on the first step of this process–our initial outreach to Veterans to inform them of their potential eligibility for disability compensation. 


### OCTO Priorities

This research supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md): 

- Enhance Veteran’s personalized online experience
- Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims


### Veteran Journey

Filing for benefits can happen throughout much of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). Our effort to connect Veterans with benefits proactively has the potential to provide support at a number of points throughout the Veteran journey, with a specific focus on the “Taking care of myself” stage of the journey. Within this stage, managing primary care and chronic health issues is a moment that matters. 

Other stages of the Veteran journey that our efforts could impact include: Getting out, Starting up, Putting down roots, Retiring, and Aging.


## Research Goals

1. Validate assumptions regarding areas of improvement for the letter and test Veteran comprehension and reaction
2. Build on our current understanding of Veteran’s communication preferences 
3. Deepen our understanding of the experience of this cohort of Veterans and find out how they might respond to this outreach


### Outcome

Given that we are in the early exploratory phase of this project, this research aims to strengthen our understanding of this space and begin to validate some of our initial assumptions about our project approach and Veteran cohort. More specifically, we anticipate that this research will:

1. Inform our outreach, not only in terms of format (i.e. channel) and content but also our outreach strategy 
2. Deepen our understanding of Veteran communication preferences and perceptions; this will not only inform our outreach strategy but also identify barriers and opportunities that we can address to help streamline the experience of being informed of benefits proactively to filing a claim.
3. Provide recommendations and insights that will inform our project’s roadmap


### Research questions

Research Goal #1: Validate assumptions regarding areas of improvement for the letter and test Veteran comprehension and reaction.

1. Validate our assumptions about the letter

   1. Is the length of the letter impacting the letter’s readability and Veteran comprehension?
   2. Is the call to action clear?
   3. Is the benefit to taking immediate action in response to the letter clear and compelling to our cohort of Veterans?

2. Understanding Veteran comprehension, motivation, and barriers to action

   1. Do Veterans understand the contents of the outreach letter?
   2. Is the call to action clear and compelling?
   3. What questions or concerns do Veterans have about the outreach?
   4. What logistical or psychological barriers are standing in the way of Veterans acting on this now?

Research Goal #2: Build on our current understanding of Veteran’s communication preferences. 

1. What do Veterans currently experience in regards to communications from the VA?
2. What are Veteran perceptions of different forms of communication (i.e letter v. email v. text?)
3. Do Veterans have expectations or varying mental models tied to specific communication formats? (Ex: are physical letters viewed as more trustworthy and official?)
4. Do Veterans feel empowered to manage the communication they receive?

Research Goal #3: Deepen our understanding of the experience of this cohort of Veterans and find out how they might respond to this outreach.

1. How might Veterans respond to this outreach, and how does this compare to our team’s expectations?

   1. Ex: Our assumption and goal is to guide Veterans to va.gov. Is this the most likely action in reality?

2. What is this cohort’s awareness level of the PACT Act? How might this impact Veteran’s response to or understanding of our outreach?

   1. Ex: For Veterans who are aware of the PACT Act and know they have a PACT Act presumptive condition, what is stopping them from filing a claim?

3. How can we build trust with Veterans in this interaction?

4. How might we approach our touchpoints with Veterans knowing that they are actively managing a diagnosis and/or care? How might their current experience impact how they receive, process, and respond to information about relevant benefits?

   1. Ex: Does receiving outreach during this time feel welcome or invasive?
   2. Ex: What role might caregivers play in this experience?

5. How do we better understand Veteran sensitivities in order to better connect them with benefits they may be entitled to without making them feel uncomfortable (i.e. do Veterans feel comfortable receiving this kind of targeted outreach based on their medical records?)


### Hypotheses

1. Veterans are unfamiliar with changes in eligibility as a result of the PACT Act becoming law.
2. Veterans may be confused by or uncomfortable with targeted outreach based on access to their medical records. 
3. The call to action in the outreach letter is clear and compelling.


## Methodology

For this study, we will be facilitating semi-structured interviews with Veterans. We will share two versions of the same letter with Veterans as conversation stimuli for our interviews; half of our participants will be shown the original letter, while the other half will be shown a modified version of the letter. The outreach letters detail a Veteran’s potential eligibility for VA disability compensation under the PACT Act.


### Location

These research sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

Our intended audience for this research are Veterans who have experience with a cancer diagnosis. Given that this is a remote moderated study, we plan to work with Perigean to recruit participants. Using Perigean recruiting, we would like to schedule 12 participants in order to achieve 6-8 completed sessions. 


### Recruitment criteria

If possible, we’d like to request a kickoff call with Perigean on Friday, Nov 3 or Monday, Nov 6.
