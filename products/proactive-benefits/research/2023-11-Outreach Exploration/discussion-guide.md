# Conversation Guide for Proactive Benefits, November 2023

This is the general guide containing all possible questions for participating Veterans. Not all of these questions will be asked, and “probe” questions are listed as optional ways to dig deeper into the overarching question. Researchers may copy and customize this guide to each participant by bolding applicable/priority questions in a separate document.

### Research Goals

- Validate assumptions regarding areas of improvement for the letter and test Veteran comprehension and reaction.
- Build on our current understanding of Veteran’s communication preferences. 
- Deepen our understanding of the experience of this cohort of Veterans and find out how they might respond to this outreach.

## Intro (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME] and \[NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I’m part of a team working on the disability claims filing experience.

To provide a little background, our team is thinking about piloting a program whereby we reach out to Veterans based on their VA medical records to invite them to file a claim for disability compensation. We’re holding a series of conversations (like this one today) to seek early feedback about this idea from Veterans. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you: I have some colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean may have mentioned this, but I wanted to confirm with you before we got started. Are you okay with my colleagues joining us for this session?

_\[If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.]_

_\[If yes: Admit observers, then allow a short pause for short introductions]_

For those of you who just joined, can you come off-camera briefly to introduce yourselves? Thanks!

_\[Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth]_

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. To ensure we're able to touch on all the topics we're hoping to cover, I may occasionally prompt you to keep the conversation on track.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not evaluating you. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, please let me know. You will be compensated for the session even if you need to stop.

One last thing. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We capture these recordings to ensure we're able to capture your opinions accurately. Recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of the comments from the recordings will be attached to your name.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

_\[Start recording]_

I have started recording. Just to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up & Filing Claims (5 min)

_Goal: Set expectations and learn more about Veteran’s familiarity with the claims filing process_

I’ll start by sharing a quick overview of what we’ll talk about today. First, I’ll ask you a few questions about your familiarity with the claims filing process at the VA. Next, we’ll talk about your experience with communications from the VA. Then we’ll go through an activity together where we’ll share a couple of sample letters with you to hear your feedback, questions, and reactions.

As a reminder, you don’t have to answer any questions that you would prefer not to, and we can end the session or take a break at any time. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

- Have you filed for a disability claim with the VA in the past?

  - If yes, could you walk me through that experience?

    - Probe: What made you decide to file a claim?
    - Probe: How did you go about filing a claim? (i.e. by mail, in person, via va.gov)?
    - Probe: What worked well or felt easy? What was confusing or frustrating?
    - Do you have a service-connected disability at VA?
    - If yes: what is your disability rating?

- Are you familiar with the PACT Act?

  - If yes, how would you describe the PACT Act in your own words?

    - Probe: Based on your understanding, does the PACT Act apply to you?

      - If yes, how?

    - Probe: Have you taken any action based on the PACT Act?

  - _\[If no, move on and let them know we’ll revisit this topic later]_


## Experience with VA Communications (10-15 min)

_Goal: Build on our current understanding of Veteran’s communication preferences and experiences_ 

Before we share some sample communications with you to hear your feedback and questions, we’d first like to hear a bit more about your experience with communications you’ve received from the VA.

- What kind of communications do you receive from the VA today?

  - Probe: What are the communications about?
  - Probe: What format (i.e. letter v. email v. text)?

- I’d like for you to think about outreach you’ve received from the VA that felt clear or helpful. Can you tell me about it?

  - Probe: What did you find to be clear or helpful about it?
  - Probe: What was the format?
  - Probe: What was the content? Was there a call to action, or was it purely informational?
  - Probe: What did you do in response to receiving the outreach?
  - Probe: What questions did you have?
  - Probe: How did the outreach impact your view or understanding of the VA?

- Now I’d like for you to think about outreach you’ve received from the VA that felt confusing, unhelpful, or frustrated you. Can you tell me about it?

  - Probe: What did you find to be confusing or frustrating about it?
  - Probe: What was the format?
  - Probe: What was the content? Was there a call to action, or was it purely informational?
  - Probe: What did you do in response to receiving the outreach?
  - Probe: What questions did you have?
  - Probe: How did the outreach impact your view or understanding of the VA?

- What do you expect from different forms of communication (i.e. letter v. email v. text)?

  - Probe: Do you receive all of these forms of communication? Others?

  - Probe: What kinds of information or asks would you expect from a letter? An email? A text?

  - Probe: Do you have a preference for receiving communications in one format over others?

    - If yes, why?

- Have you received PACT Act communications from the VA?

  - If yes, what were they about?
  - What was your impression of the communication(s)?
  - Probe: What action, if any, have you taken in response to PACT Act communications?

- Do you actively manage your communication preferences with the VA? For example, have you ever unsubscribed from a form of communication (such as text) or selected a preferred channel of communication?

  - If yes, what made you decide to do so? What have you done to manage your communications preferences?

- Think about the last time you reached out to the VA with a question or concern. Could you share how you went about getting in contact with the VA?

  - What questions or concerns were you hoping to express?

  - How did you determine a form of communication?

    - Probe: Is this typically how you get in touch with the VA?


## Activity: Reviewing Outreach Letters (20 min)

_Goal: Validate assumptions regarding areas of improvement for the letter and test Veteran comprehension and reaction._

As I mentioned earlier, we have a sample communication that we’d like to share with you to get your feedback. As a reminder, there are no right or wrong answers–we’re just interested in hearing your reactions and questions.

\[Note: We will show half of our participants the original outreach letter, while the other half will only see the modified outreach letter].

I’ll share a link in the chat. But first, I want to provide you with a scenario. Imagine that you’ve received this letter from the VA in the mail.  

I’ve shared the link in the chat. Are you able to click on the link and share your screen?

**Letter #1: Original Outreach**

First, I’ll give you a moment to review the letter. What’s your initial impression?

- Walk me through the letter.

  - Probe: In your own words, what is the letter about?

  - Probe: Is the information in this letter new to you, or are you familiar with some/all of it?

  - Probe: What questions or concerns do you have?

    - The letter makes references to your eligibility based on information from your personal records. What are your thoughts on the VA suggesting you may be eligible based on your personal records?"

  - \[For those that have filed a claim in the past] Based on what you’ve read in the letter, how would you anticipate this process to compare to past experiences filing a claim? 

- In this scenario, we asked you to imagine that you received this as a letter in the mail. That said, we’re interested in understanding how Veterans would prefer to receive information like this. How would you expect to receive this information (i.e. via mail, email, either)? Why?

- \[Prompt if needed] Are you familiar with the term “intent to file”? What does it mean to you?

  - From your perspective, how does that compare to filing a claim?

<!---->

- Now let’s imagine that you’ve finished reviewing the letter; what would you do next?

  - Probe: What information do you need before taking action?

<!---->

- Probe: What questions or concerns do you have?
- Probe: Who do you expect will be involved in this process other than yourself?
- Probe: What challenges, if any, do you anticipate will come up in this process?

<!---->

- Before we move on, do you have any questions or concerns that we haven’t discussed yet?

## Wrap-Up & Thank You (5-10 min)

Thanks again for sharing your opinions on the draft letter. As I mentioned at the beginning of the conversation, our team is exploring the possibility of piloting a program where we reach out to Veterans based on their medical records to invite them to file a claim for disability compensation. 

Related to this, we’re thinking about sending the letter that we shared with you to people who served during the Gulf War and have an active cancer diagnosis. You indicated during the screening process for this conversation that you have personal experience with a cancer diagnosis. If you feel comfortable sharing your perspective, we would like to know how receiving this letter might have felt to you when you were experiencing a diagnosis or treatment?

As a reminder, you don’t have to answer this question if you’d prefer not to.

- If you wanted to take action on the claim, what might you have done?

  - Probe: Would the ITF and wait to file appeal to you more? Or would you prefer to file a claim right away? Why?

  - Probe \[if not previously addressed]: Who do you expect would be involved in this process other than yourself? 

    - \[Clarify if needed] For example, family members or caregivers

<!---->

- Probe \[if not previously addressed]: What questions might you have had?
- Probe \[if not previously addressed]: How might this outreach impact your perception of the VA?
- Probe \[if not previously addressed]: How might you feel knowing that you received this outreach based on your medical records?

<!---->

- Do you have any advice for us, or any thoughts you’d like to share, about how we can approach reaching out to others experiencing cancer diagnosis and treatment?

<!---->

- As we wrap up our conversation today, is there anything else that you’d like to share with me today, either about the letter we showed you or about anything else?
- Do you have any questions for me?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve the experience of applying for disability benefits.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
