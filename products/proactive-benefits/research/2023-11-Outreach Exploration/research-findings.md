## Research Readout

[Recording is available on Sharepoint](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Proactive%20Benefits/Recorded%20Meetings/20231218_Proactive%20Benefits_User%20Study_Readout.mp4?csf=1\&web=1\&e=w9wMRv).


## Project Background

In August of 2022, Congress passed the PACT Act. Section 701b of the PACT Act required a benefits modernization plan from VA, and one idea noted in that plan was scanning VBA and VHA records to find Veterans that are likely eligible for benefits but are not receiving them, and proactively reaching out to Veterans to get them those benefits.

After conducting some preliminary secondary research to determine an initial cohort for this proactive offer, we chose to focus on Veterans with a VHA diagnosis of prostate or breast cancer and Gulf War service history, as we believe they are extremely likely to have disability compensation granted, and would benefit greatly from it: if a Veteran has an active cancer diagnosis for a service-connected cancer, they are automatically and temporarily bumped up to a 100% overall rating. ($3600/month). 

Our assumption is that Veterans with active cancers now presumptively related to their service may not be familiar with changes in the PACT Act, and therefore may be missing out on compensation. We aim to bridge this gap by identifying a cohort of Veterans who may benefit from a proactive claim solicitation because of their past service history and health status and design a workflow in which the Veteran receives a notification, is invited to submit a claim, and that claim is tracked through award.

This research focused on the first step of this process–our initial outreach to Veterans to inform them of their potential eligibility for additional disability compensation.


## Research Goals

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

Filing for benefits can happen throughout much of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). Our effort to connect Veterans with benefits proactively has the potential to provide support at a number of points throughout the Veteran journey, with a specific focus on the “Taking care of myself” stage of the journey. Within this stage, managing primary care and chronic health issues is a moment that matters. 

Other stages of the Veteran journey that our efforts could impact include: Getting out, Starting up, Putting down roots, Retiring, and Aging.

This study focused on three goals:

- Validate assumptions regarding areas of improvement for the outreach letter and test Veteran comprehension and reaction

- Build on our current understanding of Veteran’s communication preferences 

- Deepen our understanding of the experience of this cohort of Veterans and find out how they might respond to this outreach

Our desired outcomes from this research were to:

- Inform our outreach channel, content, and outreach strategy 

- Deepen our understanding of Veteran communication preferences and perceptions; this will not only inform our outreach strategy but also identify barriers and opportunities that we can address to help streamline the experience of being informed of benefits proactively to filing a claim.

- Provide recommendations and insights that will inform our project’s roadmap


## Research Questions

Research Goal #1: Validate assumptions regarding areas of improvement for the letter and test Veteran comprehension and reaction.

1. Validate our assumptions about the letter

   1. Is the length of the letter impacting the letter’s readability and Veteran comprehension?

   2. Is the call to action clear?

   3. Is the benefit to taking immediate action in response to the letter clear and compelling to our cohort of Veterans?

2. Understanding Veteran comprehension, motivation, and barriers to action

   1. Do Veterans understand the contents of the outreach letter?

   2. Is the call to action clear and compelling?

   3. What questions or concerns do Veterans have about the outreach?

   4. What logistical or psychological barriers are standing in the way of Veterans acting on this now?

Research Goal #2: Build on our current understanding of Veteran’s communication preferences. 

1. What do Veterans currently experience in regards to communications from the VA?

2. What are Veteran perceptions of different forms of communication (i.e letter v. email v. text?)

3. Do Veterans have expectations or varying mental models tied to specific communication formats? (Ex: are physical letters viewed as more trustworthy and official?)

4. Do Veterans feel empowered to manage the communication they receive?

Research Goal #3: Deepen our understanding of the experience of this cohort of Veterans and find out how they might respond to this outreach.

1. How might Veterans respond to this outreach, and how does this compare to our team’s expectations?

   1. Ex: Our assumption and goal is to guide Veterans to va.gov. Is this the most likely action in reality?

2. What is this cohort’s awareness level of the PACT Act? How might this impact Veteran’s response to or understanding of our outreach?

   1. Ex: For Veterans who are aware of the PACT Act and know they have a PACT Act presumptive condition, what is stopping them from filing a claim?

3. How can we build trust with Veterans in this interaction?

4. How might we approach our touchpoints with Veterans knowing that they are actively managing a diagnosis and/or care? How might their current experience impact how they receive, process, and respond to information about relevant benefits?

   1. Ex: Does receiving outreach during this time feel welcome or invasive?

   2. Ex: What role might caregivers play in this experience?

5. How do we better understand Veteran sensitivities in order to better connect them with benefits they may be entitled to without making them feel uncomfortable (i.e. do Veterans feel comfortable receiving this kind of targeted outreach based on their medical records?)


## Methodology and Conversation Stimuli

For this study, we facilitated semi-structured interviews with Veterans. 

We drafted two versions of an outreach letter to use as conversation stimuli during our interviews. The outreach letters detail a Veteran’s potential eligibility for VA disability compensation under the PACT Act.

The goal of asking Veterans to evaluate these letters was to validate assumptions regarding areas of improvement for the letter and test Veteran comprehension and reaction.

All 9 Veterans saw at least one version of our outreach letter, and just over half (n=5) evaluated both letters.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Hypothesis: Veterans are unfamiliar with changes in eligibility as a result of the PACT Act becoming law.

   1. Further research is needed. All of our participants had at least some familiarity with the PACT Act and had existing opinions about their own personal eligibility. However, further research is needed to determine how accurate those self-assessments of eligibility are. Regardless, understanding eligibility may not be enough to spur action.

2. Hypothesis: Veterans may be confused by or uncomfortable with targeted outreach based on access to their medical records. 

   1. False. None of our participants expressed personal concerns with this. In fact, at least a few of our participants expressed positive feelings about the VA utilizing their personal records to reach out to them about benefits they may be eligible for, and one explicitly expressed a desire for greater personalization in our outreach to make the content easier to interpret.

3. Hypothesis: The call to action in the outreach letter is clear and compelling.

   1. Likely False. While the majority of our participants had positive things to say about the letter broadly, there were many questions and misunderstandings about the process and a consistent desire for more clarity about next steps and expectations. There were also questions about what the VA was doing throughout the process and what their intentions are for sending this outreach.


## Summary of Key Findings

1. A strong case wasn’t made to either avoid or pursue a specific channel for outreach.

   - A letter was in line with most participants' expectations for this type of outreach, but none of them indicated mail as their preferred form of communication generally; in fact, mail was perceived to be slow and unreliable.

   - One participant noted that mail reminders about appointments sometimes arrive after the appointment has passed, and another mentioned that they only sometimes receive appointment reminders via mail. This relates to a recurring sentiment throughout the conversations that mail is slow and unreliable, not only when it comes to receiving mail but also sending it. A number of participants expressed concerns with filing a claim via mail when reviewing options for filing in our outreach.

   - It's worth noting that all of our participants were 55+, with the average age being 70. This may account for the heavier skew towards saying a letter was in line with their expectations for this outreach. Future research exploring the impact of age on communications could be useful, in addition to a comparison of the average age of our study participants to our cohort.

2. Participants who saw both letters expressed positive feelings about the shorter version.

   - When thinking about VA comms generally, participants said they appreciate comms that are concise, straightforward, and written on a level that anyone could understand.

   - For our participants that saw both letters (n=5), all but one expressed positive feelings about the shorter letter when comparing the two, with some being skeptical that someone who received this outreach in real life would read beyond the first page.

   - One participant thought that the detail in the original, longer letter might spur him to take action, mentioning that a lack of information can sometimes be a problem; our takeaway is that his perspective is not about a desire for a longer letter but for a letter with clear instructions on next steps.

3. Our conversations revealed confusion about the filing process and the options for action laid out in the letter.

   - There was an appreciation across participants for multiple options for filing, and a few participants expressed the importance of providing digital and non-digital options for filing, given that some Veterans don't have smartphones, reliable Wifi, or access to a computer.

   - Despite this appreciation for multiple filing options, there were a lot of questions about what exactly to do next after receiving this outreach and what to expect from the process. Several participants, for example, interpreted that the different filing options would yield different experiences, and it didn't seem clear what the benefit was of choosing one option over the other.

   - One of our participants, who volunteers with a VSO to help Veterans file claims, predicted that Veterans would be more likely to engage with the outreach if it focused on a single, recommended path (for example: what an ITF is and why it's important, followed by information to get in contact with a VSO to help them with the filing process once they've submitted an ITF).

4. Many of the questions and misunderstandings about the process centered around Intent to File (ITF). 

   - A few participants explicitly said that their first step would be to file an ITF, but it was otherwise unclear if many participants understood the difference between submitting an ITF and proceeding directly to file, with some thinking that ITF was a required part of the claims filing process. Even for Veterans that have filed an ITF in the past, there is still confusion about the purpose, how to do it, and what to expect.

   - There were many misunderstandings about the timeline of ITF specifically. Many saw it as a one-year deadline to filing a claim; some participants took this to mean that they had to rush to file before their claim was seen as invalid, while others said they would wait to file an ITF until they knew what to expect or had all of their documents in order so as to not run out the one-year clock prematurely. There was also common confusion about how to know what date your ITF is associated with and how the VA would notify you of that information. 

   - Lastly, a few participants erroneously inferred that the various options laid out for submitting an ITF or filing would lead to different experiences. For example, despite one participant saying she would ideally want to file online, she got the impression that she would have the benefit of extended time if she decided to file in person rather than online. 

5. The level of personalization intended to convey benefit of action in relation to PACT-Act eligibility wasn't apparent to Veterans.

   - It did not seem to be clear to any of our participants that this letter was intended to be personalized.

   - For example, many participants said if they were to take action on the letter, their first step would be determining their eligibility, even though the letter is meant to tell them that they are already very likely to be eligible.

   - A number of Veterans expressed concerns that this outreach was excluding many other groups of people that were PACT-eligible, which also tells us that it wasn't clear to everyone that this outreach was meant to target a subset of PACT-eligible Veterans.

6. Our outreach didn't stand out as unique to Veterans compared to other PACT Act communications they've been exposed to.

   - All participants had at least some awareness of the PACT Act, and have received information about it through a variety of channels, most commonly email. The common sentiment we heard was that the letter didn't provide much, if any, new information. 

   - As noted previously, the intended level of personalization of our outreach was not obvious to our participants; this is likely due in part to the volume of PACT Act communications that Veterans have been exposed to. One participant, for example, thought that he had already received this letter in the past. With this in mind, a challenge we will face is differentiating our outreach from more generic PACT Act communications.

   - Perceptions of the goals and value of the PACT Act varied among our participants; while some perceived it to be valuable for Veterans and well-intentioned, others believed it to mainly be focused on appeasing Congress, and were skeptical about the benefits of it for them personally. 

   - Specifically, one participant said that he still expected the burden of proof to rest on his shoulders in the process. Reflecting on his past experiences, he expects that taking action on the outreach would be challenging without the help of someone skilled, and insinuated that the VA isn't really providing a service in sending this outreach unless they're also offering support in the filing process itself.

7. Even if a Veteran's eligibility is clear, a lack of trust in the VA may be a barrier to engagement for some.

   - It's worth noting that clear eligibility may not always be enough to get participants to take action; one participant said she would not take action on the letter despite likely being eligible.

   - This hesitation is due to negative perceptions of the VA, past frustrating experiences with the VA, and a fear that her existing benefits would be negatively impacted by engaging with this outreach and the PACT Act generally. She said she would need reassurance in writing that her benefits wouldn't be taken away before considering taking action on outreach like this.

   - We also heard skepticism among some participants about the benefits of the PACT Act for Veterans personally, as well as a desire to better understand what the VA's intentions are in sending our outreach specifically.

8. VSOs were commonly mentioned, largely in a positive way, when recounting past filing experiences.

   - The next step that our participants expected to take after reading this outreach varied, but most mentioned planning to work with a VSO in some capacity.

   - Nearly all of the experiences mentioned with VSOs were positive, except for comments from two participants specifically about county VSOs.

   - One participant mentioned resisting working with someone on his claims for a long time because he didn't like the idea of paying someone to do something that he felt he could do himself; eventually, he decided to work with Claims Insiders, and implied that he would likely work with them again if he took action on this outreach. This highlights a false belief that some Veterans think they need to pay someone in order to get help with their claims. 

   - One participant, who volunteers with Veterans to assist them in filing their claims, noted that by recommending working with a VSO, the VA could build trust with Veterans by showing that they care and that there is a recommended service to assist them in filing claims.

9. None of our participants expressed concerns about targeted outreach based on personal medical records.

   - When asked about receiving outreach like this based on personal medical records, none of our participants expressed personal privacy concerns about this; in fact, several participants expressed positive sentiments about the idea of the VA looking closely and making personal suggestions. 

   - More participants instead expressed concerns that VA medical/service records are often incomplete, and therefore outreach based on personal records may not reach the intended audience. 

   - Anecdotally, a couple of participants noted that other Veterans may have concerns with the VA looking at their medical records or are afraid to engage in the filing process for fear of their personal information being shared with employers, insurance providers, etc. 

   - Our conversations also revealed that failure to communicate the personalized nature of the outreach to our cohort could have backfiring effects. Not realizing that the eligibility conditions in the outreach were not meant to be comprehensive of all PACT-Act eligible conditions, several participants were confused as to why our eligibility conditions were so limited, and one participant even expressed frustration about it.

## Recommendations

1. Use, but continue to modify, shorter version of outreach

2. Modify outreach content to address likely barriers to engagement

   1. Recommendations _that have been incorporated_ into an updated version of the outreach letter:

      1. amplify the benefit of potential compensation

      2. focus on benefit of getting started immediately (rather than try to explain ITF)

      3. recommend a single path to action

      4. highlight the option of working with VSO and provide guidance on finding one

      5. remove or deemphasize mail as filing option
         
      6. further personalize outreach language

   2. Recommendations _to be incorporated_ into an updated version of the outreach letter:

      1. provide reassurance about existing benefits 

      2. clarify how medical providers are and aren't involved in this process

      3. provide insight into our work to build trust

      4. acknowledge different experiences

      5. how might we communicate that this experience will be better, easier, or more successful than past filing experiences?

3. Consider two channels of outreach

4. A/B test the outreach as part of launching strategy
