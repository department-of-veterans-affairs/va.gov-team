# Product Outline 


## Overview
Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) services are vital for Veterans with service-connected disabilities who are seeking employment and independent living. The RES-powered VR&E portal integrated within VA.gov directly addresses key usability and accessibility issues, transforming VA.gov into a personalized gateway for Veterans to determine eligibility, apply for benefits, and track their progress throughout the program lifecycle. This will provide a self-service case management hub that will allow Veterans to manage the full lifecycle of their VR&E journey. The Veteran will have capabilities from eligibility determination to comprehensive case management, including a Case Progress tracker, orientation tools, scheduling, VBMS document viewing functionality, and a career planning page. 

## Problem Statement
As a Veteran, I want to have full visibility and be able to manage the full lifecycle of my application and case as part of my VR&E journey. As a Backend Developer I want to ensure each page operates error-free and renders correctly, and pulls data users expect to see. As a Frontend Developer I want to see the pages to chose from so users can access the information they need and perform actions as needed. As a UX Designer I want to confirm that users are able to navigate the self-management portal with little-to-no errors so that they can access the information they need and perform actions as needed. By creating a new page the Reapers team can ensure users have easy access to information and comply with CAIA guidelines.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this?* The self-management portal will allow the Veteran to manage the full lifecycle of their VR&E journey. The Veteran will have access to orientation tools, scheduling, VBMS uploads, and a career planning module.
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?* The Veteran will be able to view real-time updates and status information on their VR&E cases. Tools and resources will also be available to help Veterans understand and navigate the VR&E program, including guides, tutorials, and informational content.

## Undesired User Outcomes
Veterans are unaware of the status of their application/case. Users are unaware of next steps. Unexpected errors or outages.

## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?* Allows direct communication with the Veteran and provides information to the Veteran with the next steps. This will ultimately create a seamless experience for the Veteran when the Counselor has the information that they need to process a case.
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?* The self-management portal will allow the Veteran to monitor and manage their VR&E journey. The Veteran will be able to take the appropiate steps to make sure they have provided all necessary information/documentation for their case to be processed.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
Reapers team does not meet contract timeline. All work must be completed and in production by March 12, 2026.

## Measuring Success
Transform and build on the existing eligibility page on VA.gov into a more interactive and personalized experience for Veterans. Integrate secure RES data Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to enable real-time interactions with VA.gov. Enhance user experience (UX) components, including case progress tracker, orientation tools and resources, scheduling assistance, career planning module, and other usability improvements to facilitate smoother navigation and better interaction. Develop and implement a user-friendly portal User Interface (UI) that integrates seamlessly with the existing VA.gov infrastructure. Utilize the Single Sign On (SSO) capabilities to streamline the login process and enhance security for users accessing the VR&E portal.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
Users navigate to the self-management portal and track and interact with their VR&E case journey.


## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?* Build a case progress tracker. Allow the user to view/schedule their orientation through the self-management portal. Give the Veteran the ability to assess their skills/hobbies to assist with a career plan/benefits.
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?* This approach is best because it gives the Veteran the ability to monitor their case status and proceed with next steps without major delays.
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
- *Does your solution include the VA Health and Benefits mobile application? Explain why or why not.* 


## Launch Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?* Banners throughout the pages Work with VA communications teams
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?* Will create an updated user guide
