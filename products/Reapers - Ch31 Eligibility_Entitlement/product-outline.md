## Overview

Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) services are vital for Veterans with service-connected disabilities who are seeking employment and independent living. However, VA.govâ€™s current navigation to VR&E information and the application process is fragmented, confusing, and outdated. Creating new pages will directly addresses key usability and accessibility issues, transforming VA.gov into a personalized gateway for Veterans to determine eligibility, apply for benefits, and track their progress throughout the program lifecycle.

## Problem Statement

As a Veteran I want to quickly and easily access all eligibility and benefit data for CH31. 
As a Backend Developer I want to ensure each page operates is error-free and renders correctly, and pulls data users expect to see.
As a Frontend Developer I want to see the pages to chose from so users can access the information they need.
As a UX Designer I want to confirm that users are able to navigate the CH31 pages with little-to-no errors so that they can access the information they need.
By creating a new page the Reapers team can ensure users have easy access to information and comply with CAIA guidelines.

## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
The new pages will simplify access to VR&E information, helping Veterans quickly understand what the program is, check eligibility and apply within limited clicks. 

- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
Users will be able to check eligibility without reading materials, and now see their benefits for Ch31, in a single page that is easy to read and 508 compliant. 

## Undesired User Outcomes

Veterans are confused on what happened to the existing Ch31 pages 
Users are unable to navigate the page or discern the difference between each page
Veterans are presented with inaccurate benefits information
Unexpected errors or outages

## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
Reduces the amount of users submitting forms that are not eligible for the Ch31 benefit.
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
Nothing the business can do that they couldn't before, but this page will make it easier for users to navigate, check eligibility, apply for benefits, and see their benefits. 

## Undesired Business Outcomes
Reapers team does not meet contract timeline. All work must be completed and in production by November 11, 2025.
