# Product Outline: 21-686c (Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents) and 21-674 (Request for Approval of School Attendance)

---

## Overview
The online 686c form allows Veterans to add or remove dependents from their VA benefits. The online form flow is integrated with the 21-674 form (Request for Approval of School Attendance), which is used when claiming benefits for a Veteran's child who is at least 18 years old, but under 23, and attending school.

## Problem Statement
Dependent information is used accross many forms and experiences on VA.gov (pension, disability, VA profile, etc.), and there is no unified user experience when interacting with dependency information.

How might we provide a unified experience for Veterans when they need to view, add, remove, or update their dependent inforation across VA.gov?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- The 686 and 674 online form flow submits information that can be successfully processed by downstream systems
- Claims that fail to submit are successfully processed through a backup submission flow
- Veterans have a positive experience when completing the 686/674 online forms
- Veterans do not encounter accessibility issues with completing the online 686/674 form
- Veterans have a cohesive experience on VA.gov when updating and viewing dependent information

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Online claims experience processing delays
- Veterans find the form experience confusing, frustrating, or too cumbersome
- Online claims are lost

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Online form submissions can be successfuly processed through RBPS

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- 686 and 674 online form submissions generate claim errors that prevent automated processing
