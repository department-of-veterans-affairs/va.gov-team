## Goals
### Product and team
Working with USDS team lead Steve Kovacs, this research explores how we might improve the ease with which Veterans maintain an accurate list of their dependents with the VA. The business goal is to develop approaches or product improvements that will reduce the amount of Veteran debt owed to the VA around overpayments based on a change in dependency status, brought about by life events such as divorce, aging, or death. 

The research lead for this project will be Kevin M. Hoffman. The design lead for this project will be Martha Wilkes. 

### Background
A Veteran receives benefits commensurate with the number of their dependents. This could include spouses, children, grandchildren, and caregivers. As the number of dependents a Veteran has decreases due to aging or a life change, that Veteran should report that decrease to Veteran’s Affairs so that adjustments are made to the benefits that they receive. If those adjustments are not made, the Veteran is overpaid and is in debt to VA. 

There are two forms related to the process of updating a Veteran’s dependents. One is the  Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents ([About VA Form 21-686c | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-686c/))  and the other the Status of Dependents Questionnaire (and associated automated mailing process), (https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-0538/). An automated letter and form (0538) is sent to Veterans via mail once every 8 years to encourage them to fill out verification of dependents form (0538) which they do on paper. If the Veteran has to add or remove dependents, they will likely need to fill out the 686-c as well as other forms (in some cases related to dependents over the age of 18 who are attending college). 

There are three Veteran user types we are considering as we conduct this research. The first is a Veteran who uses online self-service on VA.gov with some regularity. The second is a Veteran who has the credentials to use VA.gov, but doesn’t for some reason. The third is a Veteran who doesn’t use online self service and my not be able to due to access issues. 

### Research Questions
Do Veterans remember to manage dependent benefits with the VA? If so, how do they go about keeping their dependent information up-to-date? If not, why not? 

What are ways in which Veterans do regular business with the VA where we might remind them to update their information around dependents? 

How would Veterans like to be reminded to make a change? 

If reminding Veterans as pat of logging in on VA.gov, would it be a better strategy to make it required or optional? 

If reminding Veterans as pat of logging in on VA.gov, would it be a better strategy to include or not include current dependents? 

Are there unique aspects to Veterans that have been overpaid that would help us identify the best ways to update VA with accurate information on dependents?

Are Veterans that use VA.gov regularly or semi-regularly a significant part of the population of Veterans that are being overpaid? 

Conversely, are Veterans that do not use VA.gov (either that can use but choose not to, or cannot for some reason)  a significant part of the population of Veterans that are being overpaid?


### Hypothesis
Veterans who regularly or semi-regularly use VA.gov for online self-service to do business with Veterans Affairs can be intercepted in smarter and more effective ways to encourage them to keep information about their dependents up-to-date. 

By smarter, we mean processes that target factors unique to the individual that might make them more likely to have a change in dependents that merits reporting to the VA. By more effective, we mean more likely to create the behavior of making updates with VA as dependencies change. 

## Method
We will be using remote moderated ethnographic interviews via Zoom combined with open observation of usage of VA.gov to define the Veteran customer journey as it relates to making an update to dependency status. This method will allow us to consider and observe VA.gov usage if it relates to the Veteran’s natural behavior, but not assume that they are likely to use it. 

## Participants and Recruitment
We would like to talk to no less than 6 and no more 15 Veterans. 

**1** **Primary criteria / Must have** 

* The Veteran must use their VA benefits.
* The Veteran must have dependents. 
* The Veteran must use their Veteran benefits for their dependents. 
* The Veteran must have access to a computer and be able to do a Zoom call, as well as share their screen. 

**2** **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** 
* The Veteran may have had a change in the status of their dependents as the result of age, marital status, or other life change. 

## When?
### Timeline
Research with Veterans will take place between Tuesday, December 1st and Friday, December 4

### Prepare
If anything, we will using VA.gov as it currently exists. No prototypes or new designs will be tested with Veterans. 

### Length of Sessions
Each session should be 40 minutes maximum. We will block a full hour for each session so that we have time for debrief and synthesis after we complete each session.
