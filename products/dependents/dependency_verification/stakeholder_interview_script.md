* Do you believe that Veterans remember to manage dependent benefits with the VA? Why or why not?
What ways do Veterans do business with VA that may be good opportunities to remind them to update their dependents’ information?
* Do you think there are unique aspects to Veterans that have been overpaid due to inaccurate information about dependents that would help us identify them?
