# Veteran Interview Conversation Guide

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [researcher name] and I also have a few colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how Veterans notifies Veterans Affairs about changes in their family, particularly changes in their dependents that affect the benefits they recieve. For example, things like getting married, having a baby, or adopting a child. Would it be okay if I ask you some questions about those topics, so that Veterans Affairs can make it as simple as possible to keep that information up to date? 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take no more than 40 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve this process to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not lose your stipend or be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, and then delete the recording once we're done. 

(Get confirmation, once recording)

My screen is now being recorded.

## (Introduction)
Tell me briefly about your service. 

Do you currently use VA benefits? 

Do you have financial dependents in your family? You don't have to provide any details if you don't want to. 

How would you learn about how those financial dependents affect the total benefits you, or they, recieve? 

## (Part 1: Questions to inform flow and intercept design)
When was the last time you visited VA.gov?

What did you go to VA.gov to do? 

Did you need to log in? 

When logging in, how would you feel about being asked to verify information about your dependents? 

What are other ways that you might do business with VA that may be good opportunity to remind you to update their dependents’ information if there has been a change?

## (Part 2: Questions related to benefits and dependents) 
What information would you need to see to verify that VA has accurate information about your dependents? For example, what would you like to see on a list as it relates to your dependents to confirm this information?

(Co-design example together with shared screen)

The number and kind of dependents you have figure into the calculation of certain VA benefits. 

When making a change to the status of or information about your dependents, what questions would you like answered? 

What’s the best way for you to learn how those dependents would affect those benefits? For example, once your children turned 18, how or where would you expect to learn about the effect on your benefits? 

We know that sometimes a benefit status change might happen as the result of a sensitive issue. If that status of your dependents changed to to a life change that might be personal and upsetting, how would you like VA to ask you about that? 

## (Part 3: Questions about overpayment)
If you are overpaid for a benefit because the VA doesn’t have accurate information about your dependents, you can end up owing the VA money. We want to avoid that any way possible. 

If your benefits had been overpaid as a result of a change in the status of your dependents, how would you like to find about that?

## (Part 4: Closing questions)
Is there anything else that we didn’t discuss regarding the relationship between your dependents and your benefits that you think we should be aware of? 

Do you have any questions for me about this work?
