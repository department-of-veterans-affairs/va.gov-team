# Project overview: Improve depedent management content on VA.gov

## Problem Statement

  
Veterans currently struggle to understand their responsibilities for managing dependents on their VA benefits. Existing content on VA.gov lacks clarity around critical dependent management requirements, leading to:

*  Confusion about the process to add dependents along with initial application to benefit program
*   Confusion about what changes need to be reported to the VA
    
*   Unclear timelines for reporting dependent status changes
    
*   Limited understanding of consequences for non-compliance
    
*   Potential benefit overpayments and processing delays for Veterans
  
    
  
## Project Goals

*   Improve Veteran understanding of dependent management responsibilities through clear, actionable content
    
*   Reduce administrative burden on both Veterans and VA staff by providing comprehensive self-service information
    
*   Decrease processing errors caused by unreported or incorrectly reported dependent changes
    
*   Enhance compliance with VA dependent reporting requirements
    

## Target Audience

* Primary: Veterans currently receiving benefits with dependents or considering adding dependents
    
*   Secondary: Veteran family members who may assist with benefit management
    
*   Tertiary: Veteran service representatives and VA staff who support Veterans
    

## Project Scope

  
### In Scope:

*   Update existing unauthenticated content pages related to dependent management (estimate less than 5 pages)
    
*   Create new pages addressing identified content gaps (estimate 3-4 pages)
    
*   Focus on publicly accessible content pages (not authenticated tools or forms)
    
*   Content covering: reporting requirements, timelines, consequences, and processes
  

### Out of Scope:

*   Changes to dependent management tools or applications
    
*   Updates to forms or interactive functionality
    
*   Comprehensive site-wide content strategy overhaul
    
*   New user research or extensive usability testing
      

## Desired Outcomes
  
Veterans can easily locate and access comprehensive, clear information about their dependent management responsibilities on publicly accessible content pages throughout VA.gov. Veterans understand why they need to report changes to their dependents' status to the VA, what specific changes require reporting, when these changes must be reported, and the potential consequences of failing to report changes timely. This improved content helps Veterans fulfill their dependent management obligations proactively, reducing benefit payment errors, overpayments, and administrative burdens for both Veterans and the VA.

## Key Stakeholders

## Lean roadmap

### Now

### Next
**Clearly communicate information about impact and consequences**

Add information about importance of dependent management, how it impacts benefits, and the consequences of neglecting to manage dependents

### Later
Implement a holistic content strategy for change reporting and overpayment prevention:
