## Initial Findings
These findings are an analysis of the answers participants gave to pre-study, prototype, and post-study questions. The pre-study and post-study findings group answers from participants who viewed Designs A and B together. The prototype question analysis is broken down into the two designs.


### Pre-study questions

#### How often do you view the dependents on your benefits on VA.gov? 
- 18 of the 19 participants had viewed their dependents on VA.gov
- 3	viewed their dependents when a situation calls for it
     - "Only at time of set up to make sure they are there."
     - "Recently I divorced and was checking weekly until that status was reflected in my account as well."
     - "Only when my rating went over 30%."
     - they participants mentioned situations and timelines
- 3	viewed their dependents monthly

- 18 of the 19 participants had viewed their dependents on VA.gov
- 3	viewed their dependents in the previous week
- 6	viewed their dependents in the previous month
- 5	viewed their dependents in the previous year
- 3	viewed their dependents more than a year ago

- 14	said to check or verify the information
- 4 mention benefits and benefits other than disability compensation
- 1 said the DV letter


### Prototype questions

#### Your VA dependents page: After looking at this page what would you do next, if anything?

##### Design A
- Responses focused on making necessary changes
- Responses also focused on making sure information was accurate
- Verification was not mentioned specifically
     - One person did write: "I would verify the information as correct."

##### Design B
- Responses focused on making necessary changes
- Verification was not mentioned specifically

#### Your VA dependents page: When or how often would you expect to see the alert at the top of the page?

##### Design A
- About half of participants said they didn't see, remember, or read the alert
- The next most common response was when they needed to be notified of something

##### Design B
- Responses varied and included once a year, everytime they went to the page, and whenever they needed to be notified of something

#### Your VA dependents page: Is there any additional information you would like to see about your dependents to help you take the next step? If so, what?

##### Design A
- Most participants said no

##### Design B
- Most participants said no

#### Review your personal information page: Would you like to review this information?

##### Design A
- Responses were split between yes and no

##### Design B
- Responses were split but leaned towards yes

#### Review your personal information page: If you needed to make a change to this information what would you do?

##### Design A
- Responses were split between contacting VA and using the current form flow

#### Design B
- Responses varied but generally involved reaching out to VA

#### Confirm the contact information we have on file for you page: Would you like to review this information?

##### Design A
- Responses were primarily Yes

##### Design B
- Responses were split but leaned towards No

#### Confirm the contact information we have on file for you page: If you made a change to this information would you expect it to update across VA.gov?

##### Design A
- Everyone said yes, one person mentioned that the content said that this would not happen

##### Design B
- Everyone said they would like this, one person mentioned reading that the changes must be made in your profile.

#### Confirm the contact information we have on file for you page: If you left and came back to VA.gov, where would you expect to find information about about the additional forms to complete to finish updating your dependents?

##### Design A
- Responses were primarily either with the dependents information or as a notification on VA.gov

##### Design B
- Responses were primarily either in their profile or with the dependents information

### Post-study questions

#### Did this prototype change your understanding of dependent verification? If so, how?
- 6	said Yes
     - "yes, it was helpful"
     - "Yes, the whole process is clear and logical and without the usual VA jargon and endless VA forms to wade through."
     - "Yes but it needs some work based on my recording feedback. for simple cases like a child is mine for 18 years I dont want to go through this every year..or not be required to go thru it every year."
     - "Yes. it provided step by step instructions for how to verify, how to update information, and how to add or remove dependents due any life changes, (divorce, marriage, or age)."
     - "Yes, I previously had not paid attention to the ID number of an  incomplete application. I was also unaware of the verbiage "became a caregiver of a parent" to which I would anticipate this action to apply to becoming a caregiver of any adult."
     - "Yes. Helped guide me through the process. It also streamlines the process."
- 11 said No, primarily because they were already familiar with the information or process
- 2	responses are unclear

#### How would you explain the reason for verifying dependents to another Veteran?
- some participants gave more than one reason
- 6 mentioned correct payments (not overpayment)	
- 4 mentioned accuracy and/or correctness (not focused on payment)	
- 3 mentioned correct benefits	
- 3 mentioned avoiding overpayment	
- 2 mentioned preventing fraud	
- 1 mentioned being covered by health insurance	
- 1 mentioned tracking eligible dependents	
- 5 mentioned other reasons
     - "Go step by step off the VA website benefits section."
     - "by going to VA.gov"
     - "If possible, try to explain with the ability to go on VA.GOV to visibly see on the website. Tell them to go on VA.GOV and look under dependent information."
     - "I would say one must verify dependents with the VA after any major life event/family change as with other institutions, e.g. insurance companies, schools, doctors, housing authorities."
     - "To make sure you and your dependents are enabled to entitlements"
 
 #### Where on VA.gov would you expect to view your dependents?
 - some participants mentioned more than place
 - 9 mentioned the Profile page
 - 4 mentioned myVA
 - 3 mentioned other reasons
   - "I look up my personal (account) information page. I think that there is information, or a link to information, concerning dependent benefits."
   - "Under account menus"
   - "under my personal coverage there should be a tab for dependents and their enrollment."
- 2 mentioned the Main/Home Page
- 2 mentioned the Benefits section
- 1 mentioned the Claim Status Tool
- 1 mentioned the Dependents section

#### Would there ever be a case or cases where you would prefer dealing with an overpayment instead of updating your dependents right away? If so, when?
- 16 said No
- 2 could imagine a case
     - "I would probably make certain my child is indeed receiving Chapter 35 deposits before taking the action to remove them. because if something happens where the Chapter 35 payment doesnt occur or COE for chapter 35 doesnt go thru for some reason, its a far greater pain to try to get the school child added back. bottomline : Education needs to immediately match with VBA discontinuing VBA comp upon payment of Chapter 35."
     - "If a dependent child or adult perished or became a missing persons for an indeterminate period of time, I would anticipate a delay in processing dependent updates while awaiting an autopsy or investigative report."
- 1 gave no response

#### Is there anything about the dependent verification process that you just experienced that you think should be changed? If so, what?
- some participants mentioned more than one thing
- 9 said No
- 9 had suggestions for the dependents management team
     - "I believe anything that allows you to update in real time would make the system better."
     - "It seemed easy enough, I'd like to make sure I know how long they are covered and when it expires. I want to know what they're covered for, medical, dental, vision and if not covered, a link or phone number for who to contact for that coverage."
     - "Not having to fill out form"
     - "It should not take you to a separate page or separate form to change dependents info- that should be something that can be changed right on that page."
     - "just keep "edit" buttons available and then able to save changes"
     - "Yes, don't leave the VA.gov site to go to another site and then return to the VA.gov site."
     - "reminders would be handy"
     - "yeah I said it all in the recordings."
     - "It should provide you the status of your dependent claim, rather than having to look into the claim further."
  - 1 had a suggestion for the wider VA.gov experience
 
#### Is there anything about the dependent verification process that you just experienced that you thought was positive? If so, what?
- 7 described the process as simple, easy, or something similar
- 5 mentioned the information provided
- 2 mentioned that it helps avoid overpayment
- 2 mentioned the convenience of doing it online
- 1 mentioned the lay out
- 1 said nothing positive
- 1 responded N/A
 
#### Is there anything else that you would like to share?
- 11 said No																						
- 5 gave responses related to Dependents Management
     - "I would like notice if someone were to apply to add me or one of my dependents as a dependent via data match. This unique circumstance was a potential disaster when a non-biological parent attempted to add my dependent to their benefits without my consent or forenotice. Fortunately they were unsuccessful though I'm uncertain the details of how/why the change request failed."
     - "The transition from MyHealthyVet to the VA.gov site has not been smooth from my perspective. Why offer three different ways to sign into VA.gov and why transfer someone wanting to access what used to be MyHealthyVet from the VA.gov site to a completely different site?"
     - "You are doing a great job, Keep it up."
     - "there are countless depednt scenarios and there always needs to be an environment of "if youre not sure if you should remove X or what to do about stephild Y please call 1-800-827-100 or askva link. or a cool AI tool that could answer."
     - "It might be helpful if during your birth month you got reminders when you logged in for anything (travel, appt list, meds) and the reminder would not go away until you verified your dependents. that would also help keep overpayments to a minimal"
- 3 gave responses related to the study
     - "thanks for the invitation to the study"
     - "This survey was so hard to do the page doesn't advance to go to the next questions. I have to use the arrows."
     - "I hope I did it correctly, I was not sure on the first question on 2 scenarios."
