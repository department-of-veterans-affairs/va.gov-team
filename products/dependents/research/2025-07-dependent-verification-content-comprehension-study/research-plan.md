	# Research Plan for Dependent Management Team, Dependent Verification update, July 2025

## Background 🏗️
<summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Currently, the VA overpays $250 million in dependent benefits each year. If a Veteran is overpaid a benefit, they are required to re-pay the overpayment back to the VA. One of the most common causes of overpayment is out-of-date dependents information. Updating dependency information outside the 8-year requirement is voluntary, and the burden of remembering to make dependency updates falls on the Veteran. Verifying dependents through a paper form is also burdensome for many Veterans. These problems result in a very low-quality feedback loop for maintaining an accurate list of what dependents are intended to be on the award. Our goal is to decrease the over- and under-payment amount for dependent-related benefits by allowing Veterans to quickly and easily verify their dependents on VA.gov.**
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**The Dependent Verification flow that we are testing begins on the "Your VA dependents" page; this page can only be accessed when the Veteran has signed into VA.gov.**
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**This flow is an update to existing functionality. Updates include:**
- **Enhancements to the view dependents page that will allow Veterans to see additional info for each dependent**
- **Adding a question to the view dependents page that asks Veterans if their dependent information has changed. VA.gov will automatically generate a 21-0538 form, ask the Veteran to review the info, sign a statement of truth, and then submit the 21-0538 form. If necessary, they will also be directed to fill out the add/remove dependents form on VA.gov (21-686c/674)**

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

<summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support?</summary>

**This update will include improvements to the UI and backend functionality.**

`Objective 1:  VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

`Objective 2: OCTO’s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.`

> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total error rates in our platforms by 50% compared to Q4 2024, towards a goal less than 1% per endpoint.

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

<summary>Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter?</summary>
	
**Veterans could verify their dependents at many points in their journey but it is especially relevant to the `Putting Down Roots`stage. Dependents Verification involves a Veteran's family and their VA benefits and this stage contains the "Starting, growing, or maintaining my family" and the "Engaging VA to access benefits and services" moments that matter.**


## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **What type of content on the "Your VA dependents" page, especially in the alert box, is most effective in helping Veterans understand and complete the dependents verification process?**

`2.` **How is it most natural for Veterans to respond after reviewing the current state of the dependents on their benefits?**
- **By indicating Yes they need to make changes or No they do not need to make changes**
- **OR by indicating Yes the current information is correct or No the current information is not correct**

`3.` **Do Veterans understand that if they need to make changes to the dependents on their VA benefits they will need to fill out an additional form after completing this flow?** 
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**The findings will be used to update the content in the dependents verification flow to help Veterans understand and complete the process. Verifying dependents decreases the amount of over- and under-payments for dependent-related benefits** 

---

### Research questions

***Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:***
	
`What will I do with what I learn from this question? Does this question serve the goals of my study?`

**Goal 1: What type of content on the "Your VA dependents" page, especially in the alert box, is most effective in helping Veterans understand and complete the dependents verification process?**
**(Some participants will be shown Design A and other participants will be shown Design B and their responses will be compared)**  

**`1.`After looking at this page what would you do next, if anything?**

**`2.`Is there any additional information you would like to see about your dependents to help you take the next step? If so, what?**

**Goal 2: What type of content on the "Your VA dependents" page, especially in the alert box, is most effective in helping Veterans understand and complete the dependents verification process?**
**(Some participants will be shown Design A and other participants will be shown Design B and their responses will be compared)**  

**`1.`If you see that a change needs to be made when reviewing your dependents, what would you do?**  

**Goal 3: Do Veterans understand that if they need to make changes to the dependents on their VA benefits they will need to fill out an additional form after completing this flow?** 
**(Some participants will be shown Design A and other participants will be shown Design B and their responses will be compared)**  

**`4.`[Enter Q4]**

**`5.`[Enter Q5]**


### Hypotheses

---

**Content that emphasizes the risk of debt will make Veteran participants more likely to complete the process.**

**Veterans are most likely to abandon the task in the transition between the dependent verification flow and the additional forms.** 

---
  
## Methodology  🛠️
***Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.*** 

**The research method we will be using is recorded, unmoderated usability testing with additional survey questions. Half of the surveys will include a prototype of Design A and half will include a prototype of Design B. We chose this method because the questions that we have can be answered by observing participants' interactions with the prototypes in recordings.**

### Location
Where will you be holding the research sessions? Be sure to include whether this is remote or in-person research. [Learn more about setting up in-person research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/planning-in-person-research.md)
