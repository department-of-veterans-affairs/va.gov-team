# VA Dependent Verification Study Reveals Key Insights

### tl;dr

Veteran experiences with dependent verification processes highlight opportunities for clarity and improvement.

### What We Did

The research team conducted concept testing to explore the understanding and usability of the Dependent Verification MVP on VA.gov.

### Key Insights

- Mental Model Misalignment

  - Most participants did not have a clear understanding of the dependent verification process as it relates to the Mandatory Verification of Dependents form.

  - "Just verifying that he's my legal husband to be on my benefits." (P2)

- Findability Challenges

  - Participants struggled to locate dependent management tools, suggesting a need for improved navigation and information architecture on VA.gov.

  - "Probably a birth certificate or something like that." (P3)

- Confusion Over Dependent Status

  - The distinction between dependents on and not on VA benefits caused significant confusion, indicating a need for clearer information presentation.

  - "There's no way to know why this dependent is not on your benefits." (P6)

- Missteps in Updating Personal Information

  - Participants incorrectly chose options when attempting to update personal information for dependents, revealing a need for more intuitive design.

  - "Update and edit is pretty much the same thing." (P3)

- Contact Information Update Expectations

  - Veterans expected changes to contact information in the form to also update their VA profile, suggesting a gap between user expectations and system functionality.

  - "Why do I have two different addresses?" (P6)

### Between the Lines

The study suggests that while Veterans are engaged with the dependent verification process, there is a disconnect between their expectations and the actual procedures, which can lead to frustration and potential disengagement.

### Yes, But

Although the study identified several areas for improvement, it also showed that when the process is clear, Veterans are able to confidently navigate the verification system.

### Why It Matters

Improving the dependent verification process aligns with the VA's broader goals of enhancing the Veteran experience and ensuring that benefits are managed efficiently and accurately. This research supports the OCTO's key results by identifying actionable insights to refine online tools and communications.

### Whatâ€™s Next

The next steps include implementing the recommendations to provide clearer context, improve findability, enrich dependent information, streamline personal information updates, and coordinate verification notifications to enhance the overall user experience.
