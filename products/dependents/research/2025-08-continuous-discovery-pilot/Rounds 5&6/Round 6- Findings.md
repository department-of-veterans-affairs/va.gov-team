## Participants
We spoke with 4 Veterans. However, we were concerned that one of the participants was not actually a Veteran or had not used the dependent benefits like they had claimed to, so we are not including their responses.
  
**Veteran 1**  
- 2 college-age child dependents
     - 1 may still be on the benefit
          - Was automatically removed when they turned 18, Veteran told VA the dependent was a full-time student   so they could be re-added, Veteran said they got back pay (is this standard?), they are currently using Chapter 35 education benefits
     - 1 not on the benefit recently because of the education benefit they are using- Chapter 33
          - Veteran talked about re-adding this dependent now that they had used all of their education benefit. The dependent was 23, Veteran seemed to be confusing the age limits of Chapter 33 with disability compensation
Dependent was automatically removed from the disability compensation benefit after they started using education benefit, before this happened they had accrued an overpayment
- Checked claims and dependents information on VA.gov when things were changing (not clear where he was looking at dependents info) but now they’re more stable so he hasn’t looked in a long time
- Prefers to fill out forms digitally
- Prefers digital letters to paper ones

**Veteran 2**
- Dependents- Spouse and child
- They were added to the benefit in 2008/09
- Veteran has seen dependent information on VA.gov, found it while looking at compensation information, wants to have access to that information and it was helpful when their child dropped off automatically at 18
- Veteran heard about the age limit during the process of getting benefits, they don’t remember VA reaching out around the time their dependent child turned 18, they figured out what was going on after compensation dropped
Dependent isn’t using any other education benefits
- Veteran hasn’t thought about how long the benefit will continue, assumes it is until dependent graduates
Veteran wants VA to remove dependent automatically on the graduation date they provide to VA in the paperwork, with letting 90 days advance notice

**Veteran 3**
- Dependents- Spouse, child was formerly a dependent (now aged out)
- Dependent child was using Montgomery GI Bill- Chap 30, also got Chap 35 at some point
- This Veteran’s situation was unusually complicated, shared that it is hard to find information on the website for edge cases, or appeals
     - When asked which website they used to look for information: “VA.gov, My HealthyVet, which I kind of frequent, you know, from time to time. The comp . . . the compensation website section, the education section.I've read chapters 31, 33, and 35 on education. . . . I've not been able to find - I don't know what would have been most helpful, maybe . . . special situations, or . . . to talk to someone, essentially. Because I didn't intuitively find a website link that would tell me. . . . I can't be the only person, you know, that has sought out this type of information.”
- Veteran got a letter that his dependent had aged out, but it didn’t offer any alternatives or options
- Prefers to communicate by letter because “they’re hard to ignore”, said that letters are best for making a case, they understand that for VA you sometimes have to submit a digital form
- VSO helped Veteran submit some of his original claims, however they believe that they submitted the disability compensation forms on their own online, said it was relatively easy. Veteran was on active duty when submitting initial claims.



## School Form Experience
  
**Veteran 1**
- “I don't remember it being complicated. I don't know… nothing really stands out, I guess.”
  
**Veteran 2**
- "It wasn't too difficult, otherwise I'd probably remember it more."
- Filled out the form digitally
- It took 5 or 6 months to be processed and they had to follow up, VA didn’t ask for any additional information

**Veteran 3**
- Unknown

Potential future design with three options- "Remove one or more dependents", "Add one or more dependents", and "Keep or add back a dependent child who is in school (ages 18-23)"

## Design Feedback

**Current Design with two options- "Add one or more dependents" and "Remove one or more dependents"**
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for an **existing dependent**, the Veterans were confused by the options
     - All of the Veterans were confused and expressed that the action they needed to take was not adding or removing
     - 2 of the 3 Veterans said that given the options they would choose the add option
          - The third Veteran said "It doesn't give me an option to… remove a dependent. I'm certainly not adding one. So I wouldn't know what to click on, to be honest."
     - 2 of the 3 Veterans shared they thought of the use case as "update". The third Veteran was the one with the more complicated situation and shared that they were looking for a third button where they could submit the information that they had for consideration, even if they weren't trying to add or remove.
       
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for a **new** dependent, all of the Veterans said that they would choose the add option
     - This choice seemed very clear and straightforward to the Veterans
     - One commented "That one’s pretty obvious"

**Potential future design with three options- "Remove one or more dependents", "Add one or more dependents", and "Keep or add back a dependent child who is in school (ages 18-23)"**
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for an **existing dependent**, 3 of the 3 Veterans said that they would choose the keep or add back option
     - The 2 Veterans who had said they expected an update option when looking at the current design shared that this second design was what they had in mind
     - Veterans did not express confusion or concern about the wording
          - One said that the 90 days information was helpful
       
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for a **new** dependent, all of the Veterans said that they would choose the add option
     - This choice seemed very clear and straightforward to the Veterans
       
- __All 3 Veterans preferred this design!__

## Additional Finding
- 2 of the 3 Veterans said that they would not want to take more than 1 action at the same time (for example, adding and removing)
- 1 Veteran said that they would do that if the situation called for it and in that case they would like to add dependents before removing

## Next Steps  
- Move forward with the 3 option design
- Follow up with David on questions that were raised:
     - Which benefits can and cannot be used at the same time as disability dependent student compensation?
     - Will student dependents automatically be removed on the graduation date that the Veteran provides?
     - Can dependents be added to the disability compensation benefit again after they have finished using the education benefit that previously disqualified them?
