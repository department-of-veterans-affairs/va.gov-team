# Summary

**Topics covered**: 5

* Veterans’ understanding of dependents management  
* Unexpected results seen in form analytics  
* Ways to improve communication with Veterans about verification  
* How Veterans begin the process of providing student information to VA  
* Usability of the 674 form experience

**Veterans interviewed**: 28  
**No shows**: 7  
**Number of cohorts**: 7  
**Length of pilot**: 13 weeks

From the Continuous Discovery Pilot Process document: "The goal is to improve usability and trust in dependents-related experiences by making Veteran feedback more frequent, lightweight, and actionable." Continuous Discovery allowed the Lifestage team to interact with more Veterans compared to if the team completed two large usability studies in the same 13-week period (assuming an average of 9 interviews per study). Talking to more Veterans meant the team could put more research topics in front of people to get their feedback, leading to more opportunities for learning and iteration. The team iterated on designs six times as a direct result of Continuous Discovery sessions. It also created a fast pace, allowing less time for wider sharing of synthesized findings. The pace pushed the team to move onto the next study quickly, sometimes at the expense of detailed finding documentation and testing topics that required a complicated prototype.

## Pros

**Flexibility**: One of the greatest benefits of the continuous discovery method is its inherent flexibility. During the pilot, this agility allowed us to repeat studies across multiple cohorts when we needed more data to be confident in a design direction, or pivot immediately to higher-priority questions as project needs shifted. The approach also enabled feedback on multiple design iterations so we could rapidly course-correct.

**Increased access to Veteran feedback:** By allowing Veteran feedback to generally be obtained in two weeks or less, the pilot established a rapid insight loop that influenced internal workflows. The newfound speed and access encouraged the team to increasingly incorporate Veteran perspectives into decision-making processes. The value of this data was further evidenced by the fact that, since the pilot ended, team members have asked about it and for continuing Veteran input.

## Cons

**Not a good fit for all research questions**: We found that continuous discovery works best for certain types of research questions. It is well-suited for exploratory research and effective for concept testing with lightweight prototypes. However, the inherent constraints present challenges. The short timeline makes it difficult to prepare fully-featured prototypes for comprehensive usability testing, and the limited recruiting window can hinder efforts to reach hard-to-reach Veteran groups, such as Pension recipients.

**Limited opportunities for documentation:** The continuous discovery pilot's tight timeline limited opportunities for documentation. While communication and next steps remained clear within the HCD team due to frequent research session debrief attendance and discussion in internal meetings, broader communication was more challenging. The VA HCD Lead departed mid-pilot, and the onboarding of a full-time successor was delayed by the government shutdown. Based on feedback, we did improve team-wide knowledge by starting to present continuous discovery updates in sprint reviews. Summaries of facts and findings were uploaded to GitHub for each cohort, but full reports couldn't be created due to time constraints. In the future, the team suggests documentation templates to speed up reporting.

# Logistics

**Planning and kicking off the Continuous Discovery pilot**

- Our Product Manager, HCD Lead, and researcher collaborated on a document outlining a suggested plan for the Continuous Discovery pilot, including team roles and responsibilities, topic selection guidelines, and timelines.  
- We shared this document with other team members and our stakeholders and incorporated their feedback.  
- Then we collaborated with Shane Strassberg, OCTO Research Operations Lead, to plan for how Continuous Discovery’s frequent, small studies could work with OCTO’s research approval process and Perigean’s recruiting timelines. The approach we settled on was to submit a research plan for a set amount of time, in this case three months.
- We also held a kickoff call with Perigean to make sure that we were aligned. We requested 5 participants each round.  
  


**Conducting the Continuous Discovery pilot**

- Our team works in two-week sprints, so that is what we based our Continuous Discovery cycles on. During the first week we prepared for and conducted the research sessions. In the second week we analyzed the findings from the research sessions, documented findings in Github, decided on a topic for the next research cohort, and communicated our participant needs to Perigean. 

- Midway through the pilot we conducted a retro to reflect on the process so far and make adjustments for the rest of the experiment. The team found that the successful aspects of the pilot included positive feedback from stakeholders who perceived the work as nimble and opportunities for team members to observe the research. The research benefits were receiving feedback on incremental aspects of design, receiving timely feedback, the regular contacts with Veterans, and the insights we had surfaced.  
  There were also opportunities for improvement. The pace of continuous discovery could be draining and did not allow for extensive preparation. The time for digesting, sharing, and documenting findings after the study was limited.  
  The team discussed many opportunities for improvement and next steps and there were 3 that we took action on immediately. The first was that we would continue to share the results of the research in the Sprint Reviews. This was important for communicating the findings with POs and team members outside the HCD team. We began to include the findings in sprint review shortly before the retro, after Sanja requested more updates on the continuous discovery work. We also began to create tickets when artifacts were needed to support the research. This allowed us to account for design and content team members’ time and how that would affect other work. Finally, in light of the pace of the continuous discovery work, we are taking a break over the holidays to accommodate team members’ varied schedules and fully review the results of the pilot.

  [Full notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/research/2025-08-continuous-discovery-pilot/Midpoint%20Retro.md) from the retro are available in Github.

- We did conduct one larger study during the continuous discovery pilot. This was accomplished by having the researcher conduct those interviews during the second week of the continuous discovery cycle. Other HCD team members completed the continuous discovery planning and analysis that is done during this second week. We also requested that Perigean recruit additional participants during our last continuous discovery cohort and it became similar to a larger, standard moderated user study.

# Findings

### Cohort 1 

Topic: Veterans’ understanding of dependents management

Research questions: 

- Do Veterans understand that life changes may impact their dependents’ status? Do they understand which life changes?   
- Do they understand the effect that adding or removing dependents has on their benefit?  
- What do they think might happen if a Veteran doesn't update their dependent information after a life change?  
- Where do Veterans expect to manage their dependents? If on VA.gov, where? On the VA app?  
- Do they view their dependents on VA.gov? And why and when do they view them? If they don’t view them, have they ever wanted to or are there specific cases where they would want to?  
- Where do they go to learn about VA benefits, the Disability Compensation benefit, and dependents management?  
- What does that phrase 'dependent verification’ mean to them in the context of VA benefits?  
- Has VA ever asked them to verify their dependents?  
- What does 'overpayment' mean to them in the context of VA benefits?  
- What would they expect to happen if the VA determined you had an overpayment?

Participants: 3 completed, 2 no-shows 

Findings: (See findings in Cohort 2)

Next Steps: (See findings in Cohort 2)

Outcome: We wanted more participants so we repeated the study with Cohort 2.

### Cohort 2

Topic: (Same as above)

Research questions: (Same as above)

Participants: 4 completed, 2 no-shows (for a total of 7 completed sessions)

Findings: (not all are included for length)

- Dependency mental models  
  - Participants anticipated some life changes that might impact dependents, but had some holes in their knowledge.   
  - Participants did not see the difference between dependents ON their benefits and benefits FOR dependents.  
  - Participants expected a grace period after a death or divorce to report the event to the VA.  
  - Participants generally understood how each dependent impacts their monthly payment.  
- Communication and notification  
  - Participants found it helpful to know the automated age-out date for their children (age 18).   
  - Participants expected VA to communicate with them leading up to and after an automated removal.  
  - Participants expected consistent reminders of the life changes that impact benefits.  
  - Participants expected their payments to show a breakdown of how much is base pay, and how much is for their dependents or other exceptions.  
  - Participants mentioned multiple different types of letters that listed their dependents, and info about those dependents.  
- Verification  
  - All participants assumed that “verification” meant providing documents when adding a dependent, to prove they are eligible.  
  - Participants assumed that if their dependents are correct, they don’t need to do anything. One participant said he got the verification letter, but his dependents were correct, so he threw it away.  
- Overpayments  
  - Participants expressed distress that their overpayments would accumulate in the months it takes the VA to process a change.  
  - So far, all of the participants called this “overpayment” One said “accidental overpayment”  
- Managing children over 18  
  - Participants didn’t understand the current 686/674 flow for reporting student status.  
  - Participants with children with disabilities were more aware that their children may be able to stay on their benefits, esp. if their children get SSI payments.

Next Steps: (not all are included for length)

- Next steps that can be taken by DMT team:  
- Include all life changes that affect eligibility in the picklist (integrated into 686 Improved Removals Flows v3)  
- Add content to the Dependents Management benefit information page specifically about the life changes that people don’t consistently understand (integrated into 686 Improved Removals Flows v3)  
- Consider adding date a dependent will age out to the picklist dependent cards (Explored concepts, pending API availability)  
- Provide off-ramps in the dependents management experience for users looking to make changes to other dependent benefits   
- Allow users to download their forms after submitting (planned)  
- Re-write the content explaining the 0538 form and dependent verification to address points of confusion  
- Move forward with redesign of add/reactivate student flow to address Veteran confusion (Explored concepts)  
- Investigate if Veterans are able to currently do any dependents management in the VA app (Work complete)  
- Create email outreach to Veterans about important aspects of dependents management, such as reminders as dependents approach age 18 that they will be automatically removed and about life changes that impact eligibility  
- Catalogue all paper letters Veterans receive about dependents and what info about the dependents is listed, so that we can better understand the information Veterans are receiving about dependents


- Next steps that could be taken by other teams:  
- Advocate for a policy change, or see if there is room in the current rulemaking, to allow a grace period for reporting changes to dependents after a death or divorce  
- Share participants’ desire that their payments show a breakdown of how much is base pay, and how much is for their dependents or other exceptions with the payments team  
- Advocate for changes, or see if there is room in the current process or rulemaking, to reduce negative impacts on Veterans in cases where dependent changes are delayed due to long processing times  
- Share participants’ confusion with the current 686/674 flow for reporting student status with the team redoing the 674 paper form

Outcome: 

- We gained a foundational understanding of participants’ experiences with and expectations of dependents management.   
- This understanding informed the next-steps of our product work.  
- Because this included 2 cohorts we talked to 7 participants. This is on the lower end but in the range of a standard moderated user study.    
- It took 4 weeks to conduct these studies which is less than a standard moderated user study.   
- We did not share the research findings as widely as we normally do when conducting a standard moderated user study.

### Cohort 3

Topic: Reviewing unexpected results in analytics

Research questions: 

- Why do recent analytics show an unexpectedly high rate of users exiting the 686c remove flow at the final Review and Submit page (or later sections close to submission)?  
- Once we have an answer or a theory about why this is happening, what type of Veterans would we need to recruit in future studies to learn more?

Participants: No Veteran participants this round

Findings: 

- There is not enough data yet to see patterns or develop theories about what causes Veterans to leave the flow at the end of the form.

Next Steps:

- Revisit the question in about 3 months, when the 686 form will have been released for longer and there will be more data

Outcome: 

- We had hoped that this round of continuous discovery would inform recruiting for research with a future cohort; however, we learned that we won’t have enough data until more Veterans have used the 686c form. While there are other ways we could have learned this information, for example by creating a ticket to look at the metrics, continuous discovery provided a framework of time reserved for high-priority research work that we could use to quickly look into these surprising analytics.

### Cohort 4

Topic: Testing ways to improve communication with Veterans about verification

Research questions: 

- Do you ever review your dependents? Have you ever discovered a problem with their status or information?  
- Has VA ever asked you to review your dependents’ information?  
- Have you ever manually removed a dependent from your benefit? Do you feel that you have a good understanding of why you might need to manually remove a dependent from your benefit? How did you learn about these cases?  
- Do you use VA.gov? What do you use it for?  
- How does VA communicate with you (email, letter, etc)? How would you like VA to communicate with you?  
- What language is mostly helpful when communicating to Veterans about verification: verification, re-verification, confirmation of dependents? (In past studies Veterans have assumed verification meant the documentation that was requested when they added dependents, such as a birth certificate or marriage license.)  
- What language is most helpful in communicating to Veterans about the optional yearly verifications: VA advises . . ., VA asks . . ., VA recommends . . .?  
- Does the language around the form change Veterans’ expectations about the verification experience? (In past studies Veterans have thought that verifying was scanning the list of their dependents to make sure the information was still accurate.) Language: no mention that it’s a form and includes number only, includes “form” language and number, includes “form” language and plain language form name and form number.  
- Does the language used to explain why completing the verification form is important change Veterans’ reaction to it or the steps they choose to take next? Language: determine continuing eligibility, avoid overpayment, accurate information and payment  
- After reading the language in the example email, what would you do next? When would you do that? How likely would you be to do that on a scale of 1-5?  
- What you expect to see, or what you expect to be asked to do, when you clicked on the link in the email?  
- Would you have any concerns after reading this email?

Participants: 5 completed

Findings: 

- The participants had varied reactions to the content: different preferences, interpretations, and responses.   
- The 2 participants who had previously verified their dependents had fewer questions about what the emails were saying and assumed that they were being told to verify their dependents again.  
- The content caused 1 participant to be anxious about overpayments, potentially having to pay that money back, and if they were receiving this communication because VA thought there was a problem with his information.


Next Steps:

- Continue testing content about verification with Veterans to uncover patterns  
  - Consider focusing on participants who haven’t verified their dependents before vs. participants who have verified  
  - Include questions about if the content causes participants worry or distress  
  - Consider testing content in the context of the dependent management pages on VA.gov  
    

Outcome: 

- We gained insight into how Veterans interpret communications from VA. However, more information was needed because we hadn’t seen clear themes emerging yet.   
- Higher priority research questions connected to ongoing design work were identified for the next cohorts so we haven’t followed up on these next steps yet.

### Cohort 5

Topic: What is the most natural way for Veterans to begin the process of providing student information to VA  
Research questions: 

- Do you ever review your dependents? Have you ever discovered a problem with their status or information?  
- Has VA ever asked you to review your dependents’ information?  
- Have you ever had a child between the ages of 18 and 23 on your disability benefit as a student? Were they on your benefit when they were a minor? What was the process of notifying VA that they were a student like?  
- For both designs, the current design with two options: “Add one or more dependents” and “Remove one or more dependents”, and the future design with three options: “Add one or more dependents”, “Remove one or more dependents” and “Keep or add back a dependent child who is in school (ages 18-23)”, participants were asked which option they would select in two scenarios.  
  - In the case that a Veteran has a 17 year old dependent on the benefit and receives a letter that they will be removed from the benefit on their 18th birthday, unless the Veteran provides VA with information and documentation about their schooling:  
    - What would you select to start the process of providing VA with school information for your dependent?  
    - Is there something you're looking for that you're not seeing?  
    - What would you expect to happen after you made that selection?  
    - What made you choose that option?  
  - In the case that a Veteran’s disability rating increased from 20 to 40 percent and their college student now qualifies to be a dependent on the Veteran’s disability compensation  benefit if the Veteran provides VA with information and documentation about their schooling:  
    - What would you select to start the process of providing VA with school information for your dependent?  
    - Is there something you're looking for that you're not seeing?  
    - What would you expect to happen after you made that selection?  
    - What made you choose that option?  
- After seeing both designs, is there an option that you prefer? Why do you prefer that design?  
- If you could design your own screen for providing this information, what would it look like?

Participants: 4 completed, 1 no show

Findings: (See findings in Cohort 6)

Next Steps: (See next steps in Cohort 6)

Outcome: We wanted more participants so we repeated the study with Cohort 6\.

### Cohort 6

Topic: What is the most natural way for Veterans to begin the process of providing student information to VA

Research questions: (Same as above)

Participants: 3 completed, 1 no show, 1 potentially not a Veteran so data wasn’t used (for a total of 7 completed sessions)

Findings:   
	**Student Dependent Form Experience**

- Of the 7 Veterans,   
  - 4 had previously added student dependents to their benefit  
    - 2 had negative experiences   
      - filling out the form “wasn’t too difficult”, took about 6 months to be processed, Veteran followed up and believes the long time was due to errors by VA  
      - got different answers from the call center about if dependents could use Chapter 35 and disability student benefits at once, after about a year of having both benefits the student was removed from the disability benefit by VA and had to repay  
    - 1 had a neutral experience  
    - 1 didn’t remember   
  - 1 Veteran had not previously added student dependents to their benefit  
  - 1 Veteran was not clear about the form we were talking about  
  - Were not able to ask 1 Veteran  
    

	**Design Feedback**

- Current design with two options- "Add one or more dependents" and "Remove one or more dependents"  
  - For the existing dependent scenario,  
    - 5 would choose the add option,  
      - 4 of 5 said it was confusing  
    - 2 didn’t know what to select   
      - both wanted a third option  
  -  For the new dependent scenario,   
    - All 7 Veterans would choose add  
- Potential future design with three options- "Remove one or more dependents", "Add one or more dependents", and "Keep or add back a dependent child who is in school (ages 18-23)"  
  - For the existing dependent scenario,  
    - All 7 Veterans would choose "Keep or add back a dependent child who is in school (ages 18-23)"  
      - 1 Veteran was confused by the language   
      - 1 said that the 90 days information was helpful  
      - 2 Veterans who had said they expected an update option when looking at the current design shared that this second design was what they had in mind  
  -  For the new dependent scenario,   
    - All 7 Veterans would choose add

Next Steps:

- Follow up with David on questions that were raised:  
  - Which benefits can and cannot be used at the same time as disability dependent student compensation? (Question answered)  
  - Will student dependents automatically be removed on the graduation date that the Veteran provides? (Question answered; incorporated into design)  
  - Can dependents be added to the disability compensation benefit again after they have finished using the education benefit that previously disqualified them? (Question answered)  
- Move forward with the 3-option design (Designed, and ready for future research)


Outcome: 

- We gained clarity about a new and crucial part of dependents management experience. This information allowed us to move forward with selecting a design with confidence.  
- Because this included 2 cohorts we talked to 7 participants. This is on the lower end but in the range of a standard moderated user study.    
- It took 4 weeks to conduct these studies which is less than a standard moderated user study.   
- We did not share the research findings as widely as we normally do when conducting a standard moderated user study.

Participants: 9 completed, 1 no-show

Findings: 

- 4 of the participants had filled out the 674 form before    
  - about half had been surprised when their dependents were removed on their 18th birthday and the other half were not surprised  
  - 1 Veteran’s experience was positive to neutral and 3 Veterans’ experiences were negative to neutral  
- 5 of the participants had not filled out the 674 form before, but did have dependents in middle school or high school so they would quite possibly need to fill out the form in the future    
  - about half expected their dependents to be removed on their 18th birthday and the other half did not know when their dependent would be removed  
- Filling out the 674 for high school students can be confusing  
  - 4 participants, including the VSR, mentioned confusion resulting from filling out the form for high school students and/or it would nice if the form could be adjusted to better accommodate high school students  
- All participants selected the option of "Keep or add back a dependent child who is in school (ages 18-23)" to begin the 674 form, generally with little to no hesitation  
- On the *“Select which eligible children will be in school this year”* all participants selected the dependent without issue.  
- On the *“Other education benefits”* screen 5 participants expressed confusion and would like additional information about the benefits listed.   
- On the *“Federally funded schools or programs”* screen 5 participants expressed confusion and needed additional information about each of the schools or programs, especially the "Another federally-funded school or program" option.   
- On the *\[DEPENDENT\]'s federally funded program or school* screen, 4 participants stated that they would prefer to use a dropdown, list, or type-ahead field when adding this information. One participant preferred the free-text entry field.  
- On the “*When did \[DEPENDENT\] start receiving federal education benefits?”* screen, 5 participants stated that the date would be the first date of school or of the program and 3 participants believed that the date related to benefit payment dates.  
- On the *“\[DEPENDENT\]'s school accreditation status”* screen, 7 participants stated that they liked the "How to tell if a school is accredited" help option.  
- On the *“Current or future term”* screen, 5 participants thought that the first question ("What is the official start date of the current or upcoming term?\[\*Required\] For example, if the student’s school uses semesters, tell us when the student’s current semester started. Or if the student is in a certificate program, what is the first day of class?") and the second question ("When did the student start or expect to start their term? \[\*Required\]") were asking for the same date. Three participants said that they understood the difference between the questions, with 1 sharing an example indicating that they understood the difference.   
  Two participants expressed confusion about the third question (“When does the student expect to graduate? \[\*Required\]”). One participant said her dependent had chosen a major that required secondary admission into the degree program; since she had not been admitted to the program when the Veteran filled out the form they didn't know which date to put. Another participant asked what they should do if their dependent didn't finish their studies at the planned time; also if graduation date is when they get their diploma, or when they finish classes.  
- On the *“\[DEPENDENT\]'s Previous term”* screen, there were no major questions or confusion.  
- On the “*\[DEPENDENT\]'s Previous term dates”* screen, the majority of participants said that they understood what was being asked.   
- On the *“\[DEPENDENT\]'s school attendance history”* screen, participants' reactions were mixed. The explanatory content was well-received.  
- On the “*When did \[DEPENDENT\] stop attending school continuously?”* screen, the majority of the participants expressed confusion about how to answer this question. Some expressed that it was unclear what situations might occur that would need to be reported. Two participants said that they would enter their dependent's graduation date and 2 participants asked about additional date fields to put the date that they returned to school or multiple dates if they had stopped attending school multiple times.  
- The Financial screens were a lower priority in this research study and given time limitations, only a few participants looked at them. Also, the participants were disability compensation recipients, not the pension recipients who would fill out this section of the form. Of the participants who did see these screens some were confused or did not see the difference between the different pages. The only difference is the page heading, and the prototype scrolled to the bottom of these pages when they loaded so the header wasn't visible.   
- On the *“\[DEPENDENT\]'s school expense amounts”* screen, 4 participants shared that they wanted or expected to upload receipts, 2 participants didn't mention the format provided for entering expense amounts, 1 participant liked the format provided for entering expense amounts, and 3 participants would like a more structured way of entering expense amounts.

Next Steps:

- Work with Design, Content, and Engineering to assess the feasibility of clarifying and/or customizing the form experience for high school and college students  
- Add content explaining what each of the education benefits options are on the "Other education benefits" page  
- Add content explaining what each of the schools or programs options are on the "Federally funded schools or programs" page, especially the "Another federally-funded school or program" option  
- Work with engineers and David Reis to investigate if it would be possible to create a list of federally funded programs or schools (early discussions have occurred)  
- Add content clarifying which date should be entered on the "When did KAI start receiving federal education benefits?" page  
- Add or edit content clarifying which dates should be entered on the "Current or future term" page  
- Add or edit content clarifying what cases need to be reported and which dates should be entered on the "When did dependent stop attending school continuously?" page  
- Consider adding content about why these questions are being asked, add or edit content clarifying what information needs to be provided on the Income section pages, clarify that the pages are distinct, consider testing these pages with additional Veterans

Outcome: 

- We received extensive feedback about the 674 form flow that directly informed content and design changes and other next steps.
