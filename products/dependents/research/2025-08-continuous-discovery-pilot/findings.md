### Participants
- 3 Veterans
- All received disability compensation benefits and had dependents on their disability benefit
     - Dependents included children, spouses, and parents

### Experience Adding and Removing Dependents
- Veterans had added these dependents to their disability benefit
- None had had to manually remove a dependent
- When asked why they might need to remove a dependent, participants consistently mentioned divorce or death. One person mentioned disability.
- One person had had a child removed when they turned 18, but they didn't get any notice that this was going to happen. They only realized when the check they received was less than usual.
     - When two Veterans were asked how they would like to be notified that their child was going to be removed from the benefit when they turned 18, they mentioned they would like to be notified in several ways (email, letter) and be notified in advance

### Dependent Verification
- None of the participants remember being asked to verify their dependents
     - One participant added their first dependent in approximately 2009, another in approximately 2017, don't know the timeline for the third Veteran
- When asked what they thought dependent verification meant, all participants said the documentation that they provided when adding the dependents
     - For example, a birth certificate or a marriage license
- One participant did later talk about VA making sure that their dependents were still accurate, and how this is something they were comfortable with, and they did use verification in this context
- When asked how would you explain the reason for verifying dependents to another Veteran, the participants said:
     - Participant One: To ensure that your pay stays accurate
     - Participant Two: Update immediately so you never receive overpayment and that you recieve the right amount. Make sure the information is correct or else there will be overpayment. It also takes money away from other Vets. (Is this true?)
     - Participant Three: Remind Veterans that if they don't do it they could lose benefits. There is no incentive to tell you if I'm getting a divorce. The VA would need to give me an ultimatum - to continue receiving you must do this.


### Other Findings
- Participants clearly understood that dependents were tied to payments. So when dependents were added their disability benefit payment was higher, and when they were removed the payment was lower
- They also understood that if they're paid too much, they'll need to pay it back
     - Two suggested or assumed that this could be waived in certain circumstances
     - Two requested that they be notified of overpayments by letter. (One mentioned specifically a certified letter because they would be more likely to notice it.)
       
- When asked where on VA.gov they would expect to view their dependents, the participants responded:
     - Remembers a tab/button to find this
     - Maybe in claims on Va.gov. There's a link to VA.gov on MyHealtheVet; I still want it to be there.
     - When you login it's the first thing you see, instead of hidden behind several clicks

- When asked what their ideal removal process would be if one of their dependents died, participants said:
     - (None of them had experienced this and they did not have designs in front of them so it was a theoretical conversation)
     - The process should be short and there should be a phone number to call that walks them through it
     - Have the VA contact them and handle the removal. (It wasn't entirely clear how the VA would know to contact the Veteran)
          - Did not want to have to digitally "delete a person that has been deleted out of my life" (death)
     - VA would understand if they didn't remove the deceased Veteran from their disability benefit immediately
       
- When asked about their ideal process or what they would change if they had a magic wand, participants said: 
     - More contact, proactive contact by VA
          - Has anything changed with your benefits, with your dependents?
          - You don't know what you don't know
     - Straightforward
          - A scantron can verify them
     - Wants it all to be online
          - Adding and removing dependents and uploading documents
