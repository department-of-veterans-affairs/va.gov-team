## Participants

We spoke with 9 Veterans.  
     - 1 participant often gave answers that indicated that he thought that the form was for a different education benefit despite clarification being given, so I have done my best to not include the answers that aren't applicable  
     - 1 participant had filled out the form and later became a VSR working on the 674 form, I've separated his feedback from his personal experiences and his feedback from his professional experiences with the form
  
     - 4 of the participants had filled out the 674 form before  
     - 5 of the participants had not filled out the 674 form before, but did have dependents in middle school or high school so they would quite possibly need to fill out the form in the future  
  
**Participants' feedback on their experience adding a dependent student**
- Participant 3
     - His dependent turned 18 while still in high school, he said this meant he had to do additional paperwork
     - It took him about two weeks to do the paperwork but took VA 7 months to process it
     - "Mountain of paperwork"
 
- Participant 7
     - Said there weren't any parts of the form that he didn't understand, if he gets stuck he reads the form instructions

- Participant 9
     - Her daughter was born overseas, she remembers this meant that something manual had be done to add her but she doesn't remember the details
     - Shared that she wasn't sure what to put on the form for her daughter's address because she lived in the dorms, put the college's address
     - Remembers entering all the dates

- Participant 10
     - His son was removed while still in high school, filling out the form was confusing because it was the same form for students in high school and college
     - Had the school guidance counselor write a letter saying his child was still in school and when they would graduate, getting this letter took a month which delayed the process
     - The first time he reached out to VA he was told to fill out as much as he could with high school information
     - The second time he reached out to VA a rep was able to walk him through step-by-step


**Participants' understanding of when their dependents would be removed**
- Of the 4 participants who had filled out the 674, about half had been surprised when their dependents were removed on their 18th birthday and the other half were not surprised
- Of the 5 participants who had not filled out the 674, about half expected their dependents to be removed on their 18th birthday and the other half did not know when their dependent would be removed


## Findings

**Confusion when filling out the 674 for high school students**
- 4 participants, including the VSR, mentioned confusion resulting from filling out the form for high school students and/or it would nice if the form could be adjusted to better accomodate high school students

**Veteran 3**


## School Form Experience
  
**Veteran 1**
- “I don't remember it being complicated. I don't know… nothing really stands out, I guess.”
  
**Veteran 2**
- "It wasn't too difficult, otherwise I'd probably remember it more."
- Filled out the form digitally
- It took 5 or 6 months to be processed and they had to follow up, VA didn’t ask for any additional information

**Veteran 3**
- Unknown

Potential future design with three options- "Remove one or more dependents", "Add one or more dependents", and "Keep or add back a dependent child who is in school (ages 18-23)"

## Design Feedback

**Current Design with two options- "Add one or more dependents" and "Remove one or more dependents"**
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for an **existing dependent**, the Veterans were confused by the options
     - All of the Veterans were confused and expressed that the action they needed to take was not adding or removing
     - 2 of the 3 Veterans said that given the options they would choose the add option
          - The third Veteran said "It doesn't give me an option to… remove a dependent. I'm certainly not adding one. So I wouldn't know what to click on, to be honest."
     - 2 of the 3 Veterans shared they thought of the use case as "update". The third Veteran was the one with the more complicated situation and shared that they were looking for a third button where they could submit the information that they had for consideration, even if they weren't trying to add or remove.
       
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for a **new** dependent, all of the Veterans said that they would choose the add option
     - This choice seemed very clear and straightforward to the Veterans
     - One commented "That one’s pretty obvious"

**Potential future design with three options- "Remove one or more dependents", "Add one or more dependents", and "Keep or add back a dependent child who is in school (ages 18-23)"**
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for an **existing dependent**, 3 of the 3 Veterans said that they would choose the keep or add back option
     - The 2 Veterans who had said they expected an update option when looking at the current design shared that this second design was what they had in mind
     - Veterans did not express confusion or concern about the wording
          - One said that the 90 days information was helpful
       
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for a **new** dependent, all of the Veterans said that they would choose the add option
     - This choice seemed very clear and straightforward to the Veterans
       
- __All 3 Veterans preferred this design!__

## Additional Finding
- 2 of the 3 Veterans said that they would not want to take more than 1 action at the same time (for example, adding and removing)
- 1 Veteran said that they would do that if the situation called for it and in that case they would like to add dependents before removing

## Next Steps  
- Move forward with the 3 option design
- Follow up with David on questions that were raised:
     - Which benefits can and cannot be used at the same time as disability dependent student compensation?
     - Will student dependents automatically be removed on the graduation date that the Veteran provides?
     - Can dependents be added to the disability compensation benefit again after they have finished using the education benefit that previously disqualified them?
