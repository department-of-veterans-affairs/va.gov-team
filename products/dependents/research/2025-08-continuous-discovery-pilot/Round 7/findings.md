## Participants

We spoke with 9 Veterans.  
     - 1 participant often gave answers that indicated that he thought that the form was for a different education benefit despite clarification being given, so I have done my best to not include the answers that aren't applicable  
     - 1 participant had filled out the form and later became a VSR working on the 674 form, I've separated his feedback from his personal experiences and his feedback from his professional experiences with the form
  
     - 4 of the participants had filled out the 674 form before  
     - 5 of the participants had not filled out the 674 form before, but did have dependents in middle school or high school so they would quite possibly need to fill out the form in the future  
  
**Participants' feedback on their experience adding a dependent student**
- Participant 3
     - His dependent turned 18 while still in high school, he said this meant he had to do additional paperwork
     - It took him about two weeks to do the paperwork but took VA 7 months to process it
     - "Mountain of paperwork"
 
- Participant 7
     - Said there weren't any parts of the form that he didn't understand, if he gets stuck he reads the form instructions

- Participant 9
     - Her daughter was born overseas, she remembers this meant that something manual had be done to add her but she doesn't remember the details
     - Shared that she wasn't sure what to put on the form for her daughter's address because she lived in the dorms, put the college's address
     - Remembers entering all the dates

- Participant 10
     - His son was removed while still in high school, filling out the form was confusing because it was the same form for students in high school and college
     - Had the school guidance counselor write a letter saying his child was still in school and when they would graduate, getting this letter took a month which delayed the process
     - The first time he reached out to VA he was told to fill out as much as he could with high school information
     - The second time he reached out to VA a rep was able to walk him through step-by-step


**Participants' understanding of when their dependents would be removed**
- Of the 4 participants who had filled out the 674, about half had been surprised when their dependents were removed on their 18th birthday and the other half were not surprised
- Of the 5 participants who had not filled out the 674, about half expected their dependents to be removed on their 18th birthday and the other half did not know when their dependent would be removed


## Findings

**Filling out the 674 for high school students can be confusing**
- 4 participants, including the VSR, mentioned confusion resulting from filling out the form for high school students and/or it would nice if the form could be adjusted to better accomodate high school students

Next Steps: Work with Design, Content, and Engineering to assess the feasability of clarifying and/or customizing the form experience for high school and college students

## Feedback broken down by page
  
**What would you like to do?**
- All participants selected the option of "Keep or add back a dependent child who is in school (ages 18-23)", generally with little to no hesitation
    
- Next Steps: none

    
**Select which eligible children will be in school this year**
- All participants selected the dependent without issue

- Next Steps: none

  
**Other education benefits**
- 5 participants expressed confusion about this screen

- Next Steps: Add content explaining what each of the education benefits options are on the "Other education benefits" page

**Federally funded schools or programs**
- 5 participants expressed confusion about this screen

- Next Steps: Add content explaining what each of the schools or programs options are on the "Federally funded schools or programs" page, especially the "Another federally-funded school or program" option


**Dependent's federally funded program or school**
- 4 participants stated that they would prefer to use a dropdown, list, or type-ahead field when adding this information
- 1 participant preferred the free-text entry field

- Next Steps: Work with engineers and David Reis to investigate if it would be possible to create a list of federally funded programs or schools


**When did KAI start receiving federal education benefits?**
- 5 participants stated that the date would be the first date of school or of the program
- 3 participants believed that the date related to benefit payment dates

- Next Steps: Add content clarifying which date should be entered on the "When did KAI start receiving federal education benefits?" page


**KAI’S school accreditation status**
- 7 participants stated that they liked the "How to tell if a school is accredited" help option
    
- Next Steps: none


**Current or future term**
- 5 participants thought that the first question "What is the official start date of the current or upcoming term?(*Required) For example, if the student’s school uses semesters, tell us when the student’s current semester started. Or if the student is in a certificate program, what is the first day of class?" and the second question "When did the student start or expect to start their term? (*Required)" were asking for the same date
- 3 participants said that they understood the difference between the questions
     - 1 shared an example indicating that they understood the difference
- 2 participants expressed confusion about the graduation date
     - 1 participant said her dependent had chosen a major that required secondary admission into the degree program, since she had not been admitted yet they didn't know which date to put
     - 1 participant asked what they should do if their dependent didn't finish at the planned time and if graduation date is when they get their diploma, or when they finish classes?

- Next Steps: Add or edit content clarifying which dates should be entered on the "Current or future term" page

**Dependent's Previous term**
- No major questions or confusion

- Next Steps: none


**Dependent's previous term dates**
- 2 participants of the 8 that commented on this page were confused

- Next Steps: See other next steps about the confusion caused by filling it out the form for a high school student and rearranging the term date pages


**Dependent's school attendance history**
- Participants' reactions were mixed, about half understood what was being asked and half expressed confusion
- The explanation was well-received

- Next Steps: none*


**When did dependent stop attending school continuously?**
- The majority of the participants expressed confusion about how to answer this question
- It was unclear to some participants what situations might occur that would need to be reported
     - I wonder if this would have been easier if they were filling out the paperwork for their own dependent instead of a fictitous dependent/situation
- 2 participants said that they would enter their dependent's graduation date
- 2 participants asked about additional date fields to put the date that they returned to school or multiple dates if they had stopped attending school multiple times


- Next Steps: Add or edit content clarifying what cases need to be reported and which dates should be entered on the "When did dependent stop attending school continuously?" page


*The Financial pages were a lower priority in this research study and given time limitations, only a few participants looked at them. Also, the participants were disability compensation recipients, not the pension receipients who would fill out this section of the form.**


**Dependent's income for this school term**
- Of the participants who saw this page, about half said that they understood the questions and half had additional questions
- 2 partcipants didn't understand why financial questions were necessary

- Next Steps: Consider adding content about why these questions are being asked, add or edit content clarifying what information needs to be provided on the "Dependent's income for this school term" page, consider testing these pages with additional Veterans


**Dependent's expected income for next year**
- Participants were confused or did not see the difference between this page and the previous "Dependent's income for this school term" page, the only difference is the page heading
     - This may be because on the prototype the page loaded scrolled to the bottom so the header wasn't visible

- Next Steps: Add or edit content clarifying what information needs to be provided on the "Dependent's expected income for next year" page, consider testing these pages with additional Veterans


**Value of student assets**
- Participants were confused or did not see the difference between this page and the previous "Dependent's income for this school term" and "Dependent's expected income for next year" pages
     - This may be because on the prototype the page loaded scrolled to the bottom

- Next Steps: Add or edit content clarifying what information needs to be provided on the "Value of student assets" page, consider testing these pages with additional Veterans


**Dependent's school expenses**
- Half of the participants who saw this screen described it as easy or clear and the other half had questions

- Next Steps:Add or edit content clarifying which expenses should be entered on the "Dependent's school expenses" page
