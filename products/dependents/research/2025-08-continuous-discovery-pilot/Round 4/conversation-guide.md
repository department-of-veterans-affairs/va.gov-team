**Action needed: We need you to verify your dependents**

Dear Terry,

VA advises that you verify your dependents (VA Form 21-0538) each year on VA.gov.

We use this information to determine if you’re eligible to continue receiving additional compensation based on how many dependents you have.

**Email 2 (10 minutes)**

**Action needed: Dependent re-verification needed**

Dear Terry,

VA asks that you re-verify your dependents yearly using the form (VA Form 21-0538) on VA.gov.

Re-verifying your dependents helps to avoid disability benefit overpayments by keeping your dependents up to date. If you're overpaid, you'll have to pay money back.

**Email 3 (10 minutes)**

**Action needed: Please confirm the dependents on your disability benefit**

Dear Terry,

Each year VA recommends that you confirm the status of your dependents by completing the form Mandatory Verification of Dependents (VA Form 21-0538) on VA.gov.

Confirming the status of your dependents helps to ensure that the information VA has about them is accurate. This is an important factor in confirming that your benefit compensation amount is correct.
