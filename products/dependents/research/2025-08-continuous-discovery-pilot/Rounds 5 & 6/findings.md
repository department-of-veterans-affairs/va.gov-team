# Participants
We spoke with 4 Veterans.  
  
**Veteran 2**  
- Wife, mother, and two child dependents
- One child dependent who used disability dependent student benefit while dependent was still in high school, may use it again after their GI Bill benefits run out
  
**Veteran 3**
- College student dependent using GI benefit, used disability dependent student benefit while dependent was still in high school
- Also has a dependent in high school
  
**Veteran 4**
- One dependent between the age of 18 and 23, had previously used disability student benefit but did not know that it could not be used at the same time as Chapter 35 so ended up having an overpayment, dependent had left college but planned to return and Veteran thought that once they stopped using the student benefit they could not reapply
- Mentioned another child but did not talk about them being a student
  
**Veteran 5**
- Has an elementary-school-aged child

## School Form Experience
  
**Veteran 2**
- Doesn't remember the process of adding a student
  
**Veteran 3**
- Learned about disability student benefit from VSO who helped them on original disability application
- Finding out what they needed to do online was hard, they searched on VA.gov and tried typing in dependent (went to dependents), student (went to GI bill) 
- Couldn't figure out the right form, ended up calling VA and a person told them what form to fill out, when they called back with additional questions/difficulties someone filled it out over the phone and submitted it electronically for him
- Found the school calendar online to validate high school graduation date
- Shared that they have to validate the class start and end date each year, will not get paid for the summer when dependent is out of school, and dependent needed to be taking a certain amount of credits- these may be true for the GI Bill but we do not believe these are true of the disability student benefit
  
**Veteran 4**
- Submitted the paperwork on VA.gov
- Could not find answers to some of their questions online, it was all verbal
- Got different answers from the call center about if dependents could use Chapter 35 and disability student benefits at once
- After about a year of having both benefits the student was removed from the disability benefit by VA and had to repay
  
**Veteran 5**
- Has not added a student to their disability benefit

Potential future design with three options- "Remove one or more dependents", "Add one or more dependents", and "Keep or add back a dependent child who is in school (ages 18-23)"

## Design Feedback

**Current Design with two options- "Add one or more dependents" and "Remove one or more dependents"**
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for an **existing dependent**, 3 of the 4 Veterans said that they would choose the add option
     - Veteran who did not choose add said that they would expect to see a "separate box" because "we are trying to recertify he is a student"
     - 2 of the 3 Veterans who said that they would choose add also said that it could be confusing or that there should be a third option
       
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for a **new** dependent, all of the Veterans said that they would choose the add option
     - There was much less hesitiation and confusion with this choice than there was for the existing dependent use case

**Potential future design with three options- "Remove one or more dependents", "Add one or more dependents", and "Keep or add back a dependent child who is in school (ages 18-23)"**
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for an **existing dependent**, 4 of the 4 Veterans said that they would choose the keep or add back option
     - 1 Veteran found the wording of the option confusing and said that a More Information option with different life situations that would fall into this category would help him to "say 'yes this is me' and feel more confident in my selection"
     - Other 3 Veterans did not express confustion or concern about the wording
       
- When asked which option they would choose to submit information for a **new** dependent, all of the Veterans said that they would choose the add option

- All 4 Veterans preferred this design!

## Next Steps  

- Test the designs with the next cohort in Continuous Discovery to get additional perspectives from Veterans who have added student dependents
- Follow up with David on questions that were raised:
     - Which benefits can and cannot be used at the same time as disability dependent student compensation?
     - Will student dependents automatically be removed on the graduation date that the Veteran provides?
