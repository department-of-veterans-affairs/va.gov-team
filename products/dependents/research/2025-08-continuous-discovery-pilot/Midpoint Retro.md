Halfway through our continuous discovery pilot and we chose to conduct a retro to reflect on the process so far and make adjustments for the rest of the experiment.

Here are the notes from the retro session:

**Pilot Observations**
- Continuous discovery focused on quick, lightweight research is possible!
     - We've gotten solid insights
     - Conducted CD alongside other research efforts
- Best for certain types of research
     - More success with exploratory research questions. Better fit for the smaller number of participants and less artifacts required
     - Less effective answering questions about relatively minor content/design variations


**Successful Aspects of the Pilot**
- Positive feedback from stakeholders
     - Perceived the work as nimble

- Benefits to team members
     - Created opportunities for team members to observe research
     - Future opportunities for more team members to conduct research

- Research benefits
     - Feedback on incremental aspects of design
    - Timely and responsive
     - Surfaced insights that we wouldnâ€™t have otherwise
     - Regular interface with Veterans

**Opportunities for Improvement**
- The pace can be draining

- Study preparation difficulties
     - The turnaround time from idea to research was tight and didn't leave much room for things to go wrong
     - Rush to select topics can lead to not being strategic enough
     - It's hard to make time to prepare artifacts amid other work

- Post-study difficulties
     - Not a lot of time to digest what we've learned for each research effort
     - Less time for sharing insights with the extended team
     - Less time for creating documentation

**Next Steps**

- Improve information sharing
     - Continue sharing in Sprint Review (we've been doing this for 2 sprints now)
     - Consider watch parties to offer more opportunities for observations

- Make the pace more sustainable
     - Have other DMT team members facilitate sessions
     - Possibility of PBB team conducting some sessions
     - Consider taking a break each quarter (*PO concerned that it could break the rhythm of continuous discovery)
     - Standardize/templatize documentation and/or reporting
       
- Improve planning
     - Create ticket for creating artifacts to account for the time folks need to make them
     - Design team review the research backlog together from time to time
     - Ask ourselves, what are we looking to learn from this and is continuous discovery the way to do it

- Improve pace AND planning
     - Pick a "theme" for a quarter and go with that unless something else comes up (*PO concerned that it could take away from the agility of continuous discovery)
     - Quarterly break could allow more time for planning

- In a future round focus on content-specific questions and partner with the content team

- In a future presentation include scaling for small and large teams, etc

**Outstanding Questions**
- Are the small groups representative?
- We've chose to continue a study across more than one CD cohort several times. This means we're almost in a monthly cadence. Does this mean we should make adjustments from our original bi-weekly plan?
