### Participants
- 7 Veterans
- All received disability compensation benefits and had dependents on their disability benefit
     - Dependents included children, spouses, and parents
     - We also had two veterans who talked about having a child with a permanent disability

**Adding and removing dependents**

| Finding | Recommendation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Veterans we spoke to correctly anticipated some life changes that might impact dependents, but had some holes in their knowledge. They knew about divorce and death, child's marriage, and that children would be removed at age 18. They did NOT consistently understand the rules for children with disabilities, aging parents, or children 18-24 in school | Include all change options by dependent in the picklist, so edge cases are not ignored Add content to the website specifically about the edge cases people don’t consistently understand |
| Veterans expect to manage their dependents in the VA app, and on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) in the profile  | We need to understand the dependents experience in the app and how our enhancements impact it (or dont) |


**Dependency mental models**

| Finding | Recommendation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Veterans do not see the artificial boundaries between dependents ON their benefits and benefits FOR dependents. For example, a veteran said that when his daughter was born, he had to get her added to his disability payments and CHAMPVA health insurance. He had to provide the same information twice to 2 different areas of the VA. He hoped that if he reported a change to dependents on the VA under the ‘dependents’ tab, it would make those changes to CHAMPVA too | Provide off-ramps in the dependents management experience for users looking to make changes to these related benefits At the end of the 686 combo form, remind users how and where to make changes to these other benefits |
| Veterans expect a grace period of 90 days after a death or divorce to report the event to the VA before their payments are changed. “If you have a pretty significant life event (like divorce or death), there should be a 90 day grace period before debt starts accumulating. But the VA should assume that its a tough part of life, and the VA benefit isn’t the first thing you think of...You have to give people time...We give the VA years to figure stuff out, but they don’t give us even 1 day beyond the death of a child. That’s ridiculous.” \- P3 | Advocate for a policy change, or see if there is room in the rulemaking to allow this grace period, and operationalize it |
| Veterans generally understand how each dependent impacts their monthly payment | While they do understand, I think we could better link between our manage-dependents experience and the various rates pages that have this information |


**Communication and notification**

| Finding | Recommendation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Veterans expect that any change to dependents should take 2-4 weeks at most For some veterans, this is how long it took, and they were happy. For others, it took months longer. | Explain which situations are quick (BPDS automated) vs which ones aren’t, so veterans have accurate expectations for how long things will take (balance this with the cost of maintaining and updating this content) |
| Veterans find it helpful to know the automated age-out date for their children (age 18). Multiple veterans mentioned that they get a letter every year telling them how much longer their children will be on their award | This might be a helpful attribute to include on dependent cards |
| Veterans expect consistent reminders of the life changes that impact benefits.  “If you do that on a regular basis, it would help ppl remember that if X happens, they need to tell the VA. And they should be aware of the consequences.” - P3 | Do a targeted email campaign. Such an easy lift |
| Veterans expect the VA to communicate with them leading up to and after an automated removal. “For children aging out, I would like an email 6 months, 3 months, 30 days before, telling me what my options are. Telling me when my last payment would be.” -P5 | Add email communications for these situations, esp as a child approaches age 18 |
| Veterans expect their payments to show a breakdown of how much is base pay, and how much is for their dependents or other exceptions. “Its very confusing that when I get it the payment, it doesn’t tell me how much is for my kid and for my wife. I also get social security for disability and there is some interface between them, and they argue with me about double counting my benefit because some of it is for the children. I need to be able to demonstrate my lump sum disability payment is for several people.” - P3 | Refer this idea to payments team |
| No veterans we spoke to expressed difficulty finding the place to see or update their dependents online | Dont over-rotate on findability – the idea to move dependents into profile probably makes sense.  |
| Veterans expressed that paper mail often arrives months after the date printed on the letter | Ask David about this |
| Veterans want to see what they’ve submitted to the VA, and have written record if possible Multiple veterans mentioned that they get different answers on the phone, and can’t hold the VA accountable for the different answers they get | Allow users to download their forms after submitting |
Veterans mentioned multiple different types of letters that listed their dependents, and info about those dependents | Catalogue all paper letters veterans receive about dependents, and what info about the dependents is listed, so we can propose changes to those letters and/or to the dependent object in our application |

**Verification**

6/7 participants did not remember ever receiving a verification letter. The one who did threw it away. 

| Finding | Recommendation |
| :---- | :---- |
| All veterans assumed that “verification” meant providing documents when adding a dependent, to prove they are eligible. Ex: birth/marriage certificate, adoption decree | Re-write the content that explains 0538 verification to avoid confusion |
| Veterans assume that if their dependents are correct, they don’t need to do anything ever One veteran said he got the verification letter, but his dependents were correct, so he threw it away | Add this as a FAQ somewhere – address it deliberately with veterans |


**Overpayments**

| Finding | Recommendation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Veterans expressed distress that their overpayments would accumulate with the months it takes the VA to process a change | Make a procedural change to wait 3 months before charging overpayments 1x in a benefit’s lifetime (like overdraft protection at a bank) This would increase trust in VA Perhaps it would incentivize faster processing! Veterans should not suffer because the VA is not up to modernized communication expectations |
| Veterans thought that in the case of overpayment, the full amount would be taken from their next check.  They expressed that is what they have experienced in the past from other agencies/programs, like social security or the GI bill.  And, they don’t like it! It can cause abrupt problems to their cash flow.  | We should look into the overpayments letters to understand what the comms are, and how we can make them better |
| So far, all of the veterans call this “overpayment” One said “accidental overpayment” | I think referring to this internally as ‘accidental overpayment’ could go some way towards shifting the burden away from the veteran – they are pretty harshly penalized for misunderstanding the byzantine system |


**Managing children over 18**

| Finding | Recommendation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Veterans don’t understand the current 686/674 flow for reporting student status.“My oldest kid just went to college, and I am trying to switch his status. It has been a giant pain in my butt. I am not sure what’s going on, I just know it’s not going well. I assumed I could do it in advance, but I had to wait until he turned 18\. The form asked about all these dates for his school, and I didn’t understand them. I assumed I could just change the status, but I had to remove him to add him – it didnt make any sense.” - P3 | Move forward with redesign of add/reactivate-student flow, and incorporate into our findings for the new team redoing the 674 paper form |
| Veterans with children with disabilities were more aware that their children may be able to stay on their benefits, esp. if their children get SSI payments. | Make searchable content especially for parents of children with disabilities that speaks to: Dependency on their disability, pension, survivor benefits How disability might impact other VA benefits FOR dependents, like CHAMPVA health insurance and education benefits |
