# Conversation Guide 

## Moderator logistics
### 2-3 days before the session
- Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Checklist.1958773011.html#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions). 

- Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below)

- [ ] **Assign and confirm note-takers:** This should include a member of your team but could include others. Ask your notetaker(s) to review [guidance on taking notes](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/notetaker-guidelines). If you can’t find someone to take notes, Perigean is available to assist. [Learn how to prepare for Perigean to take notes](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-prepare-for-perigean-to-take-notes).
- [ ] **Prepare for note-taking:** Create a “session-notes” folder within your research study Github folder and store each session as a .md document. Copy the conversation guide over to your .md file before each session so that you have a structured way to capture your notes.
- [ ] **Invite observers:** Invite your team and stakeholders to sessions. [Limit your observers](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#creating-a-safe-space-for-participants) to 3-4 per session so participants aren’t overwhelmed. You should empower participants by allowing them to decide if they are comfortable having observers. Ask observers to review information about [observer guidelines and attendance etiquette](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html).
- [ ] **Prepare as a moderator:** Be familiar with the conversation guide, study implement(s), and prototype(s). Review [tips on moderating, guidelines for recording sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Recording-User-Research-Sessions.2050949305.html),and guidance on [participant and researcher safety and exit strategies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html).
- [ ] If we have access to participant communications or reconfirm with Perigean that the participant has been informed of technology requirements.


### Day of the session
- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in 
Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).



### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*



## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about the experience of having dependents on your benefits and keeping them up-to-date.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** We're scheduled for 60 minutes and I want to respect your time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

- I saw from the information you provided when you signed up for the session that you have your (spouse and children - review coordinator info) as dependents on your benefits. If you think back, can you remember how you added them (for example, online, through a paper form, or with a representative)?
- We realize that some changes in dependents status can come from difficult circumstances, so let me know if you’d prefer to skip any questions. Have you ever had to remove a dependent from your benefits? 
   - (IF YES) Can you tell me a bit about that experience?
   - (Cover what life event prompted the change, how they knew what action to take, where they found information, any pain points throughout the process…)

## Section 1 - Understanding of Dependents

Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences. Now I’m going to ask you to think back to when you first heard about adding dependents to your benefits. 
- How do you know if a family member is eligible to be considered a dependent by VA?
   - Where would you go to find this information?
   - (If participant has already mentioned VA.gov) If it’s helpful, I can pull up VA.gov and we can walk through the steps you would take to find more information on dependent eligibility.
   - Is there any additional information you would like to have about managing dependents on your benefits? 
   - How do you know when you need to make updates to your dependents?
      - How would you find out more about when to update your dependents?
      - (Listen for: If they had accrued overpayments, they might say that VA notified them that they had to make updates)
      - (If no mention of prior overpayments) What might happen if some dependent information was out of date?
   - How would you confirm which dependents are currently claimed on your benefits?
   - If you needed to add or remove dependents from your benefits, how would you go about doing that?
 
*If needed, show participant static page, current dependents, add/remove dependents, Profile drop-down*

- Take a few moments to review the information on this page. 
   - Can you talk about how these steps measure up to your expectations? 
   - How would you explain this process to a friend?
   - What would you change?
  
### Things to watch for:
- Does the participant understand who can be a dependent?
- Does the participant understand how to manage dependents?
- Does the participant know where to go to learn more about how/when to manage dependents?


## Section 2 - Understanding of Risks

Thank you for talking through that with me. Next I want to talk to you more about the process of managing dependents on your benefits. 
- If you were explaining to a friend, how would you describe the reason for adding dependents to your VA benefits?
   - What about the reason you might remove a dependent from your benefits?
   - How would you find out more about this?
   - How often do you think your dependent information should be updated?
   - Where would you go to find out more about this?
- Is there any information you would like to have about managing dependents?
- (If not already mentioned) Have you ever had to pay back benefit overpayments to the VA?
   - (IF YES) Can you tell me about your experience of learning about those overpayments?

### Things to watch for:
- Does the participant understand the meaning of benefit overpayments?
- Does the participant understand the risks of not updating dependents?
- Does the participant understand the benefit of updating dependents?

## Section 3 - Email reminders

- Thank you for sharing those experiences with me. Next, I wanted to talk about your experiences around receiving email reminders from the VA. 
   - Do you currently receive email reminders from the VA? 
      - What are these email reminders about?
      - Does the VA commonly use other methods to reach you? (Paper, email, text, on-site?)
   - What is that experience like for you?
      - Can you trust the information you receive?
      - How do you feel about how often you receive reminders?
      - Do they help you accomplish what you need to?
   - How would you expect to receive reminders from the VA about your dependents?
   - When would you expect to receive notifications about your dependents? (Listen for: at regular intervals or connected to certain events)
      - How often would you expect to receive notifications about keeping your dependents up-to-date?
      - What would be the best time for you personally to receive this reminder? (Listen for: right after a life event, at a certain time of year, etc.)
   - Are there any reminders that you would like to receive that we haven’t mentioned?
 
### Things to watch for:
- What kind of notifications does the participant expect/prefer?
- Does the participant trust notifications from the VA?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Do you want to share anything else about your experience managing dependents with the VA?
- Anything about the VA in general?
- Any questions for me?

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

### Backup Moderator Plan

In the event the moderator needs to stop moderating, we’ll have determined a backup moderator for each session from one of the other possible moderators in the session (Ajia Wallace ajia.wallace@softrams.com, Nichole Nicholas nichole.nicholas@coforma.io, Julie Pedtke julie.pedtke@coforma.io). 
The initial moderator will communicate with the backup moderator via the Feedback-backchannel on Slack that they need to swap roles.
The initial moderator will communicate with the participant that they’re going to switch with a note-taker and introduce the new moderator.
“I’m going to switch out with my note taker, Julie Pedtke, who will be moderating the remainder of this session. I’ll still be on the call, but Julie will be leading. Did you have any questions before we switch out?”
Initial moderator will assume note-taking responsibilities.
