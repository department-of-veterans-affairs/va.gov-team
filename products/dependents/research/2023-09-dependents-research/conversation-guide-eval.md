# Conversation Guide 

## Moderator logistics
### 2-3 days before the session
- Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Checklist.1958773011.html#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions). 

- Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below)

- [ ] **Assign and confirm note-takers:** This should include a member of your team but could include others. Ask your notetaker(s) to review [guidance on taking notes](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/notetaker-guidelines). If you can’t find someone to take notes, Perigean is available to assist. [Learn how to prepare for Perigean to take notes](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-prepare-for-perigean-to-take-notes).
- [ ] **Prepare for note-taking:** Create a “session-notes” folder within your research study Github folder and store each session as a .md document. Copy the conversation guide over to your .md file before each session so that you have a structured way to capture your notes.
- [ ] **Invite observers:** Invite your team and stakeholders to sessions. [Limit your observers](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#creating-a-safe-space-for-participants) to 3-4 per session so participants aren’t overwhelmed. You should empower participants by allowing them to decide if they are comfortable having observers. Ask observers to review information about [observer guidelines and attendance etiquette](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html).
- [ ] **Prepare as a moderator:** Be familiar with the conversation guide, study implement(s), and prototype(s). Review [tips on moderating, guidelines for recording sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Recording-User-Research-Sessions.2050949305.html),and guidance on [participant and researcher safety and exit strategies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html).
- [ ] If we have access to participant communications or reconfirm with Perigean that the participant has been informed of technology requirements.


### Day of the session
- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in 
Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).



### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*



## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** We're scheduled for 60 minutes and I want to respect your time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

- What device do you typically use to check email?
- I saw from the information you provided when you signed up for the session that you have your (spouse and children - review coordinator info) as dependents on your benefits. If you think back, can you remember how you added them (for example, online, through a paper form, or with a representative)?
- We realize that some changes in dependents status can come from difficult circumstances, so let me know if you’d prefer to skip this next question I’m about to ask. Have you ever had to remove a dependent from your benefits? 
   - (IF YES) Can you tell me a bit about that experience?
   - (Listen for what life event prompted the change, how they knew what action to take, where they found information, any pain points throughout the process…)


## First Task: Email Inbox - 10 minutes

- Thanks for sharing that. Now I’m going to transition into having us look at some designs we’re creating.
- First, I want to show you a couple of emails & talk through them with you to get a sense of what works.
   - What do you expect this email to be about?
      - How would you explain it to a friend?
   - Who would you expect might get this email?
   - What action would you take if seeing this email in your inbox?
     - What device would you use to take action? For example, would you do it from your phone or computer…


### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant understand the intent of the email based on the subject?
- Does the participant trust the source of the email?
- Does the participant understand the email is for them?


## Second Task: Read Email - 10 minutes

- Now I’ll open the email and give you a few moments to read through it before I ask some questions about it.
   - How did the contents of the email compare to what you expected from the subject line?
      - Do you still believe it’s for the same audience?
      - How would you explain it to a friend now? Any changes?
   - If you read this, what would you do next?
   - Is there any information missing that would be helpful to have?
   - What would you expect to see if you clicked on the link?
   - How do you think you'd feel about getting this email?
   - What are some other reasons you'd expect to need to update your dependents (besides those listed in the email)?
   - Anything we could make clearer?
   - Are there any ways you can imagine the emails causing problems for people?
      - What sort of communications would you expect regarding sensitive life events?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant understand the purpose of the email? 
- Would the participant take action in response to the email?


## Third Task: Link to Static Page - 10 minutes

- Let’s click the link in the email, and I’ll give you a few moments to review this page before I ask you a few questions about it. 
   - How do the contents of this page compare to what you expected from the email? 
   - How would you explain the information on this page to a friend? 
   - What options for next steps are available to you here?
   - What action(s) would you take next? 
   - How could we make this more clear? 
   - Do you see any potential challenges for visitors to this page? 


### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant understand the purpose of the page?
- Does the participant understand what actions to take? 


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Do you want to share anything else about these designs?
- Anything else about your experience managing dependents with the VA in general?
- Any questions for me?
 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

In the event the moderator needs to stop moderating, we’ll have determined a backup moderator for each session from one of the other possible moderators in the session (Ajia Wallace ajia.wallace@softrams.com, Nichole Nicholas nichole.nicholas@coforma.io, Julie Pedtke julie.pedtke@coforma.io). 
- The initial moderator will communicate with the backup moderator via the Feedback-backchannel on Slack that they need to swap roles.
- The initial moderator will communicate with the participant that they’re going to switch with a note-taker and introduce the new moderator.
   - “I’m going to switch out with my note taker, Julie Pedtke, who will be moderating the remainder of this session. I’ll still be on the call, but Julie will be leading. Did you have any questions before we switch out?
- Initial moderator will assume note-taking responsibilities.
