### Participant Demographics
- 10 Veterans
    
- 9 of them had spouses as dependents
- 7 of them had children as dependents (average of 2 child dependents for the 4 participants that shared how many children they had)

- 3 joined the study from a phone
- 7 joined the study from a laptop/desktop


### VA.gov Usage
- All participants used VA.gov
     - 2 shared that they had added dependents on VA.gov
     - Other activities that 2 or more Veterans mentioned included: managing benefits and/or claims, accessing MyHealtheVet, managing appointments, messaging providers, and requesting travel pay reimbursements

- 2 Veterans said that they use the VA app more or prefer the app


### Reviewing Dependents
- 5 participants shared if and when they look at their dependents
     - 3 said that they don't review their dependents
     - 2 said that they don't look at their dependents often
     - 3 said that they go to look at their dependents when there is a specific reason (they need to make a change to a dependent, there is a change in amount of disability compensation that they receive, a dependent is about to age out, etc)

## Prototype Feedback
### Dependents not on your VA benefits Screen
- Alert
     - 9 of the 10 participants read aloud or commented on the alert
       
     - When it came time to act on the prompt (Imagine that you receive an email from VA that says "Review the dependents that you've added to they're VA benefits to make sure the information is accurate" the email includes a link that takes you to this page):
          - 5 used the link in the alert to move onto the next screen without direct prompting
          - 2 used the verification link farther down the page
          - 1 first tried to click on the "Add or remove a dependent" link
          - 2 had to be directly prompted to click on the link, unclear if this was a due to not being used to using a prototype or the alert or link itself


### Changes to dependents Page
- Design 1
     - Of the 4 participants who commented, 2 said that they would not need any additional information to answer the questions
     - 2 said that they would like additional information (but didn't say that they would not be able to complete the form without it), the information they mentioned was expiration date (both participants), date of birth, and SSN

- Design 2
     - Of the 4 participants who commented, 3 said that they would not need any additional information to answer the questions
     - 1 said that they would like information about how to answer if spouses were separated, but then changed his mind "once you start opening up doors, you're probably in for a big harangue from the VA and the legal world."


### Death Question

- 1 participant preferred Design 1 (where the question was asked first and on its own page)
- 5 particicpants preferred Design 2 (where the question was an option for each dependent)
- 2 participants had no preference between Designs 1 and 2
- didn't cover this with 2 participants

- Preference didn't depend on which design participants saw first.
     - Participants who saw Design 1 first: 0 prefer Design 1, 3 prefer Design 2, 1 was neutral, didn't ask 2 participants
     - Participants who saw Design 2 first: 1 prefer Design 1, 1 prefer Design 2, 1 was neutral

> "I also like the second option [Design 2] because the questions are for each specific dependent instead of the first option where the first question was "Has any of your dependents died?" That can cause unwanted memories of having to remember people that died and what their relationship was to you even if they were not dependent on your specific disability."

> "It seems kind of, kind of cold, you know? Kinda in your face, you know?"

> "I think they're a little too direct . . . After your information's correct. Alright, next screen, anybody in your family died?"

> "if you get that at the first. Now it's gonna go through all of your dependents to figure out who died. . . . I don't want to sit there and look at all of my dependents and say, well, nope, this one's still kicking, this one's dead, this one's still kicking. So, yeah, I find that page there [Design 1], that just seems out of character, out of place."

> We also asked participants to rate each design on a scale of 1 to 5. Participants gave Design 1 an average of 3.8 points and Design 2 an average of 4.5 points. The features that participants mentioned most often that they preferred were the method of asking about dependent death in Design 2 and asking about all of the dependents on a single page in Design 2, as opposed to Design 1 where each dependent was on a separate page.


### Review reasons Page
- Design 1
     - 3 of the 10 participants who saw Design 1 commented on "Changes pending" tag

- Design 2
     - 2 of the 9 participants who saw Design 2 commented on the "(Changes pending)" text after the dependent's name


 ### Confirmation Page

 - Print this confirmation
     - 2 Veterans wanted to print a copy
     - 4 Veterans wanted to save as a PDF
     - About half of the participants who wanted a copy for their records, wanted the form and/or their responses documented

- Additional forms
     - When asked what would happen if they knew they needed to fill out another form but couldn't remember the name or number:
          - 3 said they would go to VA.gov (one expected to get a notification about it, one said that they would go back to the verification page, and the last said that they would go to the documents page)
          - 2 said that they would search on Google
          - 1 said they like to get a reminder via email (or letter for Veterans who prefer not to receive emails from VA)


### Preferred Design
- We asked participants to rate each design on a scale of 1 to 5.
     - Participants gave Design 1 an average of 3.8 points
     - Participants gave Design 2 an average of 4.5 points
       
     - Reasons for preferring Design 2 that participants mentioned most often:
         - Method of asking about dependent death
         - Asking about all of the dependents on a single page
      


## Next Steps
  1) Continue to refine the content of the alert box based on feedback from this and other studies to increase Veteran understanding of verification and verification completions
  2) Include the approach to asking about death from Design 2 (where the question was an option for each dependent) in future designs
  3) Update designs and test edge cases (ie 8 dependents) for including all dependents on a single page
