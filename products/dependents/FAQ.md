# FAQ for Dependent Management on VA.gov

## General FAQ
<details>
<summary>What benefits do the 21-686c, 21-674, and 0538 impact?</summary>

- 21-686c: Disability, pension, and DIC benefits
- 21-674: Disability, pension, and DIC benefits
- 21-0538: Disability benefits only (David Reis on 6/23/25)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there instances where VA.gov should prevent a Veteran from submitting a 686c or 674?</summary>
 
  - The VA never wants to prohibit submission because there is no ITF for dependents. It is important that we accept anything and then develop the claim to determine eligibility.

<summary>How common is fraud?</summary>

  - The VA tries to avoid referencing "fraud" because it implies intent. Typically, over- and under-payments are caused by a simple oversight by the Veteran. Divorce is the largest cause of benefit over-payment. There are some cases of actual fraud, but it's extrememly rare.

<details>
<summary>Why are there questions about pension income in the VA.gov 686c form that are not on the pdf?</summary>

  - The pension line of business requested that VA.gov add two pension-related income questions to the online form flow, so that RBPS can auto-process some 686c claims that impact pension. A complete outline of the questions and functionality can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/pension_income_questions.md). Note that the net income limit changes every year and is typically finalized in October and needs to be updated on VA.gov by the end of November each year.

<summary>What is the EP code for dependency claims?</summary>

  - All dependency claims that come into the VBA are assigned an [end product](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000036570/Appendix-C-Index-of-Claim-Labels) (EP) of 130 (EP130).

## Claim Processing
<details>
<summary>How long does it take to process a 686c claim?</summary>

  - It's hard to give an estimate because every claim is different.
     - If a claim is manually processed through a field station, it might not be distributed right away if there is a queue of claims.
     - If a claim is missing evidence, it can take up to 30 days if the VA needs to send a development letter to the Veteran. A processor may also call the Veteran.
     - Worst case scenario: A claim needs to go through an administrative decision where a full write-up takes place.
     - If a claim is automatically processed through RBPS, it could be processed in as little as 30 minutes

<summary>Where are 686/674 claims with foreign addresses processed?</summary>

  - Mail Automation Service (MAS) with the Office of Business Integration (OBI) confirmed that any form received with an address of APO/FPO received by Mail Automation will receive the foreign address flash that routes it to the Pittsburgh Regional Office if additional actions are required (process claim for compensation, dependency, pension, etc.).

<details>
<summary>Why does VA.gov off-ramp some 686/674 claims before they go to RBPS?</summary>

  - RBPS processing volume is limited, so the original implementation of the online 686/674 form on VA.gov off-ramped some specific claim types that RBPS cannot process automatically. This prevents the claim from going through RBPS only to be off-ramped. Instead, VA.gov adds a manual "flag" to the claim that is read by BGS/BEP, and BGS/BEP then sends the claim to the manual processing queue. For a complete list and more information see [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/RBPS-offramp-scenarios.md).

<summary>What is RBPS' processing volume?</summary>

  - RBPS production processes every 30 mins at the top/bottom of the hour. 4 servers, 50 claims per server = 200 claims every 30 mins. VA.gov sends 60-ish 686 or 674 claims to RBPS per hour, but it's unknown how many paper claims RBPS may process.

<summary>Should ssn and file numbers be the same?</summary>

  - In most cases, they will match, however, there are a few exceptions:
     - There are four or five variations of what a file number might be, and only one variation would match SSN. Depends on the age of the Veteran and when they served. This is less and less relevant, it was mostly before the Vietnam era that the numbers deviated.
     - MPI includes file number, SSN, EDIPI, PID...tries to associate all of these to the Veteran. For older Veterans, the numbers may be different. There’s an effort to clean up the MPI, millions of records aren’t associated with the correct file number or SSN and it's common to run into problems with mismatches.

## APIs
<details>
<summary>What is the API that pulls in list of active and inactive dependents on the "View My Dependents" Page</summary>

## Marriages
<details>
<summary>If a Veteran already has a spouse listed as a dependent and they try to add a new spouse, what happens?</summary>

- The Veteran is required to tell the VA if the status of their current spouse changes (e.g., death, divorce, etc.).
- When adding the new spouse, the Veteran will be asked about prior marriages and the date those marriages ended.
- If the Veteran got divorced in November, they'll see a change to their benefits starting December 1.
- When a Veteran reports a dependent change matters. If a Veteran waits more than a year to notify the VA of a new dependent, the VA will not backdate benefits to the date of marriage (or birth). Instead, the VA will backdate benefits to the date the 686c was submitted to add that dependent.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why does the 686c ask for the Veteran's and current spouse's previous marriage history?</summary>

  - VETERAN/CLAIMANT'S PREVIOUS MARITAL INFORMATION – All previous marriage information is required by regulation ([38 CFR 3.205](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38/chapter-I/part-3/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFRdc46cfd3b31f77a/section-3.205))
  - CURRENT SPOUSE'S PREVIOUS MARITAL INFORMATION - All previous marriage information is required by regulation ([38 CFR 3.205](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38/chapter-I/part-3/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFRdc46cfd3b31f77a/section-3.205))

## Children
<details>
<summary>How far ahead of time should VA.gov warn Veterans that their soon-to-be 18 year old or 23 year old will be removed from their disability/pension benefits (if they're not attending school or permanently disabled)?</summary>

  - The VA's practice is to accept school aged child 90 days prior to 18th birthday
  - The VA currently mails letters 60 days prior the child’s 18th birthday
  - A child is removed from the Veteran's benefits the day the child turns 18 or 23

</details>

## Students
<details>
<summary>What happens if  dependent child graduates school before they turn 23?</summary>
  
  - The Veteran needs to inform the VA that the child graduated before age 23 and they will be removed from the Veterans benefits.

<details>
<summary>Does the Veteran have to wait until their child is 18 to submit a 674?</summary>
  
  - No. The VA's practice is to accept school aged child 90 days prior to 18th birthday

## Verification
<details>
<summary>Why is the verification of parents not included in the 21-0538 form?</summary>
  
  - The probablilty is so low, the VBA decided not to include them.

  [Source: Kevin Schneider 5/15/25](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F08UBCMQ5GQ?focus_section_id=temp:C:FNHc46b51e2bca243209f09b5fc8)
</details>

<details>
<summary>How often should VA.gov alert Veterans to verify their dependents?</summary>
  
  - Kevin indicated that opinions may differ, but he suggested once per year. For Veterans that do not log into VA.gov often, he suggested emailing them a notification after 2 years of inactivity.

  [Source: Kevin Schneider 5/15/25](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F08UBCMQ5GQ?focus_section_id=temp:C:FNH2e3686d5b0684854ba5feaea3)
</details>

<details>
<summary>How often do Veterans have to verify the dependents on their benefits?</summary>
  
  - The VA requires Veterans to officially verify all the dependents on their benefits every 8 years, however, the VA would prefer that Veterans review their dependents at least once a year to ensure the dependents listed on their benefits are still accurate. The VA currently mails out [a letter](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/dependency_verification/Batch%20Dependency%20Verification%20Letter_Redacted.pdf) to Veterans every 8 years that lists all the dependents currently on their disability benefits. The letter asks the Veteran to confirm the dependents listed are correct and a copy of the 21-0538 form is included with the letter.

<details>
<summary>What dependency changes most often lead to overpayments?</summary>
  
  - Divorce/death of spouse and removal of step children. Essentially any change to dependent status. More complicated cases involve other claim adjustments during the time period: retired pay, drill pay, increase or reduction in rate, multiple school children (adds multiple adjustments), pension adjustment related to income, removal of child receiving Dependents Education Assistance (DEA).
  - According to OIT’s Benefits Integration Services (BIS) Team, who run the Rules-Based Processing System (RBPS), the three most common dependency changes leading to overpayments are:
     - Veteran not removing spouse after divorce/death. This happens a lot, when they come in to add the new spouse, they realize they never removed old spouse
     - Removal of child or child stopped attending school
     - Veteran not removing spouse after divorce/death. This happens a lot, when they come in to add the new spouse, they realize they never removed old spouse
     - Also for removal of child or child stopped attending school. (VA.gov currently sets to manual because awaiting VA.gov changes for form changes that RBPS is ready for)
