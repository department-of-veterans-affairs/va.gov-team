# Initiative Brief: Improve On-Ramps to Dependents Management

## Outcome Summary
Veterans can easily locate and access the Add/Remove Dependents section of VA.gov from major entry points, including the homepage and myVA dashboard. Veterans experience less frustration and avoid unnecessary delays or misroutes when trying to manage their dependents.

## Problem
- “Dependent” and “add dependent” are the 6th most searched terms on VA.gov, with over 25,000 search instances in the past year—indicating high demand and poor organic findability.
- Veterans who log in to VA.gov are taken to the myVA dashboard, which does not provide a clear link to Dependents Management, creating unnecessary friction for logged-in users.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans can find and access the Add/Remove Dependents experience without needing to use the site search or call VA for help.
- Veterans experience a coherent and intuitive path to managing dependents, both when logged in and logged out.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans continue using site search or guessing navigation paths to find dependent services.
- Veterans fail to update their dependency status, leading to incorrect benefits or overpayments.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Reduction in dependency-related search queries and call center volume.
- Increased completion and submission rates for 686c and 674 online forms due to easier access.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Missed opportunities to automate benefits updates and prevent overpayments due to poor discoverability.
- Negative Veteran feedback on the usability of VA.gov.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
- Veterans may expect clear navigation paths from the myVA dashboard to manage dependents, even if they don’t expect to complete those tasks within myVA itself.
- Reducing reliance on site search will make access paths more intuitive and lower call center demand.
- Dependents Management content must use recognizable, plain language (e.g. "add my child") rather than form numbers or internal jargon.
- Platform, Front Door, and Search teams may have backlog or governance constraints that affect ability to implement recommended changes.

### Recommendations
- Add a prominent link to "Manage your dependents" within the main site navigation menu
- Add a prominent link to “Manage your dependents” on the myVA dashboard for logged-in users.
- Ensure the Dependents Management entry point is available in global navigation or Service Hubs for logged-out users.
- Reduce reliance on site search by providing intuitive navigation paths to the Add/Remove Dependents experience.
- Provide updated page title, meta description, and H1 to support SEO and user comprehension.
- Add contextual entry points from relevant life event pages (e.g. having a child, getting married).
