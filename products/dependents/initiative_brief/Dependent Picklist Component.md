# Initiative Brief: Dependent Picklist Component

## Outcome Summary
Veterans can select known dependents from a picklist when verifying, adding or removing dependents, rather than manually re-entering names. This reduces input errors, increases confidence, and enables more reliable downstream automation.

- Dependent Verification MVP

## Problem
- Veterans are required to manually type in the names of dependents to remove or verify, even though these individuals are already on record with VA.
- Manual entry increases cognitive load for Veterans and opens the door to small but critical typos (e.g. “John A. Smith” vs “Jon Smith”), which can trigger downstream claim routing errors or prevent automation.
- Both usability and back-end reliability are being compromised by redundant and error-prone data entry.
- Veterans who need to reinstate an inactive dependent (for example, a spouse removed after divorce but now re-married to the Veteran, or a child who aged out at 18 and is being added back via Form 674 for school attendance) must currently re-enter all personal details from scratch; this adds friction and creates new opportunities for data mismatches.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans can easily select existing dependents from a picklist and proceed with confidence that the information matches VA records.
- Veterans experience less frustration and avoid redundant data entry when removing or verifying dependents.
- Veterans can reinstate a previously inactive dependent by selecting the person—clearly marked as “inactive” with last-removed date—from the same picklist, avoiding any manual re-entry.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans make unintentional errors when typing names, leading to delays or incorrect processing.
- Veterans abandon the flow due to confusion or friction.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Claims and form submissions that rely on dependent identification can be reliably processed without manual offramping.
- Decreased rate of claim errors due to name mismatches or unrecognized dependents.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Continued manual review and intervention for common, avoidable data mismatches.
- Increased call center traffic related to status checks or error resolution.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
- The Veteran-facing name and the name stored in internal systems (e.g. RBPS, VBMS) are aligned well enough to drive picklist selection logic.
- Veterans will recognize and trust the list of names presented as their current dependents.
- We can build the picklist to degrade gracefully in edge cases (e.g. no known dependents, name mismatches, data freshness issues).
- Downstream systems will treat picklist-driven selections as more reliable than free-text input.

### Recommendations
- Conduct initial discovery and usability testing to assess viable approaches and define the scope of a Picklist MVP.
- Design and implement a picklist component for dependents, leveraging available data on file.
- Integrate this component into the Dependent Verification MVP as a fast follow after launch.
- In a second phase, expand integration into the 686c “remove dependent” flow.
- Define fallback paths when no known dependents are found or picklist data cannot be loaded.
- Instrument user selection and error patterns for ongoing refinement.

## Phase 1 Implementation: Picklist in 686c Remove Flows (September - December 2025)
As part of the 686c V3 release, we will introduce the picklist only in **remove dependent flows**.

- Applies only to dependents already on file in the Veteran’s award record  
- Picklist selections will be mapped directly to 686c submissions
- Design is based on existing 0538 Picklist exploration work where relevant, aligned with VA Design System  


### Hypotheses
- Veterans will complete removal flows at a higher rate when presented with a picklist instead of manual entry  
- Picklist-driven selections will reduce input errors  
- Veterans will trust the accuracy of the displayed dependent list and feel more confident in their submissions  
- Average time to complete a removal will decrease because redundant questions are eliminated  


### Measurement Plan
- **Primary metric:** Conversion rate on 686c remove flows (baseline vs. post-picklist)  
- **Secondary metrics:**  
  - Average time to complete a removal  
  - % of submissions with name mismatch errors  
  - % of submissions requiring manual routing  
- **Diagnostic metrics:**  
  - Drop-off rate at dependent selection step  
  - Frequency of “Other / none of the above” selections if we include a fallback  



### Risks and Watch-fors
- Dependent data freshness or mismatches could erode Veteran trust in the picklist  
- Claims intake systems may not handle mapped codes consistently, risking downstream rework  
- Edge cases (no dependents on file, complex branching removals) may still force manual paths  
- Over-indexing on speed without validating comprehension could risk incorrect removals  


### Link to Broader Initiative
This Phase 1 release will serve as a proof point for:  
- Dependent Verification picklist opportunities  
- Expansion to 686c add flows and reinstatements  
- Long-term goal of enabling RBPS auto-processing with structured dependent data 


### Screenshots
TBD — wireframes or prototypes in development.
