## Problem
- Veterans are submitting online 686/674 claims that generate outdated pdf claim forms, are missing information, and/or contain information that is no longer required. Downstream systems (RBPS) need to offramp these claims for manual processing, which delays the Veteran's benefits.

## Desired User Outcomes

- The 686 and 674 online form flow generates and submits the most recent version of the claim pdf to increase the liklihood of automated processing by RBPS.
- The 686 and 674 online form flow collects all required information from the Veteran to ensure successful claim processing. 
- Veterans spend less time filling out the 674 form flow because depreciated fields have been removed.
- Veterans encounter fewer critical accessibility issues with completing the online 686/674 form

## Undesired User Outcomes
- 686 and 674 online claims still encounter processing delays
- Veterans find the form experience confusing, frustrating, or too cumbersome

## Desired Business Outcomes
- 686 and 674 online form submissions no longer need to be offramped for manual processing -- they can be automatically processed by RBPS.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- 686 and 674 online form submissions generate claim errors that prevent automated processing

## Measuring Success

| KPI                       | Baseline Value | Target Value | Actual Value | Link to Data Source |
|---------------------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| # of 686 claims offramped |                |              |              |                     |
| # of claim errors         |                |              |              |                     |

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
- Sending the correct form pdf form version to RBPS for processing will rememdiate the proccesing errors we've observed.
- Removing depreciated fields from the online form flows will streamline the experience for Veterans
- Remediating critical accessibility issues will improve Veterans' experience with the form flows

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - 
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Addressing the critical accessibilty issues and removing depreciated form fields will not address existing problems with the form flow
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - 
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - 

### What're you building
- Update the 686 online form flow to include new fields and remove old fields
- Update the 674 online form flow to include new fields and remove old fields
- Update the pdf version both the 686 and 674 online form flows generate
- Remediate any critical accessibilty issues
- Out of scope: Remediation of non-critical accessibility issues. Descoping a complete accessibilty audit will ensure we can get critical form updates to Veterans in a timely manner.
- Future: An assessment of the complete 686/674 online form experience will be done to identify and prioritize form improvements and additional accessibility work.

#### Go-to-market 
- We will be working closely with VBA and RBPS stakeholders to ensure the payload for the 686 and 674 forms results in efficient processing
