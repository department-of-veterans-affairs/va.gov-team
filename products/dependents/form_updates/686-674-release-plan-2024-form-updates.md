## Overview
As outlined in the [intiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/form_updates/Initiative-Brief-686-674-Form-Updates.md), the online 686c/674 form flow is out of alignment with the most recent version of the paper form. The updates associated with this release will add missing fields to the online form, remove depreciated fields, update form components, and address critical accessibility issues within the pages that are getting updated. Updates to the static pages that lead into the form flow may also be needed.

The form updates will be broken into two phases to expidite improvements to the Veteran experience.
- Phase 1 | Launch June 2024
   - Add new fields to 686 and 674 interview-style form on VA.gov
   - Remove depreciated fields from 686 and 674 interview-style form on VA.gov
   - Update pdf versions generated by the 686 and 674 interview-style form on VA.gov
- Phase 2 | Launch March 2025 (DELAYED*)
   - Update all design system components from v1 patterns to v3 patterns
   - Fix high-priority accessibility issues
   - Improve form flow patterns
   - *The form updates have passed the [Collaboration Cycle staging review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/74059) stage gate, so the changes are ready for release after testing is complete. The initial release was postponed due to ongoing issues with some of the new v3 design system components, but workarounds were implmented where needed. Given the time invested in fixing or working around the component limitations, we ran out of runway to complete end-to-end testing with OBI/RBPS stakeholders, so the release was delayed. We have developed workarounds for the following issues, and tickets have been submitted to fix the component-related issues at the Platform level:
      - [#103781](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103781): Validation error
      - [#103778](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103778): Remove additional info (this workflow needs to be reviewed)
      - [#103783](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103783): Button imposter component
      - [#103784](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103784): File input imposter component

[Release plan user flow](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1714073866859/62dbc2bda8fa99a2d87d3e5ed9103d99f96b8769?wid=522-1714073889846)

### The phase 2 release plan will need to consider the following [use cases](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1714073866859/62dbc2bda8fa99a2d87d3e5ed9103d99f96b8769?wid=522-1714073889846):
1. Applications In-Progress (active session)
   - After 100% release:
      - If users are in an active session, they will be taken back to the start of the form and any data they entered on v1 of the form will appear in the new v2 form. The users will then review their data on v2 of the form and finish completing their v2 submission.
2. Applications In-Progress (non-active session)
      - If users start a form before the updated, leave the active session, and then return after the form updates, they will be taken back to the start of the form and see an [info alert](https://www.figma.com/design/7W55oNwdVXvXOTI9SaFzQ7/686c-Add-or-Remove-Dependents?node-id=3607-35894&t=6VbyLPxmE0TkiFGp-1) noting that the form has been updated. All of their v1 form data will appear in the v2 form.
3. Applications Not Started
   - After 100% release
      - Users will complete v2.

**Needs Updating**
| User Type | Flipper Status | Form in Progress | Visible Form | V2 Info Content Displayed | Data Migrated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Authenticated Users | Disabled | No | v1 Form | No | No |
| Authenticated Users | Disabled | Yes, v1 | v1 Form | No | No |
| Authenticated Users | Disabled | Yes, v2 | v2 Form | Yes | No |
| Authenticated Users | Enabled | No | v2 Form | No | Yes |
| Authenticated Users | Enabled | Yes, v1 | v2 Form | Yes | Yes |
| Authenticated Users | Enabled | Yes, v2 | v2 Form | Yes | No |

### This phase 2 release will include the following components:
1. Form field updates on some pages
2. Form component updates (v1 to v3) on all pages
3. High-priority accessibility updates (level 0-2)
4. Info alert on the form information page letting in-progress users who were redirected back to the start of the form that the form has been updated and they need to review the info they've already entered.
6. Ability to submit multiple 674s within the same session/loop.

## Step 1: Development

You'll need to create a feature toggle (or two) for any moderately or significantly changing feature. Follow the [best practices for creating feature toggles](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/feature-toggles).

List the features toggles here.

| Toggle name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| TBD | Enable the v2 form |
| TBD | vets-website v2 toggle |
| TBD | vets-api v2 toggle |

## Step 2: Validation

Since we use a [continuous delivery](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/deployment-process) model, once code is in the `main` branch, it will be deployed that day. 

Before enabling your feature toggle in production, you'll need to:

- [ ] Follow [best practices for QA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/qa-and-accessibility-testing).
- [ ] Have your team perform as much validation in staging as possible. Validation may be challenging for some teams and systems due to downstream requirements, but the staging system should mimic the production system as much as possible.
- [ ] Work any downstream or dependant systems proactively to ensure that the feature is ready for use once it hits production.
- [ ] Have a go/no go meeting with the team to ensure that the feature is ready for use and signed off by each discipline and your DEPO/OCTO contact. During this meeting, you'll need to:
  - [ ] review the plan with your DEPO/OCTO representative.
  - [ ] review the release plan with your team.

## Step 3: Production rollout
- 1 day before release: An [info alert banner](https://www.figma.com/design/7W55oNwdVXvXOTI9SaFzQ7/686c-Add-or-Remove-Dependents?node-id=5201-37740&t=8ZxCIVyFDYV4Zawb-0) will be added to the top of every form page to alert users that the form will be undergoing maintenance on a specific date and they will be taken back to the start of the form to review their information before they submit.
- Release: Flipper will be enabled in production.
   - In-progress active sessions will continue through to the submission page. When the user clicks submit, they will be redirected back to the start of the form and alerted of the udpate and asked to review their information.
   - In-progress non-active sessions will re-start the form at the information page and see an alert notifying them of the udpate and asking them to review their information.
   - Inactive (new) users will see the info alert on the information page notifying them that the form has been updated.

<!--
### Do I need a staged rollout?

**Yes**, a staged rollout is required unless you can confidently answer "yes" to all of the following:

- This change does not add substantial new functionality to VA.gov
- This change does not impact user flows through tasks
- This change does not affect traffic to backend services

*Example*: a change to a page's text content **could skip** staged rollout

*Example*: a minor visual redesign to a page that doesn't affect user flows **could skip** staged rollout

*Example*: adding a new field to an existing form **could skip** staged rollout

*Example*: a new feature on an existing application that creates new backend traffic **needs staged rollout**

*Example*: a significant change to how users navigate an existing form **needs staged rollout**

*Example*: a feature that will route significantly more users (and therefore more backend traffic) to an existing application **needs staged rollout**

#### Exceptions

Currently, [feature toggles](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/platform/tools/feature-toggles/) are the primary tool VSP provides for facilitating staged rollout. If feature toggles don't work for your use case, you can request an exception from staged rollout in Staging Review.

| Feature type | Possible with feature toggles? |
| --- | --- |
| New feature in existing application | Yes |
| New application | Yes |
| Static content changes | Doable but tricky |
| URL redirects | No |

DEPO VSP / OCTO leads can approve other exceptions to this requirement.
-->

### Define the Rollback process

Our PM and PO will monitor analytics. If something goes wrong, the engineering team will be on standby to disable the flippers and fall back to v1 of the form.

Rollback plan:
1. PM and PO monitor analytics for issues (failed submissions, traffic irregularies, unexpected errors).
2. Engineering disables flipper which hides v2 of the form.
   - Users with in-progress v2 sessions will finish out their v2 session. If they start a new session, they will be redirected to v1.
   - New users will be directed to v1 of the form.

## Phase I: LAUNCH
The 686/674 form flow underwent significant updates to all pages within the form flow, which makes it difficult to provide a phased launch experience for users without significant risk. Because of this, the url for the v1 form will be redirected to the v2 form on the backend, so that any form data already entered/saved will "migrate" to the v2 form when the user tries to submit the form. We acknowledge that allowing an active user to continue through the v1 form and then redirecting them when they try to submit is not ideal, but there are siginifcant limitations within the form experience that prevent us from "catching" and redirecting them during their active session.

## Post-launch Questions

*To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.*

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders?
1. Which assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
1. What technical tasks are needed to clean up (i.e., removal of feature toggles)?
