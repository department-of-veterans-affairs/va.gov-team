## Overview
As outlined in the [intiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/form_updates/Initiative-Brief-686-674-Form-Updates.md), the online 686c/674 form flow is out of alignment with the most recent version of the paper form. The updates associated with this release will add missing fields to the online form, remove depreciated fields, update form components, and address critical accessibility issues within the pages that are getting updated. Updates to the static pages that lead into the form flow may also be needed.

The form updates will be broken into two phases to expidite improvements to the Veteran experience.
- Phase 1 | Launch June 2024
   - Add new fields to 686 and 674 interview-style form on VA.gov
   - Remove depreciated fields from 686 and 674 interview-style form on VA.gov
   - Update pdf versions generated by the 686 and 674 interview-style form on VA.gov
- Phase 2 | Launch March 2025 (DELAYED*)
   - Update all design system components from v1 patterns to v3 patterns
   - Fix high-priority accessibility issues
   - Improve form flow patterns
   - *The form updates have passed the [Collaboration Cycle staging review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/74059) stage gate, so the changes are ready for release after testing is complete. The initial release was postponed due to ongoing issues with some of the new v3 design system components, but workarounds were implmented where needed. Given the time invested in fixing or working around the component limitations, we ran out of runway to complete end-to-end testing with OBI/RBPS stakeholders, so the release was delayed. We have developed workarounds for the following issues, and tickets have been submitted to fix the component-related issues at the Platform level:
      - [#103781](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103781): Validation error
      - [#103778](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103778): Remove additional info (this workflow needs to be reviewed)
      - [#103783](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103783): Button imposter component
      - [#103784](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103784): File input imposter component

[Release plan user flow](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1714073866859/62dbc2bda8fa99a2d87d3e5ed9103d99f96b8769?wid=522-1714073889846)

### The phase 2 release plan will need to consider the following [use cases](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1714073866859/62dbc2bda8fa99a2d87d3e5ed9103d99f96b8769?wid=522-1714073889846):

| # | User Type | `va_dependents_v2` flipper status | Form in Progress | Visible Form | Switch to V2 alert displayed | Data Migrated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1| Authenticated User | Enabled | Yes, v1 | v1 | No | No |
|2| Authenticated User | Enabled | Yes, v2 | v2 | No | No |
|3| Authenticated User | Enabled | Yes, v1 but past 60 days of full release | v2 | Yes | NO &dagger; |
|4| Authenticated User | Enabled | No | v2 | No | No |
|5| Authenticated User | Disabled | Yes, v1 | v1 | No | No |
|6| Authenticated User | Disabled | No | v1 | No | No |
|7| Authenticated User | Disabled | Yes, v2, maybe v1? | v1 | No | No |

&dagger; After v1 IPF expires, we will redirect to v2 and start the form anew.

- Case 1: Veteran remains in v1 flow, no change
- Case 2: Veteran remains in v2 flow, no change
- Case 3:
  - Past the deadline, so switch from v1 to v2.
  - v1 introduction page will detect v1 save-in-progress and trigger a redirect to v2 introduction page (Veteran will see a switching form version alert).
  - Veteran will start v2 as a blank application (since the v1 IPF expired)
- Case 4: Veteran does not have an in progress v1, so frontend will redirect to v2 introduction. No alert is shown
- Case 5: Veteran has v1 in progress, no change
- Case 6: Veteran remains in v1 flow, no change
- Case 7 (rollback):
  - Veteran already in v2 flow, then has feature toggle disabled
  - Switch back to v1 flow? Not sure how toggle would handle this situation
  - If they have a previous v1 in progress form, they would see their original
    v1 in progress data (no new data)
  - If they didn't have a previous v1 in progress form, they would see a start a
    new v1 form

### This phase 2 release will include the following components:
1. Form field updates on some pages
2. Form component updates (v1 to v3) on all pages
3. High-priority accessibility updates (level 0-2)
4. Info alert on the form information page letting in-progress users who were redirected back to the start of the form that the form has been updated and they need to review the info they've already entered.
6. Ability to submit multiple 674s within the same session/loop.

### Rollback plan

Rollback feature toggle if:
- Any submission failures during rollout at 1%
- Team judgement call

---

## Step 1: Development

We have a single feature toggle which we will use to transition from v1 to v2: 

| Toggle name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `va_dependents_v2` | Enable the v2 form |

## Step 2: Validation

Before enabling your feature toggle in production, we will:

- [ ] Follow [best practices for QA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/qa-and-accessibility-testing).
- [ ] Have your team perform as much validation in staging as possible. Validation may be challenging for some teams and systems due to downstream requirements, but the staging system should mimic the production system as much as possible.
- [ ] Work any downstream or dependant systems proactively to ensure that the feature is ready for use once it hits production.
- [ ] Have a go/no go meeting with the team to ensure that the feature is ready for use and signed off by each discipline and your DEPO/OCTO contact. During this meeting, you'll need to:
  - [ ] review the plan with your DEPO/OCTO representative.
  - [ ] review the release plan with your team.

## Step 3: Production rollout

### Define the Rollback process

Our PM and PO will monitor analytics. If something goes wrong, the engineering team will be on standby to disable the flippers and fall back to v1 of the form.

Rollback plan:
1. PM and PO monitor analytics for issues (failed submissions, traffic irregularies, unexpected errors).
2. Engineering disables flipper which hides v2 of the form.
   - Users with in-progress v2 sessions will finish out their v2 session. If they start a new session, they will be redirected to v1.
   - New users will be directed to v1 of the form.

## Phase I: LAUNCH
The 686/674 form flow underwent significant updates to all pages within the form flow so we do plan on releasing v2 as a phased launch experience. As we will need to have both forms enabled at the same time, if the feature toggle is enabled and the Veteran is to fill out the v2 flow, the v1 form will redirect the Veteran to the v2 flow on the frontend. Form data migration will need to be accomplished on the backend.

## Post-launch Questions

*To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.*

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders?
1. Which assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
1. What technical tasks are needed to clean up (i.e., removal of feature toggles)?
