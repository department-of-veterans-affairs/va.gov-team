## Overview
As outlined in the [intiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/form_updates/Initiative-Brief-686-674-Form-Updates.md), the online 686c/674 form flow is out of alignment with the most recent version of the paper form. The updates associated with this release will add missing fields to the online form, remove depreciated fields, update form components, and address critical accessibility issues within the pages that are getting updated. Updates to the static pages that lead into the form flow may also be needed.

The form updates will be broken into two phases to expidite improvements to the Veteran experience.
- Phase 1 | Launch June 2024
   - Add new fields to 686 and 674 interview-style form on VA.gov
   - Remove depreciated fields from 686 and 674 interview-style form on VA.gov
   - Update pdf versions generated by the 686 and 674 interview-style form on VA.gov
- Phase 2 | Launch Aug/Sep 2024
   - Update all design system components from v1 patterns to v3 patterns
   - Fix high-priority accessibility issues
   - Improve form flow patterns

[Release plan user flow](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1714073866859/62dbc2bda8fa99a2d87d3e5ed9103d99f96b8769?wid=522-1714073889846)

### The phase 2 release plan will need to consider the following use cases:
1. Applications In-Progress
   - Before full release:
      - If the user maintains a single active session, they will complete the old version of the form. If they leave a session and start a new one, they may be directed to fill out the updated version (v2) of the form depending on the level of incremental traffic set for the v2 form (25%/50%/75%100%).
   - After 100% release:
      - If users are in an active session, they will complete the v1 version of the form. If they leave the active session, and log back in after full release, they will be taken back to the intro page of the form and see an info alert stating the form has been updated and they may need to fill out additional info. Their v1 data will appear in the v2 form.
2. Applications Not Started
   - Before full release:
      - Users may be directed to fill out the updated version (v2) of the form depending on the level of incremental traffic set for the v2 form (25%/50%/75%100%)
   - After 100% release
      - Users will complete v2.

| User Type | Flipper Status | Form in Progress | Visible Form | V2 Info Content Displayed | Data Migrated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Authenticated Users | Disabled | No | v1 Form | No | No |
| Authenticated Users | Disabled | Yes, v1 | v1 Form | No | No |
| Authenticated Users | Disabled | Yes, v2 | v2 Form | Yes | No |
| Authenticated Users | Enabled | No | v2 Form | No | Yes |
| Authenticated Users | Enabled | Yes, v1 | v2 Form | Yes | Yes |
| Authenticated Users | Enabled | Yes, v2 | v2 Form | Yes | No |
| No-Auth Users (Pre-100% Release) | N/A | No | v1 Form | No | No |
| No-Auth Users (Post-100% Release)| N/A | No | v2 Form | Yes | No |

### This phase 2 release will include the following components:
1. Form field updates on some pages
2. Form component updates (v1 to v3)
3. High-priority accessibility updates (level 0-2)
4. Info alert on the form information page letting new users or in-progress users who were migrated to v2 know that the form has been updated.
5. Toggle for inforamtion page to show old vs new form instructions. (Confirm this is needed.)
6. Updated confirmation email sent to users confirming their claim submission through VA.gov

## Step 1: Development (UPDATE)

You'll need to create a feature toggle (or two) for any moderately or significantly changing feature. Follow the [best practices for creating feature toggles](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/feature-toggles).

List the features toggles here.

| Toggle name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| burial_form_enabled | Enable the burial form |
| burial_form_v2 | vets-website v2 toggle |
| va_burial_v2 | vets-api v2 toggle |

## Step 2: Validation

Since we use a [continuous delivery](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/deployment-process) model, once code is in the `main` branch, it will be deployed that day. 

Before enabling your feature toggle in production, you'll need to:

- [ ] Follow [best practices for QA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/qa-and-accessibility-testing).
- [ ] Have your team perform as much validation in staging as possible. Validation may be challenging for some teams and systems due to downstream requirements, but the staging system should mimic the production system as much as possible.
- [ ] Work any downstream or dependant systems proactively to ensure that the feature is ready for use once it hits production.
- [ ] Have a go/no go meeting with the team to ensure that the feature is ready for use and signed off by each discipline and your DEPO/OCTO contact. During this meeting, you'll need to:
  - [ ] review the plan with your DEPO/OCTO representative.
  - [ ] review the release plan with your team.

## Step 3: Production rollout
<!--
### Do I need a staged rollout?

**Yes**, a staged rollout is required unless you can confidently answer "yes" to all of the following:

- This change does not add substantial new functionality to VA.gov
- This change does not impact user flows through tasks
- This change does not affect traffic to backend services

*Example*: a change to a page's text content **could skip** staged rollout

*Example*: a minor visual redesign to a page that doesn't affect user flows **could skip** staged rollout

*Example*: adding a new field to an existing form **could skip** staged rollout

*Example*: a new feature on an existing application that creates new backend traffic **needs staged rollout**

*Example*: a significant change to how users navigate an existing form **needs staged rollout**

*Example*: a feature that will route significantly more users (and therefore more backend traffic) to an existing application **needs staged rollout**

#### Exceptions

Currently, [feature toggles](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/platform/tools/feature-toggles/) are the primary tool VSP provides for facilitating staged rollout. If feature toggles don't work for your use case, you can request an exception from staged rollout in Staging Review.

| Feature type | Possible with feature toggles? |
| --- | --- |
| New feature in existing application | Yes |
| New application | Yes |
| Static content changes | Doable but tricky |
| URL redirects | No |

DEPO VSP / OCTO leads can approve other exceptions to this requirement.

### Define the Rollback process

Our PM and PO will monitor analytics. If something goes wrong, the engineering team will be on standby to disable the flippers and fall back to v1 of the form.

Rollback plan:
1. PM and PO monitor analytics for issues (failed submissions, traffic irregularies, unexpected errors).
2. Engineering disables flipper which hides v2 of the form.
   - Users with in-progress v2 sessions will finish out their v2 session. If they start a new session, they will be redirected to v1.
   - New users will be directed to v1 of the form.

### Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)
(Description)

#### Planning

- Desired date range or test duration: TBD
- Desired number of users: 6 full submissions of the min, max, and overflow scenarios outlined in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qFzoRny9uDHegSh1CemWP_FhL606ki54Z-Go-04jOUA/edit?usp=sharing) (scenarios tab)
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: VFS team members, OCTO stakeholders, and VBA stakeholders will test
- How you'll conduct the testing: using test users and validating the staging form payload submissions with downstream stakeholders
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: N/A

#### Results

- Number of users: 6
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: See [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pKE5rvUgoJe0vkh06W4EVCKL5ygXxgajCRa3nVTLARQ/edit?usp=sharing). Several issues were identified as Platform-level issues that are outside the scope of our team to fix. We will work with the Platform Team to fix.
- Was any downstream service affected by the change?: Yes, as part of this form update, we also migrated the form payload from the depreciated Central Mail API to the Benefits Intake API.
- Types of errors logged: [FILL_IN]
- Any changes necessary based on the logs, feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? [PICK_ONE]: yes/no
- If yes, what: [FILL_IN] with ticket numbers

### Phase II: Staged Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)

We recommend that the rollout plan has five stages, each increasing the number of Veterans. This plan is a strongly recommended guideline but should only be deviated for precise reasons.

## Post-launch Questions

*To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.*

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders?
1. Which assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
1. What technical tasks are needed to clean up (i.e., removal of feature toggles)?
