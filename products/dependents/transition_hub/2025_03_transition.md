# 686c/674 Transition Hub

**Updated March 2025**

> The purpose of this transition document is to outline the current state of 21-686c, 21-674, and 21-0538 forms' product development. It serves as a "front door" to documentation and resources collected during the course of product design and development from March 2023 through March 2025. Included are links to more specific transition hubs where you can find direct links to resources and references used during design and development. These Transition Docs are "point in time" documents, and may not reflect current progress, deployments or upcoming efforts.

## Product context 
- The online **21-686c** form allows Veterans to add or remove dependents to/from their VA disability compensation or pension benefits. If a Veteran is supporting a dependent, they may be eligible to receive additional disability or pension compensation.
   - [About VA Form 21-686c (Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents)](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-686c/)
   - Launched on VA.gov: May 2018 with 674 form flow
   - 686c annual submission volume: 342,750 (2024)
   - Current pdf version on VA.gov: AUG 2022
- The online form flow for the **21-674** form (Request for Approval of School Attendance) is integrated with the 21-686c form. The 674 form is used to extend benefits to a Veteran’s child if they are between 18-23 years old and attending school full time. Normally, a minor child dependent ages out of benefits when they turn 18 unless a 674 is filed indicating the child is in school.
   - [About VA Form 21-674 (Request for Approval of School Attendance)](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-674/)
   - Launched on VA.gov: May 2018 with 686 form flow
   - 674 annual submission volume: 73,300 (2024)
   - Current pdf version on VA.gov: OCT 2021
- The **21-0538** (Mandatory Verification of Dependents) is a paper form that is used to verify the dependents on a Veteran's disability or pension benefits. Veterans are required to submit this paper form every 8 years. This team was tasked with turning the form into a lightweight online tool. Preliminary research on a lightweight prototype was completed in Feb/Mar 2025. The mvp protype only captured a "no changes to my dependents" answer (vast majority of responses).
   - [About VA Form 21-0538 (Mandatory Verification of Dependents)](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-0538/)
   - 113,928 paper forms submitted per year
   - The longer term goal is to add the ability for Veterans to indicate, "yes, I have changes to my dependents) and more fully integrated it into the 686/674 form flow.
- The **21P-509** (Statement of Dependency of Parent) is currently a paper form used to add dependent parents to disability or pension benefits. It may eventually need to be integrated into the online form flow of 686/674
   - [About VA Form 21P-509 (Statement of Dependency of Parent)](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21p-509/)

### Product Goal
Make the online dependent experience as easy to complete and cohesive as possible, while ensuring that Veterans verify dependent information on a regular basis and that submissions are reliable and processed as quickly as possible.
- The long term goal is that Veterans can come to the dependent management area of VA.gov and add/remove their dependents (21-686c), request approval of their school-aged child (21-674), verify their dependents (21-0538), and add their dependent parent (21P-509) all within a single form flow experience. Many of these forms ask for the same information, so there is a lot of opportunity to leverage a single form experience to prefill information and reduce the burden on the Veteran to manage their dependents.

## Roadmap
### Done (recently)
- Updated form flow to produce Aug 2022 version of pdf on Aug 13, 2024.
- Send [674-only claims from VA.gov directly to RBPS](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/97875) rather than flagging them for manual processing on March 21, 2025.
- Completed concept testing for the [MVP prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/bvj72inycD0iZkuCbjYTWL/Dependent-Verification-MVP?node-id=59-960&t=yWIz3IUP2uFChYib-0) of dependent verification tool. Intent is to capture “no changes to dependents” through an online tool on VA.gov and submit a 21-0538 (dependent verification) form on the Veteran’s behalf.
- [Met with CAIA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/84170) in January 2025 to discuss [IA of dependent experience](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1709582312238/ae3de21fd188beba8c28668ee37a31841c6203bf?wid=91-1737736233308) and [improvement opportunities](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1709582312238/ae3de21fd188beba8c28668ee37a31841c6203bf?wid=522-1737736233308).

### Now
- Test and release [updated form flow](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/1292) to use v3 design system components, improve user experience, and comply with current accessibility requirements. See general testing guidelines [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/form_updates/general_testing_plan.md).
   - The form updates have gone through a final [Collaboration Cycle staging review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/74059) stage gate, and there are a [handful of launch-blocking issues](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/1253) that need to be addressed (see launch-blocking label).
   - The initial release was postponed due to ongoing issues with some of the new v3 design system components, but workarounds were implmented where needed. Given the time invested in fixing or working around the component limitations, we ran out of runway to complete end-to-end testing with OBI/RBPS stakeholders, so the release was delayed. We have developed workarounds for the following issues, and tickets have been submitted to fix the component-related issues at the Platform level:
      - [#103781](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103781): Validation error
      - [#103778](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103778): Remove additional info (this workflow needs to be reviewed)
      - [#103783](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103783): Button imposter component
      - [#103784](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103784): File input imposter component
  - Post release, an [accessibility audit needs to be requested from the VA 508 Office](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/request-support-from-the-va-508-office#RequestsupportfromtheVA508office-AuditRequest). This is required even if no accessibility issues were found during the Staging Review. Once the audit has been requested, add a comment to the [collab cycle ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/74059) with the 508 ticket number and close the collab cycle review ticket.
- Build out [MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/dependency_verification/initiative-brief-dependent-verification-tool.md#whatre-you-building) of dependent verification tool to capture “no changes to dependents” and auto-submit a 21-0538 form. ([milestone for this project](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/1409)).
- Add claim submission in-progress email and update confirmation email to align with requirements from Zero Silent Failure initiative. Seperate existing confirmation email into seperate emails for each claim submission type. ([milestone for this project](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/1420))
- [Migrate to RESTful APIs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/91282)
- [Migrate](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/83272) off of depreciated document upload API.

### Next
- Test pension-related [income questions and API](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/1524). This would enable RBPS to process pension-related dependency claims automatically (right now they're off-ramped for manual review).
- [Prevent multiple EPs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/25030). When a 686 and 674 claim are submitted at the same time, VA.gov generates two EPs, which then have to be manually merged downstream.
- Code modularization (no tickets yet)
- Auto fill spouse and dependent information ([discovery ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/102343))
- Determine why submission and saved dates do not match MyVA. ([submission date](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/101056) and [saved date](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/101040))
- Work with Infrastructure and Arcitecture team to [improve findability of forms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/102744) (initial AI work in [GitHub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/ia-design-docs/verify-dependents.md) and [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1689863079145/5b97ba9ea11077f983f3413167f6324f11aa04a8))
- Create [analytics dashboards](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/102886) to better understand user and form behavior
- [Test and review design](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/103842) of the pension-related income questions in the 686/674 for flow. These questions were added when the forms were originally launched on VA.gov, but never turned on in production. They capture the answers needed for the pension line of business to adjust changes in benefits.

### Future
- Add the ability to [download a pdf of the submitted claim](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1237/views/13?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=ND%2FD+ZSF+%7C+Stage+5+%28Confirmation+page+full+update%29) from the confirmation page (as part of the Zero Silent Failure initiative). This work was put on hold until another team implements a solution.
- Work with MyVA to update the [status card](https://design.va.gov/patterns/help-users-to/stay-informed-of-their-application-status#status-in-myva) shown to claimants as part of the Zero Silent Failure initiative.
- Integrate dependent management into the MyVA profile experience. ([milestone for this project](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/102346))
- Integrate dependent parent form (21-509) into 686/674 form flow on VA.gov. ([discovery ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/102348))
- Expand functionality of dependency verification tool (21-0538) to capture "yes, I have changes to my dependents). (No existing tickets, but there is a [general milestone](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/1409).)
- Explore reminders for life events ([discovery ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/102351))
