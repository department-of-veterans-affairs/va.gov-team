# Engineering Overview

## Dashboards
-  TBD

## Technical Diagrams
- An architecture diagram, showing involved systems and how they connect.
- A sequence diagram for non-trivial flows (i.e. more than a single round-trip call from frontend → vets-api → VA Backend) showing the ordered flow of data and operations between systems.

## Endpoints
- TBD

## Code Repository
- [Vets-API](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api)
- [Vets-Website](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website)
