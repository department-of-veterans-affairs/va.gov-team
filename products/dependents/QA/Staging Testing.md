# Process for Testing 686/674 Form Updates with VBA Stakeholders

## PDF Updates
([example ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/96740))

### Testing should confirm:
- The pdf generated by VA.gov matches what the user entered on the front end
- The date stamped in the upper-right date stamp field and the signature line represents the date the claim was submitted (not the date the pdf was generated -- sometimes they can be different dates)
- Data that is too long for the field on the pdf overflows as expected to the last page

### Instructions for Testing
1. Start a new thread in the [OBI+VA.gov Teams testing channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A7Dew_Vfcs2z_BJK7XVhgWbaSQfJej2UO13Kq51sebX81%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=954a8eef-0c1f-4129-8eea-94149c3fef97&tenantId=e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf)
   - Example:
     > VA.gov is preparing to launch an updated version of the 21-686/674 interview-style form that will include [list types of updates here]. We anticipate starting testing in **about a week** and we'll be providing pdf+json files for review and submitting testing claims using test data in VA.gov's staging environment. From there, **we'll need support** to validation that the test submissions passed through BGS, VBMS, and RBPS as expected. (Reminder: VA.gov does not have a pre-prod testing environment with prod data similar to ProdTest.)
2. Generate minimum, maximum, and overflow pdf scenarios.
3. Product Manager or backend engineer will post the pdfs and json files to the OBI [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A7Dew_Vfcs2z_BJK7XVhgWbaSQfJej2UO13Kq51sebX81%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=954a8eef-0c1f-4129-8eea-94149c3fef97&tenantId=e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf) and in [mvp-686-674-staging-pdf](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fvaabdvro%2FShared%20Documents%2FDependents%20Management%2Fmvp%2D674%2Dstaging%2Dpdfs&viewid=3fa7a9bb%2D3d4e%2D44c2%2Db93f%2D629268a08e72&OR=Teams%2DHL&CT=1717096760601&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI0OS8yNDA0MTEyMjMxNSJ9) SharePoint folder.
4. The following individuals should be tagged in the Teams thread to validate the pdf and json files. Note, on the initial post, confirm that this is still the testing group that should be included (bc some are contractors):

## Form Updates
([example ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/96274))

### Testing should confirm
- The pdf generated and received by the VA matches what the user entered on VA.gov.
- Claims are [off-ramped by VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/RBPS-offramp-scenarios.md) for manual processing (as expected)
- The json data received by RBPS can be processed as expected:
   - Processed automatically by RBPS
   - Off-ramped from VA.gov for manual processing ([as expected](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/RBPS-offramp-scenarios.md))

### Instructions for testing:

1. Start a new thread in the [OBI+VA.gov Teams testing channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A7Dew_Vfcs2z_BJK7XVhgWbaSQfJej2UO13Kq51sebX81%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=954a8eef-0c1f-4129-8eea-94149c3fef97&tenantId=e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf)

4. Capture screenshot of review page BEFORE submission and save in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wknuOQG2Euqt66mYRqQvH4Gje_LiW4-Z?usp=drive_link). Use submission date + GUID as file name (e.g. 2024.04.05_cb2298e8-8411-495c-9b58-586288eeaf95).
5. Capture claim confirmation # (GUID) from confirmation page and add to submission tab in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mBEZJ7gORRMpsFVUAXr5wi5NYH-CaKc5njb4EJKZtfo/edit?usp=sharing).
