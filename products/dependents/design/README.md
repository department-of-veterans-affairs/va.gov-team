## Roadmap
### Done (recently)
- Completed [concept testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/dependents/research/2025-02-dependents-verification-mvp-research) for the [MVP prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/bvj72inycD0iZkuCbjYTWL/Dependent-Verification-MVP?node-id=59-960&t=yWIz3IUP2uFChYib-0) of dependent verification tool. Intent is to capture “no changes to dependents” through an online tool on VA.gov and submit a 21-0538 (dependent verification) form on the Veteran’s behalf.
     - Understand the Veteran’s mental model of dependent verification on VA.gov and their expectations for finding tools and completing tasks around dependent management.
     - Validate the usability of our 0538 email notification and va.gov designs to determine whether they provide a clear path for verifying and updating dependents, and identify any areas where they might impede the Veteran's ability to complete tasks.
     - Understand how the flow, designs, and copy impact the Veteran’s understanding of the task.
- [Met with CAIA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/84170) in January 2025 to discuss [IA of dependent experience](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1709582312238/ae3de21fd188beba8c28668ee37a31841c6203bf?wid=91-1737736233308) and [improvement opportunities](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1709582312238/ae3de21fd188beba8c28668ee37a31841c6203bf?wid=522-1737736233308).

### Now
- Review [findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/research/2025-02-dependents-verification-mvp-research/2025-02-dependents-verification-mvp-research-findings.md) from concept testing.
- Make a plan of action on how to move forward with the verification MVP (Which recommendations to appy, if any).
  - Update [proposed user flow](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1709582312238/ae3de21fd188beba8c28668ee37a31841c6203bf?wid=0-1716382766670). 
  - Update [designs](https://www.figma.com/design/bvj72inycD0iZkuCbjYTWL/Dependent-Verification-MVP?node-id=1971-20399&t=8NhK9KE2CwRsZjMu-1) (most recent verification MVP designs are out-of-date as changes were made primarily to the [research prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/bvj72inycD0iZkuCbjYTWL/Dependent-Verification-MVP?node-id=2809-74335&t=8NhK9KE2CwRsZjMu-1) leading up to and following the concept testing study.
  - Update or create new launch plan (refer to [dependency verification README](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/dependents/dependency_verification) for context, goals, and KPIs).
- Review plan and proposed updates with key stakeholders:
  - OCTO leadership
  - VBA leadership
  - Engage Platform Governance to ensure updates are compliant with the VA Design System
  - Engage Content & IA team to confirm content meeds platform standards and coordinate addition context for dependent verification to key pages that the Content & IA team owns
  - Engage the sitewide accessibility team to ensure updates are meeting accessibility standards
  - Review with engineers to confirm technical feasibility
- Create a scenario testing and design match document to test designs once built in staging (see example from [686c/674 V2 updates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hd9pWDVzfduV2UsYF7eUqXJ_PShJeo5yLrgwvZJ5Nak/edit?usp=sharing)) 

### Next
- Test live MVP with Veterans (see [recommendations for future research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/research/2025-02-dependents-verification-mvp-research/2025-02-dependents-verification-mvp-research-findings.md)
- Work with VBA partners (or whoever owns the notification) to coordinate dependent verification notification.
  - Create a timeline for how to align notification launch with MVP launch.

### Future
- Explore long-term vision recommendations from research
  - Work with Product and VBA partners to understand how use of [the online tool to add or remove dependents](https://www.va.gov/view-change-dependents/add-remove-form-21-686c-v2/introduction) (VA Forms 21-686c and/or 21-674) can generate a Mandatory Verification of Dependents (VA Form 21-0538)
  - Explore integrating the opportunity to verify dependents into the 686c/674 online tool form flow.
  - Explore quick add/remove/re-add using auto-fill where possible from dependent cards on [Your VA Dependents](https://www.va.gov/view-change-dependents/view)
  - Explore information architecture improvements to dependents management on VA.gov
- [Go to future opportunities on Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1692908527043/0da94b7ded52e8a943d798bcb8ae39697c2fb56f?wid=165-1692908552841)
