# Initiative Brief for Benefits and Claims - Dependent Experience Team, Dependency Claims, VA Form 21-686C Military Base Outside the U.S. Address Issues

## Outcome Summary

- Claims are getting rejected due to incorrect entries for mailing addresses on military bases outside the U.S. 
  - Veterans are not notified that their claims have been rejected. 
  - Until recent updates, the VA was not notified of these rejections, either. 
  - Part of a code-yellow project; triggering null claims.

## Discovery

### Assumptions/Risks

Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints2. Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by SVPG's Four Big Risks.

**Value Risks (will people use it):**
- Yes - address is a required field in the form

**Usability Risks (can people figure out how to use it):**
- Our goal is to write error messages that provide clear directions on how to enter correct information for military base addresses outside the U.S.

**[Technical] Feasibility Risks (can we build it with available tech/data):**

- Yes; minor content changes and additional postal code validation
- No expected impact to site performance

**Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints (will there be a positive organizational impact):**
- Improved Veteran experience; reduced rejections due to this error
