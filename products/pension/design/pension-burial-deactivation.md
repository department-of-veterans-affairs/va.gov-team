# Pension & Burial deactivation flows & designs

Designer: [Fiorella](https://github.com/fiorella-io)

## Problem
After interviewing Pension and Burial SMEs we learned that both 527 Pension and 530 Burial forms are so outdated that after anyone submits those digital forms online, they get a letter in the mail telling them that they need to start a new application by paper. 

## Flows
We started by identifying which pages had links to the digital form for each. 
-   [Pages with direct links to each digital form](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1689262813123/cb880912d3f71ef79be0d63d0e61e306d1e6ae31?wid=0-1689360929417)

#### Version 1
-   [Pension flow](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1689262813123/cb880912d3f71ef79be0d63d0e61e306d1e6ae31?wid=0-1690293022229)
-   [Burial flow](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1689262813123/cb880912d3f71ef79be0d63d0e61e306d1e6ae31?wid=0-1690839728770)

#### Final version
-   [Pension flow](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1689262813123/cb880912d3f71ef79be0d63d0e61e306d1e6ae31?wid=0-1691181001222)
-   [Burial flow](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1689262813123/cb880912d3f71ef79be0d63d0e61e306d1e6ae31?wid=0-1691433635538)

## Designs
#### Version 1 - Information pages
We proposed to update all the entry points for each form and have an information alert and copy changes to inform our users that the forms cannot be completed online.
-   Proposed design solution for Pension: [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1689262813123/cb880912d3f71ef79be0d63d0e61e306d1e6ae31?wid=0-1690210488953) | [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/s/12d1e8d4-7495-44b9-a16d-ab27be429ff6/p/60609EFA-720E-41E9-BD03-AB657F277F7F/canvas)
-   Proposed design solution for Burial: [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1689262813123/cb880912d3f71ef79be0d63d0e61e306d1e6ae31?wid=0-1690221334130) | [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/s/12d1e8d4-7495-44b9-a16d-ab27be429ff6/p/585E3A8A-A26C-4FAE-AA62-7446C19E7B55/canvas)

#### Final version - Information pages
After meeting with CAIA, CAIA proposed a new solution to update the least amount of pages. This meant that we would only change the copy to the "How to Apply" pages for both Pension and Burial and redirect all other pages to this page.
-   How to apply page for Pension: [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/s/12d1e8d4-7495-44b9-a16d-ab27be429ff6/p/60609EFA-720E-41E9-BD03-AB657F277F7F/canvas)
-   How to apply page for Burial: [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/s/12d1e8d4-7495-44b9-a16d-ab27be429ff6/p/585E3A8A-A26C-4FAE-AA62-7446C19E7B55/canvas)

#### Final version - Review pages for in-process applications
For users with in-progress applications, we decided to keep all the information they entered so far and give them a read-only view of their form that they can use as a reference when starting their application on paper. 
-   Pension review page: [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/s/12d1e8d4-7495-44b9-a16d-ab27be429ff6/a/MmLK81w)
-   Burial review page: [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/s/12d1e8d4-7495-44b9-a16d-ab27be429ff6/a/bLoZGjJ)

## Email templates
When the deactivation of both Pension and Burial takes place, we proposed to add a trigger and send an email notification to all in-progress applications. 
We worked closely with the Notify team, gained access to the notify application tool, and created an email template for Pension and Burial.
