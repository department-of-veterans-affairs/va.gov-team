# Pension Redesign: Adding new fields to match the paper form

Designer: [Fiorella](https://github.com/fiorella-io)

## Problem
After interviewing Pension SMEs we learned that the 527 Pension form is so outdated that after anyone submits the form online, they get a letter in the mail telling applicants that they need to start a new application by paper. For phase 1, we proposed to deactivate the form. Now for phase 2, we want to identify the fields that are in the paper form, add these new fields to the digital Pension form, and remove any unnecessary fields from the digital form.
