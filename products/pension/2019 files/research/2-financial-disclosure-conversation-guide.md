# Pensions financial disclosure form

## Goals

- Goal
  - Does it make more sense to group by people or type of information?
  - Basic usability
- Key questions
  - Does it feel more comfortable to enter all one person’s info at once? Or should we group by information type?
  - Does the additional source UI work for people?


### Methods:
- Screenshare with clickable prototype
- 3-5 participants


### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve.

We’re working on a new version of an Pension application form and we’d like to understand what problems applicants have with the current system.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.

* We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.
  * We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
  * This entire feedback session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
  * We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.
  * If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

In this session, we’d like you to talk to us about your experiences applying for pension benefits. You can just talk about it generally, or if you want to show us anything in particular, that would be fine too!

### Main questions

- Could you tell me briefly a bit about your background?
  - What’s your military background?
  - What if any VA benefits have you used?
- Please imagine needing to disclose financial data as part of applying for a VA pension.

  - Is it clear what we are asking for here?
  - What would you do if you had a source of net-worth that you didn't see listed here?
  - How would you change this form to make it easier to use?
    - Are there things we could add or take away?
    - Would you order it differently?


### Thank-You and Closing
