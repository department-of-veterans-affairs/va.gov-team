# Pensions formative research interviews

For for 21p-527EZ

## Goals

- Find out where the pain points are in the current system
- Are there any things that work well that we should be sure not to break?

## Summary

**Caveat: We didn't get anyone who was literally using the VA pension** (maybe session 3)

But, in general people seem to look for help figuring out what they need to do, and what will happen next. 

People seem confused about what "Pension" means. It seems to get mixed up with both Disability Compensation, and standard retirement pay.

## What worked well

- North Carolina Vet had really easy time with process since a county VA office filled out all the paperwork for him. He just brought in his DD214.
  - Another particiapant wondered why we couldn't pull all the info out of DEERS. Seems a related thought: **“Why do I have to do all this?”**
- ​

## What didn't work well

>  Most people hadn't actually used the 527 form. Many were confused and were referring to disability comp as "pension"

But in general:

- It's hard to know what you are going to need at the begninning
  - It would be nice to have a checklist to work from
  - Especially for spouses that are less familiar with the systems
- People don't know what to expect at the end of the process (while they wait)
- Communication is low
- People seem confused about what "Pension" means. It seems to get confused with both Disability Compensation, and standard retirement pay.


## Methods

- Interviews with Veterans who were ostensibly using the VA pension. 
- 30 minute conversations based on [the conversation guide](2-conversation-guide-pension-process.md)
- 3 participants






## Raw Notes

### Session 1: M.M.

Veteran spouse, husband died from brain tumor after serving for 38years. She has been unsuccessful in obtaining money from his pension.

- She applied to VIC and application was denied, multiple times
  - **The process: filling out paperwork and the VA would send it back stating that more info is needed, got denied**

Filled out the 21-0966 form (Intent to file form)

- DAV person has the other forms


- Filled out the "29-01" **[Not sure what this was referring to]** 
  - Supplemental claims for compensation form, that she found online via VA.gov. She came across the forms by entering ‘to file’ in the search on the VA.gov site

- **The form didn’t say anything specific but the VA continues to say that more info is needed**


- Her husband was a Vietnam Vet, he got a brain tumor while in the service and was told to wait until the brain tumor was on ‘the list’, they were told that everything would be explained to them step-by-step


- She has the Nexus letter, which is the form a doctor who took care of the patient would sign off on to say the patient got a brain tumor from the Vietnam spraying Agent Orange. (Dioxins don’t cause brain tumor cancer)
- **Widows are unaware of what they need to do or the info they need in order to receive their spouse’s pension.**
- She started a FB group for Vietnam Vets with Neoblastoma

### Session 2: S.L.

- 28 years and a month of active duty, retired in 2013, transferred her GI Bill to her children
- She was able to appeal her disability, since her daughter was full-time 
- She believe that her disability pay is her pension pay from the VA and she receives money form her retirement pay
- There wasn’t anything easy or pleasant about the process
  - **It felt like you just needed to know how it worked, there wasn't a good way to find out**
- Process was kind of slow, everything has to be done on paper
- Didn't check to see her pension went through **until 6 months has passed** b/c the VA was back logged at the time, it took a matter of a few months (that summer)
- What she wished she knew (framework of benefits)
- **Virtual or paper notification to see if things were complete (like a checklist)**

### Session 3: T.C.

- Vietnam Vet, computer literate
- The pensions process was “straight forward, some of the forms are on VA.gov”
- There was no follow up once he turned in his documentation
- Was walked through the process of filling the form out

**"Some Vets don’t know where to find the info or how to use a computer"**

Used DD214- SE15 (Veteran preferences)
