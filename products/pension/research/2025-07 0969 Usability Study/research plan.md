	# Research Plan for Pension Team, Digitizing 21P-0969, July 2025

## Background üèóÔ∏è
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Since relaunching the web-based version of VA Form 21P-527EZ in January 2024, the Pension and Burials team has shifted its focus to identifying opportunities to further improve the online filing experience for Veterans. One of these opportunities for improvement is digitizing the 21P-0969 (also known as the Income and Assets Statement) which supports claims for Pension or Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. This initiative was transferred from the Veteran Facing Forms team to the Pension and Burials team in April 2025. This study aims to validate the designs of the digitized form and identify any gaps or pain points to be addressed for 0969 Improvements currently scheduled for Q1 FY26 on the Pension team roadmap.**
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**There are use cases for both authenticated or unauthenticated.**
  
`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**When a Veteran is instructed to complete form 0969 as part of the pension application process, a streamlined digital experience is not currently available, defaulting instead to a PDF form. The 0969 form contains fourteen sections requiring detailed personal and financial data. When Veterans must complete both the 0969 and the 527EZ together, the risk of fatigue and confusion increases. This initiative intends to reduce that fatigue and confusion through up-front questions and thoughtful design that provides a more efficient and clearer path through the 0969 form that reduces the overall burden.**

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

<details><summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed. </summary>

`Objective 1:  VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

`Objective 2: OCTO‚Äôs platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.`

> - **Key Result 1:** 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total error rates in our platforms by 50% compared to Q4 2024, towards a goal less than 1% per endpoint.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of VA employees have access to a valuable Generative AI tool to help with their work.
> - **Key Result 4:** Each of our platforms* and tools increase the number of non-OCTO built capabilities or non-OCTO users by 50%. (*excluding mobile)

## Research Goals ü•Ö	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Assess initial comprehension and mental load while engaging with the form.**

`2.` **Evaluate interaction with the ‚ÄúList and Loop‚Äù model for income and assets.**

`3.` **Test clarity of labels, categorization, and task completion across steps.** 
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**Validate designs of the digitized form and identify usability issues or comprehension gaps.** 

**Identify additional opportunities to improve 0969 post-MVP.**

---

### Research questions

*Assess Initial Comprehension and Mental Load*

**`1.`Do users feel overwhelmed by the introduction page content?**

**`2.`Do they read, skim, or skip the onboarding information?**

**`3.`Do they understand what the form will ask of them before proceeding?**



*Evaluate Interaction with the ‚ÄúList and Loop‚Äù Model for Income and Assets*

**`4.`Do users understand they are entering individual items into a repeatable list structure?**

**`5.`Is the repeated flow of questions (e.g., asking the same details per entry) intuitive or frustrating?**

**`6.`Do users clearly understand how to add income for multiple recipients and why certain inputs (like "Spouse name") reappear?**

**`7.`Are any expected income types hard to categorize or missing altogether?**



*Test Clarity of Labels, Categorization, and Task Completion Across Steps*

**`8.`Are income and asset categories labeled clearly and understood correctly?**

**`9.`Can users differentiate between property and business assets without confusion?**

**`10.`After submitting the 0969, do users know what comes next (e.g., uploading documents or returning to a different form)?**

**`11.`Are participants confident they‚Äôve included all relevant financial information?**

### Hypotheses

---

**The Veteran will be provided an efficient path through the data collection process through up-front and conditional questions that ease their form filling burden.** 

**Participants are able to complete the 0969 form based on the scenarios provided with minimal friction.** 

**Participants are able to understand the terms used in the form and are able to answer all questions asked of them.** 

**Participants express that they would prefer to use this form over a paper version in a real-life scenario.** 

---
  
## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è

</details>

**For this study, we will be facilitating semi-structured interviews with Veterans based on a mock profile provided. We will utilize a combination of open-ended questions and conversation stimuli in the form of a high-fidelity prototype of proposed designs for a specific 0969-related scenario in a digitized format.**

## Recruitment üéØ	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

### Recruitment approach
Due to past experience recruiting hard-to-reach Veterans in the past, we would like to partner with Perigean to partner closely, finalizing exact criteria based on the screener outcomes. The research team would also like to make final determination regarding who is invited to the study with Perigean input. 

### Recruitment criteria

**Intro included below should be included with screener:**

*We are seeking to create an easier and more streamlined way to collect complex financial information for Veterans and their loved ones when they apply for benefits, such as Veterans Pension.*

*Due to the nature of this research, we ask that participants meet specific criteria related to their annual income and other personal or financial details. This information will only be used for screening purposes and will never be shared outside the study.* 

*You will not be required to disclose personal financial details during the sessions. Instead, you will be given a fictional profile to use as you complete an online form as part of evaluating the experience.* 

**Screener start:**

Are you 65 years or older? 
* Yes 
* No (reject)

Please select the annual income that applies closest to you from the list below:

* $80,000 or more

Have you ever applied for a mortgage for a home or business? 
* Yes
* No (preferred recruit)
