# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[MODERATOR NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about making updates to financial information.


Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. <mark>**Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**</mark>
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (for example, 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

‚û°Ô∏è **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

We‚Äôll start with a few high level questions about your past experiences applying for benefits with the VA before moving into the prototype.

1. Have you ever applied for benefits with the VA that required you to share financial information? 

**- If yes:** Can you briefly walk me through the process of applying?
  * What resources did you use to complete the application (i.e. accredited representative, personal networks, VA.gov, Google, etc)?
  * Were there any questions or concerns you had gathering or reporting financial information as you completed the application?
  * How long did it take to fill out the forms approximately?
  * Did you receive any development letters related to financial information after you submitted? If so, how did you try to respond?

**- If no:**  If you were to apply for benefits, to what extent would you expect to share financial information? 
* To better understand general attitudes, I wonder if there is anything that makes you feel more or less comfortable sharing financial information - even in a non VA setting? 
* What level of detail would you expect to have to share when applying for benefits? 
* What resources might you use to complete the application if you were to apply? 
* How long do you expect it might take to fill out the necessary forms?
