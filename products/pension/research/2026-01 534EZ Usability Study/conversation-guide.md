## Intro

Thanks for joining us today\! My name is \[NAME\] and \[NOTETAKER NAME\] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. We will get to them in a minute but first: 

Today we're going to talk about applying for survivors benefits, like Survivors Pension and Dependency Indemnity Compensation.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.  
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.  
* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.  
* I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**  
  * **If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.  
  * **If yes:** Admit observers.  
  * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)  
  * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

### Consent to record

* **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.  
  * **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  
* **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand survivors of Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions like this. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what survivors go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.  
  * **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand survivors' experiences?**  
  * If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

*After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.*

## User Tasks

### Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says Share (on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click More...) or Share Screen (on computer, button is green).
    - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
    - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.
- iPad: Broadcast screen
- Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:
    - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? [Give mouse control--doesn't work w/iPhones] Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## First Task: Wayfinding

- First we’re going to look at the VA home page at this URL: [staging.va.gov](https://staging.va.gov/)
- If you wanted to learn more about survivors benefits, what would you do first on VA.gov?  
    - Prompt: How would you go about finding this specific form on the VA.gov site?
    - Note what they would use*: Google / VA.gov / key words looking/searching for: _______________________
- Do you understand the difference between Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), Survivors Pension, and Accrued Benefits?
    - If N: can you show me where you would go to find that information?

***The new test form is not especially searchable/findable yet on staging, so they may demo their approach - but reassure them that it may not be effective on the test site. So your results here may not actually surface the form - but I’m interested in how you would go about looking for it** 

## Second Task: Open form

Let's suppose that your search (Google/VA.gov) led you to the web page that I'm going to show you. I'd like you to try to use it as if you were applying for VA benefits. As you work, please share your feedback while you're doing that. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see, any questions that you have, and how you feel about what you're doing. I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to \[dictate/put into the Zoom chat\] for you to use: [https://staging.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/apply-for-dic-survivors-pension-accrued-benefits-form-21p-534ez/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/apply-for-dic-survivors-pension-accrued-benefits-form-21p-534ez/introduction) (Use a bit.ly URL!)

Did you get the link?

* If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)  
* If link doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)

**Please look over the section under “Follow these steps to get started.” Do the steps make sense to you?** 

## Third Task: Go through questions in form

I want to make sure that you feel comfortable, so please know that you don’t have to stick to your real-life situation when answering any of the following questions. If it feels easier, you’re welcome to create a fictional scenario or adjust the details in any way that works for you. **Our goal is to test how the system works and make sure each question is clear**, we’re not testing your specific answers.

Please try to **talk aloud** about what you're thinking and what you plan to do BEFORE selecting anything.

(RECORD all feedback on questions and if they get an alert to provide a supporting document)

- If you had to stop and come back to the form, would you know how to save your progress and return?

*Note: This form uses conditional logic, certain questions don’t appear on every flow. The following steps highlight key pages where we could prompt participants for feedback.*

Let’s go on, and just talk through your thought process as you go. 

* Intro screen  
* Step 1: Veteran info  
* Step 2: Claimant info

        * How does the wording of these questions feel to you?  
      * Previous marriages  
        * (Throughout flow) How do you feel about the amount of detail being requested here?  
        * (Throughout flow) Does providing this information raise any concerns for you?  
        * If married at time of death, on “When and where did your marriage end?” pages:  
          * What information would you enter for these fields?  
          * How does the wording of this question feel to you?  
  * *Dependents will see dependent section only*  
    * (Intro page) In your own words, who does the form consider a 'dependent' for this section?  
* Step 5: Claim info

    * On a scale of 1-5, how certain are you that this specific DIC type is the correct benefit for your situation?  
    * What might be unclear to you, if anything?  
  * Treatment list and loop  
    * If you were completing this at home right now, would you have this information handy, or would you have to pause the application to find it?  
* Step 6: Financial info

    * Please tell me about what you see here.  
    * What information, if any, stands out to you?  
    * What would you do now?  
  * Income and assets  
    * Looking at the information on this page, are there any items you own that you are unsure about including as an asset? You don’t have to tell me what they might be, just a simple “yes” or “no” is fine.   
    * Is there anyone that you aren't sure whether to include in this total?
    * If you accidentally entered a wrong number, how would you go about correcting it? (Observe error recovery.)
  * Gross monthly income   
    * (On intro page) After reading the note, how would you decide which income sources to include or exclude?  
    * (On summary page) How comfortable would you feel submitting this income information as it stands right now?  
  * Care and medical expenses  
    * (On intro pages) Are there any costs you've paid that you’re unsure about including here? Why?  
    * (On intro pages) If you weren't sure if an expense qualifies, is there enough information on this screen to help you decide, or would you look elsewhere?  
    * (On summary pages) How certain are you that you haven't missed any eligible expenses?  
    * (At the end of both sections) Is there an expense you've actually paid that doesn't seem to fit into these categories?

3. What would you like to change or add?
4. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?

## Consent to use video clips

* I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
  * If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

## Thank-You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans and their families.

Thanks\! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day\!

# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies).
