     # Research Plan for Bio-Huntridgelabs, VA Form 21P-534EZ (Application for DIC, Survivors Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits), Jan 2026

## Background 🏗️
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

The current process for surviving spouses and children to apply for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), Survivors Pension, and accrued benefits using VA Form 21P-534EZ requires the manual submission of the form and numerous physical supporting documents, such as death and marriage certificates. VA staff must then manually review and process these submissions. This intensive manual labor results in long wait times for benefit delivery, creating an added burden for grieving families during a difficult period.

Our objective is to modernize this experience by moving the form online. This digital transformation will allow surviving family members to complete the application and upload necessary documents electronically, eliminating the need to mail physical papers. This will lead to faster application processing times that will provide applicants with real-time status updates and clear guidance on next steps.
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

The form is available under “Family and caregiver benefits” and offers flexible submission; users can complete it unauthenticated or log in to use an authenticated experience.
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

This is for surviving spouses and children of a Veteran. The online application offers a modernized experience that builds upon the familiar foundation of the traditional PDF form.

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

`Objective 1:  VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

## Research Goals 🥅	

### Goals

`1.` The questions are clear and easy enough for surviving spouses and children to understand and confidently answer.

`2.` The flow aligns with the mental model and expected information-gathering process of surviving family members. 

`3.` Surviving spouses and children can understand which supporting documents they should upload and how to successfully upload them for their claim to be processed faster.
  
### Outcome

Learnings will refine questions and improve other pain points in the form so that family members can provide the data needed to efficiently and effectively process claims. 

### Research questions

`1.` What feedback do family members have on individual questions?

`2.` What feedback do family members have on the entire form flow? (Total number of questions, order questions appear, the amount of information needed)

`3.` Do family members understand what supporting documents are needed for their specific claim scenario?

### Hypotheses

`1.` Surviving spouses and children will find the questions to be clear and easy to understand.

`2.` Family members won't find the number and content of the questions to be overly burdensome.

`3.` Family members will understand what supporting documents are needed to support their claim.
