# Secondary Research

## Synopsis

**Past research indicates that:**

- Some Veterans provided inaccurate or incomplete information due to unclear instructions, demands for excessive detail, or a form flow that didn't feel natural to them.
- Veterans were often surprised by the level of detail required, even after reviewing the form intro page, and questioned where to find necessary information.
- Many Veterans ignored or failed to see critical alerts or calls to action regarding the need for additional evidence or required Veteran action.
- Mistakes on the paper form went unnoticed until manual processing by a VA employee, leading to subsequent delays and the need for the VA to contact the Veteran for a corrected form.
- Past negative experiences with digital uploads and the lack of visibility into post-submission processing led to low trust in the digital process.

**Knowledge gaps:**

- No past research has tested an online version of VA Form 21P-534EZ. This creates an opportunity for our research to:
    - Identify the best way to structure the online form 
    - Correct known struggles with required details and confusing questions
    - Assess whether the online form's features alleviate user anxiety and build trust in the VA submission process
- Limited form research has been conducted with spouses and dependents. This study could offer more insight into this user group.

## Past research

**[Usability Testing, Form 527EZ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/475)** (2024)

- Many participants ignored or missed alerts or calls to action (CTAs) about the need for additional evidence or action required.
- There were multiple areas throughout the form where participants provided inaccurate or incomplete information. Participants provided inaccurate or incomplete information when faced with vague or unclear instructions, when required to provide information for which they did not see relevance or it seemed excessive, or when the form’s flow did not align with how they would enter/provide information.
- Some participants were surprised by the level of detail required in the form and questioned where they would find the information, despite reviewing what was needed to complete the application on the introduction page.

**[Usability Testing, Veteran Form Upload](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/581)** (2024)

- Ease of use is not the only factor Veterans consider when deciding how to submit documents to VA. Veterans who have had bad experiences with digital uploads may continue to hand-deliver them if they run into obstacles. Many Veterans have a negative perception of what happens after submitting a document, form, application, etc. to VA and rely on VSOs.
- The current design does not include enough detail or instruction. Some participants assumed VA.gov would run validation on the uploaded file. In reality, mistakes on the paper form would go unnoticed until a VA employee processes it. At that point, they would have to contact the Veteran and request a new form.

**[Usability Testing, Supplemental Claims MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/176)** (2022)

- Most participants did not know or were unsure of exact dates of treatment and were nervous about entering a specific day. One user struggled with how to enter ongoing treatment.

**[Dependents Verification MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/785)** (2025)

- All participants with dependent children experienced pain points around the 18-year-old to school-age transition.

**[Non-veteran user roles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/65)** (2021)

- This research sought to better understand non-Veteran use cases across VA administrations, like VHA, VBA, and NCA. There may be opportunities to use these definitions within the 534EZ. 
Relevant definitions for the 534EZ are:
    - **A dependent** is someone who has a legal relationship with the Veteran, and is financially dependent on the Veteran. Dependents may or may not also be beneficiaries.
    - **A beneficiary** can be anyone who is the direct recipient of a benefit or service from VA. In VBA, the term is also used to refer to a person the Veteran has named to receive their benefit in the future.
    - **VSO representatives**, claim agents and attorneys are accredited individuals who assist Veterans and their families with claims. VBA and VHA definitions of these roles are consistent.
