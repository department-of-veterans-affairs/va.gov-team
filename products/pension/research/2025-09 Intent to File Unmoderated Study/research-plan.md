# **Research Plan for Pension Benefits, Intent to File Content Study, September 2025**

## **Background**

Since launching intent to file (ITF) functionality to the online pension application, we’ve introduced a front-end experience to help Veterans maximize their potential benefits.

This study aims to evaluate how our application of content design might reduce confusion and instill confidence in their application journey. We hypothesize that these content-related learnings will be broadly applicable to the intent to file experience across VA.gov.

### **OCTO Priorities**

This research supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md):

* Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits

### **Veteran Journey**

This research maps to the following stages of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

* Taking care of self  
* Putting down roots  
* Retiring

## **Research Goals**

The goals of this research study are to:

1. Validate how intent to file messaging might be effective for Veterans in understanding intent to file and its impact on their application  
2. Evaluate the usability of the proposed pattern

### **Outcomes**

We anticipate that this research will inform messaging and design strategy for the intent to file experience across VA.gov \- for the online pension application as well as other forms that automate intent to file submission.

### **Hypotheses**

* Veterans will understand that by starting their application, they may receive benefits back to that date through their intent to file. 

* Veterans will take note of the date their application needs to be completed by (i.e. the intent to file expiration date). 

* When an intent to file cannot be found, Veterans’ next step will be to continue their application, rather than contact VA.

## **Methodology**

For this study, we will conduct recorded, unmoderated usability testing using Optimal Workshop's platform. Participants will be presented with a survey that guides them through a Figma prototype, either flow A or flow B. They will complete the study asynchronously on their own time, on their own devices. 

**Flow A**

1. Successful start: An authenticated Veteran starts a new pension application; a new intent to file is created.  
2. Successful return: An authenticated Veteran returns to an in-progress pension application; an existing intent to file is found. 

**Flow B**

1. Successful start: An authenticated Veteran starts a new pension application; a new intent to file is created.  
2. Failed return: An authenticated Veteran returns to an in-progress pension application; VA can’t check for an existing intent to file. 

**Flow C**

1. Failed start: An authenticated Veteran starts a new pension application; VA can’t check for an existing intent to file.  
2. Successful return: An authenticated Veteran returns to an in-progress pension application; an existing intent to file is found. 

### **Location**

These research sessions will be conducted remotely via Optimal Workshop.

### **Research Materials**

## **Recruitment**

### **Recruitment approach**

Using Perigean to recruit, we would like to schedule 50 Veterans as participants as we aim for 20 complete sessions. Our intended audience is Veterans with a mix of experience on VA.gov so that we might have a range of exposure to intent to file language.

We're looking to recruit participants who will access and complete this study on desktop devices only. This is due to technical challenges with recording sessions when users access Optimal Workshop on mobile devices. 

### **Recruitment criteria**

Primary criteria (must-haves)

* Half of participants **have** filed a compensation or pension claim on VA.gov before  
* Half of participants **have not** filed a compensation or pension claim on VA.gov before
* Able to participate in study using a desktop computer

Demographic must-haves

* At least 50% of participants are over the age of 55

Secondary demographic criteria (nice-to-haves)

* 50% with an identified cognitive disability  
* 30% people of color  
* 25% live in a rural area  
* 25% without a degree  
* 17% with immigrant origins  
* 10% women  
* At least 1 identify as a part of the LGBTQ+ community

Screener Questions:

1. Have you filed a disability compensation or benefits claim on VA.gov before? If you have filed a healthcare claim but not a disability compensation or benefits claim, select “No”  
   1. Response options: yes or no (We are aiming for a \~50/50 split in how this question is answered)  
2. Do you find it difficult to remember or learn new things, focus on a task, or make decisions? We ask this question because we want to make sure that our tools work for people who live with challenges like these.  
   1. Response options: yes or no (We are aiming for at least 25 participants who answer yes)  
3. Do you identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community? We ask this question because we want to make sure the feedback we get from these sessions represents all the people we serve.  
   1. Response options: yes or no (We are aiming for at least 1 participant who answers yes)
