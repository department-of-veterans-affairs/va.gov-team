Research Ops Process
====================

Purpose: If we're doing research with veterans or other users (like family members or VSOs), we need to get it approved before we can start. This is a super simplified guide for how to get that approval

Check the above links for the latest updates, but here's a quick summary of the process of getting research approved by the VA.

Getting approval
----------------

1.  Create a folder for the study in github ([pension example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/pension/research)). Must include:

      a. Research plan (include screener questions)

      b.  Conversation guide

      c.  Stimuli (if using)

2.  Create [research repo ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=new-research-intake.md&title=YYYY-MM+Title+of+Study)

      a.  Assign yourself

      b.  Add the [right labels](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/adding-labels-in-the-research-repository)

3.  Create recruitment ticket

      a.  [Issue template - moderated](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/new?assignees=sstrassberg&labels=recruitment-criteria&template=recruitment+criteria.yaml&title=%5BRecruitment+Request%5D%3A+YYYY-MM+name+of+your+study) | ([example from Janelle F](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/746))

      b.  [Issue template - unmoderated](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/new?assignees=sstrassberg&labels=recruitment-criteria&template=cohorts+recruitment+criteria.yaml&title=%5BRecruitment+Request%5D%3A+Insert+name+of+your+study+here)

4.  Add link to recruitment ticket in repo ticket

5.  Tag Shane Strassberg in the #research-ops channel telling him it's ready for review

Once approved

1.  Change status to "Current"

2.  Shane/Kevin should send a kickoff email w/ Perigean

After research is done
----------------------

1.  Change status to "Complete"

2.  Update stuff so that future researchers can learn from your work

      a.  Add key findings to body of the issueÂ 

      b.  Adjust labels as needed
