Veterans face many challenges learning about, applying for, maintaining, and receiving Veterans Pension benefits. Some examples include lack of information about the program itself, level of complexity and amount of information required to complete the necessary forms, and long processing times. This research aimed to build on learnings previously gathered through Veteran Service Officers (VSO) and identify additional opportunities to improve the experience of Veterans and their family members directly, who have been described as key support people throughout the journey.  

## Research Goals and Questions 

1. Better understand our end users and their experience learning about, applying for, maintaining, and receiving Veterans Pension benefits.
* How do users learn about the Veteran pension benefit? 
* What is their experience applying for the Veteran pension benefit? 
* What is their experience receiving and maintaining the Veteran pension benefit? 
2. Validate existing research findings or identify divergences in what we understand about the Veteran journey that have been gathered during previous research.
* What are the convergences and divergences in the Veteran or family/ friend experience in this study compared to existing research?

## Methodology 

We facilitated semi-structured interviews with pension-eligible Veterans and members of their support network, such as friends or family. We utilized open ended questions with intent to map to key journey phases, including learning about the program, applying, and receiving benefits.     

## Important Note on Study Recruitment 

This study was very difficult to recruit for and resulted in completion of 5 of 14 scheduled sessions. Out of the completed sessions we believe 2 Veterans and 1 friend of family had direct experience applying for Veteran pension; while 2 Veterans believed they were meant to speak about their experience with disability benefits (despite differentiating between the two program types explicitly in the screener, and confirming via phone and email follow up through Perigean). 

There are a number of actions that were taken during recruitment to address the potential challenges we faced including: 

* Requesting to schedule double the amount of sessions needed assuming we might see as much as a 50% cancellation or no show rate.

* Working closely with recruiting partner Perigean on the screener to clearly differentiate veteran pension as separate from other types of programs with explanatory definitions and relevant links. 

* Starting with a more narrow scope, limited to people who could confirm they were receiving veteran pension or could confirm they had actually submitted the application. 

* Revising the screener criteria to include participants who had any experience with the form, even if they had not completed submission, when we encountered difficulty identifying any eligible participants halfway through the recruitment period. 

* Additional follow up to clarify study criteria to confirm experience with veteran pension. 

* Seeking advance confirmation by engaging participants by email, phone call, and text message and providing highly flexible rescheduling options.

One result worth noting is that in a [previous study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024%2002%20Pension%20Usability%20Evaluation/research-findings.md)
seeking to recruit this population, we completed a higher number of sessions (with a no show or cancel rate of one third) but none were confirmed as pension eligible. In this instance, we were able to recruit at least 3 participants that did match the intended criteria. 

During a retrospective with recruiting partner Perigean, it was confirmed that pension-eligible Veterans can be difficult to recruit. Many who are pension eligible are very elderly, have lower tech literacy, and may be living in nursing homes with high levels of assistance. Our Perigean representative believes that there are likely a much lower number of potential participants that are represented in the existing database pool. Alternate recruitment methods may be necessary to ensure a more successful future outcome. We include more on this in the recommendations and next steps section at the end of this document. 

## Key Findings

While some learnings have been gathered through this study, we are unable to draw conclusive insights from such a small sample size. Therefore, we have included our learning questions paired with relevant data below, followed by how this aligns with previous findings from the [VSO report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024-09%20527EZ%20VSO%20Research/research-findings.md) (per research goal #2), and relevant study hypotheses. 

Please note: Study participants mostly were able to speak to earlier phases of the application journey such as learning about the program and experience applying. We were unable to speak directly with a Veteran currently receiving or maintaining pension benefits; therefore, this learning question is not included and is one that should be explored in future studies.

*How do users learn about the Veteran pension benefit?*

**1.** All Veteran participants were already experiencing adverse financial or medical conditions when they began to seek out pension. 
- _P5, Veteran: “I got double pneumonia and covid. Then I broke my ankle… that pretty much put me housebound. It puts a lot more pressure on me to get help from experienced folks. I’m hoping pension will help with some of that.”_
- _P9, Veteran: When I got out the military my paycheck took a drastic cut. When I say drastic, I mean ‘oh God, I don’t know how I’m going to make it.’ I had responsibilities to cover… that’s why I was trying to get this application filled out.”_ 

This aligns with the VSO report and is aligned to the hypothesis: 
Veterans tend to seek out pension benefits when they are already experiencing financial hardship or other adverse conditions.

**2.** All participants learned about the pension program through other Veterans or newsletters distributed by third party organizations; rather than the VA directly. 
- _P11, Friend of Veteran: People are secretive I guess. He didn’t know anything about it and he’s been going to the VA for years. It was only after he talked to his friends who were getting pension and they mentioned something about it._ 
- _P5, Veteran: I stumbled across [program information] through a newsletter instead of anybody mentioning it._ 
- _P9, Veteran: Nobody ever says anything about pension [at the VA]. I was hoping to go through it [and apply] so I can tell other people how to do it right._ 

This aligns with the VSO report and partially supports the hypothesis: 
Veterans learn about pension through word of mouth or communications from both trusted or predatory sources outside the VA (e.g. pension poachers). In our study predatory sources were not discussed. 

*What is their experience applying for the Veteran pension benefit?*

**3.** Some participants felt adequate instruction was provided as they completed the form, but all still felt additional information would be beneficial; especially on what to expect before starting and confirmation of progress at key checkpoints. 
- _P9, Veteran: It's a lot of stuff that I don't know. I don't have the information to whatever. it just caused so many issues and I was almost to the end and I said ‘screw it’… If I were changing anything,  you go through one step, you get a green. That does complete it. Then we move to the next step and you get a green, and then, it's ready to be submitted. So that would help a lot because now I know I've done everything proper._ 
- _P11, Friend of Veteran: I think it would be helpful if [there was] some kind of education tutorial before you even looked at the form. If I was to sit down and look at this the first time, I would be overwhelmed and [wouldn't] have information. And now instead of taking a few minutes to fill out a form, it could take me days because I gotta keep going back to the form to get information to fill it out and get dates and all that stuff and records._
- _P5, Veteran: When I was applying for pension it stops you and says, ‘okay, you need this form,’ there are some questions that could throw somebody off… Do you believe that all these questions actually pertain to you, even though you have to answer them?_

**4.** Length of time to complete the form varied, but seemed to correlate with level of comfort with technology and navigating system complexity (e.g. responding to prompts, gathering documentation, taking required actions, etc). 
- _P5, Veteran: It took 45 minutes going through a lot of the parts that you name and everything else that the VA already has on you is brought up. Then you are asked a series of questions and you know it. If it gives you a place to comment, you can comment there. You had to sit and really think about the questions they send because it, as long as you're not mentally incapacitated, you had to think through it._ 
- _P11, Friend of Veteran: It took me maybe 30 minutes at the most. But that's because I was helping [the veteran]. If I wasn't it'd probably be a lot longer... I'm a younger generation, so I'm used to being on the computer. I wasn't too familiar with the form, but it pretty much was what I thought it would be like. It’s the same thing if you gotta fill a form out online. You just gotta read the steps._ 
- _P9, Veteran: It took me a few days going through the process of getting [information and documentation] or trying it. Then it's just cool, one question after the other after the other. I didn’t know how to answer. I'm like, ‘man, this, here's getting to be aggravation rather than being a benefit.’_ 

**5.** Veteran participants reported a high level of expectation and responsibility to gather documentation and coordinate communications; leading to more burden when compared to other applications. 
- _P9, Veteran: When you compare the pension application to other [forms it’s] so much more in depth. Putting in a claim you put the information, send it off, and then wait 30 days or so to get a response by. But doing the pension is totally different 'cause there's a lot more paperwork and a lot more responsibility on my side that I have to come up with, to show and get approval._
- _P5, Veteran: [I want] an easier way to get the form from the physician or whoever they need to fill it out when the person is applying for pension. Right now, I have to be the one to make that happen. It used to be that you could do things within the VA and they understood what was needed. Since we are getting more and more computerized, if that could be sent it would make that step so much easier. It would make a huge difference to help not only the vet but for the doctor._

These findings partially align with the VSO report and partially support the hypothesis: 
Veterans experience challenges completing the application such as: large amounts of information required for submission, unclear or missing information, and lack of direction on necessary follow-up steps. While barriers to completion and level of complexity posed challenges in the overall experience, some participants were able to navigate this difficulty with less effort or time than others. 

**6.** All participants discussed having others help the Veteran complete the form due to the high amount of information needed or difficulty navigating required actions. 
- _P5, Veteran: My wife has helped me [with the application and related actions]. If I have a question, or if I need to get documentation. Her memory is a bit stronger than mine… and she is the one who talked me into applying._ 
- _P11, Friend of Veteran: I don't know if it was just him [who had all the information ready]. I think his wife was on top of that shit too. He is like semi-blind, she plays a big role in doing things for him. She had all her ducks in a row. So it made my life easier._ 
- _P9, Veteran: When I started going through the internet and start searching and saw the form and everything and then I was telling my other veterans about it and they were like ‘hey, once you get through the process, let us know so you can help us.’ I'm like, ‘shoot, I need help.’_ 

This aligns with findings from the VSO report and supports the hypothesis: 
Veterans often need others to help support completion of the application, such as a VSO, family member, or other advocate. In all instances help was provided or desired for application completion. 


## **Additional Findings**

One Veteran who had experience with the pension application before and after recent changes, identified improved clarity of eligibility criteria online, and a perception of increased transparency with the launch of intent to file. 
- _P9, Veteran: [Eligibility] is broken down [online] telling you this is what you need in order to get this pension, so now that's better… there's no reason why you're wasting your time if you know you're not gonna get approved for it._
- _P9, Veteran: I know in the last few years that it came with that intent to file. When I was submitting that wasn't even in the picture or anything like that. It makes me think maybe things have actually  improved and I should try again._

One friend who assisted the Veteran to apply was able to share their experience responding to development letters post-submission. He did not have difficulty understanding the letter or taking necessary action and was able to assist the Veteran to resolve final items. He was also able to get questions addressed by calling the phone number provided.
- _P11, Friend of Veteran: I think some things were missing on the form. Like some things were dates and some things were missing and then we got that corrected and it was fine after that._
- _P11, Friend of Veteran: There was a phone number that you could call if you had any questions. So, I think I remember calling and asking them about that too... I think it's helpful because it is always great to be able to talk to somebody verbally too, opposed to just digital._

## Recommendations and Next Steps

Based on the study sample size we are not able to provide definitive recommendations related to pension form changes. Instead, we will provide recommendations on how best to both incorporate the low-sample findings we did gather and set ourselves up for more robust findings in the future.   

1. **As we continue to improve the pension form experience, further studies with pension-eligible Veterans may require alternate recruitment methods, in order to address challenges with sign up and cancellation rates.**   

While we have attempted to recruit using standard approaches, they have not proved successful. Therefore, alternative strategies that could be considered include: 

* Partnering with VSOs to observe as they conduct their work and conduct interviews with Veterans and their loved one's post activity to gain insights on early stages of the journey such as trigger moments, learning about the program, and role of support networks.  
* Partnering with Veteran organizations or community hubs to conduct relational recruiting through case managers or other representatives, who have existing relationships with the Veteran population we seek to engage.
    * May also require in person interviews/ activities rather than virtual. 
    * Alternately could be administered asynchronously through these trusted sources to Veterans, if in person research were not possible, and compensation was available for all parties.
* Exploring quantitative approaches to assessing the effectiveness of the pension form and related experiences

One known challenge is administering compensation for study participation. In discussion with Perigean, there is some precedent to have the study researchers conduct recruiting directly and partner with Perigean to administer compensation only. 
   
2. **Learnings gathered so far can provide a foundation for future research, expanding on themes identified to develop insights and guide design recommendations. These findings will be shared with relevant teams to help inform upcoming work.**
