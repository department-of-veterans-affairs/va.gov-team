# Conversation Guide 

## Purpose
This guide contains all possible questions for participating Veterans and advocates. Not all of these questions will be asked, and “probe” questions are listed as optional ways to dig deeper into the overarching question. Researchers may copy and customize this guide to each participant by bolding applicable/priority questions in a separate document.

## Research Goals

- Better understand our end users and their experience learning about, applying for, maintaining, and receiving Veterans Pension benefits.

- Validate existing research findings or identify divergences in what we understand about the Veteran journey that have been gathered so far; especially by proxy in the VSO study.

## Taking a Trauma-informed approach 
During this study, we plan to take a trauma-informed approach by:

- Setting clear expectations at the start of the session by providing research participants with an overview of what the session will entail

- Starting each interview by setting expectations about our scope of practice -- in other words, what we can and can't help with today

- Sharing how we plan to use the recordings and the learnings from our conversation

- Introducing observers/disclosing who else is on the call

- Prioritizing a participant's well being and time over completing our conversation guide

- Making guidance and resources easily accessible for moderators and creating a plan specific to our team about what to do if difficult moments arise in a session

- Explicitly giving participants the option to: turn off their camera, refuse recording, decline to answer any questions they would prefer not to, and end the session at any time

- Allowing space at the end of each session so a participant can ask questions, or sometimes, just vent

- Scheduling a 15 minute debrief with observers after every research session, and scheduling a 30 minute buffer in between research sessions if multiple sessions are scheduled in one day

## Moderator logistics

### Day of session

- [ ] Start a thread in #feedback-backchannel (ex: Proactive Benefits Outreach Exploration P3 starts in 10 minutes :thread: ) and tag your observers for the session
   - Type “observer instructions” in the channel at the beginning of your day of sessions to give your observers tips
   - Also send the instructions to any observers not in slack (like VBA partners)

- [ ] Make sure you mute all notifications (including slack), and close unnecessary applications

- [ ] Have your conversation guide somewhere accessible that the participant cannot see

- [ ] Zoom reminders:
   - Make sure you have [transcriptions enabled](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-create-a-transcript)
   - Make sure to hit record after permission is granted!

- [ ] Keep handy the [Tech set-up checklis](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/tech-set-up-checklist)[t ](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/tech-set-up-checklist)and [Troubleshooting Research Sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr) in case the participant needs help during the session.

- [ ] Review [tips on moderating](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Conducting-Research-Sessions.1958773061.html#ConductingResearchSessions-Moderatingtips)[ ](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Conducting-Research-Sessions.1958773061.html#ConductingResearchSessions-Moderatingtips)and [responding to emergencies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html)

- [ ] Near the end of your session, take a look at the [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel) and see if anyone brought up questions that you can address with your participant.

### Starting the session

- [ ] In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- [ ] In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked.
- [ ] Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- [ ] When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.



## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Name] and I’m a [role] working on VA.gov.

Today we're going to talk about your experience applying for Veterans pension. We are also interested in your experiences first learning about the benefit and after the application was submitted. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you: I have some colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean may have mentioned this, but I wanted to confirm with you before we got started. Are you okay with my colleagues joining us for this session?

*[****If no****: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.]*

*[****If yes****: Admit observers, then allow a pause for short introductions]*

For those of you who just joined, can you come off-camera briefly to introduce yourselves? Thanks!

*[Once complete, **ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session**]*

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. To ensure we're able to touch on all the topics we're hoping to cover, I may occasionally prompt you to keep the conversation on track.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. There are no right or wrong answers and we are not evaluating you.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, please let me know. You will be compensated for the session even if you need to stop.

One last thing. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We document these recordings to ensure we're able to document your opinions accurately. Recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of the comments from the recordings will be attached to your name.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

*[Start recording]*

I have started recording. Just to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

*Goal: Understand relevant background and context for participant experiences.*

**Veteran Participant**

- Before we get started learning about your experiences with applying for Veteran pension, can you share if you have ever applied for any other programs with the VA?

- We will have a chance to go into the specifics but does anything stand out to you as particularly different or similar to your experience learning about or applying for those other programs compared to Veterans pension?

**Veteran Advocate Participant**

- Can you share how you are connected to the Veteran you supported through the application process?

- How often do you assist the Veteran with this type of activity (e.g. learning about programs, filling out forms, etc.)?

## Learning about Pension - 10 minutes

When and how did you first learn about the Veterans pension benefit?

- Were there specific factor(s) that led you to seek out or apply for the pension benefit at the time you did?

- How did you determine this program might be something you (or the veteran) were eligible for?

- What did you already know about the pension benefit before applying?

- What surprised you to learn?

- Did you have any assumptions about the pension benefit or application before applying? 

### *Things to listen for:*

- *What level of understanding did the Veteran or advocate already have and how did they come to know or believe what they did?*

- *What mental models or previous experience are they relying on to determine actions or make sense of next steps?*

- *Were there any people, programs, communications, etc. that were particularly helpful or unhelpful in learning about Veterans pension and applying?*


## Applying for Pension - 15 minutes

There are a few different ways to apply for Veterans pension such as on paper or online. Can you share the method you used in your application? 

- Can you share more about why you used the method you did?

- Can you walk me through the general process you followed filling out the application?

- Was there a person or program that provided support as you completed it?

- Were there areas of the form that were particularly supportive or unsupportive?

- Were there any instances where something was especially helpful or challenging in completing the application?

 
**Additional questions for Veteran Advocate Participant**

- We have heard from others that it is common for a family member or other advocate to fill out the form as if they are the veteran themselves. Would you be open to sharing how you went about it?
   - [if hesitant] I just want to make sure to say your answers will not be linked directly back to you or the veteran in any way. Understanding this aspect of the form experience is helpful for us as we think about how it is actually being used so it matches up better with your expectations and preferences.
 
- [if yes] Did you fill out the form with or without signing in?
   - [if yes to sign in] Do you happen to remember if it was generally at the beginning, middle, or end when you signed in?
   - [if hesitant] For context this is because we have certain features connected to sign in and we want to make sure we are applying them in the best way.

### *Things to listen for:*

- *What factors (specific to the form or otherwise) most contributed to determining which application method was used?*

- *What factors (specific to the form or otherwise) most contributed to successful or unsuccessful completion of the application?*

- Can you share how it felt at this point in the process (e.g. frustrated, confused, motivated for resolution, etc.)
   - *Moderator note: be aware this might be sensitive for the participant to share and we should be listening actively and empathizing as appropriate; but also making sure to not express stronger sentiment than that of the participant.*


**Submitted**

- After you had gone through the process of getting approved, was there anything that was challenging or surprised you about the steps you had to take to actually get your payments?

**If Approved for Pension ****AND**** Time Allows Continue [if not skip to Resume All]**

So far we have been discussing the process and experience with the application itself. In order to better understand the full journey, we hope to get more specific about receiving and maintaining benefits. Some of this might touch on sensitive information like finances. Would you be open to discussing this?

[if no] Thanks for letting me know. We can move on to a few final questions then. **[skip to resume all section]**

[if yes] Thank you. As we go through these, feel free to skip any you prefer not to answer.

- What happened after you got the decision?

- Did you have to do anything or set anything up?

- When did your payments start?

- Did you know what your payments would be?

- Did you ever get overpayments that you had to pay back?

- Do you know of any factors that would change the income you received from Veterans Pension? 

**Additional questions for Veteran Advocate Participant**

- Do you have a role in managing the Veteran’s finances?

- How was the experience making sure pension payments went where they needed to go?

- [If the advocate has proactively shared that the Veteran is deceased] I can imagine it was difficult when the Veteran passed. May I ask a question related to closing down their benefits?

   - *Moderator note: Only ask if **<span style="text - decoration: underline;">the advocate volunteered this info*</span>* and was **<span style="text - decoration: underline;">not overly distressed*</span>* sharing these details.*

- Did you find there were difficulties or complications related to the pension benefit - such as overpayments that required resolution?

**Resume all** 
I have just a couple more questions and then we will shift to wrap up. 

- How would you describe the overall experience applying for Veteran pension?

- When you think about  <span style="text - decoration: underline;">completing the form, </span>did it feel worth the effort you put in? 

- Did the level of effort <span style="text - decoration: underline;">throughout the overall process</span> align with your expectations? 

### *Things to listen for:*

- *What factors or motivations led to form submission or abandon.*

- *To what extent was follow up action needed post-submission or abandon?*

- *What were the specific factors or areas that follow up action were most associated with? (e.g. a specific area on the form, technical error, etc.)*

- *Was the level of information or instruction given adequate for the Veteran or advocate to respond and/or take necessary actions?*

- *To what extent did time or effort spent feel commensurate with the submission outcome?*

## Wrap Up Questions - 10 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback and perspective is so helpful to us as we continue to improve the experience of applying for benefits. We have just one or two closing questions for you as we wrap up.

- [*Moderator note: Skip if short on time*] As you reflect on what you’ve shared, how would you rate the following processes on a scale of 1-5 (where 1 is terrible and 5 is amazing):
   - Learning about pension
   - Applying for pension
   - Setting up pension payments
   - Managing pension payments

- While there are many people working on these forms and experiences, you really are the expert and we want to learn from you.
   - Is there any advice you would give to those designing the forms or experience that you think would make the biggest difference?
**[OR]** 
   - If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about the experience of applying for and getting/managing your pension, what would it be? 

- Do you have any questions for me?

- As we wrap up our conversation today, is there anything else that you’d like to share that we didn't get a chance to discuss?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Those are all of the questions we had for today!

We wanted to make sure you knew what the next steps are in this project. After we finish this research learning about the pension experience, we hope to shift to test specific features of the form with Veterans and their advocates.

During the screening process this should have been mentioned and you had a chance to share if you were interested or not in this follow up study. We have made note of your preferences, but if that changes at any time, please don’t hesitate to reach out to your contact person at Perigean who helped set up this meeting. 

Lastly, so you’re aware, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again for your time, and enjoy the rest of your day!
