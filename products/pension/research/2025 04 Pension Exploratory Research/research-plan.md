# Research Plan for Pension Benefits: Generative Research to Increase UX Performance for VA 21P-527EZ, April 2025 [#675](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/675)

## Background

Since relaunching the web-based version of VA Form 21P-527EZ in January 2024, the Pension team has shifted its focus to identifying opportunities to further improve the online filing experience for Veterans.

Three studies previously completed by the pension team include: [VSO Research (Fall ‘24)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024-09%20527EZ%20VSO%20Research/research-findings.md), [VSR Shadowing (Spring ‘24)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024-05%20527EZ%20VSR%20Shadowing/report.md), and [Usability Study (Winter ‘24)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024%2002%20Pension%20Usability%20Evaluation/research-findings.md). Through this research, it was found that the majority of our participants were likely not eligible for Veterans Pension. We have since learned that **pension-eligible Veterans can be challenging to contact and recruit, as many of them are in later stages of life**, may be in assisted living facilities, and are likely to be experiencing significant health challenges or financial hardship.

Although some form changes have been [prioritized](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/Pension-Related%20Research%20Discovery%20Findings%20and%20Prioritization.md) to address issues that interfere with accurate and efficient benefit dispersals, opportunity exists to validate and deepen learnings specifically with pension-eligible Veterans and Veteran advocates (such as family members); who were identified in previous research as likely to have a large role in supporting or even driving pension applications. 

This study aims to better establish understanding of end users and their experience learning about, applying for, maintaining, and receiving Veterans Pension benefits. We also seek to validate existing learnings and applicable design changes to ensure they are meeting and exceeding user needs. This study will lay the groundwork for future usability studies focused on speeding up completion and processing of the form, reducing errors leading to avoidable development letters, and meeting the needs of Veterans and advocates better.   


### OCTO Priorities

This research supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md):

- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits

- Objective 2: Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA (secondary).

### Veteran Journey

This research maps to the following stages of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

- Taking care of self

- Putting down roots

- Retiring

## Research Goals

**1. Better understand our end users and their experience learning about, applying for, maintaining, and receiving Veterans Pension benefits.**

- How do users learn about the Veteran pension benefit? (Awareness)

- What is their experience applying for the Veteran pension benefit? (Application Usage and Completion)

- What is their experience receiving and maintaining the Veteran pension benefit? (Post-submission/ Approval)

**2. Validate existing research findings or identify divergences in what we understand about the Veteran journey that have been gathered so far; especially by proxy in the [VSO study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024-09%20527EZ%20VSO%20Research/research-findings.md).**

- What are the convergences and divergences in the Veteran and advocate experience in this study compared to existing research?


### Outcomes

We anticipate that this research will:

- Deepen understanding of the perceptions and experiences of pension-eligible Veterans and their family members or caregivers related to learning about, applying for, and receiving pension benefits.

- Validate and provide direction for the most impactful VA 21P-527EZ form changes that will increase accurate and efficient benefit dispersals.

- Create informal updates to existing [journey maps](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/hcdveo2185/1650040181744/b41f183d67ce4e5ebb73d043835c9c1180bbd840?wid=0-1650056257256) to be used as an internal resource (in order to base form improvements on most up-to-date user priorities and experience).

- Reduce errors and boost efficiency for adjudicators by making the form easier to complete for end users,  streamline backend workflows, and reduce processing times (secondary).

### Measurement

We anticipate that research findings once applied will result downstream in:

- Reduction in length of time required to complete the form for Veterans and advocates.
- Reduction in length of time required to process the form for adjudicators.
- Reduction in number of development letters sent to Veterans and advocates due to submission errors.

### Hypotheses

- Veterans tend to seek out pension benefits when they are already experiencing financial hardship or other adverse conditions.

- Veterans learn about pension through word of mouth or communications from both trusted or predatory sources outside the VA (e.g. pension poachers).

- Veterans often need others to help support completion of the application, such as a VSO, family member, or other advocate.

- Veterans experience challenges completing the application such as: the large amount of information required for submission, unclear or missing information, and lack of direction on necessary follow-up steps.

- Veterans experience high error rates post application submission that require additional action on the part of them or their advocate.

##  Methodology

We will be facilitating two sets of semi-structured interviews with pension-eligible Veterans and advocates. We will utilize open ended questions that will help us map to the overall journey phases including: awareness, application completion, and post-submission/ benefit approval.

### Location

These research sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom.

### Research Materials

Research materials for moderated interviews include:

- Conversation guide (link to come)

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

Using Perigean to recruit, we would like to schedule: 15 pension-eligible Veteran participants and 10 pension-eligible Veteran family members or other advocates in order to achieve 6-8 completed sessions for each user group.

### Recruitment criteria

Primary criteria (must-haves)

- Pension-eligible

- Applied for pension within the last 2 calendar years


Demographic must-haves

- We are looking for a heterogenous group of participants demographically reflective of those who use the form day-to-day. 


## Veteran Screening Questions:

Note: The *notes in italics* are for Perigean to understand the purpose of each question, not to be displayed to screener respondents.

     - Yes (exclude participant)

     - No

3. Are you receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI)? (_To receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI), you must be disabled, blind, or 65 or older, and have limited income and resources, regardless of your work history. If receiving SSI they are highly likely to be eligible for 527EZ pension benefit_) 

     - Yes (preferred recruit)

     - No

4. Have you attempted to apply for [Veterans Pension](https://www.va.gov/pension/eligibility/) using VA Form 21P-527EZ online, on paper, or with assistance from a third party in the last two years?

     - Yes, using paper form
   
     - Yes, with assistance from a Veteran Service Officer (VSO), family member, etc.

     - No (exclude participant)

## Veteran Family Member/ Advocate Screening Questions:

     - Yes

     - No (exclude participant)

     - Learning about Veteran Pension benefit or application process

     - Starting or completing the Veteran Pension application

     - Supporting the Veteran to complete follow-up steps after application submission (e.g. responding to development letters, etc.)
