# Research Plan for Pension Benefits, Increase UX Performance and Efficiencies for VA 21P-527EZ, April 2025 #675

## Background

Since relaunching the web-based version of VA Form 21P-527EZ in January 2024, the Pension team has shifted its focus to identifying opportunities to further improve the online filing experience for Veterans.

Three studies previously completed by the pension team include: [VSO Research (Fall ‘24)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024-09%20527EZ%20VSO%20Research/research-findings.md), [VSR Shadowing (Spring ‘24)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024-05%20527EZ%20VSR%20Shadowing/report.md), and [Usability Study (Winter ‘24)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024%2002%20Pension%20Usability%20Evaluation/research-findings.md). Through this research, it was found that the majority of our participants were likely not eligible for Veterans Pension. We have since learned that pension-eligible Veterans can be challenging to contact and recruit, as many of them are in later stages of life, may be in assisted living facilities, and are likely to be experiencing significant health challenges or financial hardship.

Although some form changes have been prioritized to address issues that interfere with accurate and efficient benefit dispersals, opportunity exists to validate and deepen learnings specifically with pension-eligible Veterans and Veteran advocates (such as family members); who were identified in previous research as likely to have a large role in supporting or even driving pension applications. 

This study aims to better establish understanding of end users and their experience learning about, applying for, maintaining, and receiving Veterans Pension benefits. We also seek to validate existing learnings and applicable design changes to ensure they are meeting and exceeding user needs. We hypothesize that taking a phased approach focused on both exploratory and evaluative research, will (1) provide a more holistic understanding of the pension-eligible Veteran journey, (2) align more closely with user needs and (3) therefore inform design improvements in more impactful ways.  


### OCTO Priorities

This research supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md):

- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits

- Objective 2: Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA (secondary).

### Veteran Journey

This research maps to the following stages of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

- Taking care of self

- Putting down roots

- Retiring

## Research Goals

### Phase 1: Discovery (Exploratory)

**Better understand our end users and their experience learning about, applying for, maintaining, and receiving Veterans Pension benefits.**

- How do users learn about the Veteran pension benefit (Awareness)

- What is their experience applying for Veteran pension benefit (Application Usage and Completion)

- What is their experience receiving and maintaining Veteran pension benefit (Post-submission/ Approval)

**Validate existing research findings or identify divergences in what we understand about the Veteran journey that have been gathered so far; especially by proxy in the VSO study.**

- What are the convergences and divergences in the Veteran and advocate experience in this study compared to existing research?

### Phase 2: Usability (Evaluative) 

*As this is based on pending design work and learnings from phase 1, we have included some details below but will update before phase 2 starts in more detail.* 

**Validate design changes to the form based on previous usability testing and other research.**

- Will likely include design fixes and other improvements with the highest direct impact to increase accuracy and efficiency based on previous research, such as the Financial and Household Information sections. 

### Outcomes

We anticipate that this research will:

- Deepen understanding of the perceptions and experiences of pension-eligible Veterans and their family members or caregivers related to learning about, applying for, and receiving pension benefits.

- Validate and provide direction for the most impactful VA 21P-527EZ form changes that will increase accurate and efficient benefit dispersals.

- Create informal updates to existing [journey maps](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/hcdveo2185/1650040181744/b41f183d67ce4e5ebb73d043835c9c1180bbd840?wid=0-1650056257256) to be used as an internal resource in order to base form improvements on most up-to-date user priorities and experience.

- Reducing errors and boosting efficiency for adjudicators by making the form easier to complete for end users,  streamline backend workflows, and reduce processing times (secondary).

### Hypotheses

- Veterans tend to seek out pension benefits when they are already experiencing financial hardship or other adverse conditions.

- Veterans learn about pension through word of mouth or communications from both trusted or predatory sources outside the VA (e.g. pension poachers).

- Veterans often need others to help support completion of the application, such as a VSO, family member, or other advocate.

- Veterans experience challenges completing the application such as: how much information is required for submission, unclear or missing information, and lack of direction on necessary follow up steps.

- Veterans experience high error rates post application submission that require additional action on the part of them or their advocate.

##  Methodology

In phase 1, we will be facilitating two sets of semi-structured interviews with pension-eligible Veterans and advocates. We will utilize open ended questions that will help us map to the overall journey phases including: awareness, application completion, and post-submission/ benefit approval.

In phase 2 we are anticipating a remote moderated usability study with the same population (see recruitment section for more detail). Details for exact methodology will be added once we are closer to phase 2 research start.

### Location

These research sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom.

### Research Materials

Research materials for moderated interviews include:

- Conversation guide (link to come)

- Conversation stimuli (likely relevant in phase 2)

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

Using Perigean to recruit for phase 1, we would like to schedule: 15 pension-eligible Veteran participants and 10 pension-eligible Veteran family members or other advocates in order to achieve 6-8 completed sessions for each user group.

For phase 2 we would like to provide first invites to phase 1 participants to build on previously established rapport (as this is a hard to engage population) and provide transparency to those initially engaged and then launch a second recruiting effort using Perigean that accounts for attrition.

### Recruitment criteria

Primary criteria (must-haves)

- Pension-eligible

- Applied for pension within the last 2 calendar years


Demographic must-haves

- We are looking for a heterogenous group of participants demographically reflective of those who use the form day to day. 


## Veteran Screening Questions:

Note: The *notes in italics* are for Perigean to understand the purpose of each question, not to be displayed to screener respondents.

2. Are you currently or anticipating receiving a military retirement pension?  *(If a Veteran is receiving a military pension they are highly unlikely to be eligible for VA pension)

 - Yes (exclude participant)

 - No

3. Are you receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI)? *(To receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI), you must be disabled, blind, or 65 or older, and have limited income and resources, regardless of your work history. If receiving SSI they are highly likely to be eligible for 527EZ pension benefit) 

 - Yes (preferred recruit)

 - No

 - Yes with assistance from a Veteran Service Officer (VSO), family member, etc.

 - No (exclude)

## Veteran Family Members/ Advocate Screening Questions:

2. How far into the process did you provide support to the Veteran?

 - Learning about Veteran Pension benefit or application process
