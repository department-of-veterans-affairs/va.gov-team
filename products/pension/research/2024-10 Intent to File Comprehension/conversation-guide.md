# **Conversation Guide for Pension Benefits, Intent to File Comprehension, October 2024**

This is the general guide containing all possible questions for participating Veterans. Not all of these questions will be asked, and “probe” questions are listed as optional ways to dig deeper into the overarching question. Researchers may copy and customize this guide to each participant by bolding applicable/priority questions in a separate document.

## **Research Goals**

* Validate when and how intent to file messaging might be effective for Veterans and evaluate the usability of the proposed content and experience

* \[Secondary\] Understand Veterans’ expectations after an ITF is created  
* \[Secondary\] Understand Veterans' existing mental model (if any) of ITF and their barriers to taking action to starting an application 

## **Taking a Trauma-informed approach**

During this study, we plan to take a trauma-informed approach by:

* Setting clear expectations at the start of the session by providing research participants with an overview of what the session will entail  
* Starting each interview by setting expectations about our scope of practice \-- in other words, what we can and can't help with today  
* Sharing how we plan to use the recordings and the learnings from our conversation  
* Introducing observers/disclose who else is on the call  
* Prioritizing a participant's well being and time over completing our conversation guide  
* Making guidance and resources easily accessible for moderators and creating a plan specific to our team about what to do if difficult moments arise in a session  
* Explicitly giving participants the option to: turn off their camera, refuse recording, decline to answer any questions they would prefer not to, and end the session at any time  
* Allowing space at the end of each session so a participant can ask questions, or sometimes, just vent  
* Scheduling a 15 minute debrief after every research session, and scheduling a 30 minute buffer in between research sessions if multiple sessions are scheduled in one day

## **Intro (5 minutes)**

Thanks for joining us today\! My name is \[Name\] and I’m part of a team working on the claims filing experience on VA.gov.

To provide a little background, our team is looking to understand more about the claims filing experience on Va.gov. We’re holding a series of conversations (like this one today) to seek feedback from Veterans. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you: I have some colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean may have mentioned this, but I wanted to confirm with you before we got started. Are you okay with my colleagues joining us for this session?

*\[If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.\]*

*\[If yes: Admit observers, then allow a short pause for short introductions\]*

For those of you who just joined, can you come off-camera briefly to introduce yourselves? Thanks\!

*\[Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session\]*

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. To ensure we're able to touch on all the topics we're hoping to cover, I may occasionally prompt you to keep the conversation on track.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers and we are not evaluating you. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, please let me know. You will be compensated for the session even if you need to stop.

One last thing. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We capture these recordings to ensure we're able to capture your opinions accurately. Recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of the comments from the recordings will be attached to your name.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

*\[Start recording\]*

I have started recording. Just to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

I’d like to share an overview of what today’s conversation will look like: We’ll start with a few questions about your past claim filing experiences with the VA, and then we’ll spend the majority of our time together asking you to walk us through your experience using a prototype that we’ll share with you shortly. Do you have any questions about this?

## **Warm-up (5-10 min)**

*Goal: Understand Veterans' existing mental model (if any) of ITF*

For participants who **have** previously filed a claim on VA.gov

* In the screening process for this research, you indicated that you have filed a claim on VA.gov before. First I want to confirm that you have in fact filed a claim on VA.gov before?  
  *  Can you walk me through the process of filing that claim?  
    * \[probe\] What resources did you use to file your claim (i.e. accredited representative, personal networks, VA.gov, Google, etc)?

For participants who **have not** previously filed a claim on VA.gov

* In the screening process for this research, you indicated that you have not filed a claim on VA.gov before. First I want to confirm that you have not filed a claim on VA.gov before?  
  * Have you looked into filing a claim before?  
    * If yes, what resources have you used to learn more about filing a claim (i.e. accredited representative, personal networks, VA.gov, Google, etc)?   
  * Have you used VA.gov before? If yes, what have you used it for?

For **all** participants

* Are you familiar with the phrase “intent to file”?  
  * \[If yes\] If you had to describe intent to file to a fellow Veteran, what would you say?  
  * What do you know about intent to file?  
  * Where did you learn about it?  
  * In your own words, how does intent to file work?  
  * \[If applicable\] Tell me about your last experience with intent to file.  
    * \[If they’ve filed an ITF before\] What informed your decision to file an intent to file? How did you go about filing one? What questions did you have?

## **Task: Starting a new application (10-15 min)**

*Goal: Validate when and how intent to file messaging might be effective for Veterans*

Now I'm going to ask you to open a prototype from a link I'll post in the chat and have you share your screen. Just a reminder \- it'll be very helpful if you think out loud and share what's on your mind as much as possible as you're looking at the prototype.

* *Send link to prototype in Zoom chat*  
* *If user is on mobile, tell them to tap the three dots that say "More" and then select Chat from the menu to access the link that was sent*  
* *Ask participant to share their screen by selecting the green Share Screen button in the middle of the bottom menu*

Scenario: Thanks for sharing your screen. Before you start scrolling through the prototype, I’m going to provide you with a scenario to keep in mind as you review and click through the prototype.

I want you to imagine you are learning about Veterans Pension benefits, and you reached this page because you’ve decided that you want to start a pension application

I’ll give you some time to review this page–please feel free to talk out loud as you review.

* What does “back payments” mean to you? Is there a different word, or words, that you would use?  
* Before you continue, what do you think will happen next? 

Go ahead and start an application, and talk aloud as you go.

Success Criteria:

## Pause or exit strategies

We can use this strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
