# **Conversation Guide for Pension Benefits, Intent to File Comprehension, October 2024**

This is the general guide containing all possible questions for participating Veterans. Not all of these questions will be asked, and “probe” questions are listed as optional ways to dig deeper into the overarching question. Researchers may copy and customize this guide to each participant by bolding applicable/priority questions in a separate document.

## **Research Goals**

* Validate when and how intent to file messaging might be effective for Veterans and evaluate the usability of the proposed content and experience

* \[Secondary\] Understand Veterans’ expectations after an ITF is created  
* \[Secondary\] Understand Veterans' existing mental model (if any) of ITF and their barriers to taking action to starting an application 

## **Taking a Trauma-informed approach**

During this study, we plan to take a trauma-informed approach by:

* Setting clear expectations at the start of the session by providing research participants with an overview of what the session will entail  
* Starting each interview by setting expectations about our scope of practice \-- in other words, what we can and can't help with today  
* Sharing how we plan to use the recordings and the learnings from our conversation  
* Introducing observers/disclose who else is on the call  
* Prioritizing a participant's well being and time over completing our conversation guide  
* Making guidance and resources easily accessible for moderators and creating a plan specific to our team about what to do if difficult moments arise in a session  
* Explicitly giving participants the option to: turn off their camera, refuse recording, decline to answer any questions they would prefer not to, and end the session at any time  
* Allowing space at the end of each session so a participant can ask questions, or sometimes, just vent  
* Scheduling a 15 minute debrief after every research session, and scheduling a 30 minute buffer in between research sessions if multiple sessions are scheduled in one day

## **Intro (5 minutes)**

Thanks for joining us today\! My name is \[Name\] and I’m a \[role\] working on VA.gov.

To provide a little background, our team is looking to understand more about the claims filing experience on Va.gov. We’re holding a series of conversations (like this one today) to seek feedback from Veterans. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you: I have some colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean may have mentioned this, but I wanted to confirm with you before we got started. Are you okay with my colleagues joining us for this session?

*\[If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.\]*

*\[If yes: Admit observers, then allow a short pause for short introductions\]*

For those of you who just joined, can you come off-camera briefly to introduce yourselves? Thanks\!

*\[Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session\]*

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. To ensure we're able to touch on all the topics we're hoping to cover, I may occasionally prompt you to keep the conversation on track.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. There are no right or wrong answers and we are not evaluating you. If you ask questions, I may ask them back to you so that we can understand your perspective better. But if you feel stuck, I’m here to help so that you feel comfortable to participate. 

You'll be interacting with a mobile prototype. This may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be interactive, and some will not. Since it's a simulation, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, please let me know. You will be compensated for the session even if you need to stop.

One last thing. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We capture these recordings to ensure we're able to capture your opinions accurately. Recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of the comments from the recordings will be attached to your name.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

*\[Start recording\]*

I have started recording. Just to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

I’d like to share an overview of what today’s conversation will look like: We’ll start with a few questions about your past claim filing experiences with the VA, and then we’ll spend the majority of our time together asking you to walk us through 3 scenarios using the prototype we’ll share with you shortly. Do you have any questions about this?

## **Warm-up (5-10 min) until \[time\]**

*Goal: Understand Veterans' existing mental model (if any) of ITF*

For participants who **have** previously filed a claim on VA.gov

* In the screening process for this research, you indicated that you have filed a claim on VA.gov before. First I want to confirm that you have in fact filed a claim on VA.gov before?  
  *  Can you walk me through the process of filing that claim?  
    * \[probe\] What resources did you use to file your claim (i.e. accredited representative, personal networks, VA.gov, Google, etc)?

For participants who **have not** previously filed a claim on VA.gov

* In the screening process for this research, you indicated that you have not filed a claim on VA.gov before. First I want to confirm that you have not filed a claim on VA.gov before?  
  * Have you looked into filing a claim before?  
    * If yes, what resources have you used to learn more about filing a claim (i.e. accredited representative, personal networks, VA.gov, Google, etc)?   
  * Have you used VA.gov before? If yes, what have you used it for?

—------------

* Are you familiar with the phrase “intent to file”?  
  * \[If yes\] If you had to describe intent to file to a fellow Veteran, what would you say?  
  * What do you know about intent to file?  
  * Where did you learn about it?  
  * In your own words, how does intent to file work?  
  * \[If applicable\] Tell me about your last experience with intent to file.  
    * \[If they’ve filed an ITF before\] What informed your decision to file an intent to file? How did you go about filing one? What questions did you have?

## **Task: Starting a new application (10-15 min) until \[time\]**

*Goal: Learn when and where ITF messaging would be most effective and beneficial for Veterans*

Now I'm going to ask you to open a prototype from a link I'll post in the chat and have you share your screen. 

* *Send link to prototype in Zoom chat*  
* *If user is on mobile, tell them to tap the three dots that say "More" and then select Chat from the menu to access the link that was sent*  
* *Ask participant to share their screen by selecting the Share button*   
  * *\[if Desktop\] in the middle of the bottom menu*  
  * *\[if Mobile\] You may need to scroll at the bottom menu to see the “Share” button. Tap “Share”, then scroll down to tap “Screen”. Then, tap “Start” or “Start Broadcast”. You can swipe my video to the side of the screen so that we can see how you’re interacting with it.* 

Just a reminder \- it'll be very helpful if you think out loud and share what's on your mind as much as possible as you're looking at the prototype. We’re testing the prototype, not you, so interact with it as you would if we weren’t here, and feel free to point out anything that you didn’t expect.  

Scenario: Thanks for sharing your screen. Before you start scrolling through the prototype, I’m going to provide you with a scenario to keep in mind as you review and click through the prototype.

I want you to imagine you are learning about Veterans Pension benefits. You’ve signed into VA.gov, and you reached this page because you’ve decided that you want to start a Veterans Pension application.

I’ll give you some time to review this page–please feel free to talk out loud as you review.

* \[Probe if needed\] What do you think is the purpose of this message?  
* Is there anything confusing about the message here?  
* In your own words, what do you think this is telling you?  
* What does “back payments” mean to you? Is there a different word, or words, that you would use?  
* Before you continue, what do you think will happen next? 

Go ahead and continue as you would, and talk aloud as you go.

* On the previous screen, you mentioned that you expected to see \[...\]. How does this page compare to those expectations?

Success Criteria: 

* They mention the relationship between starting an application and the benefits start date (if they start today, their benefits start date is reserved as today)  
* They mention an earlier start date for benefits or payments  
* They mention backpay or back payments

## **Task: ITF successfully created (5-10 min) until \[time\]**

*Goal: Learn when and where ITF messaging would be most effective and beneficial for Veterans*

* Walk me through what you would do on this page.  
* What do you think is the purpose of this page?  
* Based on what you see here, what does the information on this page tell you about your application?  
* Is there anything you expect to see here that you don't? Is anything confusing?  
* What questions do you have, if any?  
* What stands out to you? 

Before we move on:

* How would you use this information?  
* What would you do if you wanted more information?  
* What would you do next? Where would you go from here?  
* What do you expect to happen next?  
* In your own words, how does intent to file relate to your application?  
  * What do these dates mean to you?  
  * If you’re eligible for benefits, when would your benefits start?  
  * When do you need to complete your application by?  
    * Why?

Success Criteria: 

* They mention the correct benefits effective date  
* They mention the correct expiry date  
* They mention the consequence of expiry:   
  * if they do not complete the application by the expiry date, their benefits start date will be later  
  * if they do not complete the application by the expiry date, they miss out on more retroactive payments  
* They mention their next step as continuing the application, or clicking “Continue”

Now we’ll move onto the next scenario. I want you to imagine the same scenario – that you’re learning about Veterans Pension benefits, and you’ve decided that you want to start an application for the first time.

## **Task: Endpoint is unavailable (5-10 min) until \[time\]**

*Goal: Learn when and where ITF messaging would be most effective and beneficial for Veterans*

* Walk me through what you would do on this page.  
* Is there anything you expect to see here that you don't?  
* What questions do you have, if any?

Before we move on:

* How would you use this information?  
* What would you do if you wanted more information?  
* What would you do next?   
* What does “potential start date” mean to you?   
  * When do you think it is?

Success Criteria: 

* They mention their next step as continuing the application  
* They understand that their potential start date may not be today (the day they started)

## **Task: Returning to an in-progress application (10-15 min) until \[time\]**

*Goal: Learn when and where ITF messaging would be most effective and beneficial for Veterans*

For the last scenario, I’d like you to imagine you previously started an application for Veterans Pension benefits a few months ago, and you reached this page because you’ve decided that you’re ready to continue working on your in-progress pension application.

I’ll give you some time to review this page–please feel free to talk out loud as you review.

* Walk me through what you would do on this page.   
* Based on what you see here, what does the information on this page tell you about your application?  
* When was the last time you worked on your application?  
* When do you need to complete your application by? Why?  
* What questions do you have, if any? Is anything confusing?  
  * Where would you go for more information?  
* What would you do next?  
* What would you expect to happen next?

Go ahead and continue to work on your application, and talk aloud as you go.

So in this scenario, let’s say that you’re done working on your application for now. Before you continue:

* What do you expect to happen next?  
* How did this match your expectations?  
* What stands out to you?  
* Is there anything you expect to see here that you don’t?

Success Criteria: 

* They mention the correct date the application was last saved  
* They mention the correct expiry date

## **Wrap-Up & Thank You (5-10 min)**

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback and perspective is so helpful to us as we continue to improve the experience of applying for benefits.

* How, if at all, did today’s experience impact your understanding of intent to file?  
* What did you think of that process?
