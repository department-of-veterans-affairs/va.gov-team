**Usability Test of Pension Benefits Form 527EZ with Veterans: Research Plan** [Zenhub issue [# 73620](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/73620)] 

<h2>**Background**</h2>


VA.gov aims to offer digital experiences that are the best way to access VA health care and benefits. In 2023, VA Office of the CTO engaged a team to manage and improve digital claims for pension benefits. In the fall of 2023, the web-based version of VA Form 21P-527EZ was found to be several versions behind the paper form. It was missing fields that are required to process pension claims. Any Veteran who submitted a 527EZ claim on VA.gov received a development letter asking them to resubmit their claim using the paper form. The digital Veterans Pension form was deactivated from VA.gov on Wednesday, November 8, 2023, in order to reduce Veteran burden of having to re-apply. We committed to relaunching in January.  

The Pension Benefits team has been working to redesign and build a minimum viable product version of the online Veterans Pension form that will make the submission processable for the business and contribute to an improved user experience for Veterans. Due to the time pressure to make the interview-style 527EZ once again available on VA.gov, we didn’t perform evaluative testing prior to relaunch.  We don’t have a clear sense of the end-to-end experience of Veterans completing the pension form.

<h2>**OCTO Priorities **</h2>


Resolving the stated issues with the digital 527EZ form will align with OCTO DE goals 



* (#6) Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience, and 
* (#10) OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy

<h2>**Veteran Journey**</h2>


This research and product (VA Form 21P-527EZ Veterans Pension benefits) fits into the retiring stage of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) where Veterans’ are engaging VA to access benefits.

<h2>
** Research Goals**</h2>



The goals of the research are to learn from Veterans about their experience with completing the digital version of the 527EZ pension benefits form to determine:  



1. How Veterans respond to the instructions for completing the 527EZ form
2. The Veteran’s experience with applying for pension benefits
3. The pain points as well as pleasure points experienced with using the 527EZ digital form
<h2>
** Outcome**</h2>



In our current work on the 527EZ, we aim to ensure that form submissions provide the data needed to efficiently and effectively process claims. We also aim to improve the design and logic flow of questions.  

Desirable outcomes:



1. Veterans have a clear understanding of what is needed to complete the 527EZ form to receive pension benefits.
2. Veterans have a positive experience completing the online application. 
3. Identify  pain points Veterans experience completing the online pension benefit form.  

**Research questions**

**Goal 1**: **To determine how Veterans respond to the instructions for completing the 527EZ form**. 



1. Is there anything on the Apply for Veterans Pension benefits page that they question or do not understand? 
2. How difficult, if at all, do they expect it to be to get the information to complete the pension form? Why?
3. What other parties would they involve in the information gathering process?
4. Do they choose to complete the application with or without signing in? Why?

**Goal 2**: **To understand the Veteran’s experience with applying for pension benefits**



    1. What do Veterans do when they have a question or need assistance?
    2. Were any questions on the online form misinterpreted? 
    3. Where in the form is additional clarification or information needed?
    4. Did their mental model or expectations about their experience completing the form change after they completed it? 
    5. What, if anything, surprised them about their experience? 

**Goal 3**: **To determine the pain points experienced with using the 527EZ digital form**



1. Are there certain sections that were more difficult to complete than others?   Where and why? 
2. Are there certain questions or sections that create confusion?
3. What information requires them to pause/stop and why?  
    1. What do they think/see as their next steps? 
1. Do Veterans want to know or question why certain information is needed?
4. Did they experience any challenge or concerns with uploading data? 
5. What information, if any, do they note that they have previously provided to VA?
6. What, if any, concerns did they have around completing the application?
7. What, if any, concerns did they have around submitting the application?

**Hypothesis**

**What we know** 

To be eligible for pension benefits you need to be at least 65 years old, or you have a permanent and total disability, or you’re a patient in a nursing home for long-term care because of a disability, or you’re getting Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income. 

Through interviews with subject matter experts, we understand that most pension beneficiaries are from an aging demographic. Extreme and urgent needs often act as a barrier to applying for pension (e.g. catastrophic accident that left them debilitated or homeless).  A Veteran’s access to information and ability to apply for pension benefits are negatively impacted by situational living limitations, physical and mental health limitations, and financial limitations.  Veterans often need access to outside sources to introduce them to the program and guide them through the process.  

October 2023 data on digital pension form usage provided the following information: 



* 29% drop off rate at the military history (section 2) 
* 43% left during the household information (section 3) 
* 30% of claims were rejected because Veterans did not furnish sufficient detail and documentation regarding their finances and medical expenses
* 20% of claims led to overpayments because of poorly documented financial information, requiring Veterans to repay money to VA

**Assumptions **



* Certain information may be difficult for Veterans to obtain and in some cases participants may not know how to obtain the information. 
* Participants may experience fatigue completing the application and will want to know how many questions are remaining or may abandon the application.
* Veterans will not understand why they have to populate all of their personal information when they believe VA already has it (e.g. provided the information when signed in, profile page shows their branch of service).
* Participants do not complete the application in one sitting ands come back to the application at a later date. 
<h2>
**Methodology**</h2>



To test the usability of the online pension form we will use semi-structured moderated interviews where we observe Veterans completing the online 527EZ form for the first time. We will use a video conference tool and ask Veterans to share their screen as they think out loud and share their thoughts as they complete the form. The duration of the sessions will be 1 hour.  By observing Veterans completing the form we will learn about their experience with the digital form and where improvements to design, content, and usability will enhance their experience.

<h2>**Recruitment**</h2>


The intended audience for this research is Veterans and we will use Perigean to assist in recruiting them.  We are requesting a kick off call with Perigean for Thursday 2/15 between 1-3pm.

<h3>
**Recruitment criteria**</h3>


We would like to recruit 16 Veterans with the goal of conducting 8 research sessions with Veterans who have not used the pdf or digital version of the 527EZ pension benefit form and are willing to fill out the Veterans Pension form on our test website using a test account. This will not have any impact on the participant’s own records. 

Participants must:



* Have a laptop or desktop with audio and a web browser window from which they are able to screen share.
* Are willing to be observed while potentially entering personal and sensitive information into the form. 

**Primary criteria**
