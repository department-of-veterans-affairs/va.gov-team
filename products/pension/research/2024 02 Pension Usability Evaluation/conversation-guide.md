** Research Goals**</h2>



The goals of the research are to learn from Veterans about their experience with completing the digital version of the 527EZ pension benefits form to determine:  



1. How Veterans respond to the instructions for completing the 527EZ form
2. The Veteran’s experience with applying for pension benefits
3. The pain points as well as pleasure points experienced with using the 527EZ digital form
<h2>
**Intro - 5 minutes**</h2>



Thanks for joining us today!  My name is Allexe.   

Today we're going to talk about the web-based version of the Veterans Pension form 21P-527EZ. We want to learn about where it’s working well and where we can make it better.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:



* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or skills. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you share.
* Your participation in this session is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. You’ll get paid the same either way.
* I want you to know that I work on the VA.gov website, and have no access to your records or benefits, and I have no ability to change your claims or benefits in any way. 
* The people from Perigean who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Is it okay with you to have  [specific number] people join us to observe this session?
    * _If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
    * _If yes: Admit observers._
        * _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov_. 
* In this session, we’ll ask you to use a test version of the pension benefits application form using a fakename. The information you enter won’t be attributed to you in any system. None of your actions will affect your VA information, record, or benefits.
        * Any questions at this point?
* I’d like to ask your permission to record the screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments would be attributed to you directly. Are you okay with me recording my screen and audio during this session?

_Start recording._



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
<h2>
**Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes**</h2>



Before we get started, I would like to ask you a few questions.


* What kind of device are you using today? This could be a computer, phone, tablet, etc. 
    * When completing a form, do you have a preference of one device over another? Why? 
* In order for us to observe your work, we will need to ask you to share your screen and then open another window in your browser.
    * Would you mind practicing screen sharing now?

Now that you have the screen shared, you will need to open another window in your browser and once that’s open I will provide you the url link in the ZOOM chat to the Pension Benefit form.  [https://staging.va.gov/pension/how-to-apply/](https://staging.va.gov/pension/how-to-apply/)  

Ok, now that you have access, I would like to ask you just a few questions. I do want to clarify that I am not a specialist in pension benefits and that my primary focus is to understand your experience with the form.  With that said: 



* Were you familiar with pension benefits prior to being contacted for this usability session?
    * If yes, how did you learn about the program? 
* Are you planning to apply for pension benefits at some time in the future? 
    * In what timeframe?
* Have you ever reviewed the eligibility requirements? 
    * If so, were you able to determine if you might be eligible? 
* Have you seen or reviewed the form before? 

Ok, Now I would like to share a little more about the usability testing we’re doing. 

As I mentioned earlier, we want to learn how well the pension form is working for Veterans. 

For today, we would like you to imagine that you learned that you are likely eligible for Veterans Pension benefits and that you’ve decided to apply.  Your fake name for the application is _____________.  

Some of the personal questions for your fictional character will be pre-filled but there will also be questions that you will be asked to answer. Although you will not need to provide any of your own real information, it may be easiest to stay close to the truth because some answers build on each other. (For example, if you say you have 3 dependents, you’ll then be entering information about 3 dependents.) 

Our hope is for you to complete the form, but we’ll just get as far along as we can.  As you fill out the form, you may be asked to complete another form and upload it.  For this session, we won’t be doing these extra forms.  Again, you can use fake information, but the closer you stick to the truth, the better our chances of finding usability problems we should fix. 

We want to learn about what works, what doesn't, and what could be better.   With that said, we ask that as you are going through the form that you share out loud what you are thinking and feeling.   If something doesn’t make sense, please say so.  If something raises a question for you, please share.  By sharing everything you are thinking and experiencing with the form, we will better understand your experience.   Do you have any questions?  

**Share url: **[https://staging.va.gov/pension/how-to-apply/](https://staging.va.gov/pension/how-to-apply/)** and screen with pension benefits form**

_[Throughout the observation, the moderator will watch for evidence of confusion, hesitation, frustration, bouncing, etc. See sample questions below. ] _



* _I noticed that you paused for a moment on [name the page], can you tell us why?_
* _I observed that when [x] happened you did [y]. Can you tell us about your thought process there? _
* _I see that you have [insert thing they did], can you tell us about how that is a part of your process?_

**Step 1a. Pension Form Instructions **</h2>



Ok, I would like you to begin by reviewing this page and sharing your thoughts or three takeaways from this page? 


    _After they have reviewed_

What would you do next?

For today’s research we will be signing in.  



* Which authentication provider would you normally use and why?  

Today, we will use the ID.me option with the email and password that I provide you.

**Share one of the following staging emails and passwords. **



* Next, I would like you to read through this page and then tell me afterwards if there was any information that stood out for you?  

    (_home page with instructions)_.

    1. How might you summarize what’s being said here if you were explaining to a fellow Veteran? 
* Do you have any questions about what this page is asking or suggesting?

**Questions: Observe**

<h3>**Things to watch for:**</h3>




* Are you 65 years or older?  Do they question why this is being asked if already entered birthdate?

* Special Monthly Pension: Do Veterans understand what "Claiming" SMP means? 
* Do users know what a federal medical facility is?
* "When did you last work?"  Do they question if that is the day the stopped working?  Is the request for the exact day difficult for the Veteran to determine? Would the month/year be enough?

**Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes**</h2>


Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little more information on research studies in case you want to pass it along to other Veterans who might want to participate.

Thank you so much again; we appreciate your time!

<h2>
**Emergency Exit**</h2>


[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
