	# Research Plan for Pension Burial Benefits, Pension Form (527EZ), Dec 2025

[WIP]

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

If a Veteran has a 100% Disability Rating, it's nearly impossible that they will be eligible for a Veteran's Pension, given that the disability compensation they are receiving. For this reason, we want to inform the Veterans with a 100% Disability Rating of their ineligibility _before_ they take the time to fill out a Pension application to help save them the wasted effort.

There is also an "API-failed" version of this alert, which we will show Veterans if the API fails and we can't tell if they have a 100% Disability Rating or not. We want to ensure that message is also clear and we want to understand what impact that would have on user behavior.
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

The messaging will appear on the Introduction page of the Pension form for authenticated Veterans with a Disability Rating of 100%.
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

We are iterating on an existing product – the Pension application.

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Ensure that the message is clear to Veterans and that they understand what it is trying to say.**

`2.` **See if Veterans who understand the message and have a 100%$ rating will be encouraged or discouraged from filling out the Pension form.**

`3.` **Get a better sense of Veterans' understanding of Disability Rating as a concept.** 
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**We will iterate on the language or even the overall design if the messaging is shown to be confusing or if it has the opposite of the intended effect.** 

---

### Research questions

*Assess clarity of the alert*

**`1.`Do participants understand what the message is trying to tell them**

**`2.`After seeing the message, are Veterans more or less likely to fill out the pension form?**

**`3.`What would Vetearns do after seeing the message?**

*Assess clarity of the API-failed alert*

**`1.`Do participants understand what the message is trying to tell them**

**`2.`After seeing the message, are Veterans more or less likely to fill out the pension form?**

**`3.`What would Vetearns do after seeing the message?**

### Hypotheses

---

**The Veteran will be provided an efficient path through the data collection process through up-front and conditional questions that ease their form filling burden.** 

**Participants are able to complete the 0969 form based on the scenarios provided with minimal friction.** 

**Participants are able to understand the terms used in the form and are able to answer all questions asked of them.** 

**Participants express that they would prefer to use this form over a paper version in a real-life scenario.** 

---
  
## Methodology  🛠️

</details>

**For this study, we will be facilitating semi-structured interviews with Veterans based on a mock profile provided. We will utilize a combination of open-ended questions and conversation stimuli in the form of a high-fidelity prototype of proposed designs for a specific 0969-related scenario in a digitized format.**

## Recruitment 🎯	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

### Recruitment approach
Due to past experience recruiting hard-to-reach Veterans in the past, we would like to partner with Perigean to partner closely, finalizing exact criteria based on the screener outcomes. The research team would also like to make final determination regarding who is invited to the study with Perigean input. 

### Recruitment criteria

**Intro included below should be included with screener:**

*We are seeking to create an easier and more streamlined way to collect complex financial information for Veterans and their loved ones when they apply for benefits, such as Veterans Pension.*

*Due to the nature of this research, we ask that participants meet specific criteria related to their annual income and other personal or financial details. This information will only be used for screening purposes and will never be shared outside the study.* 

*You will not be required to disclose personal financial details during the sessions. Instead, you will be given a fictional profile to use as you complete an online form as part of evaluating the experience.* 

**Screener start:**

Are you 65 years or older? 
* Yes 
* No (reject)

Please select the annual income that applies closest to you from the list below: 
* Less than $20,000 (preferred recruit)
* $20,000 to $49,000 (preferred recruit)
* $50,000 to $79,000
* $80,000 or more

Have you ever applied for a mortgage for a home or business? 
* Yes
* No (preferred recruit)

Please select all assets that you may have from the list below: 
* Investments such as stocks or bonds
* Home or land that is not your primary residence
* Other personal property not your primary vehicle (such as boat, furniture etc.) valued more than $25,000 in total


Have you ever applied for or received a Veterans Pension benefit? (This is different from a military pension, retirement, or disability benefit.) 
* Yes I applied but was not approved for Veterans Pension 
* Yes I applied and I am waiting for approval decision
* Yes I receive Veterans Pension currently (preferred recruit)
* No
