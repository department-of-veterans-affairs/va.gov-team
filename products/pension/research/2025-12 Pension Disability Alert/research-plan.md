	# Research Plan for Pension Burial Benefits, Pension Form (527EZ), Dec 2025

[WIP]

## Background 🏗️
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

If a Veteran has a 100% Disability Rating, it's nearly impossible that they will be eligible for a Veteran's Pension, given that the disability compensation they are receiving. For this reason, we want to inform the Veterans with a 100% Disability Rating of their ineligibility _before_ they take the time to fill out a Pension application to help save them the wasted effort.

There is also an "API-failed" version of this alert, which we will show Veterans if the API fails and we can't tell if they have a 100% Disability Rating or not. We want to ensure that message is also clear and we want to understand what impact that would have on user behavior.
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

The messaging will appear on the Introduction page of the Pension form for authenticated Veterans with a Disability Rating of 100%.
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

We are iterating on an existing product – the Pension application.

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

`Objective 1:  VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)
	
- `Taking Care of Myself`
- `Retiring`

## Research Goals 🥅	

### Goals

`1.` **Ensure that the message is clear to Veterans and that they understand what it is trying to say.**

`2.` **See if Veterans who understand the message and have a 100%$ rating will be encouraged or discouraged from filling out the Pension form.**

`3.` **Get a better sense of Veterans' understanding of Disability Rating as a concept.** 
  
### Outcome

`How will this research advance our product to the next phase in the design process? What will we do with our learnings?`

We will iterate on the language or even the overall design if the messaging is shown to be confusing or if it has the opposite of the intended effect.

### Research questions

*Assess clarity of the standard alert*

**`1.`Do participants understand what the message is trying to tell them**

**`2.`After seeing the message, are Veterans more or less likely to fill out the pension form?**

**`3.`What would Vetearns do after seeing the message?**

*Assess clarity of the API-failed alert*

**`1.`Do participants understand what the message is trying to tell them**

**`2.`After seeing the message, are Veterans more or less likely to fill out the pension form?**

**`3.`What would Vetearns do after seeing the message?**

## Hypotheses 🔬

For the standard alert, the Veteran will recognize that because of their high Disability Rating, filling out the Pension application does not make sense for them.

For the API-failed version of the alert, the Veteran will recognize that Disability Rating might have an impact on whether or not they should fill out the Pension form, and they will try to figure out what their Disability Rating is.
  
## Methodology  🛠️

For this study, we will be facilitating short, semi-structured interviews with Veterans. We will show them message(s) and asssess their comprehension.

### Location
Where will you be holding the research sessions? Be sure to include whether this is remote or in-person research.

## Recruitment 🎯	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

### Recruitment approach
Due to past experience recruiting hard-to-reach Veterans in the past, we would like to partner with Perigean to partner closely to try and get as many participants as possible who fit the eligiblity criteria for Pension benefits.
### Recruitment criteria

**Intro included below should be included with screener:**

*We are seeking to inform Veterans about their eligibility for Pension form, specifically letting them know when they are not eligible due to a high Disability Rating.*

*Due to the nature of this research, we ask that participants meet specific criteria related to their annual income and other personal or financial details. This information will only be used for screening purposes and will never be shared outside the study.* 

*You will not be required to disclose personal financial details during the sessions. Instead, you will be given a fictional profile to use as you complete an online form as part of evaluating the experience.* 

**Screener start:**

Are you 65 years or older? 
* Yes (preferred recruit)
* No

Please select the annual income that applies closest to you from the list below: 
* Less than $20,000 (preferred recruit)
* $20,000 to $49,000 (preferred recruit)
* $50,000 to $79,000
* $80,000 or more

Have you ever applied for or received a Veterans Pension benefit? (This is different from a military pension, retirement, or disability benefit.) 
* Yes I applied but was not approved for Veterans Pension 
* Yes I applied and I am waiting for approval decision
* Yes I receive Veterans Pension currently (preferred recruit)
* No

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:

- `Veterans:` **10**
- `Total:` **10**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **5-7**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)

- `Veterans age 65 or older`
- `Annual income under $50,000 (preferred - will finalize based on screener results)`

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
*What criteria would strengthen your results?* 

- `Experience applying for and receiving Veterans Pension`
- `30% people of color`
- `25% live in a rural area`
- `25% without a degree`
- `10% women`
