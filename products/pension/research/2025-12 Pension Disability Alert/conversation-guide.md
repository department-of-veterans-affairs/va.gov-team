# **Conversation Guide for Pension’s Disability Rating Alert December 2025**

## **Research Goals**

* Ensure that the message is clear to Veterans and that they understand what it is trying to say.  
* See if Veterans who understand the message and have a 100% rating will be encouraged or discouraged from filling out the Pension form.

> **Note:** We will alter which of the Tasks listed below the participant sees first, so as to unbias as much as possible the feedback around message comprehension for both messages. Hopefully we will get 50% of participants having seen the standard message first, and 50% having seen the error message first.

## **Intro (5 minutes)**

Thanks for joining us today\! My name is \[Name\] and I’m a \[role\] working on VA.gov.

To provide a little background, our team is looking to understand more about the claims filing experience on VA.gov. We’re holding a series of conversations (like this one today) to seek feedback from Veterans. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you: I have some colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean may have mentioned this, but I wanted to confirm with you before we got started. Are you okay with my colleagues joining us for this session?

*\[If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.\]*

*\[If yes: Admit observers, then allow a short pause for short introductions\]*

For those of you who just joined, can you come off-camera briefly to introduce yourselves? Thanks\!

*\[Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session\]*

This entire session should take about 30 minutes. To ensure we're able to touch on all the topics we're hoping to cover, I may occasionally prompt you to keep the conversation on track.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, please let me know. You will be compensated for the session even if you need to stop.

One last thing. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We capture these recordings to ensure we're able to capture your opinions accurately. Recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of the comments from the recordings will be attached to your name.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

*\[Start recording\]*

I have started recording. Just to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up (3 min) until \[time\]**

We’ll start with a couple questions about your past experiences applying for benefits with the VA before moving into the prototype.

* In the screening process for this research, you indicated that you have filed a claim on VA.gov before. Do you use [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)? Have you ever filed a claim? 
* You also indicated that you have a 100% disability rating. Can you confirm that that’s your current rating? 

## **Task: Disability rating successfully returned (10 min) until \[time\]**

Now I'm going to ask you to open a prototype from a link I'll post in the chat and have you share your screen. 

* *Send link to prototype in Zoom chat*  
* *If user is on mobile, tell them to tap the three dots that say "More" and then select Chat from the menu to access the link that was sent*  
* *Ask participant to share their screen by selecting the Share button in the middle of the bottom menu*

Scenario: Thanks for sharing your screen. Before you start scrolling through the prototype, I’m going to provide you with a scenario to keep in mind.

I want you to imagine you are learning about Veterans Pension benefits. You’ve signed into VA.gov, and you reached this page because you’re interested in potentially applying.

I’ll give you some time to review this page– go ahead and talk out loud as you review.

* \[Probe if needed\] What do you think is the purpose of this message?  
* Is there anything confusing about the message here?  
* In your own words, what do you think this is telling you?  
* What questions do you have, if any?  
* Is there any other information that you think would be helpful to see here?  
* What would you do if you wanted more information?  
* What would you do next?  
* Can you tell me if this information would influence your decision to apply or not? Why?

Success Criteria: 

* They mention that they already receive more money from disability payments  
* They mention their next step as not continuing to apply for Veterans Pension
* They understand the content as intended (ie. no misinterpretations)

Now we’ll move onto the next scenario. In order to move onto the next screen, can you navigate to the top-left corner and click on the VA.gov logo? The website won’t behave this way, this is just how we’ve set it up for our prototype.

I want you to imagine the same scenario – that you’re learning about Veterans Pension benefits.

## **Wrap-Up & Thank You (2 min)**

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your perspective is so helpful to us as we continue to improve the experience of applying for benefits.

* As we wrap up our conversation, is there anything else that you’d like to share with me today?  
* Do you have any questions for me?

Those are all of the questions we had for today\! 

Lastly, so you’re aware, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again for your time, and enjoy the rest of your day\!
