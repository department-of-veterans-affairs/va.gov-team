## **Findings**

1. **All participants demonstrated an understanding that their current disability pay is the greater benefit.**  
* In terms of overall comprehension, participants described that they already receive a higher payment than what pension might provide due to their 100% disability rating.   
*  5 out of 6 participants read the content of the yellow warning alert aloud without being prompted.   
* 4 out of 6 participants explicitly reiterated that they could not receive both benefits at the same time.

 > “You have 100% and you have this \[exception\], if you don’t, then they’re gonna waste their time, but you will manage expectations. And all the work that someone has to do on the backend to deal with this applicant would be eliminated, right?” –P10

2. **Most participants preferred the yellow warning alert for its detail.**  
* Although the two alerts have different use cases, participants naturally compared the two alerts they were presented with. 4 out of 6 participants indicated a preference for the yellow warning alert over the blue info alert.   
  * Some of the reasoning included that the title was clearer, it managed their expectations better, or that it was more thorough in answering the questions that they had.  
* Participants also described the blue info alert as clear and concise.  
  * 1 participant preferred the blue info alert because it was “simplified” to them.  
  * The other participant did not have a preference because they misinterpreted the info alert as a generic message about how to apply for pension.  
* 3 out of 6 participants mentioned the sentence, “We always pay the higher amount.”  
  * 1 participant said this made the message clearer to them, while 1 interpreted this as “slapping on Veterans”  to not waste the Veteran’s time.

 > “\[The warning alert\] explained it more thoroughly, I believe, to me. I understand both of them, but the first one would have stopped me from going any further right there. It would’ve answered all the questions I had.” –P7

3. **Half of the participants said they would not apply for pension, and the other half said their next step would be to click on resource links.**  
* 3 out of 6 participants said they would not apply for pension as their next step.  
  * 1 participant already experienced applying for both and knew it wouldn't be worth their time.  
* The other 3 mentioned that they would click the links, “Review current pension rates” and “Learn about the differences between pension and disability”, even though they reiterated that pension won't increase their monthly payments.  
  * 1 mentioned that they were hesitant to apply because they are hesitant to reopen anything that would put their disability rating at risk, but also motivated to share what they learned with other Veterans. 

 > “I would definitely have to look at your first thing, ‘Review the pension rates’ and ‘Learn the differences’. Because it’s telling me it’s probably not going to be worth my while because I’m maxed out. But you say there are situations…” –P2

4. **Most participants noticed the Medicaid nursing home exception and raised additional questions.**   
* 3 out of 6 wanted to learn more about what situations would make it beneficial for them to apply.  
* Another 4th participant with a family member in a nursing home asked questions about whether the higher payment goes to the nursing home. 

 >  “So applying for Veterans pension will only increase my payment in some situations, like if I live in a Medicaid approved nursing home. See, I’d have to get more information because, I’ll be honest, when it comes to Medicaid, Medicare, that whole system confuses me. And then how that works with the VA, that just adds an extra layer of confusion for me.” \-P8

5. **Most participants had questions about Veterans pension as a benefit beyond what the introduction page provided.**  
* 2 out of 6 were familiar with Veterans pension as a needs-based benefit before the study.   
* 2 participants misunderstood pension eligibility:  
  * 1 participant assumed that pension is irrelevant to them because their age is not 65 or over.   
  * 1 participant interpreted the age eligibility criteria (65 or over) as a qualifying exception where pension is the greater benefit.  
* Some participants wanted to know how Veterans pension was related to aid and attendance, income levels, employment status, and/or military retirement pension.   
* *Study limitation: We prompted participants to imagine a scenario where they found the introduction page because they were interested in Veterans Pension, but because this is the only screen they were presented with, they do not experience a natural path – of potentially other resource pages – that drives them to this page.*

 >  “There were other things I would have liked to learn because of the definition of a pension as it relates to a pension…you got Social Security, you got private industry. So those things get those two or three different kinds of pensions and they get mixed up. And you get kinda confused as far as which is which, what is what.” \-P4

## **Recommendations**

1. **Move forward with the warning alert as our main message to Veterans with a 100% disability rating.** Our findings suggest that the warning alert's content is largely successful when we can retrieve the user’s disability alert, with the resource pages providing supplemental answers to questions that Veterans might have.

2. **Insert "We always pay the higher amount" into the blue info alert.** In case Veterans are unsure whether they can receive both benefits at the same time, this sentence may provide additional clarity.

3. **Consider utilizing a resource page to explain exception scenarios.** While these details may not fit in the alert itself, additional context may be helpful in either existing or new resource pages for Veterans that want to learn more, including the nuances surrounding the Medicaid nursing home rule.

4. **Integrate these findings into a resource page for the different types of pensions and other benefits.** [This C/IA intake ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/118378) already exists, but the page has not been published. This work can be further supported by the research we’ve conducted. 

5. **Consider how payment amounts are represented on the pension rate and disability rate pages.** Currently, pension displays annual amounts, and disability displays monthly amounts. The higher numbers on the pension page may mislead users to interpret pension as the greater benefit.
