## Research Goals

This research supports Veterans during the **Taking Care of Myself** and **Retiring** phases of the Veteran journey, specifically when they are evaluating financial benefits options and determining eligibility for needs-based assistance. 

**Key moments this research supports:**
- Veterans with 100% disability ratings exploring additional financial benefits
- Veterans evaluating whether to apply for Veterans Pension
- Veterans understanding the relationship between disability compensation and pension benefits

**Intended outcomes:**
- **For Veterans:** Provide clear, accurate information about benefit eligibility before they invest time in an application that will not increase their compensation
- **For VA:** Reduce processing time for applications from Veterans who are ineligible or unlikely to receive additional compensation due to existing disability benefits

**Guiding questions:**
- Will Veterans with 100% disability ratings understand that applying for pension is unlikely to increase their compensation?
- Does the messaging effectively prevent unnecessary applications while maintaining trust and clarity?
- What questions or concerns do Veterans have when presented with this information?

---

## Research Questions

* Do participants understand what the message is trying to tell them (standard alert)?
* After seeing the message, are Veterans more or less likely to fill out the pension form (standard alert)?
* What would Veterans do after seeing the message (standard alert)?
* Do participants understand what the message is trying to tell them (API-failed alert)?
* After seeing the message, are Veterans more or less likely to fill out the pension form (API-failed alert)?
* What would Veterans do after seeing the message (API-failed alert)?

---

## Methodology 

**Moderated Usability Testing (N=6):** Participants completed 30-minute remote sessions where they reviewed prototype screens of the Veterans Pension introduction page containing disability rating alerts. Sessions were conducted via Zoom between January 6-12, 2026. Participants were presented with two scenarios: one showing the standard alert (when disability rating was successfully retrieved) and one showing the API-failed alert (when rating could not be retrieved). The order of scenarios was alternated across participants to reduce bias.

---

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **Hypothesis:** For the standard alert, the Veteran will recognize that because of their high Disability Rating, filling out the Pension application does not make sense for them. 
  - **Likely True**  
  - Supporting evidence: All 6 participants (100%) demonstrated understanding that their current disability pay is the greater benefit.  3 of 6 participants (50%) stated they would not apply for pension as their next step.  However, the other 3 mentioned they would click resource links to learn more, indicating some hesitancy despite understanding the core message.

- **Hypothesis:** For the API-failed version of the alert, the Veteran will recognize that Disability Rating might have an impact on whether or not they should fill out the Pension form.
  - **Likely True**
  - Supporting evidence:  Participants understood the blue info alert communicated a relationship between disability rating and pension eligibility.  However, 1 of 6 participants misinterpreted the info alert as a generic message about how to apply for pension, suggesting the message could be clearer about the specific relevance to their situation. 

---

## Key Findings

1. **All participants demonstrated an understanding that their current disability pay is the greater benefit.** Participants recognized they already receive a higher payment than what pension might provide due to their 100% disability rating, and most explicitly stated they could not receive both benefits simultaneously.

2. **Most participants preferred the yellow warning alert for its detail. ** When comparing the two alert types, 4 of 6 participants indicated preference for the yellow warning alert because the title was clearer, it managed expectations better, and it was more thorough in answering their questions.

3. **Half of participants said they would not apply for pension, while the other half said their next step would be to click resource links.** Despite understanding that pension would not increase their compensation, 3 of 6 participants indicated they would still click links to "Review current pension rates" or "Learn about the differences between pension and disability" before making a final decision.

4. **Most participants noticed the Medicaid nursing home exception and raised additional questions. ** 3 of 6 participants wanted to learn more about what situations would make it beneficial for them to apply, and an additional participant with a family member in a nursing home had questions about how payments work in that scenario.

5. **Most participants had questions about Veterans pension as a benefit beyond what the introduction page provided.** Only 2 of 6 participants were familiar with Veterans pension as a needs-based benefit before the study.  Participants wanted to know how pension relates to aid and attendance, income levels, employment status, and military retirement pension.

## Details of Findings 

### Finding 1: All participants demonstrated an understanding that their current disability pay is the greater benefit

All 6 participants recognized they already receive a higher payment than what pension might provide due to their 100% disability rating. In terms of overall comprehension, participants described understanding that their disability compensation is the greater benefit and that applying for pension would not increase their monthly payment. 

- _Supporting data:  5 of 6 participants (83%) read the content of the yellow warning alert aloud without being prompted_
- _Supporting data: 4 of 6 participants (67%) explicitly reiterated that they could not receive both benefits at the same time_
- _Supporting data: **Participant quote:** "You have 100% and you have this [exception], if you don't, then they're gonna waste their time, but you will manage expectations.  And all the work that someone has to do on the backend to [process the claim]" (method and date not provided in topline summary)_

### Finding 2: Most participants preferred the yellow warning alert for its detail

Although the two alerts have different use cases, participants naturally compared the two alerts they were presented with. 4 of 6 participants (67%) indicated a preference for the yellow warning alert over the blue info alert. 

- _Supporting data:  Participants described the yellow warning alert as clearer because the title was more explicit, it managed their expectations better, and it was more thorough in answering the questions they had_
- _Supporting data: 1 of 6 participants (17%) preferred the blue info alert because it was "simplified" to them_
- _Supporting data: 1 of 6 participants (17%) did not have a preference because they misinterpreted the info alert as a generic message about how to apply for pension_
- _Supporting data: 3 of 6 participants (50%) mentioned the sentence, "We always pay the higher amount." One participant said this made the message clearer to them, while another interpreted this as "slapping on Veterans" to not waste the Veteran's time_
- _Supporting data: **Participant quote:** "[The warning alert] explained it more thoroughly, I believe, to me.  I understand both of them, but the first one would have stopped me from going any further right there.  It would've answered my questions" (method and date not provided in topline summary)_

### Finding 3: Half of participants said they would not apply for pension, while the other half said their next step would be to click resource links

Despite understanding that pension would not increase their compensation, half of participants indicated they would explore additional resources before deciding not to apply. 

- _Supporting data: 3 of 6 participants (50%) said they would not apply for pension as their next step_
- _Supporting data: 1 of 6 participants (17%) had already experienced applying for both benefits and knew it wouldn't be worth their time_
- _Supporting data:  3 of 6 participants (50%) mentioned they would click the links "Review current pension rates" and "Learn about the differences between pension and disability" even though they reiterated that pension wouldn't increase their payment_
- _Supporting data: 1 participant mentioned they were hesitant to apply because they are hesitant to reopen anything that would put their disability rating at risk, but also motivated to share what they learned with other Veterans_
- _Supporting data:  **Participant quote:** "I would definitely have to look at your first thing, 'Review the pension rates' and 'Learn the differences'.  Because it's telling me it's probably not going to be worth my while because I'm already getting a monthly benefit" (method and date not provided in topline summary)_

### Finding 4: Most participants noticed the Medicaid nursing home exception and raised additional questions

The mention of Medicaid nursing home as an exception scenario prompted questions from participants about edge cases where pension might be beneficial.

- _Supporting data: 3 of 6 participants (50%) wanted to learn more about what situations would make it beneficial for them to apply_
- _Supporting data: 1 additional participant (total 4 of 6, or 67%) with a family member in a nursing home asked questions about whether the higher payment goes to the nursing home_
- _Supporting data: **Participant quote:** "So applying for Veterans pension will only increase my payment in some situations, like if I live in a Medicaid approved nursing home. See, I'd have to get more information because, I'll be honest with you, I don't understand that" (method and date not provided in topline summary)_

### Finding 5: Most participants had questions about Veterans pension as a benefit beyond what the introduction page provided

Participants demonstrated limited familiarity with Veterans pension and had questions about how it relates to other benefits and eligibility criteria.

- _Supporting data: Only 2 of 6 participants (33%) were familiar with Veterans pension as a needs-based benefit before the study_
- _Supporting data:  2 of 6 participants (33%) misunderstood pension eligibility:  One participant assumed pension is irrelevant to them because their age is not 65 or over; another interpreted the age eligibility criteria (65 or over) as a qualifying exception where pension is the greater benefit_
- _Supporting data:  Participants wanted to know how Veterans pension was related to aid and attendance, income levels, employment status, and/or military retirement pension_
- _Supporting data: Study limitation noted in topline summary:  Participants were prompted to imagine a scenario where they found the introduction page because they were interested in Veterans Pension, but because this is the only screen they were shown, it's unclear whether they would have reached this page organically_
- _Supporting data: **Participant quote:** "There were other things I would have liked to learn because of the definition of a pension as it relates to a pension…you got Social Security, you got private industry.  So those things get thrown around and they need to be separated and clearly defined" (method and date not provided in topline summary)_

## Additional Insights

**One participant interpreted the phrase "We always pay the higher amount" negatively. ** While 3 of 6 participants mentioned this sentence and 1 found it clarifying, another participant interpreted it as "slapping on Veterans" to not waste the Veteran's time. This suggests the language, while factually accurate, may carry unintended emotional weight for some Veterans who perceive it as dismissive.

**The visual prominence of the yellow warning alert may have contributed to engagement.** 5 of 6 participants read the content of the yellow warning alert aloud without prompting, suggesting the warning alert format successfully captures attention. This level of unprompted engagement was not noted for the blue info alert.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Move forward with the warning alert as our main message to Veterans with a 100% disability rating.** (High Priority)
   - _Supporting evidence: This addresses Findings 1 and 2. All 6 participants (100%) demonstrated understanding that their current disability pay is the greater benefit, and 4 of 6 participants (67%) preferred the warning alert for its clarity and thoroughness._
   - Implementation: Implement the yellow warning alert on the Veterans Pension introduction page for authenticated Veterans with a verified 100% disability rating. Use the VADS warning alert component.  Test in staging environment with analytics tracking to monitor whether Veterans proceed past the introduction page or exit.  Success criteria: &gt;70% of Veterans with 100% disability ratings who see the alert do not proceed to start the application. 

2. **Insert "We always pay the higher amount" into the blue info alert.** (Medium Priority)
   - _Supporting evidence: This addresses Finding 1. While 3 of 6 participants (50%) mentioned this sentence and 1 found it clarifying, inclusion of this statement may provide additional clarity for Veterans unsure whether they can receive both benefits simultaneously.  4 of 6 participants (67%) explicitly reiterated they could not receive both benefits._
   - Implementation: Add the sentence "We always pay the higher amount" to the blue info alert shown when the disability rating cannot be retrieved via API. This ensures consistency in messaging about benefit exclusivity.  Test with 5-8 Veterans to validate that &gt;80% understand they cannot receive both benefits simultaneously.

3. **Consider utilizing a resource page to explain exception scenarios.** (Medium Priority)
   - _Supporting evidence: This addresses Finding 4. 3 of 6 participants (50%) wanted to learn more about situations that would make it beneficial to apply, and 1 additional participant asked specific questions about nursing home payment scenarios._
   - Implementation: Create or enhance an existing resource page that explains edge cases where pension may provide higher compensation than disability (e.g., Medicaid nursing home residents). Link to this resource from the alert using language like "Learn about exceptions" or "When pension may be beneficial." Work with pension SMEs to ensure accuracy of exception scenarios.  Success criteria: Veterans can find and understand exception information without contacting the call center.

4. **Integrate these findings into a resource page for the different types of pensions and other benefits.** (Low Priority)
   - _Supporting evidence: This addresses Finding 5. Only 2 of 6 participants (33%) were familiar with Veterans pension as a needs-based benefit before the study, and 2 participants misunderstood pension eligibility.  Participants wanted clarification on how pension relates to aid and attendance, income levels, employment status, and military retirement pension._
   - Implementation: Reference existing C/IA intake ticket for pension content strategy.  Develop comprehensive resource content that differentiates between VA pension, military retirement pension, Social Security, and other benefit types. Include plain-language definitions, eligibility criteria, and interaction between benefits. This work should be coordinated with content and information architecture teams.

5. **Consider how payment amounts are represented on the pension rate and disability rate pages.** (Low Priority)
   - _Supporting evidence: This addresses Finding 3. Despite understanding pension wouldn't increase their payment, 3 of 6 participants (50%) indicated they would click links to review pension rates and learn about differences between pension and disability._
   - Implementation: Audit the pension rate tables and disability compensation rate tables to ensure consistency in format (monthly vs. annual) and clear labeling.  Currently, pension displays annual amounts while disability displays monthly amounts—the higher numbers on pension pages may create confusion. Consider standardizing both to monthly amounts or providing clear conversion information.  Test with 6-8 Veterans to validate understanding of comparative payment amounts.

## Product User and Business Outcomes

### Desired User Outcome
Veterans with 100% disability ratings can quickly and accurately determine whether applying for Veterans Pension will increase their monthly compensation, saving them time and effort.

This research directly supports this outcome by validating that the disability rating alert successfully communicates to Veterans that their current disability compensation is the greater benefit.  All 6 participants (100%) demonstrated understanding of this core message.  Findings 1 and 2 confirm the yellow warning alert is clear and thorough.  However, Finding 3 reveals that even with understanding, 50% of participants indicated they would still explore resource links before deciding not to apply. This suggests the alert is working as intended—it's not blocking access but is providing informed decision-making support.  Implementation of Recommendations 3 and 4 (resource pages about exceptions and benefit types) will further support Veterans in making confident decisions without needing to contact VA for clarification.

### Desired Business Outcome
Reduce the volume of pension applications from Veterans with 100% disability ratings who are unlikely to receive additional compensation, allowing pension processors to focus on applications more likely to result in benefit awards.

This research supports this outcome by demonstrating that the alert messaging is understood and influences Veteran behavior. Finding 1 shows all participants understood they already receive the greater benefit, and Finding 3 shows that half explicitly stated they would not apply after seeing the message. While the other half indicated they would explore resources first, providing clear resource content (Recommendations 3 and 4) should help those Veterans self-determine that applying is not beneficial. If implemented, we expect to see a measurable decrease in applications from Veterans with 100% disability ratings, particularly those who do not qualify for exception scenarios like Medicaid nursing home residence.

---

## Key Performance Indicators

### KPI 1: Application Start Rate for Veterans with 100% Disability Ratings
This research validates that the warning alert successfully communicates the core message that disability compensation is the greater benefit (Finding 1). We recommend establishing a baseline measurement of how many Veterans with 100% disability ratings currently start pension applications before the alert is implemented, then tracking whether this rate decreases post-implementation.  Success would be defined as a &gt;30% reduction in application starts from this population.

### KPI 2: Click-Through Rate on Resource Links
This research revealed that 3 of 6 participants (50%) indicated they would click resource links to "Review current pension rates" or "Learn about the differences between pension and disability" before making a final decision (Finding 3). We recommend tracking click-through rates on these links to understand how many Veterans seek additional information before deciding whether to apply. High click-through rates would validate the need for comprehensive resource content (Recommendations 3 and 4).

### KPI 3: Pension Application Completion Rate for Veterans with 100% Disability Ratings Who Proceed Past the Alert
For Veterans who see the alert but choose to proceed with the application, we should track completion rates and award rates. If the alert is working correctly, Veterans who proceed past it should primarily be those in exception scenarios (e.g., Medicaid nursing home residents) and should have higher award rates than the general population of 100% disabled Veterans applying for pension. 

### KPI 4: Call Center Inquiries About Pension Eligibility for 100% Disabled Veterans
This research revealed that most participants had questions about pension beyond what the introduction page provided (Finding 5), and half wanted to learn more about exception scenarios (Finding 4). We recommend tracking call center inquiries related to pension eligibility for Veterans with 100% disability ratings.  If resource content is effective (Recommendations 3 and 4), we should see a decrease in these inquiries over time.

## Further Research Needed

### Research Gaps

- **Organic navigation patterns to the pension introduction page**:  This study prompted participants to imagine they were interested in applying for pension and had reached the introduction page. We did not observe how Veterans with 100% disability ratings naturally navigate to this page or what motivates them to explore pension.  Understanding organic behavior would help us determine whether additional messaging should be placed earlier in the navigation flow.  Suggested approach: Analytics review of navigation paths for Veterans with 100% disability ratings who reach the pension introduction page, supplemented by 6-8 intercept interviews or diary studies.

- **Long-term behavior after seeing the alert**: We observed immediate reactions during 30-minute sessions but did not track whether Veterans returned to the page later or contacted the call center with questions. Understanding whether the alert has lasting impact or creates follow-up confusion is important.  Suggested approach: Follow-up survey or interviews with Veterans who saw the alert in production 2-4 weeks after implementation. 

- **Effectiveness of resource content for exception scenarios**: Finding 4 revealed that participants wanted more information about Medicaid nursing home exceptions and other scenarios, but we did not test whether specific resource content would adequately answer their questions. Suggested approach: Content testing with 6-8 Veterans to validate that resource pages about exception scenarios are clear and sufficient to support decision-making without call center contact.

- **Impact on Veterans in actual exception scenarios**: This study recruited Veterans with 100% disability ratings but did not specifically recruit those in Medicaid nursing homes or other exception scenarios where pension may be beneficial. We need to ensure the alert does not inadvertently discourage Veterans in legitimate exception scenarios from applying. Suggested approach: Targeted interviews with 4-6 Veterans in nursing homes or receiving aid and attendance to validate that alert language about exceptions is clear and does not create barriers.

## Research Participants

### Recruitment Criteria
Participants were recruited through Perigean to include Veterans with verified 100% disability ratings who had experience using VA. gov to file claims.  These criteria ensured participants represented the specific audience who would see the disability rating alert in a production environment.

We talked to **6 participants.**

### Demographics

**Audience Segment:**

### Underserved Groups We Haven't Talked To

This research does not include adequate representation of the following marginalized Veteran groups: 

* **Rural Veterans**:  Recruited 1 of target (research plan specified 25% rural target = ~2 participants). Rural Veterans may have different access patterns to benefit information and may rely more heavily on online resources. 
* **Veterans 65+**:  Recruited 2 of 6 (33%). Given that age 65+ is a pension eligibility criterion and that some participants misunderstood the relationship between age and pension eligibility, greater representation from this age group would strengthen findings.
* **Veterans with high school education or less**: Recruited 0 of target (research plan specified 25% without degree = ~2 participants). Veterans with lower education levels may have different comprehension patterns for alert messaging.
* **Women Veterans**: Recruited 0 of target (research plan specified 10% women = 1 participant). Women Veterans may have different benefit awareness patterns and may respond differently to messaging. 
* **Veterans of color**: Recruited unknown (research plan specified 30% people of color = ~2 participants; race data was not collected). Ensuring benefit messaging serves diverse racial and ethnic communities is critical to equitable access. 
* **Veterans using assistive technology**: Recruited 0.  Accessibility testing is needed to ensure alert content is properly formatted and comprehensible for screen reader users, magnification users, and other assistive technology users.

**Recommendation**:  Follow-up research or validation testing should specifically target these underserved groups to ensure design recommendations serve the full Veteran population, particularly women Veterans, Veterans with lower education levels, Veterans of color, and Veterans using assistive technology.
