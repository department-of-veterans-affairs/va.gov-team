## **Project Background**

View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024-09%20527EZ%20VSO%20Research/VSO%20Research%20Plan.md)

Shortly after relaunching the web-based version of the Veterans Pension form (VA Form 21P-527EZ) in January 2024, the Pension & Burial Program (PBP) team conducted a usability study of the form. Through this research, we discovered that the majority of our participants were likely not eligible for Veterans Pension. We have since learned that pension-eligible Veterans can be challenging to contact and recruit, as many of them are in later stages of life, may be in assisted living facilities, and are likely to be experiencing significant health challenges or financial hardship. 

While our team is seeking opportunities to connect directly with this population, we decided to speak with Veteran Service Officers (VSOs) who work with pension-eligible Veterans as a valuable first step to learn more about the experience of learning about, applying for, receiving, and maintaining Veterans Pension benefits.

## **Research Goals**

The goals of this study are to better understand:

1. VSOs’ experiences working with Veterans on Veterans Pension claims  
2. VSOs’ perception of the 527EZ, as well as the experience of applying for and receiving Veterans Pension  
3. VSOs’ perspectives on the challenges associated with the 527EZ and/or the process of applying for Veterans Pension generally 

## **Research Questions**

1. What is the VSOs’ experience helping Veterans understand Veterans Pension benefits?  
2. What is the VSOs’ experience helping eligible Veterans apply for Veterans Pension benefits?   
3. What are VSOs’ perceptions of Veterans’ experience of receiving and maintaining Veterans Pension benefits?

## **Methodology**

We conducted six moderated interviews with Veteran Service Officers (VSOs) via Zoom. Each session lasted approximately one hour. 

We utilized “by proxy methodology” in this study; while our team is in the process of recruiting pension-eligible Veterans for a future study, the VSOs we spoke to acted as "proxies" by sharing their experiences and perspectives working with pension-eligible Veterans. We look forward to validating the findings from this study with pension-eligible Veterans and their families directly.

With this study, a trauma-informed approach included:

* Prioritizing a participant's well being and time over completing our conversation guide  
* Acknowledging that many VSOs are Veterans themselves and may therefore have their own perspective on these processes outside of their role as a VSO. Consider asking participants if they are Veterans and, when applicable, invite them to share any personal experiences they may have with the subject matter.   
* When asking if they would like to participate in future research, disclose how their info will be used if they express interest (i.e. our database of VSOs that have expressed willingness to participate in research)  
* Allowing space at the end of each session so a participant can ask questions, or sometimes, just vent 
* Scheduling a 15 minute debrief after every research session

This study was part of a limited pilot program focused on defining a process for recruiting VSOs. As part of this pilot, we had access to a limited participant pool, which constrained our ability to recruit participants based on a variety of demographic characteristics.

[Additional information about the pilot program and guidance on conducting research with accredited representatives can be found here](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/vaabdvro/EbVMvXvUnfhOtq_U7N-eT08BQlEMpYWLU-yMrQE-1zVsIA?e=l34sBc) (Sharepoint).

**Who we talked to**:

* 6 VSOs, 4 of whom are Veterans:  
  * 5 County VSOs (CVSOs)  
  * 1 State VSO (SVSO)  
* Experience as a VSO:  
  * between 3-34 years  
* Geographic locations:  
  * 4 states were represented:  
    * 5 VSOs were based in rural areas  
    * 1 VSO was based in an urban area

## **Key Findings**

1. Pension-eligible Veterans typically contact VSOs when they are already in dire financial need, potentially missing out on benefits they could have accessed sooner.

2. While VSOs are effectively reaching some Veterans through a variety of channels, it remains challenging to proactively connect with some pension-eligible Veterans.

3. Many pension-eligible Veterans may not be self-sufficient and are almost always supported by a family member or caregiver when working with a VSO.

4. Due to the complexity of Veterans Pension, many VSOs prefer to work with applicants in person to address questions and concerns in real time and ensure application accuracy.

5. Citing Veterans Pension as one of the most complicated benefits to apply for, VSOs recommend Veterans seek help from an accredited representative to help avoid costly application errors and delays.

6. VSOs frequently named marriage history, financial information, and medical expenses as the most challenging sections of the application for Veterans to complete due to the complexity or volume of information required.

7. VSOs frequently report the presence of pension poachers—individuals or companies that exploit Veterans by offering fraudulent services or charging high fees for assistance. This predatory behavior complicates the process and increases the risk of errors or scams for vulnerable Veterans.

8. In the face of recent increases in claim processing times, VSOs recommend waiting to gather all necessary evidence prior to submitting an application for a faster decision.

9. After submitting an application, Veterans often reach out to VSOs about claim status, development letters, and overpayments, underscoring the need for ongoing communication and support at every stage of the application process.

## **Details of Findings**

## **Research Question \#1: What is the VSOs’ experience helping Veterans understand Veterans Pension benefits?**

### **Finding 1: Pension-eligible Veterans typically contact VSOs when they are already in dire financial need, potentially missing out on benefits they could have accessed sooner**

When pension-eligible Veterans and their families contact VSOs, they are not often seeking out Veterans Pension benefits specifically. Rather, they are looking to VSOs to help get them qualified for VA benefits in general.

#### **Increased medical needs and depleted finances**

Across our interviews, we heard that pension-eligible Veterans have often depleted all of their resources when they contact VSOs. Additionally, many have either recently entered into an assisted living facility or are considering doing so. 

> P5: "Late stage of life, dementia, need help, can't take care of mom and dad anymore, they've moved up to rural \[area\]. The property is too big, whatever, all those problems. Yeah, it's usually the medical needs have increased. They need help being taken care of."

#### **Eligibility**

When seeking support from a VSO, most of these Veterans and their families don’t know what benefit(s) they might be eligible for; rather, they’re typically looking for help to “get eligible” for benefits. It may be up to the VSO to act as a detective to see what VA benefits their client may be eligible for. With this in mind, VSOs said they don’t often come across Veterans who believe themselves to be eligible for Veterans Pension but aren’t.

Several VSOs mentioned encountering Veterans on the cusp of eligibility for Veterans Pension. These are Veterans who may be unable to afford their medical expenses but are “too rich” to qualify for pension benefits. Explaining the income limits can be challenging; more challenging still, one VSO said he often has to explain that the VA only pays for incurred costs, not expected costs. This may mean that Veterans or families who are already struggling financially may need to pay upfront for medical costs with only the hope that they will qualify for VA benefits and receive a retroactive lump sum payment. 

> P1: "Normally when they come in they truly don't have a clue what they're eligible for...we start from scratch. I'm looking at their 214, I'm asking them questions and determining what I can get them qualified for, you know, through the whole benefit series, not just a pension."

> P2: “A lot of people want to say 'hey, can I apply now so it's ready to go when I'm in need?' Which I think is actually a very valid question when it comes to pension. If we have everything in place, then we just need to report, 'hey, I'm now at that asset limit.' It really could help a lot of our applicants. What we do see is that pension does take some time, especially the gathering of documents…and then the actual claims process…Sometimes these people are really up there and may be end of life or maybe waited too long to apply cause they didn't know about the benefit and then it takes so long for it to actually kick in."

#### **Complex relationship between Medicaid and VA benefits** 

The complex relationship between Medicaid and some VA benefits may further drive Veterans to be in dire straits by the time they apply for Veterans Pension. A couple of VSOs mentioned Veterans dwindling down their money in order to qualify for Medicaid, only to be told to apply for VA benefits first, thereby realizing they could have been eligible for benefits years ago. We also heard that this complicated relationship with Medicaid can continue after pension benefits are awarded–the receipt of a retroactive lump sum payment may result in the Veteran being automatically kicked off of Medicaid.

> P5: "Something that I am disappointed with…people will dwindle down their money to Medicaid rates. They'll have about 3,000 bucks left and then they'll go and apply for county assistance. And then the county tells them, well, you gotta apply for VA assistance first. And then they find out they could have applied three years ago."

| **Recommendations:**
* Explore opportunities to inform Veterans and their families of Veterans Pension before they are in dire straits, including those who may be on the cusp of eligibility for Veterans Pension.
* Share this report with groups who can impact programming and messaging related to the relationship between Medicaid and VA benefits on VA.gov, such as CAIA.

### 

### **Finding 2: While VSOs are effectively reaching some Veterans through a variety of channels, it remains challenging to proactively connect with some pension-eligible Veterans**

#### **VSO-driven outreach: referrals and community outreach**

Referrals are the most common way that pension-eligible Veterans get connected with VSOs; these referrals come from a range of organizations, most often from assisted living facilities and both VA and civilian hospitals. One VSO noted that his office receives a notification from a state-wide database whenever a Veteran or Veteran spouse enters a care facility. He then sends a letter about aid and attendance benefits with his office’s contact information, meaning that every Veteran or spouse of a Veteran entering a care facility in that state is receiving communications from his office.

Many VSOs also do a wide range of community outreach activities, including regularly visiting assisted living facilities to proactively share information about benefits such as Veterans Pension. One VSO made it clear that there isn’t one place to find all eligible Veterans, and emphasized the importance of casting a wide net to reach those who may not already be engaging the VA for benefits.

> P3: "Part of my outreach is to leave information for them to give to Veterans who come into their \[assisted living\] facilities. So that's a great way to do that outreach because then…a lot of times they just contact me directly."

> P4: "Sometimes we rely a little too much on \[community centers\]. Everybody in that room is probably already getting benefits from our office, right? So \[in a\] rural community, spread out really well, I have to reach them through all forms of communication...you gotta cast a wide net."

#### **Beyond VSO-driven outreach: word of mouth and state programs (including Medicaid)**

Beyond proactive efforts by VSOs, word of mouth is another common way that Veterans find out about benefits like Veterans Pension, particularly from family members. One VSO noted that Veterans are often encouraged by a trusted source, typically a family member, to seek out benefits. This is especially important for those who are “VA-shy” or have negative past experiences with the VA.

> P3: "Word of mouth is really huge in this county…A lot of times it's somebody suggesting they apply, especially if they're VA shy, you know, if they've not had a good experience in the past. And so usually it takes a spouse or a family member to encourage that."

Alternatively, Veterans may find out about Veterans Pension through state programs, most notably while applying for Medicaid. We heard from several VSOs that in their state, when a Veteran goes to apply for Medicaid, they are required to apply for VA benefits first, as the expectation is that federal funds are utilized before state funds.

> P2: "Primarily, the only other option if somebody doesn't tell them about \[pension\] is when a Veteran goes to apply for Medicaid and they're forced to apply for VA benefits first.”

| **Recommendations:**
* Consider informing Veterans and families of the relationship between Medicaid and Veterans Pension on the online form.
* Future research opportunity: Validate how pension-eligible Veterans and their families who apply without the help of an accredited representative typically learn about Veterans Pension.
* \[Potentially out of scope\] Identify what group(s) work on messaging and outreach strategies to inform Veterans about Veterans Pension beyond VA.gov.

##  **Research Question \#2: What is the VSOs’ experience helping eligible Veterans apply for Veterans Pension benefits?**

### **Finding 3: Many pension-eligible Veterans may not be self-sufficient and are almost always supported by a family member or caregiver when working with a VSO**

For pension applicants, family members or caregivers are often heavily involved in or are driving the application process. Oftentimes, the VSO may interface more with the family member than the Veteran themselves. This is because the Veteran is likely to be in an assisted living facility and/or may be experiencing significant health or cognitive challenges such as dementia.

In cases where VSOs work more closely with Veterans without a family member, they cited examples including the pension being needed to help with a spouse's medical bills, or perhaps the Veteran is in stronger health or may be experiencing a physical limitation but not a cognitive one, which allows them to better advocate for themselves.

> P5: "As a matter of fact, we see more family, spouse and extended family than the actual claimant because the claimant is up at the nursing home, you know, and can't get out. So these family members will come seeking information and we'll provide what we can."

| **Recommendations:**
* Future research opportunity: Since family members in particular are often involved in applying for a Veterans Pension, conduct research with this population to better understand their experience and needs as users of the 527EZ.
* Future research opportunity: Validate if Veterans who fill out the 527EZ are doing so by themselves, or if they are also commonly supported by a family member or caregiver. If family members or caregivers are commonly filling out the 527EZ on a Veteran’s behalf, consider designing an experience catered specifically toward this group within the online form.

### 

### **Finding 4: Due to the complexity of Veterans Pension, many VSOs prefer to work with applicants in person to address questions and concerns in real time and ensure application accuracy**

VSOs will work in whatever way is easiest for the claimant, but prefer working on pension claims in person. In-person appointments typically occur at the VSO’s office or in-home (including assisted living facilities). 

The way VSOs prefer to work with applicants on filing a pension claim lends itself better to in-person collaboration. Typically, they give Veterans and their families “homework”–a checklist or set of instructions detailing what information is needed in support of their claim–to complete prior to meeting to work on the claim. 

Aside from asking Veterans and their families to compile necessary documents prior to working together, VSOs are committed to doing everything on behalf of their client. All of the VSOs we spoke to use third party software to complete, file, and manage claims for their clients. More specifically, three of our participants use VetPro, and the other three use VetraSpec. VSOs rely on the ability to pull information from VBMS to make what they perceive to be the most complicated form with the VA simpler and easier to fill out.

> P3: “A lot of the time I'll give them a homework list. You know, ‘these are the things that we need from you’ and then we'll set up another appointment for them to come back with that information." 

> P2: "We get \[eligibility requirements\] established first. And then I let them know that in our world, we believe that pension is probably one of the most complicated claims. At a minimum, we are going to meet at least twice to get this claim to go through. And so...cause there's a lot of questions...a lot of explanation when it comes to pension...we really do try to meet with them in person, whether that be a home visit or right here in our office."

By phone is the second-most common way VSOs work with pension-eligible claimants.

Email was rarely mentioned as an option utilized by pension-eligible Veterans. We heard from a couple of VSOs that older Veterans are either not very good with digital technology and/or aren’t interested in using it. Two VSO noted that people in their rural communities, particularly older Veterans, often don’t have reliable or consistent access to the internet.

| **Recommendations:**
* Future research opportunity: Knowing that digital options are rarely utilized by pension-eligible Veterans working with VSOs, who are the users of the 527EZ, and what challenges do they face during their self-service experience?

### **Finding 5: Citing Veterans Pension as one of the most complicated benefits to apply for, VSOs recommend Veterans seek help from an accredited representative to help avoid costly application errors and delays** 

For Veterans and families who start an application on their own, VSOs cite the length and complexity of the application as common reasons that lead applicants to seek help. For those who submit a claim on their own, they often seek assistance from a VSO because they receive a development letter they don’t understand.

> P3: "Most of them don't understand any of it and it's just overwhelming. It's a long, long form and they're just coming to us to help them fill out the form."

> P2: "First off if you just look at the length of the application on pension people automatically wave the white flag and say 'hey, I need some help."

All of the VSOs we spoke to said that it makes their job more difficult when a Veteran or their family has attempted, or worse, completed, a pension application without their help. If a claimant seeks out help after starting an application, VSOs will almost always start fresh as the in-progress claims are not likely to be correct. We heard from VSOs that it's better if the applicant comes in before submitting anything on their own. If they submit on their own without VSO assistance, the path to a decision on the claim is more likely to be drawn out through back-and-forth correspondence with the VA via development letters.

> P2: "We do get quite a few who have tried to go online and just get exhausted by it or just don't understand the process. I would say it's a pretty significant amount that have tried to do it on their own. In fact, a good majority of them come in with printed off applications handwritten and say, 'I don't know what I'm doing here.’ And we just kind of start the process over and…hit the reset button.'”

> P6: "Pretty much anyone coming in with a next of kin, the next of kin has probably attempted on their own and gone 'oh, that's a lot.’ And then they find somebody to help them with it. It's not too often that the forms are actually correct...I'm going to redo it anyway."

At least one VSO said that he specifically discourages his clients from going online to file a pension claim. He mentioned seeing many cases where family members, particularly children or grandchildren of the Veteran, will explore the online form or encourage their Veteran family member to try it.

> P1: "Usually when they go through sharks or va.gov and try to do it themselves \[the claim is\] a hot mess. And we're doing a lot of clean up, a lot of clean up these days."

The estimated number of claimants that have attempted the application before working with a VSO varied greatly throughout our interviews–while one VSO said that most come directly to her office rather than try the application on their own, another estimated that 75% of the claimants he works with have already attempted the application before working with him.

| **Recommendations:**
* Consider if there are certain circumstances best suited to self service on VA.gov, and others where we may recommend working with an accredited representative to file a pension claim.

### 

### **Finding 6: VSOs frequently named marriage history, financial information, and medical expenses as the most challenging sections of the application for Veterans to complete due to the complexity or volume of information required**

Across these three sections of the form, we heard that the information needed in these sections was often difficult for Veterans and their families to understand, remember, or obtain supporting documentation for. Additionally, VSOs noted that Veterans and their families are surprised by how much information is required for a pension claim, often questioning why the VA needs certain information.

#### **Marriage history**

All but one of the VSOs we spoke to noted the difficulties associated with the marriage history section, particularly prior marriages. Not only is marriage history information difficult for Veterans to remember, but it can be challenging and time consuming to obtain official records if the Veteran or family does not already have that information readily available.

One VSO noted that he and his staff will indicate ‘no prior marriages’ on claims in these situations, hoping that the VA won’t catch it due to the difficulty often associated with tracking down this information. Additionally, some of the VSOs we spoke shared that the value of this including this information in the claim is unclear. 

> P5: “The marriages can prove to be insanely difficult sometimes.”

> P2: "If a Veteran has been married to a spouse for the last 25 years, and we're able to report that information, does it really matter that they were married, you know, 40 years ago at that point? And what weight does that have on the claim?"

#### **Financial information and the Income and Asset Statement (21P-0969)**

Financial information was noted as another difficult section of the application due to the information being complex and the documentation required sometimes being difficult to obtain. Assets were frequently mentioned as being particularly challenging to both track down and explain. Additionally, required information can be highly context dependent–for example, one VSO has learned from experience that lakefront properties commonly need to be accounted for in his county due to the location.

Oftentimes, VSOs may either be dealing with family members who don’t have ready access to required financial information and/or a Veteran or spouse who is experiencing cognitive difficulties and may not remember the information or have trouble answering the questions. Additionally, one VSO noted that some Veterans may hold back on financial information; either because they think it may affect their eligibility or because they question why so much information is required.

Five out of the six VSOs we spoke to estimated that more than 50% of claimants applying for pension need to complete the Income and Asset Statement (21P-0969), a supplemental form to provide supporting financial evidence. A couple of VSOs explained that even if a Veteran is at the Medicaid level or is receiving any income outside of Social Security, they will likely have to complete an 0969\.

> P6: "’Why do they need x, y, z? Why do they need bank statements? Why do they need to know X amount of dollars in this account?’, especially when you're filling out that 0969. And you have to explain...there's a max asset and then there's the actual income that you're allowed. And...you gotta meet all of the numbers. Sometimes if you can explain the why with Veterans, they usually are a little more willing to cooperate."

> P3: "With the pension claim, Veterans are just surprised we're asking so many questions about their finances."

> P4: "\[Many have to do the 0969\] for something stupid too. \[If you have any\] income outside of Social Security, then you have to do the 0969.”

#### **Medical expenses and the Medical Expense Report (21P-8416)**

Due to the complexity of the medical expense section of the form, VSOs noted that development letters related to this section are common. Examples of the reasons for development letters include medical expenses being reported prior to the ITF date or requesting more information to clarify the reported medical expenses. 

One VSO shared that it can be challenging to explain some medical expenses, such as stays in multiple care facilities, directly on the 527\. To preempt development letters seeking clarification on medical expenses, he often submits a buddy statement (Statement in Support of Claim, VA Form 21-4138) to explain the expenses in narrative form rather than rely only on the design of the 527 to communicate the necessary information.

In the case of the Medical Expense Report (21P-8416), a supplementary form to report eligible medical expenses, there appeared to be a relationship between the experience level of the VSO and how often they felt the 8416 was necessary for their clients to fill out. VSOs with more experience said that they can usually avoid submitting an 8416 by fitting most medical expenses within the 527 itself. In many cases, this is because it’s not necessary to report all of a Veteran’s expenses to obtain the maximum benefit. This is one way that we heard VSOs try to ease the burden when completing this section. For example, they won’t report all of a Veteran’s medical expenses if they know that the cost of the care facility alone will exceed the Veteran’s income and maximize the benefit.

> P6: “Not many need to submit \[the 8416\] right away. There's some that we submit \[later\] like for the next year to adjust expenses, but that's not real usual. I've maybe seen like 3 or 4 this year." 

> P2: "I think sometimes the flow on the form can be hard to process for the VA, at least that's our interpretation of it. So…our most common development letters basically say we're not understanding your medical expenses. And so we just kind of have to spell it out a little bit \[on the 4138\] for them to calculate maybe what that benefit should have been.”

| **Recommendations:**
* Explore opportunities to ease form completion and processing burden, such as:
*  Revisit (with VBA partners) what information on the form is essential and clarify the ‘why’ behind the information needed within the form itself.
*  Integrate approaches utilized by VSOs into form content and design, such as guidance to minimize the reporting of medical expenses while maximizing the benefit.
*  Incorporate more dynamic user experiences into the form, such as a dynamic medical expenses calculator.
*  Continue to pursue opportunities to prefill information on the form where possible.
*  Explore the idea of a “buddy statement” within the 527EZ for medical expenses.
* Consider the prioritization of digitizing the Income and Asset Statement relative to other PBP team initiatives, knowing that this supplemental form is used by upwards of 50% of pension applicants.
* Future research opportunity: Validate whether or not these are the most challenging sections for pension-eligible Veterans and their families to fill out on the online form.

### **Finding 7: VSOs frequently report the presence of pension poachers—individuals or companies that exploit Veterans by offering fraudulent services or charging high fees for assistance. This predatory behavior complicates the process and increases the risk of errors or scams for vulnerable Veterans**

A claim shark is an individual or company that is not VA accredited and charges fees to help Veterans file for VA benefits. While some accredited representatives may charge fees for services, a claim shark is not VA accredited, meaning they aren’t required to adhere to the professional and ethical standards of VA accreditation. 

Pension poachers are a type of claim shark focused specifically on targeting pension-eligible Veterans and families. They target assisted living facilities, contribute to confusion and misinformation with their online presence, and even utilize VA.gov to instruct Veterans to screenshot and share their own private information as part of a ploy to convince Veterans to pay them for their services.

One VSO noted that pension-eligible Veterans and families often come to her looking for help after working with or being abandoned by a shark. 

We heard from several VSOs that they want to see more advertising of their services on VA.gov. This is because they believe Veterans will be more successful in their claim if they work with a VSO and that more prevalent advertising of accredited reps on VA.gov will help steer Veterans away from working with sharks. 

> P1: Those sharks out there target \[facilities\] to get people to file for pension and charge them to file."

> P4: "The pension poachers, those bad people, actually direct them to your website to get information to help them charge Veterans. If there could be a disclaimer on VA.gov letting them know that the accredited representative was there to help them, that'd be really beneficial." 

> P2: "I feel the VA has done what I believe is an access issue where they wanna make sure Veterans or applicants have access to do it, which is great, but why not really just push, 'hey, would you like somebody to do this for you?' cause that's what we're here to do....’Before you proceed, would you like to know about a service officer nearby that can do this for you?' They click 'no, I wanna do it,' fine, go ahead. But that's our biggest challenge...getting our information out, letting them know that there are people there to help with this process.”

| **Recommendations:**
* Consider providing information about pension poachers and/or making information about accredited representatives more visible on the 527EZ.
* Share findings with relevant groups to inform content about accredited representatives on VA.gov.

### **Finding 8: In the face of recent increases in claim processing times, VSOs recommend waiting to gather all necessary evidence prior to submitting an application for a faster decision**

We heard from several VSOs that waiting to make sure a claim has all necessary forms and documents before submission can lead to fewer development letters and a faster decision time from the VA. This has become particularly important as VSOs have observed the processing time increase substantially in recent years. 

> P6: "I try and get all of the information together at the same time so we're not wasting time through due process with development letters…By waiting and making sure that it's fully developed before submitting, we've had much better success rates."

#### **Fully Developed Claim (FDC) program**

The Fully Developed Claim (FDC) program is designed to provide a faster decision to applicants who include all evidence or supporting documents when filing their claim.

Most of the VSOs we spoke to said they utilize the FDC program by checking the “fully developed claim” box on the pension application. However, when we asked if the FDC program resulted in faster processing times for their claims, all but one VSO said no. 

Despite the FDC program seemingly not having an impact on processing times, some VSOs are checking claims as "fully developed" whether or not they actually are, mistakenly thinking that claims marked “fully developed” are guaranteed to be processed faster.

> P5: “All we do is FDCs. But are they fully developed? They might not be.”

One VSO with extensive experience referred to FDC as “old language.” When talking about FDC, he doesn’t expect that actually marking claims as “fully developed” will have an impact on the processing timeframe. Rather, he uses the term “fully developed claim” to mean that “everything that’s needed is within the claim and it’s ready to be granted or denied whichever way the VA decides it.” 

| **Recommendations:**
* Revisit whether we should include information about the Fully Developed Claim (FDC) program on our form.
* Revisit the language in our form about supporting documentation to clarify how submitting all documentation at once may impact processing times.

## **Research Question \#3: What are VSOs’ perceptions of Veterans’ experience of receiving and maintaining Veterans Pension benefits?**

### **Finding 9: After submitting an application, Veterans often reach out to VSOs about claim status, development letters, and overpayments, underscoring the need for ongoing communication and support at every stage of the application process.**

#### **Claim status checks**

Status checks are one of the most common touch points VSOs have with Veterans and families after a claim has been filed. This may be due in part to the long processing times Veterans and their families are currently experiencing–all VSOs we spoke to reported an increase in claims processing times in recent years, with cited averages from 3 to 12 months. 

All of the VSOs we spoke to expressed concern about the timeframe and how the increase and variability in processing time has made it challenging for them to set accurate expectations with their clients. As a result, Veterans and their families are often shocked and discouraged to learn how long processing times are.

> P1: "A couple years ago, if we had a homeless person, it could be 30-60 days. Now we see our pension claims taking a year or longer and we don't understand why."

> P3: "And that \[timeframe\] is kind of discouraging, I think, to some families. And I've heard the comment on a couple of occasions, ‘are they waiting for them to die so they don't have to pay?’”

> P2: "We used to be able to very confidently say, 'by the time I put this in, we're looking at about 90 days.' That's where we used to be. We're not there anymore. We're seeing them closer to six months. Some of them still move pretty quick. It really is just kind of hit and miss, which makes it very difficult for our service officers to really give a timeframe on it because it's just all over the board right now."

#### **Development letters**

All of the VSOs we spoke to said they instruct their clients to inform them if they receive development letters from the VA so that the VSO can answer on their behalf. When it comes to pension, development letters are often related to medical or financial information.

The percentage of development letters VSOs receive in response to their pension claims varies widely. Generally speaking, VSOs with less experience reported a higher percentage of development letters, while more experienced VSOs reported lower percentages. Comparing what we heard across participants, the complexity of pension creates a steep learning curve to filing successful claims. One VSO said as he has gained more experience, he feels more confident in helping his clients provide the right information upfront, resulting in a reduction in development letters.

VSOs try to proactively prevent development letters by advising Veterans to submit all information needed for the claim at once, rather than sending supporting evidence after an initial submission, for example.

> P3: "At first…as the VSO I didn't understand exactly what \[the VA\] needed. Now I do understand, so I'm better at helping people get that information upfront. As I'm learning, it's improving my ability to help somebody."

> P5: "The development letters are complex, you know, 10 pages in there of crap they don't need."

> P3: "Every time the VA has to ask for more information, it delays your claim 15-40 days, you know, so we need to get that information as quickly as possible if we're missing something.”

#### **Overpayments**

VSOs are proactive about explaining overpayments and how to avoid them. As a result, some claimants will come to them proactively when they receive an annual income review letter that they don’t understand. 

More often than not, however, claimants are coming in too long after those letters have been received. Sometimes, claimants who worked with sharks and weren’t advised about overpayments will come to VSOs seeking help. In both of these cases, VSOs said that their options to help are limited. Typically, all they can do is propose a compromise with the VA by requesting a waiver. One VSO mentioned that Electronic Verification Reports (EVRs), which used to be required, helped people stay on top of reporting changes that could result in overpayments.

> P1: "Back in the day we used to have EVRs, and that's where they would update any changes. Those don't go out anymore. So people just forget. And it doesn't matter if we tell them 'if you have any changes, let us know'...we don't know unless they bring the information in or the VA catches it. And a lot of them...I feel they're not going to say anything until it's brought up."

> P6: “It's usually like 'oh hey, I got married and my spouse is now on Social Security and we didn't report it so now we have a debt.’"

> P1: “We address \[overpayments\] from the get-go. But when you're looking at those unaccredited people out there putting the information out there, they are not telling them…and that's where the overpayments are coming in. It's people we've never even seen before coming to us because they have this huge debt this year."

| **Recommendations:**
* Provide clear, accessible information to Veterans about how to maintain their benefits and avoid overpayments.
* Work with VBA partners to simplify development letter content.
* Consider what resources may be beneficial to share with Veterans after they’ve filed a pension claim, as well as how and where we might best communicate information about those resources.
* Explore opportunities to better set expectations on the claims processing timeline and claims status for Veterans on the online form.

## **Additional Insights**

* **Confusion between Veterans Pension and military retirement pension:** In contrast with our [previous research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024%2002%20Pension%20Usability%20Evaluation/research-findings.md), the VSOs we spoke with don’t often see Veterans mistake Veterans Pension for military retirement pension. However, the verbiage of “Veterans Pension” does not match the civilian mental model of pension. This makes an already complicated benefit even more complicated for VSOs to explain and challenging for Veterans to understand.  
* **Burial benefit challenges:** While the Burial benefit form is perceived by VSOs to be one of the most straightforward benefit applications, Veteran families typically run into challenges applying for and obtaining the benefit if a Veteran never engaged the VA for benefits in the past.   
* **Intent to file confusion:** VSOs claim that older Veterans generally do not have prior knowledge of intent to file. They sometimes misinterpret the letter they receive in the mail confirming their intent to file as confirmation of their claim’s submission.  
  * To combat this confusion, VSOs are proactive in explaining to claimants that this letter is a confirmation of their intent to file, not their claim submission. Due to the frequency with which claimants will call her with questions about the letter, one VSOs even advises her clients to throw away the letter upon receipt.   
  * Despite efforts to alert Veterans to this letter, a few VSOs noted that pension-eligible Veterans and their families do not come back after working with VSOs to file their ITF. They mistakenly think that the claim has been completed. It is not uncommon for them to reach out after a few months looking for a status update on their claim, only for the VSO to have to explain to them that their claim has yet to be filed. 

## **Summary of Recommendations**

##### Better inform Veterans and their families about different aspects of Veterans Pension

Examples for future work may include: 

* Strategies to inform Veterans and their families of Veterans Pension before they are in dire straits, including those who may be on the cusp of eligibility for Veterans Pension.  
* Share this report with groups (such as CAIA) who can impact broader programming and messaging related to:  
  * The relationship between Medicaid and VA benefits on VA.gov.  
  * Pension poachers and accredited representatives  
* On the 527EZ, consider informing Veterans and families of:  
  * The relationship between Medicaid and Veterans Pension  
  * Pension poachers and accredited representatives  
* \[Potentially out of scope\] Identify what group(s) work on messaging and outreach strategies to inform Veterans about Veterans Pension beyond VA.gov.

##### Ease form completion and processing burden

Examples for future work may include: 

* Consider if there are certain circumstances best suited to self service on VA.gov, and others where we may recommend working with an accredited representative to file a pension claim.  
* Design an experience catered specifically toward Veteran family members within the online form.  
* Revisit (with VBA partners) what information on the form is essential and clarify the ‘why’ behind the information needed within the form itself.  
* Integrate approaches utilized by VSOs into form content and design, such as guidance to minimize the reporting of medical expenses while maximizing the benefit.  
* Incorporate more dynamic user experiences into the form, such as a dynamic medical expenses calculator.  
* Continue to pursue opportunities to prefill information on the form where possible.  
* Explore the idea of a “buddy statement” within the 527EZ for medical expenses.  
* Consider the prioritization of digitizing the Income and Asset Statement relative to other PBP team initiatives, knowing that this supplemental form is used by upwards of 50% of pension applicants.  
* Revisit whether we should include information about the Fully Developed Claim (FDC) program on our form.  
* Revisit the language in our form about supporting documentation to clarify how submitting all documentation at once may impact processing times.

##### Simplify the experience of receiving and maintaining pension benefits

Examples for future work may include: 

* Provide clear, accessible information to Veterans about how to maintain their benefits and avoid overpayments.  
* Work with VBA partners to simplify development letter content.  
* Consider what resources may be beneficial to share with Veterans after they’ve filed a pension claim, as well as how and where we might best communicate information about those resources.  
* Better set expectations on the claims processing timeline and claims status for Veterans on the online form.

##### Consider additional research to further explore related areas not included in this study but show signals of note

Future research areas may include: 

* Validate whether or not the three sections mentioned in this report are the most challenging sections for pension-eligible Veterans and their families to fill out on the online form.  
* Validate how pension-eligible Veterans and their families who apply without the help of an accredited representative typically learn about Veterans Pension.  
* Conduct research with family members of eligible Veterans to better understand their experience and needs as users of the 527EZ.  
* Validate if Veterans who fill out the 527EZ are also commonly supported by a family member or caregiver.  
* Knowing that digital options are rarely utilized by pension-eligible Veterans working with VSOs, validate who the users of the 527EZ are and what challenges they face during their self-service experience.

## **Next Steps**

* Incorporate findings into signals by section document to inform holistic 527 form improvement discussion  
* Share high-level learnings with VBA partners and discuss open questions (date TBD)  
* Work with the delivery team to further develop and prioritize recommendations  
* Incorporate findings into pension-eligible research planning
