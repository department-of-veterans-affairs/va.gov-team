## **2024-06 Veteran Service Officers (VSOs) Experience with Veterans Applying for Pension Benefits ([VA Form 21P-527EZ](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21P-527EZ-ARE.pdf))- Research Plan and Conversation Guide**


### **Context and Background**

VA.gov aims to expand their offering of digital experiences for Veterans to access VA health care and benefits. In 2023, VA Office of the CTO engaged a team to manage and improve digital claims for pension benefits. In the fall of 2023, the web-based version of VA Form 21P-527EZ was found to be several versions behind the paper form. The digital Veterans Pension form was deactivated from VA.gov in November 2023, in order to reduce Veteran burden of having to re-apply. It was relaunched in January 2024, and a usability study of the form was completed shortly after relaunch. We were unable to reach Pension-eligible Veterans in the last usability study as the Pension eligibility criteria means that applicants may be facing health and/or financial hardship. 

As we continue looking at opportunities to improve the pension benefits application and to understand the pension form end-user experience, we are seeking to understand how the pension application is used by accredited representatives on behalf of the Veterans they are representing. From discussions with Veteran Service Representatives (VSRs) and VBA subject matter experts, we have learned that accredited representatives are used by over 50% of Veterans applying for the 527EZ pension benefit. 

We want to learn from accredited representatives about their experience supporting Veterans applying for the 527EZ pension benefit.

**Why do we want to speak with VSOs?**



* Understanding VSOs (Veteran Service Officers/Accredited Representatives) first-hand experience using the VA.gov Pension benefit application to support Veterans with their pension application.
* Understand VSOs’ perspectives of what causes incomplete claims (eg. Veteran quits the process) and what causes further development.
* Understanding what tools accredited representatives are using to help Veterans submit a 527EZ application for Veteran Benefits (e.g. paper pdf, software application) and the benefits and challenges of each will help us identify opportunities to improve the experience for Veterans. 

**OCTO Priorities**

Resolving challenges or friction points with the digital 527EZ form will align with OCTO DE goals, including: 



* (#6) Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience, and 
* (#10) OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy


### **Veteran Journey**


This research and product (VA Form 21P-527EZ Veterans Pension benefits) fits into the taking care of myself and retiring stages of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) where Veterans are engaging VA to access Veterans pension benefits.


### 
**Research Goals**


The goals of this research are to learn from VSOs of the pain points Veterans experience in applying for and receiving pension benefits.  


**Desired outcomes are to understand:**



* VSOs' experiences working with Veterans on Veterans pension claims
* VSOs’ perspectives on the reasons why claims don't get completed/submitted
* VSOs’ perspectives on the typical causes for development letters to be issued when working with Pension-eligible Veterans
* Areas of the application that VSOs may need to clarify for their Veteran clients
* VSOs’ understanding of ITF, the Pension application, and Pension service
* The tools VSOs use to help Veterans apply for Pension benefits as well as behaviors and sentiments about the Pension application and service in general.

**Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today!  My name is Allexe.   

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about the Veterans Pension and eligible Veterans with whom you have assisted getting this pension benefit.  We are representing the VA’s Chief Technology Office (OCTO) and working with the Veterans Business Administration (VBA) to improve the experience of Veterans applying for Pension benefits. We would like to learn about your experience (the experience of VSOs) helping Veterans with applying for this benefit.   

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:



* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. 
* Before we get going, are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    * _Observers briefly introduce themselves and then turn off camera_
* In this research, we will be asking about your experience working with eligible Veterans applying for pension benefits. We want to understand the challenges, if any, that Veterans and accredited representatives, like you, experience helping Veterans to apply and receive this benefit.  Any questions at this point?
* Are you ok with me recording my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

_Start recording._



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**Warm-up Questions** - 5 minutes


Before we talk about the Veterans experience applying for Veterans pension, I would like to learn a little more about your experience as an accredited representative.  

1. Could you tell me about your current position?  
2. How long have you been an accredited representative?
3. Have you worked at the same place for that timeframe _(trying to understand experience working with Veteran population from different areas and experience working within different orgs_) ?
4. Where are you based?  Would you consider that location as rural, suburban or city? _ (trying to understand experience working with Veteran population from different types of areas)  _
5. Have you obtained your own accreditation or are you accredited through the Veteran Service Organization (VSO)? 
6. How do Veterans seeking the Pension benefit find you/your organization?

    * If so, which ones?  
    * How does it work in regards to referrals? 
8. How many Veterans would you say that you help with the 527EZ pension Benefits application in a given year?

    * How might the VA circumvent Veterans misunderstanding about their eligibility for the benefit? 

I have additional questions for you relative to the 527EZ, but we’re also working on improvements to the VA Form 21P-530 Burial Benefits form, and we have just two questions for you about the 530, before moving on to the 527EZ.  The first question:



1. What sections of the form or supporting evidence cause delays or are the biggest challenges when supporting claimants?    

And my last question relative to the 530: 



2. What is the most critical information and supporting evidence needed for a successful submission?

Thank you!  Now, i’d like to switch gears with questions about 527EZ
