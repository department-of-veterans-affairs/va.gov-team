# Initiative Brief - 530 Burial Form Reactivation
## Overview
* The digital burial 530 form is several versions behind the paper form, and it is missing fields that are now required to process burial claims. Currently, any user who submits a digital 527 claim receives a development letter asking them to resubmit their claim using the paper form.
---

## Outcome Summary
> *Brief statement describing opportunity you're pursuing e.g. "Increase Use of Search Tools on VA.gov." Include measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to affect.*
* Update the burial 530 form to align with the paper version of the form, so the digital form can be processed by downstream systems. The ideal outcome is 0% development of digital 530 forms.

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
   * The digital 530 form is so out of date that it's missing fields required for claim processing. 100% of digital 530 claims require development. Any user who submits a digital 530 form is mailed a development letter requesting more information.
   * The digital 530 form has many accessibility issues and uses depreciated form components, which leads to a poor user experience.
   * There is no backup form submission process if the claim fails to submit.
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
   * Resolving the stated issues with the digital 530 form will allow Veterans to receive pension benefits faster.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Users submit a processable 530 claim
- More users submit 530 claims through VA.gov.
- Users who do submit 530 claims thorugh VA.gov receive benefits faster (e.g., have a low development rate)
- Users receive the benefits they are entitled to because their ITF date aligns with VBA requirements (earliest claim save date)

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Users avoid using the digital 530 form because it's long and complicated.
- Users submit incomplete or incorrect information leading to additional claim development

## Desired Business Outcomes
- More users submit digital pension forms
- Processing claims faster
- Failed claims are submitted successfully through a backup process

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Downstream systems cannot process updated digital burial form submissions
- Failed claims are not established

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - 
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - 
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Not a lot is known (yet) about the downstream workflows of the digital burial application
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - VBA vs OMB consensus on required form fields
  - Availablility of stakeholders to test new form

### What're you building
- A 530 form that includes the required fields (as identified by the VBA pension team of Terrence Minaryd and Eric Henne)
- A form that uses the latest Platform Design System components
- A form that meets current accessibility requirements
- The following items are out of scope due to time contraints. The goal is to get a processable form up ASAP.
   - Form enhancements such as auto-filling contact information
   - Extensive user experience enhancements 

#### Go-to-market 
- The VBA will be communicating the availablility of an updated digital burial form to Veterans, VSO, and other stakeholders.
- We may partner with the VBA to support these outreach efforts.
- Users with previously in-progress forms that were affected by the [form deactivation initatitive](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/form-deactivation/Initiative%20Brief-527EZ%20and%20530%20Temp%20Deactivation.md) may need to be notified and have their data migrated to the new form
