# Initiative Brief - 527EZ Pension Form Reactivation
## Overview
* The digital pension 527EZ form was recently found to be several versions behind the paper form. The online form was is missing fields that are now required to process pension claims. Any user who submitted a digital 527 claim received a development letter asking them to resubmit their claim using the paper form.

* Due to this, the digital pension benefits form was officially deactivated from VA.gov on Wednesday, November 8, 2023. At the moment, any visitor who goes to VA.gov for Pension benefits information will see copy informing them that the online form is temporarily deactivated, and it explains other options to submit an appication for Pension benefits in the meantime (mail, QuickSubmit, or in-person).

* The Pension Benefits team is working to redesign and build a minimum viable product version of the online Pension form that will make the digital form processable for the business and contribute to an improved user experience for veterans.

## Outcome Summary
> *Brief statement describing opportunity you're pursuing e.g. "Increase Use of Search Tools on VA.gov." Include measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to affect.*
* Update the digital 527 pension form to align with the paper version of the form, so the digital form can be processed by downstream systems. The ideal outcome is 0% development of digital 527 forms.

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
   * The digital 527 form is so out of date that it's missing fields required for claim processing. 100% of digital 527 claims require development. Any user who submits a digital 527 form is mailed a development letter requesting more information.
   * The digital 527 form has many accessibility issues and uses depreciated form components, which leads to a poor user experience.
   * The intent to file (ITF) date that is captured it out of compliance with VBA requirements. The current form collects ITF as the date/time of submission when it should be collecting ITF at the first point the form is saved.
   * There is no backup form submission process if the claim fails to submit.
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
   * Resolving the stated issues with the digital 527 form will allow Veterans to receive pension benefits faster.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Users submit a processable 527 claim
- More users submit 527 claims through VA.gov.
- Users who do submit 527 claims thorugh VA.gov receive benefits faster (e.g., have a low development rate)
- Users receive the benefits they are entitled to because their ITF date aligns with VBA requirements (earliest claim save date)

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Users avoid using the digital 527 form because it's long and complicated.
- Users submit incomplete or incorrect information leading to additional claim development

## Desired Business Outcomes
- More users submit digital pension forms
- Processing claims faster
- Failed claims are submitted successfully through a backup process

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Downstream systems cannot process updated digital pension form submissions
- Failed claims are not established

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Pension benefits can be a complicated, so many users may prefer to work with an expert (VSO) to submit their claim.
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - The pension form is long and complex, so many users may prefer to work with a VSO to complete it rather than filling it out themselves.
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Not a lot is known (yet) about the downstream workflows of the digital pension application
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - VBA vs OMB consensus on required form fields
  - Availablility of stakeholders to test new form

### What're you building
- A 527 form that includes the required fields (as identified by the VBA pension team of Terrence Minaryd and Eric Henne)
- A form that uses the latest Platform Design System components
- A form that meets current accessibility requirements
- A form that correctly captures the intent to file date
- The following items are out of scope due to time contraints. The goal is to get a processable form up ASAP.
   - Form enhancements such as auto-filling contact and dependent information
   - Extensive user experience enhancements 

#### Go-to-market 
- The VBA will be communicating the availablility of an updated digital pension form to Veterans, VSO, and other stakeholders.
- We may partner with the VBA to support these outreach efforts.
- Users with previously in-progress forms that were affected by the [form deactivation initatitive](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/form-deactivation/Initiative%20Brief-527EZ%20and%20530%20Temp%20Deactivation.md) may need to be notified and have their data migrated to the new form
