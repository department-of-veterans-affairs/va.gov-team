# Process for Updating Evidence Requests with Plain Language
This document explains the process for updating evidence requests on VA.gov with plain language. Use it as a step-by-step reference to understand what to do and the order to complete each stage.
## Prepare
### 1. Check the tracking spreadsheet
Open the [Evidence Request Tracking Spreadsheet (SharePoint)](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/vaabdvro/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BD662A942-DA89-45FA-A055-35A822C0EB3B%7D&file=Evidence%20Requests%20by%20Type%20and%20Status.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) to see the status of all evidence requests. This shows which ones are already updated and which still need plain language.
### 2. (Optional) Prioritize updates
To focus on the ones most used by Veterans, sort the spreadsheet by log count.
### 3. Find requests that need updates
If the “Content status” column is blank or says “On hold,” the request still needs plain language.
### 4. Get details from experts
Open the [VA.gov Evidence Request Content Worksheet (SharePoint)](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Benefits%20Management%20-%20CST/cst%20-%20evidence-requests/Content%20Worksheet%20(VA%20evidence%20requests).docx?d=w6dc2e2711afd48d5be7e028ddd26ec7c&csf=1&web=1&e=CrIxXo). Use it to collect details from subject matter experts, such as:
- Type of request (first-party or third-party)
- What VA is asking for
- What steps the Veteran should take
- Any other important information
## Draft
### 5. Create a design mockup
Once the worksheet is complete, create a design mockup in [Evidence Requests (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/design/P9rl860Qt8qqVFZGg4sejE/Evidence-Requests?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=KgdQOGJvE0T08vRm-0) with the new plain language content.
### 6. (Optional) Share with SME for review
Send a screenshot of the mockup to the subject matter expert for feedback.
### 7. Make edits if needed
Update the mockup with any changes from the review.
## Review
### 8. Get final approval
Request a content and design review from the Design Lead and product owner.
## Publish
### 9. Submit for implementation
After approval, ask an engineer to add the changes to staging.va.gov.
### 10. Review and go live
Check the staging site for accuracy and quality. When it’s ready, give the go-ahead to publish on the live production site.
