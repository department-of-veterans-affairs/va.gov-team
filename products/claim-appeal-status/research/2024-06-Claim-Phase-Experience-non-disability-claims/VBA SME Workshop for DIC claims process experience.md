# VBA SME Workshop for DIC claims process experience

## Background

Currently, we are working to increase transparency for the  [disability claims process](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1713276576012/25e677b1d846aff3bea16fc9175e473d5e509888?sender=u606d6bea4af40ec4fe659363)  by providing a description for each process step so hopefully veterans can  anticipate what will happen next in the claims process or to educate veterans on ideal times to submit evidence etc.

Our new understanding is that we can specify which claims will use the new claims process UI (accordion UI) and provide bespoke content based on the claim type. Our goal is to learn more about the [product] claims process so that we can determine the most effective way to represent the claim using the new UI.

## Summary

The Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) claims process generally follows the same 8-step process as pension claims. These claims typically move faster through the steps, with the average processing time for DIC being significantly lower than for pension. We evaluate steps 1-8 for each benefit simultaneously. If a benefit doesn’t apply during a step, we stop considering it and continue with the others. The number of additional rules we need to consider beyond that point is relatively small. Therefore, we don’t need to gather further information as often, as it is easy to establish a direct connection if the information is on the death certificate and service record. If we are unable to connect the service-related condition to the cause of death, we continue the evaluation for pension.

## Open questions with answers

### Is there some relationship between DIC claims and pension claims or dependency claims?  Can someone file DIC claim independently
The application for DIC also includes consideration for the survivor’s pension and accrued benefits. Dependency is a major factor in DIC evaluations. Technically, we are supposed to evaluate both DIC and pension simultaneously because DIC is a higher benefit. If we only grant pension, we might be shorting people on the benefits they could receive.

### In scenarios involving a surviving spouse or child, it appears that the VA recommends applicants to file for DIC, Death Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits. Is this part of the relationship?
Yes, essentially it’s what’s being explained above. An example of the forms are list below: 

*  [VA Form 21P-534a](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21p-534a/)   - Forms for In-service death
*  [VA Form 21P-534EZ](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21p-534ez/) ) - Application for DIC, Survivors Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits

### What are the specific process steps for this type of claim? ( list them)
It basically follows the same steps as pension claims and the 8 step process we would like to reintroduce as part of the claim phase experience work. 

#### Step 1: Claim received
We receive the claim

#### Step 2: Initial review

We review everything; If anything is missing, we gather evidence through the development cycle. Additionally,  we ensure we have a death certificate or evidence of death and make determinations based on that. If no further evidence is needed, we do not gather additional information. Part of the reason DIC claims can be processed faster is that if it’s an obvious DIC claim where the veteran dies from the same service-connected condition, we just validate marriages, address, and send it to rating.
If we bypass the other steps and go directly to rating, and the rater feels the death wasn’t service-connected (e.g., the veteran was service-connected for one type of cancer but died of another), the claim would be sent back for evidence gathering.

**Note**:. We perform steps 1-8  for all 3 benefits (DIC, Pension, Accrued) for each benefit simultaneously. If one doesn’t apply during a step, we stop considering it and continue with the others.

#### Step 3: Evidence gathering
We don’t gather evidence for pension if it is a straightforward DIC claim; we send it directly to rating. Effectively, the initial review is the same as the evidence review. This is the only real caveat to how we can skip steps. During step three, if the initial review aligns with the evidence review, it goes straight to rating, and we stop considering it for pension until it’s denied for DIC.

 If the VSR sees an opportunity for a better benefit, we pursue the better benefit.

## What are common Veterans’ survivor’s pain points with this process? (ie. for disability claims, Veterans unintentionally resubmit evidence after their claim has move out of gathering evidence, causing the process to regress. )
Regarding death, we have to consider that in this claim we are communicating with survivors, not the veterans. if we are referring to the veteran as if they are still alive when they’ve been deceased for a decade, it can be really insensitive to the spouse or children who may still be grieving
 Common pain points are obtaining military records, service treatment records, personal records, and private records. If it’s a survivor pension claim, anything related to income or net worth that’s not straightforward is a problem.

From a claim process perspective for the spouse, if a veteran is service-connected for a heart condition but died from another cause, it makes one ponder if the coroner might have gotten it wrong. If a veteran is service-connected for a heart condition but dies from an unrelated condition, they may not be awarded the benefit unless the death certificate reflects the service-connected condition.

All in all, survivors may submit all the necessary forms, but if the cause of death differs from the service-connected condition, it becomes an issue.

## Any points of confusion for veterans’ survivors during the process? (when VA request additional info)
We have a long history of people who got married again without getting divorced first. If we haven’t previously made a determination, we need to review the marital history to ensure everything is in order. It’s not just the veterans; sometimes it’s the survivors who have been married multiple times and may not be legally married to their subsequent spouse. So they miss out on those benefits. There are additional benefits for those who have been married for eight or ten years, like the  [1318 grants](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/01/21/00-1507/dic-benefits-for-survivors-of-certain-veterans-rated-totally-disabled-at-time-of-death).

The other point about marriage is that in some rare cases, we’ll have a veteran who is 100% service-connected but does not have their spouse on record. These scenarios are common where someone is service-connected at 10%, 20%, or 30% and doesn’t record a spouse because those ratings don’t consider a spouse as a modification to the benefit. But if they go from 30% to 100% due to presumptives, they might not add the spouse because they think the spouse should already be on the record. It doesn’t work that way. Because of that disconnect, they sometimes slip through, and we don’t have a complete record. They have to apply for a benefit, and we might short them because we didn’t think they were married for ten years and 100% for the same period. So, they won’t qualify for the 8 by 8 benefit, which is an extra $350. That’s another important reason for those marriage dates and information—to maximize their benefit. This is why it’s important to keep marriage records so they can maximize that benefit.

Another confusion is exposure stuff. ie. My spouse served in Vietnam. but we (VA) can’t connect the exposure for that Unit. It becomes difficult for survivors. A survivor may have artifacts in their possession to suggest a Veteran was at an exposure was present (ie Vietnam service medal, or photos), but VA can’t confirm the exposure.

## Does this type of claim return to previous steps in the process? E.g. if Veterans add evidence later in the process or if VA staff identify something is missing.
Yeah, all the time! Generally, I think the biggest issue for DIC is that it often returns from rating to request more evidence (gathering evidence). For survivor’s pension claims, it typically returns from the authorization step (Step 6: Preparing decision letter), and they’ll likely ask for more evidence (step3: Gathering evidence. These are the most common scenarios I encounter. 

This brings us back to the frustration when all the information is submitted correctly, but it doesn’t exactly meet our requirements. Sometimes, the service records, military records, or medical evidence don’t align, or we lack access to necessary military records. We’ve requested them; if survivors possess these records, submitting them directly would expedite the process.

## Do we know the average time duration per step in this claim process?
We have some actual data: pension automation can complete a DIC claim in the same day or, more realistically, in 2-3 days from when we receive the claim (working on it) to when we finalize it. Typically, it takes a few days or less than a week to make a decision and get it processed, barring any technical issues. So, from receiving the claim to making the decision, it can be a matter of a few days or less than a week, longer if there are technical issues. For those straightforward DIC claims where the cause of death aligns with a service-connected condition, our automation systems can rate them directly. However, they cannot generate and authorize the award immediately—boom, boom, boom, done.

On the flip side, the process of collecting evidence can take a while. For instance, veterans impacted by the National Archives record centers fire, where many records were lost, face significant delays. It can take a year or two to reconstruct these records from unit records and other sources to demonstrate service in places like Vietnam.

If Joe Joe Smith claims he was in Vietnam and died from a presumptive condition like diabetes, and his records were impacted by the fire, we would need to locate his unit records, verify his service, mobilization, and transportation details, and review travel orders. This process can bounce us between various record sources to reconstruct his history, such as confirming his presence on manifests for transportation into Vietnam.

On average time on current  [EP140](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000011474/Appendix-B-End-Product-EP-Codes#140)  - is just over 130 days, about 4 months)

## Is there anywhere in the VA ecosystem where this claims process is described?
To my knowledge, aside from the  [Current DIC rates page](https://www.va.gov/disability/survivor-dic-rates/)  and information  [about the DIC claims](https://www.va.gov/disability/dependency-indemnity-compensation/)  process, it’s relatively straightforward. The main challenge arises from incidents like the fire that destroyed records, leading to difficulties when certain records don’t strongly support the evidence needed (for example, having an old photo of a veteran in a jungle claiming he was in Vietnam).
