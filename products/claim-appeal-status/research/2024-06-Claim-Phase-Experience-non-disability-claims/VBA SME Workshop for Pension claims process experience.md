# VBA SME Workshop for Pension claims process experience

## Background
Currently, we are working to increase transparency for the  [disability claims process](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1713276576012/25e677b1d846aff3bea16fc9175e473d5e509888?sender=u606d6bea4af40ec4fe659363)  by providing a description for each process step so hopefully veterans can  anticipate what will happen next in the claims process or to educate veterans on ideal times to submit evidence etc.

Our new understanding is that we can specify which claims will use the new claims process UI (accordion UI) and provide bespoke content based on the claim type. Our goal is to learn more about the pension claims process so that we can determine the most effective way to represent the claim using the new UI.

## Summary
The claims process for Pension claims essentially mirrors the 8-step process we are outlining in the  [claim phase experience](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/CST%20Product/Product%20Outline.md)  effort. However, Step 5, the rating step, isn’t a required step. In step 4, Evidence review, the VSR will determine if a rating is needed based on the information at hand.

## General Overview of the claims process
The process mirrors the 8 steps as denoted in the claim phase experience project, but there’s some hesitation about the exact number of days each step takes. From the national work queue, something might be ready for evidence in 1 or 2 days, but it may take longer for someone to review it. Ratings are usually quicker because they have fewer issues, but evidence gathering can take a long time. Although exams are rare, they are still possible.

Many ratings can be handled administratively (via administrative grant), so some claims don’t require a rating step. For example, if a 65-year-old qualifies based on eligibility criteria and doesn’t need anything rated, they get an administrative grant and skip the rating step. To qualify, they must prove they can’t work due to non-service-connected issues or a combination of non-service and service-connected issues, which qualifies them for a pension with a permanent and total disability rating.

Another way to qualify is through  [Aid and Attendance or Housebound claims](https://www.va.gov/pension/aid-attendance-housebound/) , which are similar to  [special monthly compensation claims](https://www.va.gov/disability/compensation-rates/special-monthly-compensation-rates/) . If you’re over 65 and don’t receive a special monthly benefit, we’ll grant the benefit based on income and net worth. The permanent and total disability requirement is rarely rated. Most claimants get an administrative grant if they’re over 65, receiving Social Security disability, or in a nursing home. If they’re in a nursing home, we can also grant a higher rate of special monthly pension administratively, without a rating.

During step 4, in evidence review, we determine if a rating is necessary. If everything can be handled administratively, we skip the rating step and issue a decision letter directly.

For Survivor claims, there’s additional complexity with service-connected death issues. If someone applies for a survivor’s pension and we notice a rating is warranted because they might be eligible for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), we’ll send it to rating even without their request.

Most of our claimants get a rating to qualify, usually for a special monthly pension.

## Open questions with answers

### 1. What are the specific process steps for pension claim? ( list them)

#### Step 1: Claim received
We use data extraction to match claims with other documents. Someone opens the mail, then we send it to a scanning vendor to extract the information. After that, we match it and ensure it’s uploaded. The data matching process starts, so it’s not just about receiving the claim but also uploading and acknowledging it. This can take up to a week from the day we receive it.

For example, in my appeal case, it took 10 days from when I used the va.gov portal for it to appear in my E-folder, despite the website promising 24 hours. I’m still a bit frustrated about that.

Explaining this process—scanning, organizing, and filing claims into the system—can help manage expectations.

#### Step 2: Initial review
Once claims are in the initial queue, they wait until a VSR is available to review them. The initial review is mostly automated, where we establish the claims and handle related tasks.

#### Step 3: Evidence gathering
Evidence gathering involves matching data with other federal entities. It can take up to two weeks to get information from the IRS for a new claim. We must validate these matches before proceeding with the claim.

#### Step 4: Evidence review
During the evidence review, we examine the information gathered from federal matches and what the claimant submitted. This is usually all the evidence we need, except for missing medical records or pending IRS information. Before the initial review (the step where we would check for missing items), we gather evidence from the IRS and other federal matches. In this phase, we decide if a rating is needed; if it is, we proceed with the rating.

#### Step 5: Rating
If a rating is needed, the rater must ensure there is enough evidence to proceed with the rating process. If not, they send it back to the evidence-gathering stage and request the additional required information.

#### Step 6: Preparing decision letter
Preparing the decision letter involves the VSR receiving the case, drafting a letter, and verifying all previously reviewed information to ensure the rating hasn’t changed

#### Step 7: Final review
The final review is the last step where our authorizers validate that the VSR completed everything correctly before we grant or deny benefits.  If any issues are found during this stage, whether by the VSR during decision preparation or by the Rater, we send the case back to the evidence gathering phase.

Ideally, we should gather all necessary information in one go. However, I’ve seen cases where we’ve had to request information multiple times. This isn’t always due to missing something initially, but because each new piece of information raised further questions.

For instance, receiving new information might reveal payments from an undisclosed bank account, prompting us to inquire further. Additional bank records might then show numerous transfers, leading us to ask about these transactions’ purposes. While uncommon, this can escalate in complexity.

#### Step 8: Claim decided
The claim is sent to Veterans

### 2. What are common Veteran pain points with this process? (ie. for disability claims, Veterans unintentionally resubmit evidence after their claim has move out of gathering evidence, causing the process to regress. )
Claimants sometimes resubmit evidence after the claim has moved out of the evidence-gathering phase. This isn’t usually a major issue. If they resubmit the same evidence after it’s marked ready for decision, our raters know to proceed without being concerned about the extra evidence.
Main pain points for our claimants include:

1. **Gathering Full Marital History**:  Especially when claiming a dependent spouse for pension eligibility. We need the total family composition to calculate income and net worth accurately. This can be complicated.
2. **Obtaining Accurate Financial Figures**: Many people have a general idea of their financial situation but may not have exact numbers. This can slow down our verification process as we reconcile their information with ours.
3. **Verifying Medical Expenses**: Claiming certain medical expenses, like facility or in-home care, requires verification from the provider. This can be time-consuming as it involves getting third-party confirmation.
4. **Address Changes**: If claimants move, it complicates matters, especially if they were claiming expenses for a previous facility. We need to determine how much they paid at the prior facility versus the current one and what is countable vs what isn’t as it pertains to  income or expenses. We base our calculations on the date they applied or their intent to file. We can only count expenses from the date of entitlement forward, and sometimes we have to drill down to exact dates to determine if they can be considered for the claim.

#### Any resources available that VA guides veterans to get accurate numbers?
We may not offer guidance on this. We don’t always know if claimants only have bank accounts; some people have land or other assets. We need to know the value of their property as there are many ways to have countable net worth, which makes it complicated.

We have the  [0969 form](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21p-0969/)  (long form) that asks detailed questions and includes instructions. Claimants must submit this form if their net worth is $25k or more. Form 527 contains a handful of questions.

Other factors include asset transfers in the last three years, marketable land over 2 acres, or having more than four sources of income. The VA may develop further information if necessary.

#### We recognize that Veterans often find the income sources questions confusing, leading them to leave these sections incomplete. Consequently, the VA returns the forms as unfinished. Is there a significant difference between paper and digital forms in this regard?
There’s no difference for whether or not it is filled out. But, the online version allows Veterans to report more than 4 sources of income. 

### 3. Any points of confusion for veterans during the process?
Sometimes veterans report net income when the VA needs gross income, causing development issues. When providing marital history, veterans might report incomplete or conflicting information, such as overlapping marriage dates.

Expenses are another major issue. Veterans often report only some expenses without specifying if they are recurring.  If it’s predictable, we can use 12 months of the expense instead of a single month. That can be the difference between a grant and a denial.

One area of confusion is indicating payment or expense frequency. Older forms had few pay frequency options, but current forms now include options for one-time, monthly, or annual expenses. However, there’s no checkbox for quarterly expenses. If someone writes that an expense is quarterly but checks the annual box, we can’t tell if they mean $5,000 per quarter or per year. It’s important to be clear and not provide more information than needed.

Other personnel can confirm that claimants often submit too much information, delaying their cases. For example, we don’t need 30 pages of prescription medications. We still have to review them in case there’s one relevant item, like a recurring oxygen expense. Extra information usually doesn’t help and only slows down the process.

### 4. Do pension claims return to previous steps in the process? E.g. if Veterans add evidence later in the process or if VA staff identify something is missing.
Yes, it’s possible. A VSR might mark a claim ready for decision but miss something. When the rater reviews it, they might notice mistakes and send it back for review.

The process goes back to step 3 for more evidence, unless the rater is asking for unnecessary evidence, which also happens. The claim may bounce back and forth for a while. Sometimes the rater might be confused and request evidence that isn’t needed.

### 5. Do we know the average time duration per step in the pension process?
30-60 days for evidence gathering makes sense legally  (referring to time estimates they saw in our prototypes). Ideally, review should take a couple of days and rating a day or two. However, actual times may vary.

[Derek] I can pull the data, but we might not want to advertise it without leadership’s permission, as I don’t always have the full picture. We do have the data to figure out step durations, but presenting this to veterans can be contentious since claims can take anywhere from 5 days to 3 years. 

A quick claim might be handled by automation within 5 days, part of that delay might only be because it took five days for mail automation to upload it into the  e-folder so the system can run it through. A more complex claim requiring additional evidence could take up to 3 years.

Decisions in 5 days or 3 years aren’t common for pension claims, though  [DIC (Dependency indemnity compensation)](https://www.va.gov/disability/dependency-indemnity-compensation/)  claims might be resolved quickly. Instead of focusing on step durations, we should consider the median time from start to finish. If we say 9 months but finish in 5 days, it might not reflect well on us.

Time frames should set realistic expectations for veterans. As a Veteran, I would appreciate seeing the actual time frames that are tied to actual data and get updated  weekly or monthly, to reflect real data rather than arbitrary time frames. Leadership can then state, ’80% of claims are finished in X time.

Other agencies, like DHS ( Department of Homeland Security), use live assessments to show time frames. Pension claims don’t involve piecing together evidence like you’re trying to solve a giant puzzle; DIC claims do. 

For DIC, we need to actually look at the full reasons as to why somebody could be connected, but it’s usually more straightforward than a disability claim, because it’s written on the death certificate or it’s not.

For us pension claims, delays happen when we need more information. If this happens multiple times, it can delay a claim by over 100 days, whereas catching all issues at once might only delay it by 30 days. This is why the process sometimes becomes convoluted.

### 6. Who is the VA subject matter expert serving as the point of contact for your team?
* VA “business” stakeholder is Dan Gifford (daniel.gifford@va.gov).  
* Enablement team Product Owner is Ryan Powers.

### 7. Is there anywhere in the VA ecosystem where this claims process is described?
There might be some explanation when you apply for pension benefits, but nothing about the step-by-step process. There aren’t any other sources that we are aware of.
