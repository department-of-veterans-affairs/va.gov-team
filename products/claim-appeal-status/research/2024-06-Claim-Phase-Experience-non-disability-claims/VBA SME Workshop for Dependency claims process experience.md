# VBA SME Workshop for Dependency claims process experience
# Background
Currently, we are working to increase transparency for the  [disability claims process](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1713276576012/25e677b1d846aff3bea16fc9175e473d5e509888?sender=u606d6bea4af40ec4fe659363)  by providing a description for each process step so hopefully veterans can  anticipate what will happen next in the claims process or to educate veterans on ideal times to submit evidence etc.

Our new understanding is that we can specify which claims will use the new claims process UI (accordion UI) and provide bespoke content based on the claim type. Our goal is to learn more about the [product] claims process so that we can determine the most effective way to represent the claim using the new UI.

# Summary
Dependency claims don’t align with either the 5-step or 8-step claim process, with the 5-step process being more relatable. These claims can be decided in a single day once they leave the national work queue, as most evidence is submitted during steps 1 and 2. Much of the claim is handled by either RBPS or a single VA staff, with few intermediate steps.

## High Level overview

The challenge with these claims is the lack of specific steps and decision documents. Instead, an award is generated to close the claim without any developments, meaning no letters are sent to veterans. Claims typically move from pending to closed within one processing day, but it can take months before they are worked on.

For dependency claims, there are no intermediate steps. When intermediate steps exist, tracked items with a 30-day suspension period are used. After this period, a decision can usually be made the same day. Claims processed through RBPS (Rules Based Processing System) automation closes the same day, similar to manual processing by a human.

If a claim is submitted via RBPS, it might take days to complete. However, if it is assigned to a human, it could sit for months before being processed. The 8-step process does align with dependency claims as the rating and decision steps do not apply. The 5-step process is slightly better, but dependency claims essentially goes through a 3-step process instead.

# Open questions with answers
## 1. What are the specific process steps for this type of claim? ( list them)

The reality of each steps are as follows: 

### Step 1 - Claim received
Claim is opened and uploaded into the National work queue where it is waiting to be processed. 

### Step 2 - Initial review
Steps 1-2 occur simultaneously because the same rep that received the claim continues with it all the way through. They would review all evidence that has been submitted in step 1  as veterans would have provided the necessary information in step 1, without the need for exams or additional steps.

### Step 3 - Evidence gathering  (Doesn’t always occur)
If the VA needs more information, they generate a development letter, establish tracked items, and wait 30 days for a response. Once the evidence is submitted, the decision process continues.

### Step 4 - Evidence Review  (Doesn’t occur)
**Note:** This happens in step 2. 

### Step 5 - Rating (Doesn’t always occur)
It is challenging to distinguish step 6 in dependency claims. In rating claims, once the rating is completed, the status changes to “rating decision complete,” which activates step 6. There are no steps for dependency claims beyond rating pending authorization closed, and step 5 will never occur. 

### Step 6 - Preparing decision letter
Would likely involve reward generation, where a VSR enters the decision in the award system, including dependency decisions like adding a spouse or children. 

In step 6, claims never enter a post-decisional status. 

### Step 7 - Final review
Would be award authorization, where another VSR verifies and authorizes the claim. Once authorized, the claim…

### Step 8 - Claim decided
Decision sent to Veteran.

## What are common Veteran pain points with this process? (ie. for disability claims, Veterans unintentionally resubmit evidence after their claim has move out of gathering evidence, causing the process to regress. )
* **Claims appear stagnant, then get decided in 1 day** - The VBA and Veterans share similar frustrations. For example, if a veteran is aware of the rating process, they might find it disconcerting that dependency claims can remain open for six months with no updates. The call center might say the claim is waiting to be assigned to a human, and then suddenly, the claim is decided in a single day, which can be quite jarring.
* **Inconsistent marriage dates for marriages that ended in divorce years ago** - If a Veteran is trying to file a claim for a second spouse. For instance, if a veteran has been receiving a disability claim for 20 years, got divorced 12 years ago, and removed the first spouse, and now remarries and submits a new claim, they might mistakenly provide inconsistent marriage dates. This inconsistency will prompt the VA to request additional evidence, such as the divorce decree.

## What are the reasons for RBPS to switch to a manual process?
Some reasons why RBPS switches to manual process are as follows: 

* if stepchildren are involved
* the marriage took place on tribal land, **or** It was a common-law marriage. 
* Newborn child without a social

Such claims may appear untouched before being off-ramped. After this off-ramping, the claim sits in the national queue, waiting for a representative to handle it. Once the representative gets involved, they can close the claim the same day.

In the example of a child without a social security number, if a veteran submits a claim for a newborn child without a Social Security number, the RBPS can’t process it. A human can then contact the veteran to ask if an SSN has been issued. If it has, the VSR can close the claim on the same day. 

## Any points of confusion for veterans during the process?
When reviewing a dependent added to an award, it would be beneficial to include the date the dependent was added. There are instances when a veteran divorces their first spouse and then remarries the same person. In these cases, the VA might incorrectly assume the person was continuously present. Similarly, a veteran might marry their first spouse, divorce, remarry the same person, divorce again, and then marry a new person. This sequence can create confusing date issues for the VA, causing complications. Including specific dates helps avoid these problems when the veteran adds a new spouse.

## Does this type of claim return to previous steps in the process? E.g. if Veterans add evidence later in the process or if VA staff identify something is missing.
Typically, the person making the decision on the claim is the same person doing  development. They have all the necessary information to make the decision. While mistakes can happen, it is quite rare. It’s not impossible, but it’s not likely

## Do we know the average time duration per step in this claim process?
We can probably track it. It’s challenging because a claim can sit for months and then be decided in a single day. It’s not like a rating claim; it’s much more simplified because it can literally be handled by one person.

## Is there anywhere in the VA ecosystem where this claims process is described?
I’m not sure… maybe not, because we don’t typically focus on things like dependency claims.

## What percentage of 686 (Adding/Removing a child or spouse)  forms goes through RBPS automation successfully?
I’m not sure, but RBPS has been helpful with the simpler tasks.

## Is there the same process for various dependency claim types?
Example dependency claim types

* Adding/Removing a child or spouse to an existing disability benefit ( [21-686c](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-686c/) )
* Requesting Approval of School-Age Child for an existing disability benefit ( [21-674](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-674/) )
* Dependent parents are added to disability benefits through form  [21P-509](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21p-509/)  (paper)

It is the same for all dependent types except for a “helpless child” claim.

A  [helpless child’s claim](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/benefits/children-birth-defects.asp)  goes through the rating process because they require medical evidence and a formal rated decision. they are not  [EP130](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000011474/Appendix-B-End-Product-EP-Codes#130)  (ie. Disability and Death Dependency).

## Who can we contact to learn more about a “helpless child” or a child who has a permanent mental or physical disability”?
To learn more about a “helpless child,” you can talk to David Reis.

It’s the same for all dependent types except for a helpless child. A helpless child’s claim goes through the rating process because it requires medical evidence and a formal rated decision. They are not EP130 (like disability claims) but are classified as  [EP020](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000011474/Appendix-B-End-Product-EP-Codes#020) .
