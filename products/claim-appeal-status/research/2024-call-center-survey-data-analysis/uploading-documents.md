# Research Theme 1: Uploading Documents

Synthesis of 49 call center records and 70 Madallia survey records that contain relevant and actionable information for the top theme: Having trouble uploading documents.

## Pain points

### Unclear instructions
- Unclear process for uploading docs (i.e., what's involved?)
- Can't upload documents for a closed case
   - This is expected; redirect to supplemental claims
   - Are people finding supplemental claims
- Unclear how to return decision review request form
- Unclear if uploaded documents have been received
- Trying to upload a claim from the claim itself
- Receives error message: "We are Sorry, we cannot upload at this time."
   - Skyler: There are several front end error messages that need to be investigated.
- Inconsistent messaging about where to upload evidence for different types of appeals
- Unclear what file types are supported for upload or how to respond to related error message
- Unclear how to add notes to uploaded documents
   - Functionality doesn’t exist
   - Veterans want to add context

### Tech issue
- Upload function not working (progress bar doesn't move on Quick Submit)
- Trying to upload docs and getting an error saying the website is currently being updated or “down for maintenance” (*), causing some to miss deadlines
   - This might be related to VBMS routine maintenance
- Nothing happens when trying to drag and drop files to upload using Quick Submit
- Using Quick Submit, receive a message that documents were successfully uploaded, but don't see the uploaded files.
- Receives a "forbidden" error message when trying to upload.
- Unable to upload documents without changing file names
- Don't receive a "success" message after uploading docs and worry they weren't properly uploaded.
- "Stuck in a loop" while trying to upload documents
   - Will clarify
- Uploaded documents appearing in the wrong order in the system (?)

### Upload tool hard to find
- Don't know where to upload docs
   - Amy: For mobile, you can only upload docs if VA requested it (will be changing soon); on va.gov you can upload any time

## Opportunities
- Provide greater guidance or timely links upfront in the user journey on how and when to upload documents, including what documents can’t be submitted online.
- Clarify how to reopen a closed case and submit new evidence
   - Amy: Maybe the opportunity is adding instructions around “if you have new evidence…”
- Better describe what to expect when uploading documents, including how to know if a doc was successfully uploaded and how to troubleshoot common issues.
   - Skyler: Looking to address in document status work
- Improve findability of document upload page and upload instructions.
- Build in validation messages (if they don’t exist)  to confirm documents were properly uploaded
   - Skyler: Looking to address in document status work
- Allow Veterans to submit notes with uploaded docs
- Offer live chat or virtual assistance to support Veterans during upload process*
- Add a confirmation message with timestamp after uploading documents*
   - Skyler: Looking to address in document status work
- Notify Veterans when an uploaded document has been processed*
   - Skyler: We currently send an email when an upload fails, but not when it’s successful…might be an opportunity for improvement.
   - Skyler: We haven’t audited current email alerts and comms.
   - Amy: we could learn what emails Veterans get after a claim has been submitted
   - Amy: Claim decision emails is another example
   - Amy: Currently only action-needed emails are sent in BMT and CST
- Include instructional videos to illustrate the process for uploading documents*
- Clarify what browsers are supported for file upload (or verify it works with all browsers)
   - Investigate possible tech issues.
   - Investigate possible issue using drag and drop with Quick Submit
   - Investigate possible issue with uploading docs without changing file names
   - Investigate possible "stuck in  loop" issue while trying to upload documents
   - Investigate uploaded files appear in the wrong order*

## Question we have
- What is the experience like for Veterans trying to upload docs and unable to?
- Where do Veterans expect to find the upload documents page?
- How do Veterans re-open a closed case and submit new evidence?
- How do Veterans know if uploaded documents have been received?
- What information is included in the "website currently being updated" error message and similar error messages?
- Does Quick Submit have a "success" or "error" message after uploading files?
- What forms can't be uploaded online (and need to be mailed)?
- What accessibility issues might cause problems with uploading documents?*
- Does functionality differ between devices and browsers?*
- How are errors (file format, file size, etc) communicated during the upload process?*
- How could the functionality of the upload function be simplified?*
- Do Veterans have clear and consistent deadlines for submitting documents?*
- How well does the Claim Status Tool integrate with Quick Submit?
- Is Quick Submit being sunsetted? (Skyler)
   - Amy: Not aware of plans to sunset it
   - OCTO is building a similar upload tool because QuickSubmit is not accessible
- Should NCC be sending people to QuickSubmit or to Claim Status Tool? 
   - Why might CST be better other than for accessibility. (You’ll know it was received!)
   - Clearly there are a lot of usability issues with QuickSubmit
- Are survey links only available on VA.gov?
   - Amy: One suggested next step: Along with work BMT 1 is doing, combine research activities
