# Veteran Representation Research Strategy

## Background

eBenefits currently has a tool that allows Veterans to search for and view accredited representatives who can act with PoA (Power of Attorney) for Veterans. These reps (sometimes called VSOs) often help Veterans file or dispute their disability comp claims. 
Starting in 2019, there was an [effort to migrate these features from eBenefits to VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/3672). This epic was subdivided into two feature workstreams: “search-rep” and “view-rep”. Some members of our current Benefits team worked on the search-rep workstream. 

This work got all the way to [front-end implementation](https://staging.va.gov/view-change-representative/search). 
As of Nov 2022, OCTO PO Matt Self reported to us that this feature was never implemented due to a backend issue that has yet to be resolved. His advice  is that it makes sense to continue pursuing these features on the frontend, but that the backend issue remains an unresolved open question.

## Previous Research
- [Benefits team research on these features](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ebenefits/view-update-POA/research-design/usability-testing/view-search-appoint-research-plan.md) (2021)
- [Research on VSOs and Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ebenefits/view-update-POA/research-design/vso-discovery-interviews/vso-discovery-research-findings.md) (2021)

## Research Plan
Since we already have a solution validated by research and developed on the frontend, the research effort will be minimal. 
- Tease out main takeaways from the 2021 usability research and work them into the final design as needed (optional)

## Tasks
- Try to resolve the backend issue as soon as possible. The development of these features is blocked until that is sorted out.

## Open Questions
- What are the usage stats for the current eBenefits features? Are they widely used? If not, why not? 
- Were there any major issues identified with the search-rep and view-rep digital  experiences? 
- How much faith do Veterans have in these services and the representatives they are paired with through the VA? Is there any reason for them to go outside the VA to acquire these services, and if so, what are they?
