## Research Goals
In previous research relating to [decision reviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-11-Decision-Reviews/research-findings.md), we've found that Veterans are not fully satisfied with the claim status tool — with Veterans sharing that they don’t see enough details about their claims, leaving them feeling like they’re in the dark.

For this research, we gathered Veteran feedback about their experiences in determining the status of their active claims through the CST with the intent of soliciting Veteran painpoints and needs in the context of their real-world active claims.

## Research Questions
- We want to understand **what information Veterans specifically want to know to stay informed** as their claim goes through the initial decision process.
- We want to understand **the experience Veterans have with requests to provide additional evidence.** We want to find opportunities to help Veterans provide better evidence in support of their claims earlier in the process.  
- We want to understand **the experience Veterans have with requests for C&P exams.** We want to find opportunities to set the right expectation for Veterans going to C&P exams.

## Methodology 
To investigate this topic, we conducted qualitative research with Veterans during 1-hour sessions utilizing 3 different methods:

**Semi-structured interviews**
We gathered context from Veterans surrounding their active claim. And got a sense of how they engage the CST and the VA more broadly.

**Contextual Inquiry**
We gathered feedback from Veterans of the CST in the context of their active claims, with a focus on their comprehension and clarity of the status of their claim and the what is being asked of them with respect to the claims process.

**Co-Creation**
We gathered ideas from Veterans regarding ways to improve the CST by prompting them for the pieces of information and actions they would want to see within the claim listing and claim detail pages.


## Key Findings

1. Veterans find the claims process learning curve to be steep, with many potential areas of improvement for the claim status tool (CST).
   
2. Keeping track of relevant claims is difficult for veterans who have more claims with greater claim complexity.
   
3. Veterans think about claim status in terms of what’s currently being done to the claim, the outcome of the claim, and the items and actions standing in the way of gaining a favorable determination. 
   
4. Duplicative, inconsistent, and out-of-date content forces Veterans to play detective in establishing a cohesive picture of their claim.
   
5. Veterans find information in the CST to be vague and lacking specificity leading them to feel uncertain.
   
6. Alarming and confusing UI lead Veterans to feel anxiety about their claim. Often, these items are most relevant for other actors in the claims process.
   
7. Veterans feel a lack of reciprocity in the claims process at times. Some of the language in the CST lead Veterans to feel they’re on trial and viewed with suspicion.
   
8. Veterans wish for, and feel entitled to access the files and exam records within their benefit claims. Where necessary, access enables claimants to intervene earlier in the claims process.


## Details of Findings 

### 1. Veterans find the claims process learning curve to be steep, with many potential areas of improvement for the claim status tool (CST). 
We spoke with a range of Veterans possessing varied levels of familiarity with the claims process — from those filling their first claims post separation, to those optimizing their disability ratings and ensuring all relevant conditions are accounted for. 

While many have successfully gained expertise, this experience is hard-earned. Oftentimes involving a lot of personal research, support from 3rd parties, and many long hours spent with VA support line.

> Initially, I was going through blind, taking things for what they were. And then, I figured I could do some research and gain some knowledge digging more into the VA systems. **They're a government entity, so it's going to be pretty non-user-friendly.** 
>
> I went to youtube and google and searched what was available out there and I found some forums that explained the VA system and how it worked. 
>
> The people at the VA are good people trying to do the best that they can, with the system that they have. **They figure it's helpful, but not as helpful as they're making it out to be.
> -P4

### 2. Keeping track of relevant claims is difficult for veterans who have more claims with greater claim complexity.

- It's difficult to identify what's active or relevant in long lists of claims and appeals.
- 3 of 16 participants had 15+ events listed
- Disability claims can be structured with one claim addressing multiple conditions or issues or multiple claims addressing individual conditions or issues
- Each claim may be associated with separate additional claims or appeals 
- The VA may append or separate individual conditions/issues from open claims, making it difficult for Veterans to keep track

> If you look at the decision letter closely, you'll see that they've added stuff in the open claim. 
> It’s confusing when then do that.
> -P16

> With all of these being open I have to look at this to determine why they are here. You'd want to see the most recent claim — the one that's active.
> -P18

### 3. Veterans think about claim status in terms of what’s currently being done to the claim, the outcome of the claim, and the items and actions standing in the way of gaining a favorable determination.

**Re: Actionable Items / Blockers**

> I would want to see if there was something else I needed to do, or if everything I've submitted is sufficient for them to make a decision.
>
> Am I waiting on something specific, or is there something else I need to send?
> -P14

**Re: Determination of Individual Contentions**

> What would make this clearer is… it should list the actual determination of each contention or issue. 
> It would be good to see if it's deferred or approved rather than just “gathering evidence”.
> -P14

### 4. Duplicative, inconsistent, and out-of-date content forces Veterans to play detective in establishing a cohesive picture of their claim.

**Veterans have to piece together details from the status and files tabs of a claim to understand what's happening with claim requests.**

> ***Scans events on the status tab***
> February 11 —  We closed the notice for request 2. Now that I'm looking at this, it makes me question what request 2 even was.
>
> I recall only being asked for evidence once, so now I'd have to go back into the files section to see if I've put anything in between February 4 and February 11. Either way, there should be a notice for request 2.
>
> ***Reviews details in the files tab*** 
> So now this is even more detail on request 2, which actually makes me more concerned I missed an opportunity for a more thorough investigation.
> -P10

**Updates relating to development letters only appear on the listing page,  
with no clear way for Veterans to access them.

> The latest update listed on this screen is the 10th (claim detail), but on the other screen (claim listing), it looks like it's been updated on the 13th.
> -P16

**Regarding the claim determination, Veterans observed discrepancies between the information displayed in the details tab of a claim and the content listed in the decision letter**

> In my decision letter, it said that these issues were deferred. In my mind, If you see what's showing in here (issues listed as new), you might think “is there another decision letter out there reversing what they had already decided on?” 
> -P14

### 5. Veterans find information in the CST to be vague and lacking specificity leading them to feel uncertain.

**Veterans interpreted "closed" claims as "denied"**

> It says it's closed, but I don't know why it would be closed. I assume it's because I didn't follow through with it.
> -P13

**The status presented does not always reflect the most recent state of the claim**
One participant shared an anecdote with us relating to a claim in higher-level review described as in review. The participant shared that they were just being instructed to participate in additional exams.

> Based on What's on the screen I don't have a good sense of the status. I talked to the reviewer in the middle of the week. They had me update my availability since I got qualified for a new exam.
> -P14

Another participant shared their confusion surrounding their claim in board appeals. While the status is displaying that the board has made a decision on their appeal, content on the detail page indicates that the Veteran will either receive updated remand instructions or that the appeal may get returned to the VA board for further deliberation, leaving the Veteran uncertain about what may happen next.

**RE: Vague Language surrounding potential board appeal remand instructions** 
> They've made a decision on my appeal, but it's still open.
> What happens next is, supposedly the VA completes the "remand" instructions. And I haven't gotten anything yet as to what they're going to do. 
> -P20

Not only do Veterans, need to look across the files and status tabs to piece together information around requests for exams and evidence, there is limited information available. 

**Veterans wish to know**
-   What is being requested    
-   Who the request pertains to
-   What information has been provided
-   Whether or not the request has been accepted

> You can kind of see here it's kind of vague. They've already asked me for more evidence that I could provide. As far as I can tell they might be in evidence gathering rather than review. 
> -P10

> I don't really feel like anything's happening. It's been in here since January, basically it's saying that they're still looking into it. 
>
> Let's say I've requested medical documents from 3 facilities. It doesn't tell me here which facilities those are. Which ones sent the documents? Which ones are we waiting on?
> -P16

### 6. Alarming and confusing UI lead Veterans to feel anxiety about their claim. Often, these items are most relevant for other actors in the claims process.

Veterans are shown updates on missed claims requests that they're not responsible for, causing them to call the help line for more clarification.

> This is what caught my attention when it said, “1 item needs your attention.” It didn't tell me what the items were. I was concerned and I called. They said it wasn't on my end. This was for when I visit the VA-approved doctors. They would submit that.
> -P06

> Another time, it gave me an indicator that said that the suspense was 9 days overdue. >I didn't know what the suspense was for. I checked my mail and email. There was nothing about the suspense. When I called in, I found out it wasn't a message directed at me.
> -P06

### 7. Veterans feel a lack of reciprocity in the claims process at times. Some of the language in the CST lead Veterans to feel they’re on trial and viewed with suspicion.

We heard from Veterans examples of encountering incidents where they were not trusted by authority figures in the disability claim process. In this anecdote, a Veteran shared an example of when a C&P exam doctor misattributing a previously benefit-approved condition as one caused by a minor car accident.

> I was just telling the reviewer at the time...  the reviewer asked me if I was having a flare-up. And I said I was. I couldn't even turn my neck. 
> 
> I had to file an appeal since the one doctor associated my condition with a recent accident I went through, rather than my existing condition. 
> 
> I previously got awarded for the condition. The accident the doctor referred to was one where I was hit from behind and barely at 20 mph. 
> -P14

Given these experiences of mistrust, Veterans shared misgivings toward some of the legalist language in the claims process, and claims status tool.

> Personally, I don't like the verbiage. "Evidence gathering." It feels like it's questioning me and not just part of the process. 
> It just feels incendiary to me.  
> -P15

Others provided feedback that surrounding feelings of a lack of reciprocity in the claims process.

> It’s interesting, because when I’m submitting the claim — you're rushing me to gather all the evidence. But once it’s in. you give yourself all the time in the world to decide. 
> -P16


> They need to explain the service connections part of it in more depth and clarity if they're going to remand it. They have more information in the status part than the part that they remanded!
> -P20

   
## 8. Veterans wish for, and feel entitled to access the files and exam records within their benefit claims. Where necessary, access enables claimants to intervene earlier in the claims process.

> I should be able to pull up... just like when you go to a doctor's appointment. 
> You're evaluating me. You should be able to ask, hey can I get a copy of my medical records? Can I see my C&P exam results? It shouldn't be hidden from me. 
>
> A lot of times there are miscommunications. It could be that the individual taking the notes could have taken it incorrectly. If I were to review that, I can correct it right there without having to submit an appeal. 
> -P18

> Doesn't even look like I can look at what I submitted. I can add files, but I can't click to download or open anything, If they said, clarify this line, or explain this statement, I wouldn't be able to find it. 
> -P16

> These are my records, this is my claim, if there's something holding that up, I'm going to light a fire. 
> -P16

> Personally, I would be making sure any of the information that I understood was in there. That any of those past updates jived with what I was seeing.
> -P15

## Additional Insights
**In addition to the previous insights, mentioned above we also found that transgender Veterans experience anxiety and gender dysphoria in the process of pursuing their disability compensation benefit and utilizing their benefits.**

A transgender Veteran was blocked from moving forward in the BDD process due to the process not being able to accommodate multiple names and genders associated with one Veteran.

> I first initiated the claim under the BDD process in the 120 to 180-day window prior to discharge. I was unable to make any headway due to technical difficulties with the VA databases, so I was not able to proceed until discharge.
>
> VA systems are not configured well for transgender veterans. They periodically interface with DOD databases to download personnel information. And, at some point, it had downloaded information using my social security or service number but did it under my previous name. 
>
> When I try to access systems with my current legal name, it would reject it as invalid. There was no one from local to headquarters to fix the database issue. I was directed all over the place. VA, VHA, VA Data. I spent 3 months fruitlessly trying to fix this. Well, within one week prior to the end of the BDD window, it said it was resolved.
> -P07

Transgender Veterans experience anxiety during Evidence Gathering and Review due to the presence of multiple names and genders in their medical and service records.

> I also don't know the thoroughness of the updates to other parts of the database. Is it just my name? Or does it relate to gender? How many different places have they gone through and changed it with, what I am sure, is an archaic database system? 
>
> So, whenever I interface... or a provider is sent information about me... what information are they being sent?
> -P07

Even with a favorable determination, transgender Veterans may experience complications in obtaining their benefit in cases where the benefit is made out to their former name.

> If it's direct deposit, it may not be an issue, but what if it's a check?
> Now, persons like myself, we're prepared for that. I have a copy of a legal court order for my legal name change. But it's an unnecessary burden. 
> -P07

Transgender Veterans experience trauma and gender dysphoria encountering their former names as a part of receiving care.

> For any transgendered person [sic], encountering their former name can be traumatic or trauma-inducing. So when you're seeking out care, why invite trauma?
> -P07

## Recommendations

There are a handful of actions we can pursue based on the current pieces of data accessible within the CST.

### To address pain points relating to duplicative, inconsistent, and out-of-date content
We recommend restructuring and consolidating content in claim detail pages to reduce the amount of redundant information presented.

> This might take shape as:
> - Revising request information displayed the claim detail status tab to include details from the file tab.
	eg. Revise closed request events in the status tab to display the request details shown in the file tab. Rather than displaying “We closed the notice for Request 8”, display  “Request for Exam Request Completed”.
> - Ensure the title displayed on the detail page and the corresponding item in listing page match for appeals and supplemental claims    

### To address pain points relating to lack of clarity and confusion in claim status terminology
We recommend reviewing and revising claim status content to ensure that information is presented with clarity and serves to inform, direct and set expectations for claimants. Where possible, provide adjustments and context to tonal concerns regarding the feelings of a lack of reciprocity and Veteran mistrust.

>This might take shape as:
>- Revising vague descriptions associated with requests and status for greater clarity. (eg. “Request 3 - No longer needed” and “We closed the notice for request 4”)
>- Revise confusing language in claim status alerts
>  (eg. Request 1, Needed from you - due a month ago).

Further opportunities exist that require more extensive efforts to realize. To pursue these opportunities, we recommend further exploration, concept testing, and validation.

### To address pain points relating to process and information gaps in tracking claim status
We recommend exploring near-future-state concepts for the claim status detail page addressing the gaps identified in the research. These concepts would require further validation to ensure they address the needs identified.

>This might take the shape as:
>- Revisions to display the determination status for each contention under each claim
>- Revisions to provide the review status for granular requests associated with each claim contention
>- Revision to provide links to instructional content where appropriate

### To address existing limitations with the listing page accommodating longer lists of claims and appeals, or configurations of claims that might be more complicated
Explore alternate ways to organize the claim listing page and display claim items.

>This might take the shape as:
>- Revisions to group associated claims and appeals
>- Revisions to display the contentions associated with each claim in the listing page
