## Research Goals
With this research, we are hoping to speak with Veterans who have engaged in a decision review. We want to learn more about the pain points in this user journey.

We are also curious to find out more about which of these journeys can be fully self-service, given the complexity and high stakes nature of these reviews. We want to understand more about the Veteran experience working with VSOs and third party legal reps, so that we can create an experience that guides Veterans to either self-service or VSO-supported options in the optimal way.


## Methodology 

We scheduled 40 remote Zoom sessions with Veterans. We successfully completed 25, with 15 cancellations or no-shows.

This was broad-based discovery research intended to identify pain points in the Veteran claims and appeals process. We also got some feedback on a concept prototype intended to help Veterans connect with VSOs on VA.gov.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypotheses from [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-11-Decision-Reviews/research-plan.md)_:

_1. We have a hunch that a fully self-service digital experience will not satisfy all use cases for Veterans who are pursuing decision review options. We are hoping to get clarity around which use cases are best for self-service digital, and which require the support of a VSO._ 

**True.** It is clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach to helping Veterans file disability compensation claims and decision reviews. We heard from a number of Veterans who said VSOs were crucial to their ability to complete this process, but we also heard from Veterans who were optimistic about the VA.gov experience. Depending on a variety of factors including (but not limited to) age, the amount of free time they have, the strength of their connection to a Veteran network, and their geographic location, a self-service VA.gov process may or may not be sufficient to meet their needs. 

_2. We suspect that Veterans might not fully trust the VA to appoint a representative for them. Given suspicions we've seen in data and anecdotally, Veterans might feel as though the VA is not giving them the "best" representation and they might express a desire to seek out their own._

**False.** Veterans didn't mention being suspicious of finding a representative through the VA. Many of the Veterans we showed our "Connect with a representative" prototype to thought it was a positive thing and something they would use to connect with a VSO. Some participants in fact found a good VSO through the VA. 

_3. We have a hypothesis that self-service works well for simplified or automated use cases. In this scenario, the simplified PACT Act experience enabled via automation might be the use case that works best in a digital self-service environment._

**Maybe.** We didn't test these use cases explicitly in this study. We did confirm that a major pain point of filing claims and appeals is the gathering and submission of supporting evidence and "presumptive" cases like those enabled by the PACT Act would likely make self-service much more appealing for Veterans. This would need further research to confirm.


## Key Findings

1. The most common pain point we heard in filing decision reviews (and initial claims) is knowing what documentation/evidence you will need and being able to track it down. This is often why Veterans turn to VSOs or even lawyers for guidance.

2. When faced with a decision review scenario, the Decision Review Options page showed mixed results in helping Veterans confidently choose a decision review option.

3. When faced with a decision review scenario, Veterans responded positively to the idea of connecting with a VSO or other representative via VA.gov.

4. Many Veterans we spoke to found VSOs to be crucial in getting to a satisfactory claim decision.

5. It's clear that not all VSOs are equal in quality, and a bad VSO can be detrimental to a Veteran's experience.   

6. Many Veterans imagined an ideal experience that could be thought of as "assisted self-service." They wanted to be able to complete the process themselves on VA.gov, but also wanted to be able to reach out to a VSO if they got stuck.


## Details of Findings 


### 1. The most common pain point we heard in filing decision reviews (and initial claims) is knowing what documentation/evidence you will need and being able to track it down. This is often why Veterans turn to VSOs or even lawyers for guidance.

Labels: BNFT: Disability, PRDT: Decision Reviews, PRDT: Benefit Hubs, SPG: Vets at VSOs 

Knowing what type of evidence is needed up front, and being able to track that evidence down emerged as key pain points for Veterans in filing both initial 526 EZ claims and decision reviews. Many Veterans commented on how they don't have access to their medical records from their time in service, which makes it very challenging to prove that a disability is service-connected. Others mentioned that their initial claim was denied because they didn't know they were supposed to submit evidence at all, or a VSO told them they didn't need to. 

There are a variety of thorny problems contained within this step of the process, and it is a major reason Veterans seek out the help of VSOs. 

> "If these folks are going to file on their own, they need details explaining the type of records they need. It doesn't tell you enough about the process. It leads you to believe "fill out this form, and you're good to go." - P5

> "I'm tired of justifying this, when all the VRO has to do is read (the active duty medical records). You want a detailed summary? do it yourself." - P6

> "I had to reach out ot the VA to get my medical records, and I had got to various doctors to get my records as well. It's so much hassle, because you have to do so much running to get everything together." - P23


### 2. When faced with a decision review scenario, the Decision Review Options page showed mixed results in helping Veterans confidently choose a decision review option.

> "Me personally, I would hire an attorney at this point. A buddy of mine took 7 years. I don't know if I'll be alive a year from now." - P4

> Notes on P10: He likes the site OK, but doesn't feel like it provides the level of detail that his VSO did, or that would be necessary for a successful appeal.

> Notes on P24: Does not understand "decision review options" as a term.

> "I have to know what i'm looking for? That's my first impression. I would go straight to 'Connect with a rep.'" - P31

> "The reason this is good is because not every person is able to get to a VSO. This gives you the detailed information you need." - P33


### 3. When faced with a decision review, Veterans responded positively to the idea of connecting with a VSO or other representative via VA.gov. 

Labels: BNFT: Disability, PRDT: Decision Reviews, PRDT: Benefit Hubs, SPG: Vets at VSOs 

Our concept prototype contained link to a page that allowed Veterans to see their current VSO reps and connect with other VSO reps. If anything, participants wanted this option to be even more prominent and readily available.

> "I would have VSO info at the top of the page where they see that first." - P5 

> "I would try to get an accredited person before i did anything so I have a better understanding of the proces." - P7

> "You have connect with a rep right here. Excellent service." - P20

> Notes on P29: Would call someone for help to verify she was doing right thing. She was happy to see that option on the page.


### 4. We spoke to many Veterans who found VSOs to be crucial in getting a satisfactory claim decision.

Labels: BNFT: Disability, PRDT: Decision Reviews, PRDT: Benefit Hubs, SPG: Vets at VSOs

Many of the Veterans we talked to had positive things to say about their experience working with a Veteran Service Organization (VSO). Some expressed that they didn't believe they would have been able to get benefits at all without the help of a VSO. There are many different VSO groups, but some of the common ones we heard about were Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and Disabled American Veterans (DAV).    

Some of the main benefits of using a VSO: 
- VSOs help Veterans parse the difficult-to-understand language that the VA uses. (P2, P16)
- VSOs know what questions to ask the Veteran that will help elicit the information needed for the claim or decision review. (P10, P19, P34)
- Some VSOs even provide a "white glove" type of service where they file the forms on behalf of Veterans. (P13, P33)
- VSOs help Veterans understand what VA benefits they're even eligible for, since many are unaware. (P1, P18)


> "Doing it on my own, I don't know how I would have gotten through all that." - P7

> "You're always wise to take counsel and go with people who do this for a living." - P9

> "Without a VSO, I wouldn't have the compensation that I have." - P34


### 5. It's clear that VSOs vary in quality, and a bad VSO can be detrimental to a Veteran's experience.

Labels: BNFT: Disability, PRDT: Decision Reviews, PRDT: Benefit Hubs, SPG: Vets at VSOs 

We talked to many Veterans who had gone to several different VSOs before finding one that worked for them. A smaller number of Veterans gave up on VSOs after a bad experience, and decided to go it alone or hire a lawyer specializing in VA claims to help them. Common issues with VSOs were a perceived lack of interest in the Veteran, an overly pessimistic attitude towards claims, and severe backlogs that led to very long wait times.

> "The VSOs are overwhelmed, especially with the PCT Act, these guys just get swamped." - P3

> Notes on P6: Tried to connect with VSO and there was a huge backlog and couldn't connect from 1996-2011. He even worked at a VSO (VFW) but was still unable to get help filing a claim due to the backlog. 

> "The state VSOs we have here are hit and miss." - P12

> "Some (VSOs) are good, some are bad." - P19

> "When I first went to the VSO in 2015, he had me fill the form for what the request was about, but he didn't request medical records." - P30
 

### 6. Some Veterans imagined an ideal experience that could be thought of as "assisted self-service." They wanted to be able to complete the process themselves on VA.gov, but also wanted expert help easily available in case they got stuck. 

Labels: BNFT: Disability, PRDT: Decision Reviews, PRDT: Benefit Hubs, SPG: Vets at VSOs 

Veterans liked that the self-service option was available, but expressed hesitancy to complete a claim or decision review online without getting any help from an expert third party.

> "(Would recommend to fellow Veteran): If you’re having problems, give someone a call and talk to them." - P16

> "I would recommend doing both. I think you can do it yourself. but there are some things. It's like doing your taxes. You can do it yourself, but you can also have some assistance." - P24

> "Kinda torn (about self-service vs. VSO). I'd like to be able to do both...help with a rep and have access to complete it myself." - P31


## Additional Insights

- C&P exams also emerged as a pain point for Veterans. Some Veterans felt like the examiners weren't giving them their due diligence and were simply going through the motions conducting the exams.
- Veterans wanted to be able to see more details and more frequent status updates in CST. They often felt like the claim was "stuck" in one place and they were getting no indication that it was progressing.
- Many Veterans we talked to weren't aware that they were eligible for benefits for a long time, sometimes for decades. 
- Some Veterans have a perception that their initial claim will always get denied, and that they will necessarily need to file a decision review. 
- Access to medical records was a problem or many Veterans we talked to. Those who hadn't saved a copy of their medical records before transitioning out of the military had a much harder time filing claims and decision reviews. 


## Recommendations

**1. Make it easier for Veterans to find and connect with an accredited VSO from the CST and other VA.gov decision review pages.**
   * The value of a good VSO was clear in this research. We should build on the existing VA.gov features that allow Veterans to connect with an accredited representative should they need it, as an "escape hatch" for users who feel overwhelmed and discouraged by the idea of filing decision reviews themselves.
 
**2. Consider updating the Decision Review Options page to be simpler and more personalized.**
   * Explore opportunities to provide more relevant, tailored advice on this page so improve the chances that Veterans make the right choice when pursuing decision reviews.

**3. Help Veterans better understand what evidence they will need up-front when filing a claim or decision review.** 
   * To address the pain point of evidence gathering and initial claim denial based on insufficient evidence, can we provide more information to Veterans before they start the process so that they are better able to gather the supporting evidence they need?

## Next Steps
- Conduct further research on initial claims to determine how CST can better help Veterans with some of the pain points identified above.
- Conduct further research with claims processors to explore how decision reviews UI on VA.gov could better set Veterans up for success.
- Explore design changes to CST to make it more detailed and feel more "active". 
- Share findings with the sitewide team, and explore design changes to Decision Review Options page and other pages to incorporate above recommendations.
- Share findings with other teams working in the Benefits space so that they can make use of the findings and we can collaborate on the above recommendations. 


## Further research needed

- If we are interested in further examining whether Veterans prefer using VSOs to the self-service model, we should conduct more research on that and recruit larger numbers of Veterans who did not use VSOs to file their claims and decision reviews.
- As noted in the [Hypotheses](#hypotheses-and-conclusions) section, it would be interesting to test more automated claims and reviews scenarios with Veterans to see if that alleviates the need to use representation in filing claims and decision reviews.

## Future exploration
Based on the findings, these are good candidates for future design explorations.

- How might we help Veterans find "good" VSOs and avoid "bad" VSOs? Could something like a VSO review system help with this?
- How might we make CST feel more "alive" so that Veterans can tell their claim is being worked on, and it doesn't feel like the claim has been forgotten?
