# Research Plan for Benefits Team 1: Decision Review Options

##### Note: "Decision Review Option" refers to a Veteran attempt to change their claim decision via either a Supplemental Claim (Form 20-0995), a Higher Level Review (Form 20-0996) , or a Notice of Disagreement (Form 10182).

## Background
Today, the process for appealing an unfavorable claims decision is complicated and lengthy. Veterans have to decide on which decision review option to pursue: supplemental claims, higher level review, and/or appealing to the Board of Appeals. Each pathway is associated with lengthy wait times, with veterans often waiting more than 100 days to receive a final decision. Disability compensation appeals make up the overwhelming majority of VA benefits decision appeals.

With this research effort, we seek to better understand this user journey and identify ways in which it can be improved. Our hypothesis is: “if we provide veterans who disagree with their claims decision clarity about which decision review option is right for them and a means to pursue that option, then we expect them to receive the full disability benefits they've earned on a faster timeline.

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following OCTO Objectives: 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This work touches on various aspects of the Veteran Journey. Whenever a Veteran is applying for disability compensation benefits, this feature would be relevant. For many Veterans, this can happen at any point along their life journey. 

## Research Goals	
With this research, we are hoping to speak with Veterans who have engaged in a decision review. We want to learn more about the pain points in this user journey. 

We are also curious to find out more about which of these journeys can be fully self-service, given the complexity and high stakes nature of these reviews. We want to understand more about the Veteran experience working with VSOs and third party legal reps, so that we can create an experience that guides Veterans to either self-service or VSO-supported options in the optimal way.

We also want learn about new opportunities for Veterans to pursue decision reviews that have been enabled by the passage of the PACT Act.

### Outcome
This research will include two parts. In one, we will get some foundational qualitative data to strengthen our understanding of decision review options from the Veteran perspective. In the second, we will test a quick concept prototype to see if Veterans find value in this type of digital self-service tool. Based on the findings, we will proceed with our product development to identify ways in which we can address Veteran pain points. 

### Research questions
Part 1: General questions
- Did you use VA.gov to file your (decision review option)?
- What were your main reasons for filing the (decision review option)?
- Did you consult a third party (Veteran rep, lawyer) when filing your initial claim? Did you consult a third party when filing a (decision review option)?
- On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your experience submitting a (decision review option)?
- What were your biggest challenges with the process? 
- Was there anything about the process that worked particularly well?
- How did you feel about the end result (or how do you feel so far, if it’s underway)?

- [Show [existing decision review info](https://www.va.gov/resources/choosing-a-decision-review-option/) to ppt.] Were you aware of this page? Did you use it as a resource when pursuing your decision review option? Given your experience, do you think you would use a page like this if you were to pursue a decision review option in the future?

Part 2: Prototype

- Let’s say you just received a decision, but you’re unhappy with the result. What would you do next?
- [Reviewing decision review options] What would you do next?
- What would you expect to happen if you filed a (decision review option) in this way? 
- Is there anything else you would do at this point, either on VA.gov or elsewhere?

### Hypothesis

- We have a hunch that a fully self-service digital experience will not satisfy all use cases for Veterans who are pursuing decision review options. We are hoping to get clarity around which use cases are best for self-service digital, and which require the support of a VSO. 
- We suspect that Veterans might not fully trust the VA to appoint a representative for them. Given suspicions we've seen in data and anecdotally, Veterans might feel as though the VA is not giving them the "best" representation and they might express a desire to seek out their own.
- We have a hypothesis that self-service works well for simplified or automated use cases. In this scenario, the simplified PACT Act experience enabled via automation might be the use case that works best in a digital self-service environment.

## Methodology	
As mentioned above, the research sessions will be broken into two parts: 

**Part 1: Semi-structured interviews** 
The interviewer will ask the Veterans a series of questions with the goal of learning more about their decision review experience and the pain points they encountered. The goal of this is generative – to try and elecit problems that the team can solve with subsequent design ideation.

**Part 2: Usability testing**
We will be using a concept prototype for this, meaning we won't be looking for perfect usability. The goal is also generative: to explore whether this type of tool would be useful to Veterans, and also to see if there are any obvious gaps in its content that need to be filled in a subsequent iteration.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research is Veterans who have gone through a decision review, or are in the process of going through a decision review. We would like to recruit (out of 40 total): 

- 20 ppts who have submitted a Supplemental Claim
- 10 ppts who have submitted a Higher Level Review
- 10 ppts who have submitted a Notice of Disagreement

### Recruitment criteria
We would like to recruit 40 Veterans with the goal of successfully completing at least 20 sessions. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

We are primarily looking for Veterans who have experience with the decision review process for disability compensation claims. Participants must be able to speak to their process, so ideally it has happened in the last ~5 years, or they are curently in the process of a decision review.

> Question for recruits: "Have you ever submitted either a Supplemental Claim (Form 20-0995), a Higher Level Review (Form 20-0996) , or a Notice of Disagreement (Form 10182)?"

We would like to recruit at least 20 Veterans who worked with a Veteran Service Organization (VSO) in pursuing their decision review. 

We would like representation from the following underrepresented groups: 

- 10 Primarily mobile users
- 10 Veterans in a rural area
- 10 Veterans without a degree
