# (WIP) Research Plan: Development Letters

## Background
Veterans can currently access decision letters and 5103 Notice letters from the Claim Letters page. There are a number of "development letters" and other correspondence letters that the VA sends to Veterans that we want to also make available on this page for easy access.

As we introduce these letters to the Claim Letters page, we need to better understand the current experience of Veterans who receive development letters. What are some pain points in the current process that we might be able to help resolve by adding these letters to CST? 

Development letters will also include tracked items, which show up as alerts in CST for Veterans to take action on. Many times these involve evidence requests, but not always. With the 5103 redesign we have established a new UI flow to improve the experience of seeing a 1P alert for a tracked item with a new letter in the Claim Letters page. In this research we want to test the efficacy of that design, and see how this design might scale to other tracked items associated with development letters.


### OCTO Priorities 

This supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md):
- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey
This work supports a Veteran whenever they are filing a disability compensation claim, which could occur across a wide swath of the Veteran journey, ranging all the way from "Getting out" to "Aging."

## Research Goals	
1. Understand more about Veterans' experience with development letters today, including pain points and things that seem to be working.
2. Evaluate the efficacy of the new 5103 Notice design. Is it clear what Veterans are being asked to do? Is it clear how it relates to the 5103 Notice letter?
3. Asses how well our "content model" for alerts works across a variety of different request types associated with development letters.
 

### Outcome
Identify pain points in the current development letters experience that we might help resolve with CST user experience improvements. Identify any issues with the new 5103 design and solidify a user-validated model for how we should communicate information and action items related to development letters in CST.

### Research questions

**Part 1: Understanding development letters experience**
- Do you remember receiving letters from the VA while you were waiting for your claim?
- What was the contents of the letters you received?
- Was there anything particularly frustrating about your experience with these letters?
- What would have made the experience better?
- Did these letters make things easier in any way?

**Part 2: Review 5103 design**
- Looking at this design, what do you think you need to do here?
- Where would you go to find your letter?
- What action, if any, would you take?
- Is there anything confusing about this?

**Part 3: Review other benefit letter types**
- Looking at this design, what do you think you need to do here?
- Where would you go to find your letter?
- What action, if any, would you take?
- Is there anything confusing about this?

### Hypothesis

- Veterans will have had some confusing or frustrating experiences with development letters while their claim was being processed.
- There are opportunities to improve the experience of receiving development letters by including them in CST.
- The new 5103 design makes it clear to Veterans what the 5103 Notice letter is for and what is being asked of them.
- The "content model" works to make various types of development letters and their notifications clear and actionable in CST.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach


Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
We would like to recruit 20 Veterans for this study.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- Veterans must have filed a (standard, non-FDC) disability compensation claim with the VA in the past 2 years
- [Open question: Do we want to filter for Veterans who say they remember receiving a VA letter?]

**Screener question**
> Have you filed a disability compensation claim with the VA in the last 2 years?
> Was your disability compensation claim a Fully Developed Claim (FDC)? **Screen out participants who respond Yes to this question**

What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 2 sessions per day

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
