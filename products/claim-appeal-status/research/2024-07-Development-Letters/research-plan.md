# Research Plan: Benefit claims development letters

## Background
Veterans can currently access decision letters and 5103 response request notice letters from the VA.gov Claim Status Tool. VBA sends Veterans a number of "development letters" and other correspondence letters that VBA wants to also make available on this page in order to give Veterans the ability to elect digital-only communications in the future.

As we introduce these letters to the Claim Letters page, we need to better understand the current experience of Veterans who receive development letters. What are some pain points in the current process that we might be able to help resolve by adding these letters to CST? 

Development letters will also include tracked items, which show up as alerts in CST for Veterans to take action on. Many times these involve evidence requests, but not always. With the 5103 redesign we have established a new UI flow to improve the experience of seeing a 1P alert for a tracked item with a new letter in the Claim Letters page. In this research we want to test the efficacy of that design, and see how this design might scale to other tracked items associated with development letters.


### OCTO Priorities 

This supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md):
- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey
This work supports a Veteran whenever they are filing a disability compensation claim, which could occur across a wide swath of the Veteran journey, ranging all the way from "Getting out" to "Aging."

## Research Goals	
1. Understand more about Veterans' experience with development letters today, including pain points and things that seem to be working.
2. Evaluate the efficacy of the new 5103 Notice design. 
3. Asses how well CST's tracked items "content model" for alerts works across a variety of different request types associated with development letters.
4. Identify pain points in the current development letters experience that we might help resolve with CST user experience improvements
5. Assess Veteran perception of the value and/or risks associated with electronic-only communications from VA
 

### Outcome
Identify pain points in the current development letters experience that we might help resolve with CST user experience improvements. Identify any issues with the new 5103 design and solidify a user-validated model for how we should communicate information and action items related to development letters in CST.

### Research questions

- Is it clear what Veterans are being asked to do? Is it clear how it relates to the 5103 Notice letter?

**Part 1: Understanding development letters experience**
- How do Veterans perceive and manage the letters they receive related to their claim?
- Do Veterans have clarity about what actions they need to take for their claim?
- What’s difficult about the letters Veterans receive about their benefits claims?
- What's helpful about the letters Veterans receive about their benefits claims?

**Part 2: Evaluate 5103 design (Prototype)**
- Are Veterans clear what the alert means and what they're being asked to do?
- On the document request page, what action are Veterans more likely to take?
- Are Veterans clear how the 5103 alert relates to the 5103 Notice letter?
- Can Veterans find the 5103 letter related to their claim?

**Part 3: Review other benefit letter types (Prototype)**
- Are Veterans clear what the alert means and what they're being asked to do?

**Part 4: Electronic-only communications**
- If they had the option, would Veterans like receiving only electronic communications like this?
- How would they configure these communications, if they had those options?

### Hypothesis

- Veterans have had some confusing or frustrating experiences with development letters while their claim was being processed.
- There are opportunities to improve the experience of receiving development letters by including them in CST.
- The new 5103 design makes it clear to Veterans what the 5103 Notice letter is for and what is being asked of them.
- It is reasonably easy for Veterans to find the development letter they're looking for among the full list of letters in the Claim Letters page.
- CST's tracked items content model works to make various types of development letters and their notifications clear and actionable in CST.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment criteria
We would like to recruit 20 Veterans for this study.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- Veterans must have filed a (standard, non-FDC) disability compensation claim with the VA within the past 2 years.
- Veterans must have received a letter from the VA related to their claim within the past 2 years.

**Screener question**
> "Have you filed a disability compensation claim with the VA in the last 2 years?" **Should be yes**

> "Have you received letters from the VA related to your claim in the last 2 years?" **Should be yes**

We intend to use Maximum Variation Sampling as a recruitment strategy. Below is the demographic breakdown of participants we would like:

- 10 participants should be aged 55-64+
- 10 participants should be Black or Hispanic Veterans
- 5 participants should be in a rural area
- 2 (at least) should be women

For more details about our criteria, refer to our [Recruitment ticket.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/632)

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.
