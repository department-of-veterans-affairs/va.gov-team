## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Skyler/Gary], and I'm going to be guiding you through the session today. I'm on a team that works with the VA on the VA.gov website. Today we're going to talk about disability compensation claims and the Claim Status Tool.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you used VA.gov before?
- If yes, could you briefly describe the last time you used it? Do you tend to go there for a specific use?
- Have you ever filed an application for disability compensation (Form 526-EZ) with the VA?
- If yes, when was the last time that you've filed a claim with the VA?

## Part 1: Understanding development letters experience (before the prototype) - 5 minutes

- Do you remember receiving letters from the VA while you were waiting for your claim?
- Do you remember what was being asked of you in those letters?
- Was there anything about the letter that was confusing?
- Was there anything about the letter that helpful in fulfilling the request?

[Ask participant to share their screen]

## Part 2: Evaluate 5103 design (Prototype)

### Part 2 A: CST Home Page - 5 minutes

Imagine you're signed into your VA.gov account and looking at this page.

- Do you know what this page is? If yes, what is it?
- Descridbe to me what you're seeing here.
- What do you think is the difference between the first claim and the second claim shown here?
- Looking at the claim card, you can see it says, "We sent you a development letter". What do you think that means?
- What would you do next if you wanted to know more about the request?

#### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant recognize the Claim Status Tool?
- Do they recognize which claim is in progress?
- Are they initially inclined to investigate the notice on their own? (Do they lean towards calling VA)

### Part 2 B: Status Tab - 5 minutes

[Have the participant click "Details" on the in-progress claim]

- Tell me what you see here. (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)
- From what you've observed, what do you believe this notice is trying to communicating?
- Do you feel like this page tells you everything you need to know about the claim? Why or why not?
- If you wanted to learn more about the notice, where would you go from here?

[Have the participant click "Details"]

#### Things to watch for:

- How do Veterans react to the Status page in general?
- Does the description in the notice make it clear the Veteran what is being asked of them?
- Does the Veteran understand the current status of the claim and the pending request, including what actions are needed from them and what actions we are taking?

### Part 2 C: Evidence notice page - 10 minutes

- Take a moment to review the page. Is the content what you expected to see?
- Can you describe the relationship between the alert on the previous page and the notice page?
- Describe in your own words what you think is being communicated?
- What would happen if you don't take any action?
- What action, if any, would you take?

#### Questions for claim letters page

- Tell me what you see here?
- Where would you go to find your claim letters?
- If you wanted to view a particular claim letter, what would you do?
- Is there anything here you're not seeing that you wish was here?

[Have participant navigate back to evidence notice page]

Next, we will go back to the 5103 evidence notice page and explore the evidence upload process.
At this time, I will have you click on the "upload your evidence here" link.

#### Questions for evidence upload, on the files page
- Tell me what you see here?
- If you wanted to upload evidence, what would you do?
- After submitting your evidence, what do you expect to happen next?

We will return to the 5103 evidence page to explore the last option on the page. 

#### Questions for submitting waiver section
- Before you check the box, tell me what you expect to happen when you select the "I'm finished adding evidence" checkbox?

[Participant clicks into submit waiver]

- Describe what you are seeing on this page
- what do you think will happen next
  
#### Things to watch for:

- Is the particpant aware of their options and the results of each
- Are Veterans clear how the 5103 alert relates to the 5103 Notice letter?
- Can Veterans find the 5103 letter?
- Do participants feel like there's still something else they need to do?

One last time, we will review the 5103 evidence page for a few general questions about this experience

- What would happen if you don't take any action?
- If there's anything we could do to improve this page, what would it be?
- Is there anything confusing about this?
- Is there anything helpful about this?

## Part 3: Review other benefit letter types - 10 minutes

- How well do you think the layout of this page works for this notice?
- Is there anything confusing about this?
- If you could improve this in any way, what would you change?

### Things to watch for:

## Part 4: Electronic-only communication - 5 minutes

- How do you currently receive communications about your veteran benefits?
- If given the option, would you prefer receiving only electronic communications for development letters (ie 5103 notices)? Why or why not?
- How comfortable are you with accessing and managing electronic communications?
- How do you ensure you don’t miss important electronic communications?
- What features or functionalities would make electronic communications more appealing or useful to you?

### Things to note:

- If they had the option, would Veterans like receiving only electronic communications like this?
- How would they configure these communications, if they had those options?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Overall, what did you think of what you saw today? Was it clear or confusing?
- On a scale of 1-5, how helpful would you say the flow was? (1 being least helpful, 5 being most helpful.)
- If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about the evidence request experience, what would it be?
- Any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
