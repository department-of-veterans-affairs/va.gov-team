## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Gary/Skyler], and I'm going to be guiding you through the session today. I'm on a team that works with the VA on the VA.gov website. Today we're going to talk about disability compensation claims and the Claim Status Tool.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way. I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website.
- The people from Perigean who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Is it okay with you to have  [specific number] people join us to observe this session?**
   - _If yes: Admit observers._
      - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.
      - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

- **In this session, we’ll ask you to use a test version of the website.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- I'd like to ask for your permission to record the screen and audio as we talk today. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments would be attributed to you directly.  **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you okay if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

* Have you used VA.gov before?
   * _If yes_
      *  Could you briefly describe the last time you used it? Do you tend to go there for a specific use?
* Have you ever filed an application for disability compensation (Form 526-EZ) with the VA?
   * _If yes_
      * When was the last time that you’ve filed a claim with the VA?

## Part 1: Understanding development letters experience (before the prototype) - 5 minutes

* Do you remember receiving letters from the VA while you were waiting for your claim?
   * _If yes:_
      * Can you give us some examples of what was in the letters?
      * Was there anything particularly frustrating about your experience with the letters?
      * Was there anything about the letters that helped you know what to do?
   * _If no: Move to screen sharing_

### Screen sharing and prototype
At this time, I'm going to have share your screen. Before you do, please make sure to hide anything sensitive on your device that you don't want us to see.

[Ask participant to share their screen]

[Share  [prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/BUdMIxAiIutG12rZxZ0cg1/Claim-Letters-Navigation-%2B-5103-Alert-Updates?node-id=2479-8381&t=DIduZYnsoaPYuT1q-1&starting-point-node-id=2479%3A8381)  with participant]

## Part 2: Evaluate 5103 design (Prototype)
### Part 2 A: CST Home Page - 5 minutes
**PROMPT**: Imagine you’re signed into your VA.gov account and looking at this page.

* Describe to me what you’re seeing here.
* What would you call this page?
* What do you think is the difference between the first claim and the second claim shown here?
* Looking at the in progress claim, it says, “We sent you a development letter”. What do you think that means?
* What would you do next if you wanted to know more?

[Have the participant click “Details” on the in-progress claim]

#### Things to watch for:
* Does the participant recognize the Claim Status Tool?
* Do they recognize which claim is in progress?
* Are they initially inclined to investigate the notice on their own? (Do they lean towards calling VA)

### Part 2 B: Status Tab - 5 minutes
Take a moment to review this page. Feel free to scroll up and down and think aloud as you do so. 

* Tell me what you see here. 
* Based on what you’ve read, what is this alert trying to communicate?
* Do you feel like this page tells you everything you need to know about the claim? Why or why not?
* If you want to learn more about what you need to do, where would you go from here?

[Have the participant click “Details”]

#### Things to watch for:
* How do Veterans react to the Status page in general?
* Does the description in the notice make it clear to the Veteran what is being asked of them?

* Can you describe the relationship between the alert on the previous page and this notice page?
* Is this content what you expected to see?
* Describe in your own words what you think is being communicated?
* What would happen if you don’t take any action?

I want you to explore the available options as if you were alone and viewing the actual page.

* What action, if any, would you take first?

#### Questions for claim letters page

At this time, I will have you click on the “upload evidence” link.

#### Questions for evidence upload, on the files page
* Tell me what you see here?
* If you wanted to upload evidence, what would you do?

[Participant clicks submit waiver]

* Describe what you are seeing on this page.

[Have the participant click on the “VA” logo to go back to the previous page]

_If the participant hasn’t explored the other options, prompt them to take another action on the 5103 evidence notice page_

_Otherwise, skip to “Closing questions for 5103 experience”_

#### Closing questions for 5103 experience
Now that we’ve explored all the options available to you, we’ll ask a few general questions about your experience.

* Is there anything confusing about this page?
* Is there anything helpful about this page?
* If there’s anything we could do to improve this page, what would it be?

At this time, we’ll transition to a different scenario.

#### Things to watch for:
* Is the participant making sense of the content on the page
* Is the participant aware of their options and the results of each
* Are participants clear how the 5103 alert relates to the 5103 Notice letter?
* Can participants find the 5103 letter related to their claim?
* Do participants feel like there’s still something else they need to do?

## Part 3: Review other benefit letter types

Thank you for your input. We are done with the prototype, and we’ll now move on to a few questions about your communication preferences. 

#### Things to watch for:

* Does the participant understand what’s required of them?


## Part 4: Electronic-only communication - 5 minutes

- How do you currently receive communications about your veteran benefits?
- If given the option, would you prefer receiving only electronic communications for development letters (ie 5103 notices)? Why or why not?
- How comfortable are you with accessing and managing electronic communications?
- How do you ensure you don’t miss important electronic communications?
- What features or functionalities would make electronic communications more appealing or useful to you?

#### Things to watch for:

- If they had the option, would Veterans like receiving only electronic communications like this?
- How would they configure these communications, if they had those options?


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Overall, what did you think of what you saw today? Was it clear or confusing?
- On a scale of 1-5, how helpful would you say this evidence request experience? (1 being least helpful, 5 being most helpful.)

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us today. Your feedback was greatly appreciated as we work to improve the site for Veterans.

Perigean will send you a thank you note with a brief message to share with other Veterans who might want to participate in future research.

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
