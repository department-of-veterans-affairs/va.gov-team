# PILOT

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Gary/Skyler], and I'm going to be guiding you through the session today. I'm on a team that works with the VA on the VA.gov website. Today we're going to tal k about disability compensation claims and the Claim Status Tool.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way. I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website.
* The people from Perigean who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Is it okay with you to have  [specific number] people join us to observe this session?
  * If yes: Admit observers.
  * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.
  * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
* In this session, we’ll ask you to use a test version of the website. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
* I’d like to ask your permission to record the screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments would be attributed to you directly. Are you okay with me recording my screen and audio during this session?

**Start recording.**

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you okay if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? <br>
    Yes

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

* Have you used VA.gov before?<br>
  Yes
  * *If yes*, could you briefly describe the last time you used it?<br>
  Last time I used it to log into the Health eVet to refill my perscription
* Have you ever filed an application for disability compensation (Form 526-EZ) with the VA?<br>
  Yeah
* Have you uploaded files using Va.gov or VA mobile app?<br>
  I think VA.gov I have, not mobile though

[Ask participant to share their screen]

[Share [prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/m1Xt8XjVDjZIbliCYcCKpE/Document-status-%28formerly-silent-failures%29?node-id=2771-20256&t=YQPL10Sibs5kZtpY-1) with participant]

## Part 1: Uploading a file successfully

### Part 1 A: CST Home Page - 5 minutes

**PROMPT**: Let's say you are signed into your VA.gov account and you're looking at this page. You submitted a claim a month ago, and you're logging in to check and see if there's been an update.

* Do you know what this page is? If yes, what is it?<br>
Looks like the page to see where all my claims are and to get informatin on them
* Describe to me what you're seeing here.<br>
So this is where I'll check my claim status and I can probably scroll down and see all my historical claims for each of them for example the first box I can see when it was received, what step it's at, and the last date that a step was taken by the VA - and then if I want more informatino on this claim I would click on Details.
* Imagine you’re waiting for this top claim to be decided, and you want to upload evidence. What would you do?<br>
Click on the Details link

### Part 1 B: Status Page - 5 minutes

[Have the participant click "Details" on the in-progress claim]

* Tell me what you see here. (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)<br>
So here I get the details of what was on that claim, (reads contentions) and the status so like the latest information and that's kind of repetitive, almost the same thing I saw on the box overview. The most interesting thing that I would look for is what I need to do, and right now it says there's nothing needed from you right now. But it does tell me what step they're in. If I wanted to know the details of those steps I'd click on "Overview of the process"
* Is there anything particularly useful?<br>
Probably the Files tab would be good to look at to review what files I did upload or I wonder if there's any files that the VA would upload there - that would be most interesting to double check that if I forgot to upload something 
* Is there anything particularly confusing?<br>
No
* If you wanted to upload evidence to your claim, what would you do?<br>
I would assume that I'd go to Files tab in that tab there'd be like an upload functionality

### Part 1 C: Files Page - 10 minutes

[Participant clicks into the Files tab]

* Now tell me what you see here. (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)<br>
Yeah so now I get to see that I could upload more files such as additional evidence and then it does verify that I should be able to see files associated with this claim and I'm guessing if we scroll down under "Documents received" there'd be a history of what's been uploaded (scrolls) yeah.
* Is there anything that is particularly useful about what you see here?<br>
YEah it's good to see what's been submitted, so just by looking at what's there I see veteran leetter, DD214, I'd probably at this point be like oh I forgot to upload htis medical record, so I'd upload it here and click "Submit files for review"
* Is there anything that is particularly confusing about what you see here?<br>
Nope
* What steps would you take to add a file to your claim?<br>
I would click on "Upload file" and then select a file from my computer, I'm just very like particular if I'm doing something important I use my laptop. Even booking travel, I can't book travel from a phone, that's so risky.

### Part 1 D: Confirmation message for successful file upload - 10 minutes

[Participant completes the File upload]

* Now tell me what you see here.<br>
So here I get to see a verification message that lets me know that it was received and it'll take two days to receive so that lets me know to wait at least two days if I have my qualms about whether it got uploaded.
* How would you explain this message to a friend?<br>
My file was submitted jan 16, and my submission will take two days. So within two days I should be able to see that it's uploaded.
* If we were not here, what would be your next step? (Prompt them to scroll up and down. If they haven't.)<br>
 I'd probably check out the Overview tab to see if there's any additional information that's useful for me to know
* What do you think this card is trying to communicate (referring to the submission in progress card)?<br>
Um so this gives me more information about, it gives me the opportunity to upload more files but particularly here I get to see the status and that it was submitted today and it shows that it's in progress. And then (reading Docs Received text) and then this one (in progress) will show up in two days I think. And then I have some information about whether I want to mail my files, which I wouldn't, but I get to see some informatino about what's on my record and what's in progress.
* Can you describe the relationship between the confirmation message and the "submission in progress" card?<br>
So it looks like almost the same message it says if I submitted using this online tool then this is where I'm gonna see it while it's in progress, so even though it's not showing up under Documents Received I can see what's being uploaded so it doesn't just go into the complete ether, so there is a glimmer of hope that like you're file's not lost, we're just processing it.
* Add: Is there a reason why you'd click Overview tab instead of link inside card*
 I guess I felt like the green box gave enough information. 
* What do you think will happen in a couple days after seeing this card?<br>
*[Notes]*

[Click on the “next button” to see the file has now be added to the e-folder]

* Describe what happened here?<br>
It looks like it processed really fast. Instead of being in progress it's already been received. And that's confirmed byt the "Received on" date
* What would you do next?<br>
I think that's all I was looking for to see the status of that file upload

## Part 2: Failure processing file (Type 2 Failure)

[Click on the name "Hector" on the top-right hand corner of the page]

### Part 2 A: Home page - Open tracked item - 5 minutes

**PROMPT**: Now, we're going to imagine that the VA has requested evidence from you.

* Tell me what you see here.<br>
I see a neat box in blue so that lets me know - it stands out because it's a different color and it looks like an important banner. So it says "We requested more information from you" so it's telling me to check on this. And it will go away once I take action it looks like. So I'd click on Details to find out what they're asking me for.
* What do you think this alert is communicating?<br>
See above
* Based on the text in this alert, when you upload your file, when do you expect the alert to disappear?<br>
I expect it to disappear once they've reviewed it, I guess once it's been reviewed because that's what they say...
* If you want to know more about this request, what would you do?<br>
Click on Details

### Part 2 B: Status page - Buddy statement request - 5 minutes

[Click on "Details"]

* Tell me what you see here.<br>
Immediately at the top it looks like I need VA form 21-4142 so I can give them permission to access medical records. I'm guessing if I click on Details I'll get access to a form that I can fill out and upload. 
* Describe to me what this alert is communicating?<br>
*[Notes]*
* What pieces of information are importnat to you on this page?<br>
This warning box, that's the most, anything else just kinda takes background - so yeah I would say the fact that it does tell me which form that's a vital piece of informatino because it could be a form that I've already filled out in that case I just need to upload it, in that case I'd just go to File but if I didn't I'd have confidence they'd provide that in the details.
* If you wanted to learn more about the alert, what would you do?<br>
Click on Details

### Part 2 C: Request page - 5 minutes

[Click on the details]

* Describe what you’re seeing here. Remember to think aloud as you do.<br>
So here I see more information about that form, and it looks like I can download it, and I can fill it out online. It looks like it tells me what date they sent me this request. I'm glad this is in bold (suspense date) because it looks like the timeline to respond is in 30 days. It als has informatino about accreddite representative, might refer to this as a different number...and then if I'm ready I can go ahead and drop the file here and submit it.
* In your own words, can you describe what is being communicated?<br>
That I have 30 days to respond to this request um I guess I am curious what happens if I miss the deadline...yeah...because it says we'll wait for you to respond until Jan 30, so I'm guessing if I miss the deadline then it affects the decision in a negative way. And that they make a decision without that info. 
* If you wanted to respond to this request what would you do?<br>
So I would do it through this area (pointing to file uploader widget) if I didn't have it I'd fill it out going to "About VA Form 21-4142". I don't know if I'd have to come back or if it's already connection. I'm not sure where that link's gonna take me ("About VA Form 21-4142"). 

### Part 2 D: Confirmation for tracked item - 15 minutes

[Participant completes the File upload]

* Now tell me what you see here.<br>
So I'm seeing the same green confirmation message that the submission started on Jan 19, and it's in progress, and similar to before it can take up to two days for them to receive it, and then there's a link for checking the status of the submission.
* If we were not here, what would be your next step? (Prompt them to scroll up and down. If they haven't.)<br>
I think either clicking the "Check the status" or "Files" just to see what it looks like as it's in progress.

[Click on the alert, "Check the status of your document submission"]

**PROMPT**: Please scroll down to the "Documents" section. In this prototype, the page won’t scroll there automatically, but that’s the intended behavior in the final version.

* Is this what you expect to see?<br>
Yeah
* What would you do next?<br>
I think I'd be done, I'd come back in a couple of days to see if that submission goes to Documents Received 
  
⠀
## Part 2 E: Participant Logged out

**PROMPT**: Now we’re going to pause and imagine that you’ve logged off and 3 days later, you get an email notification on your device.

[Click on the name "Hector" on the top-right hand corner of the page]

**PROMPT**: Take a moment to review this page.
So it looks like the next step would be to mail it, not sure how you would do it in person. I think if you scroll down it'll tell me...(reads) OK so I would find a VA Regional Office near me. So if it fails it sounds like I'd have to send it by mail...what's WI...Wisconsim? And then if I just want to hand it over in person I could visit someone, but I feel like mail would probably be easier.

* What are you feeling when you see this?<br>
Um probably not surprised that something failed on the VA website (laughs). But glad to see alternative solutions. Yeah and I think the "by mail" would be more accessible, I feel like in person would just require too many steps, driving somewhere and all that. 
* In your own words, describe what is being communicated.<br>
*[Notes]*
* Why do you think you are receiving this email?<br>
There was probably like a tech glitch of some sort, maybe the document didn't get uploaded correctly, that's my main suspicion. 
* What would you do next?<br>
*[Notes]*
  
⠀
I want you to explore the available options as if you were on your own and viewing the actual page.

* Which option do you prefer and why?<br>
*[Notes]*

### Part 2 F: Return to VA.gov - 3 minutes

[Click on the "exit" button on the top-right hand corner of the page]

**PROMPT**: Now we’re logged back into the VA website to see your claim.
Without clicking anything, take a moment to review the page. Remember to think aloud as you scroll up and down.

* Tell me what you see here<br>
So my eyes immediately went to the red message and I saw the "we need you to resubmit a document for this claim" and having just seen that email, I already know that it's going to be that one, but so far that's the only information I see. So I would have to click on Details.
* If you want to know more about this alert, what would you do?<br>
Click details

### Part 2 G: Status page - Resubmit Error - 10 minutes

* Tell me what you see.<br>
(Reading alert) It shows me the name of the file, and I think that's helpful beause already three days later I'll already have forgotten what I submitted (reading more). I imagine that the "Learn how to submit documents" link will give me informatino similar to what I saw in the email. 
* Describe what you think this alert is telling you.<br>
See above
* What do you think is the relationship between what you're seeing here and what you saw in your email?<br>
So this one is just like the virtual confirmation of what I saw in the email, and then if I don't see my email I can also click here to remind myself on how to resubmit the document. 
  * [If needed for reference click the “reference email” button]
  * [Click the email logo to return to previous screen]
* What do you expect to happen if you click the "X" button on the alert?
Um...that's a good question...I immediately think that it's just gonna go away, because that's...any time I don't want to see an error message I just close it and it goes away. 
* If you sign out and then sign back in a few days later, would you expect to see anything related to this alert?<br>
Yeah. I think it just closes it for that session.
* What would you do next?<br>
I'd probably just close the alert and look to see if there's any other messages to attend to. (Regarding this error or something else?) Something else.

#### If they say click on the files page

* What are you expecting to see here? (prompt them to scroll down)<br>
*[Notes]*
* Looking at this card, can you describe what's being communicated?<br>
*[Notes]*
* If you wanted to resubmit your documents what would you do?<br>
*[Notes]*
* [click the CTA to resubmit documents]
⠀
#### If they chose learn how to resubmit document

* [click the CTA to resubmit documents]

### Part 2 H: Resubmit notice page - 10 minutes
Without clicking anything, take a moment to review the page. Remember to think aloud as you scroll up and down.

* Tell me what you see?<br>
Pretty similar to the email, same message, they couldn't process it, and then there's a Note that if I already did it I don't need to do it again. And then if I scroll down I see where I need to mail it to, and how to do it in person. And then it looks like there's more information on how to confirm if the documents have been received, and it says to call, so rather than rather than see online I'd probably...since it's either snail mail or in person calling is the best way to check the progress of it. 
* What do you think is the relationship between what you're seeing here and what you saw in your email?<br>
*[Notes]*
  * [If needed for reference click the “reference email” button]
  * [Click the email logo to return to previous screen]
* What do you think will happen after you submit your document using one of these options?<br>
I think it'll take longer than two days for it to show up, but eventually I'll see it ... actually I don't know that I'll see it in the document ssubmitted because it seems that only shows what you upload. So yeah, I'm not sure. I think it's supposed to also show any document, but I'm not certain. 

⠀
## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

* Overall, what did you think of what you saw today? Was it clear or confusing?<br>
Um I think only the end part was confusing. There's like excitement of "oh I'm so glad the VA is being modernized so I can upload my files, because why am I mailing myself when we have the internet" and the only sadness is "oh I'm going to have to do this the old school way even though technology is here." 
* Was there anything helpful?<br>
The little info messages and the warning and it being red, those are always helpful because it helps at least my eyes see something different. So that i can take action as soon as possible. 
* On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel about being able to resubmit your document if you received a notice like this in real life? (1 being least confident, 5 being most confident.)<br>
I would say 4, because I'd probably still have to go to the library and print the form and then just all the extra steps that I'd have to find it in my schedule to plan to after I print it, fill it out, put my social on it and then mail it. So yeah it's a 4 just because of all the extra time that it's gonna take to do all of these things.
* On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel VA will effectively manage your paper documents you've submitted? (1 being least confident, 5 being most confident.)<br>
I would say a 4 also because I still have to call them to check the status like I don't remember seeing "we'll send you an email when we receive your physical copy" or any type of physical validation that this is moving along it's more like "you need to take every step to make sure that we receive it." 
  * Why?<br>
  *[Notes]*
* Any questions for me?<br>
*[Notes]*
  
## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us today. Your feedback was greatly appreciated as we work to improve the site for Veterans.

Perigean will send you a thank you note with a brief message to share with other Veterans who might want to participate in future research.

Thanks again, and have a great day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
