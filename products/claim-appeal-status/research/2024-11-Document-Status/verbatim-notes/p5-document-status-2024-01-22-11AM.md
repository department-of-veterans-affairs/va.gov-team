## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

* Have you used VA.gov before?
> Yes
* Have you ever filed an application for disability compensation (Form 526-EZ) with the VA?
> Yes

* Have you uploaded files using Va.gov or VA mobile app?
> NOTES


## Part 1: Uploading a file successfully

### Part 1 A: CST Home Page - 5 minutes

**PROMPT**: Let's say you are signed into your VA.gov account and you're looking at this page. You submitted a claim a month ago, and you're logging in to check and see if there's been an update.

* Do you know what this page is? If yes, what is it?
> Yes, It's a saying decision and recview. I would do Thank you regularly. you see the claim and compensation. evertyhing. 

* Imagine you’re waiting for this top claim to be decided, and you want to upload evidence. What would you do?
> Go to details.

#### Things to watch for:

* Does the participant recognize the Claim Status Tool?
* Do they recognize which claim is in progress?

### Part 1 B: Status Page - 5 minutes

[Have the participant click "Details" on the in-progress claim]

* Tell me what you see here. (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)
>  I see where I've claimed. Dec 15th. i see a date, what i claimed, status, files, overview and what I need to do. like it normally does. I see the entire page. 
> I would scroll down and click files to make sure I have evertying in and everything is covered.

* Is there anything particularly useful?
> yea, actually ugh., i can see i'm step 3 of 8 and it tells me the overviw of the process. i see dec 30th I moved to step 3. I would scroll down more. now i would go up to overview. i would tap the overview.
> just to tsee the process and how far it is and what's it doing. after I check that then i would go to files to see if i have evertyign and not missing everyting. then go to overview to check on evertying. I would just make sure my I's are dotted and T's are crossed. 

* Is there anything particularly confusing?
> go down some more... yea.. ugh... yea... oh its going up instead of down. 
> It felt like I was going up instead of down. Yeah, it actually does because it says I submitted on the 15th, but the order is going up. I expected it to go down instead—like the 15th, the 20th, and the 30th in descending order. So, yeah, I was expecting the order to be reversed.
> And, like I said, it’s a bit confusing because it shows I submitted on the 15th, but you’d expect to see the 15th, the 20th, and the 30th in order going down the line. It's more convenient.

* If you wanted to upload evidence to your claim, what would you do?
> ugh... I 'd scroll down to see where I can submit it. (still on the status page). there's no place to submit it.. **note**: he's reading the page. then says.
> I guess I would go to files to see if iit will let me submit there. 

#### Things to watch for:

* How do Veterans react to the Status page in general?
> NOTES

* Do Veterans read the recent activity section and find it important?
> NOTES

* Do Veterans know what to do if they want to add files to their claim online?
> NOTES

### Part 1 C: Files Page - 10 minutes

[Participant clicks into the Files tab]

* Now tell me what you see here. (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)
> ok..yea ook.. claim files.. additional evidence.. ok yea, I can see a lot better. I figured it would be in files. yea. ok yea...

>  I would keep scrolling down if I dno't have anything to upload. I see they have my documents, cross my T and dot my eye. I see they revieed my files. pending reviewed.  some files haven't been reviewed. that's what I'm looking for. I'm wondering why it haven't been revieed. the copy of DD214 says it wasnt reviewed, that looks like it should be reviewed. . the evided PDF (5103) was reviewed but why hasn't the other stuff been reviewed. I see the other see if the veteran stuff is left pending., tbut the dd214 was left with no review. that was submitted on the 15th but the other file was (5103) was esubmitted on the 16th (of december) that was reviewed why not the other one. Som that's sconfusing.

> moderator - it sound like you expecting every file say reviewed at soe point?

> Yea, you would figure it wouldbe more uniform like it'd be check. That would be confusing, because, as you can see right here, it was submitted on the 15th. That hasn’t been reviewed. But the one on the 16th Has got the green mark, and you got the one that’s pending. It doesn’t even say anything about the DD214, except that it was received on December 15th. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense that that will be complete.

* Is there anything that is particularly useful about what you see here?
> NOTES

* Is there anything that is particularly confusing about what you see here?
> It felt like I was going up instead of down. Yeah, it actually does because it says I submitted on the 15th, but the order is going up. I expected it to go down instead—like the 15th, the 20th, and the 30th in descending order. So, yeah, I was expecting the order to be reversed. And, like I said, it’s a bit confusing because it shows I submitted on the 15th, but you’d expect to see the 15th, the 20th, and the 30th in order going down the line.

* What steps would you take to add a file to your claim?
> Oh, I scroll back up.  OK, I will have load file, upload file. I would select to see what file it is. make sure it's the right file. i would put the file I need and submit. here we go yep. i would go to overwiw or status to see if it was submit just to make sure it's gotten submitted (this is while looking at the confirmation message). He asserts he would look at status. 


#### Things to watch for:

* What content on the page is most useful to the Veteran? Least helpful or confusing?
> NOTES

* Do Veterans read the document files section and find it important?
> NOTES

### Part 1 D: Confirmation message for successful file upload - 10 minutes

[Participant completes the File upload]

* How would you explain this message to a friend?
> Oh it tell me how to check the document submission. It takes up to two days to receive the document. Yeah, that’s cool. OK, that’s cool.

* If we were not here, what would be your next step? (Prompt them to scroll up and down. If they haven't.)
> I would click on it—just a second. Yeah, I’d click on it, just to make sure and see what happens. Honestly, I would. OK, so I clicked on it. Alright, now I’ll go to... It’s in progress. It’s received. I’ll scroll down as well. Yeah, just curious. I’m just checking things out, scrolling down a bit more. Scrolling down a bit more. OK, alright. Now, I’ll scroll back up to take another look. Scrolling back up. A little more, one more. OK, I’ll go to "Overview" since I see it’s been submitted. I just wanted to check "Overview" to make sure everything looks right. So, when we clicked this to check the document submission status, it brought us here.

* Is this what you expected to see?
> Yeah, yeah. No! I see a copy of my DD214. Oh, but that's just a simulation, right? Yeah. OK. Yeah, yeah. So that should be fine because you have the right date on there. It shows that I submitted it, and it's marked as in progress. As long as I know you received it, I’m satisfied.

* What do you think this card is trying to communicate (referring to the submission in progress card)?
> Oh, just what I submitted and the date I submitted it. and my submissin is in progress it's not fully submitted, i jnow you guys got it so I'm good with it honestly. 

* Can you describe the relationship between the confirmation message and the "submission in progress" card?
> yeah.. well this one says it'll take us 2 days to received your sumibttions (referrgint to green alert) it doesn't say it down there. But why does it says it's in progress? Oh that's it... its says it's in progress. Yea that would be fine. As long as it is has the same date on there. I don't see anything wrong with that. 


**PROMPT:** Let's pause and imagine you come back later in the day to check on your uploaded.

[Click on the name "Hector" on the top-right hand corner of the page]

* If you wanted to check the status of the claim where would you click?
> ummmm... well.. ugh.. scroll down. yea, I would click on details to see everything. Because it say is in progress, just to see. 

[Click on "Details"] 
* Where would you go to check the progress your uploaded document?
> Scroll down... I would check the overview of the process, to see everything that I have submitted and an idea of how far along I am—like, for example, how close I am to step four. See everyting that was  submitted and trying to guestimate if I’m closer to step four.
> Well, there really wouldn’t be anything else I could do until the "in progress" gets done (referring to the status page "in progress tag).
> Moderator: OK. And you’re saying there’s nothing you can do at this point? So, you’re referring to the "in progress" status?
> Yea that in progress you have to wait until it process then I would come back and see if it processes after 2 days.
> Moderator: what do you think this in progress is referring to?
> ughh the file I just submitted.
> Mod: i'll direct us to the files page and scroll down for you (to the documents received section).
> **Note**: He thinks the in progress tag on the status page is referring to the file he just submitted

[Click on "Files tab"] 

* Describe what happened here? (Prompt them to scroll up and down. If they haven't.)
> ok.. see that's what's confusing right there. that received January 16th (newSupportingDocument.pdf), then the review and and review by VA and see all of that would be confusing because those dates.

> Let me see...Wait a minute. Oh no... Oh yeah... I would be clicking on all that, to be honest with you. (referring to the individual files in documents received) whaterver I can click on to see what they have, what tehy're doing.

> But I see the NewSuportingDocument.pdf.  It doesn’t say "pending review" or nothing though, and it doesn’t have a green checkmark or anything.

> Mod: Do you recognize this file, the new supporting document?

> Yes, I do. I remember—that’s the file we submitted, correct?

> Mod: So can you describe what happened with this file?

> Yeah, I've submitted my document. It just said it was received on the 16th, but it doesn't say its been review or in progress. I wouldn't know anything about that. i would just call and see if they got it or not.

> See that's what..see, that's what would be confusing you. I know these are files you submitted, but none of these have it (status). There's only one that's been reviewed. So and one being 1 pending review. It would just be confusing to me that whole scenario. you don't know what you received or didn't received... you don't know. 


* When you look at the other files listed, some have a status while others don’t. What do you think is the difference between these files?
> yea that would be really confusing to me. well I know, 1 says newSuportdocument. and one says copy of DD214. andother says the same thign at the bottom. I submitted it one month then submitted it again. why? Honestly it'sall confusng.

> The whole, the whole thing would be confusing, OK, because I don't know if I don't know if you could click on any of that to see what's going on with it, 'cause you you'd be, you'd be wondering, OK, So what happened to this do what happened to the one on the 15th?

* Would you expect to see statuses on all of these files?"
> that would be frustating, it really would because you don't know nothing. If it was more uniform with the checkmarks, it would be a whole lot easier. I would have to pick up the phone and call VA to ask them what's going on. 


* What would you do next?
> NOTES

#### Things to watch for:

* When they see the confirmation message, are they more likely to leave the page or check their submission status?
> NOTES

* Do they understand what the "submission in progress" card is?
> NOTES

* Once the document hits the eFolder, is it clear the submitted document is now added to their records and no longer pending?
> NOTES

> I'm missing something... then its teling me, after I review it, it's going to go away. Where woudl it go to? Do I get a copy of it?

> Mod: what are you reffring to as it?

> Mod: what's your instncts

> its just goign to tell me about the form. it doens't tell me about to download it. It's about thhe form but it's not the form.

> Mod: OK, so it so it sounds as though you're saying that this link will take you to read more about the form, but it doesn't necessarily tell you you're about to download the form.

> well you see it says you the "download the form to fill it otu online but the link suggests it will just tell me about it. but I would click the link anyway to see. 

* If you wanted to upload your response, how would you go about it?

> No, no, you're good. You're right where I need you to be (looking at the "submissions in progress" section on the files page).

## Part 2 E: Participant Logged out

**PROMPT**: Now we’re going to pause and imagine that you’ve logged off and 3 days later, you get an email notification on your device.

[Click on the name "Hector" on the top-right hand corner of the page]

**PROMPT**: Take a moment to review this page.

I want you to explore the available options as if you were on your own and viewing the actual page. 
 * Which option do you prefer and why?

> It depends, if i'm closer i would go in person, if not, I'd probably mail it.

> I would click "Find VA reginoal office" to see how close it is to me and I would weigh my options.

> Mod: so why would doing it in person, assuming that there is one close to you, why would doing it in person appeal to you more? 

> I want to give to a personal person. I'd rather hand deliver it or, you know, know that they got it cause the mail always can mess up and the mail's always running late. And as we know being in America, it's always a problem with the mail.

### Part 2 F: Return to VA.gov - 3 minutes

[Click on the "exit" button on the top-right hand corner of the page]

**PROMPT**: Now we’re logged back into the VA website to see your claim.

> autohriozation to release of infomraiton (reading the documet type listed in the alert (e.g. new-va-21-4142.pdf) and reads the linked request title, authorizationt o disclose information)

> Honeslty I would click on both links: the authorization to discose request type to be nosey. i'm expecting to see the form I filled out. then I would click "learn how to resumibt the doucment by mail" 

* What do you think is the relationship between what you're seeing here and what you saw in your email?

  * [Click the email logo to return to previous screen]
> the email that you just showed me? its the same... I need to submit. it s gave me the the information at first. I just waent in there to look more in depth. but I would pay attention to that "we need to you sesumit a doucment" they way you have it out there is really good.

### Part 2 H: Resubmit notice page - 10 minutes
Without clicking anything, take a moment to review the page. Remember to think aloud as you scroll up and down.

* What do you think is the relationship between what you're seeing here and what you saw in your email? 
  * [If needed for reference click the “reference email” button]
  * [Click the email logo to return to previous screen]

> oh that's what I'd bee looking at. its already submitted the document the date it failed.. I would scroll down to see how to resubmit your document.

> then I would go down to read "how to confirmed we received".. yea that's about right. 

* How likely are you to re-upload the document instead of sending a physical copy?
> I'd rather re-upload my document. I wish they had a way you can re-upload because mailing or going in person is extremly inconviennt.

> Mod: So if we were not here, right, like if you're getting this in real life, would you try to re-upload it or would you just try to send the copies like the first time around once you see this message?

> I wouldn't even waste my time trying to re upload it.

> Mod: you'll just go ahead and send copies in?

> yea, just plain and simple. It's just cut to the chase. I wouldn't try to re-upload it, it wouldn't make sense. 

* What do you think will happen after you submit your document using one of these options? 
> I would expect it to tell me what the process is. If i logged out. I would come back to see that you guys got it for sure. To let me know it's been verified. 

#### Things to watch for:

* Do they use the "recent activity" section to track the progress of their upload?
* Do they understand why they are seeing an email?
* Can they identify the relationship between the email and in-app alerts?
* Do they understand the options available for resubmitting files to VA?
⠀
## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

* Overall, what did you think of what you saw today? Was it clear or confusing?
> It was pretty much mainly clear, but it was just a little bit confusing. Like I said, when you upload the documents and they’re not... it seemed like they should go from the down.

> You know, the way they go, the way it looks is like you’ve got to go down to find out, and then you’ve got to go up instead of just going straight down looking at the dates and stuff. You know, you just go straight down, but the way it’s set up on the page, it’s like you’ve got to go all the way down to the page and then start scrolling up.

> Mod: OK, so referring to the recent activity, how they started with like, I guess the most recent day and then going to the older ones, you feel like it should be the other way.

> Yeah..yeah. because you have to go down and look back up. instead of just reading down the page. 

* Was there anything specifically helpful?
> Yeah, it told me everything I needed to do, and it stood out—especially the warnings. They made it clear that there was no point in trying to upload the documents because they wouldn’t go through. That was really helpful because most people would probably still try to submit them anyway. But it plainly states not to do it. In so many words, it clearly says to mail it or bring it in. So, right then and there, you know not to try submitting it. I mean, most people with common sense wouldn’t attempt to submit it.

* On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel about being able to resubmit your document if you received a notice like this in real life? (1 being least confident, 5 being most confident.)
  * Why?
> I say it'd be  4. I'd be kinda weary, because I don't know if the proper person received it. I got to hand it to somebody in the building, but it's the proper people going to get it. and that's what I'd be worried about. did they received it, did it go through the process.

> Mod: So it sounds as though you're confident in submitting the documents themselves, but you're not so confident of what will happen once you've already turned it over.

> So many times that's happened.

* On a scale of 1-5, How confident are you that VA will effectively manage the paper documents you’ve submitted? (1 being least confident, 5 being most confident.)
  * Why?
> Honestly? 2. You have to understand, the VA makes you feel a bit leery about a lot of things. When you're dealing with them, there's always that uncertainty. I guess you don’t really trust anyone, but in the back of your mind, you’re always wondering—did they actually receive it? Was it sent to the right people? Did it end up in the proper place? You're just in limbo because you don't know. That uncertainty is the most frustrating part because there’s no real confirmation. You can hand it in, and they might say, "Oh, OK, thank you. I’ll make sure it goes in the file." But how would you really know? Mistakes happen, and work gets lost all the time.

> Mod: OK, so knowing that like receiving some sort of confirmation that your paper documents were received will boost your confidence.

> It definitely would because you know it's there, you know they got it, and that’s one less thing on your mind. You’re not left wondering, "OK, well, I haven’t heard if they got the documents." One of the biggest concerns is making sure you receive the paperwork you need. Because if the paperwork isn’t submitted, you get denied, you’re stuck in limbo, and you end up with even more paperwork. That’s one of the biggest challenges I’ve had to deal with—making sure you got the document, checking if it went through, if you received it, and if you reviewed it.


* Any questions for me?
> No, no but this was fun though.

> the site is really good. just little bitty thing. they put somethign on your mind that make you think  when you get off there..like did htey get the paperwork?
