## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

* Have you used VA.gov before?
> Yes
I wanted to make sure I could get in, so I used it this morning—went in to VA.gov and went to disability section and pension section and just went on my VA health to check my messages.

* Have you ever filed an application for disability compensation (Form 526-EZ) with the VA?
> M: Sounds like you’ve filed for disability before

* Have you uploaded files using Va.gov or VA mobile app?
> Yes


## Part 1: Uploading a file successfully

### Part 1 A: CST Home Page - 5 minutes

**PROMPT**: Let's say you are signed into your VA.gov account and you're looking at this page. You submitted a claim a month ago, and you're logging in to check and see if there's been an update.

* Do you know what this page is? If yes, what is it?
> So create an account? Is that what you want me to do?<br> I see 404 the page you’re looking for cannot be found.
<br>M: So when you went to VA.gov you got a 404
<br> Site was down for maintenance
<br>(Tries again with link in chat)
<br>I see Check your VA claim and appeal status
<br>M: Let’s say logged into your account and you submitted a claim a month ago and you’re checking for any updates. (Gives some other guidance about waiting to click on things). Do you know what this page is?
<br>Yes, I’ve visited it many time, checked my status many times. Took 12, 18 months to get my results. 

* Imagine you’re waiting for this top claim to be decided, and you want to upload evidence. What would you do?
> This one says I’ve got evidence gathering and this one says I’ve got a decision ready. I imagine I wouldn’t need to go to claim decision because I’ve got a note here. I’d click details.
<br>It says there’s nothing I need to do now, so I wouldn’t understand why I’d need to add files based on what they’re saying
<br>I’d go to the Files tab 


#### Things to watch for:

* Does the participant recognize the Claim Status Tool?
* Do they recognize which claim is in progress?

### Part 1 B: Status Page - 5 minutes

[Have the participant click "Details" on the in-progress claim]

* Tell me what you see here. (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)
> NOTES

* Is there anything particularly useful?
> Yeah—It says what I claimed and that they received it on December 15 so it’s nice to know that they received my claim and that it’s in progress. I could go to the overview of the progress and see if there’s anything I didn’t know.


* Is there anything particularly confusing?
> It’s pretty clear – they received my claim and the status of my claim that it’s in progress and that they don’t need anything from me right now and that they’ll let me know when there’s an update


* If you wanted to upload evidence to your claim, what would you do?
> (Clicks on files tab)
<br>Reads: If you need to add evidence…
<br>Only submit evidence that supports this claim…
<br>Files sizes. This is not confusing to me, but I’d imagine that someone who’s not technical wouldn’t really know how to see how big their file is. 
<br>I would then click upload file.


#### Things to watch for:

* How do Veterans react to the Status page in general?
> NOTES

* Do Veterans read the recent activity section and find it important?
> NOTES

* Do Veterans know what to do if they want to add files to their claim online?
> NOTES

### Part 1 C: Files Page - 10 minutes

[Participant clicks into the Files tab]

* Now tell me what you see here. (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)
> NOTES

* Is there anything that is particularly useful about what you see here?
> Yeah—to submit for a new claim and it’s nice that it says it opens in a new tab 
<br><br>It says here to only submit evidence for this claim, but for a new claim, go here. I guess that’s ok here, but it seems like it wouldn’t be the place for it. It should be earlier because I’m already down in these files. 
<br><br>I’m looking at what I already uploaded. My veteran letter, a buddy statement, an evidence, and a DD214. I don’t know what this 5103-evidence is. Maybe I filled it out when I did mine, but maybe describing what this is. Another little line about what this is. And the VeteranLetter – a buddy statement – maybe what this is. Is that where my buddy said what I’m saying is true?
<br><br>M: So you’d have liked to see a descriptive line about each file
<br>Yeah




* Is there anything that is particularly confusing about what you see here?
> I’d click upload file.
<br>Then I have to scroll down. What kind of document is this, so I’d select what kind of document type. (Sighs while looking at drop-down) Marriage, divorce, photographs. So I’d choose one of those. I’m trying to see if there’s an other. What if I had something that’s different from one of those things listed. 
<br><br>M: Explains that this is not a complete list
<br><br>Then I’d need to upload file
<br><br>M: Explains that for purpose of prototype we pre-uploaded one for you
<br><br>Then I’d click Submit files for review.
<br>Shows here that you’ve received it which I like. I’ve got confirmation that you’ve got it, and I imagine that when it’s received it would appear under Documents received.
Is the Veteran notified by email when the document is received?
<br><br>M: What would you expect or desire?
<br><br>I’d like some kind of notification that my submission was received rather than me having to go back and check.
<br><br>M: As of now, you’d have to go back and check
<br><br>That can be frustrating because the process takes so long – to go back and check, you’re like finally. I’m talking months. So you’re going back and checking.
<br>Every 30 days, you get this thing that says they’re still working on it.
<br><br>M: What would be your next step?
<br><br>I’d log out.


* What steps would you take to add a file to your claim?
> NOTES


#### Things to watch for:

* What content on the page is most useful to the Veteran? Least helpful or confusing?
> NOTES

* Do Veterans read the document files section and find it important?
> NOTES

### Part 1 D: Confirmation message for successful file upload - 10 minutes

[Participant completes the File upload]

* How would you explain this message to a friend?
> Well I submitted my document on the 16th and in a couple of days I’m going to go back and click this link to check the status and see if it’s been expected


* If we were not here, what would be your next step? (Prompt them to scroll up and down. If they haven't.)
> NOTES

* Is this what you expected to see?
> NOTES

* What do you think this card is trying to communicate (referring to the submission in progress card)?
> That it’s in progress and hasn’t been accepted yet. Or maybe hasn’t been reviewed yet. Reviewed. Accepted.


* Can you describe the relationship between the confirmation message and the "submission in progress" card?
> (Scrolls up and down to review)
They look like they’re the same to me. When I click this, all it does is take me down here. Looks the same. The only thing the card gives me further information is what I submitted, which is helpful. The dates are the same. I like that. (Laughs)


**PROMPT:** Let's pause and imagine you come back later in the day to check on your uploaded.

[Click on the name "Hector" on the top-right hand corner of the page]

* If you wanted to check the status of the claim where would you click?
> Is this actually what happens when I click on my name? It would go right here? Usually what I do is go up here to VA and get a list of all the things I can click on. It’d be great if clicking on my name went right here!
<br><br>I’d scroll down and click just be able to see it. I’d click details and I’d be able to see that while it was submitted on December 15 and that it moved to this date on Dec 30, I really don’t know if my document was accepted.
<br><br>M: What does “in progress” mean to you?
<br><br>It means that my whole claim is in progress.


[Click on "Details"] 
* Where would you go to check the progress your uploaded document?
> It says last updated in [missed this] so it looks like my file hasn’t been accepted
<br><br>This is confusing because it looks like it was accepted oh but it’s not reviewed. This one says it’s pending review and this one says it’s been reviewed. This one I have no idea if VA has reviewed it or not. 
<br><br>The military personnel and DD214 look like they haven’t been reviewed. 


[Click on "Files tab"] 

* Describe what happened here? (Prompt them to scroll up and down. If they haven't.)
> NOTES

* When you look at the other files listed, some have a status while others don’t. What do you think is the difference between these files?
> Military Personnel and DD214 – those are facts about me that probably wouldn’t need to be analyzed or reviewed or disputed or anything like that unless there was an error. The evidence and the veteran letter would probably need to be analyzed for their content as to whether it applies to the disability claim.

* When you look at the other files listed, some have a status while others don’t. What do you think is the difference between these files?
> NOTES

* Would you expect to see statuses on all of these files?"
> Yes, I’d expect to – I see that the DD214 and Military Personnel have been received, but it’d be nice to see that they’ve been received and reviewed or accepted. I’d like to know that somebody looked at them.

* What would you do next?
> I’d log out and wait to see if something changes here. Because like if the status – last updated on December 31st. I’d log out and log in again tomorrow to see if there are any changes.

#### Things to watch for:

* When they see the confirmation message, are they more likely to leave the page or check their submission status?
> NOTES

* Do they understand what the "submission in progress" card is?
> NOTES

* Once the document hits the eFolder, is it clear the submitted document is now added to their records and no longer pending?
> NOTES

## Part 2: Failure processing file (Type 2 Failure)

[Click on the name "Hector" on the top-right hand corner of the page]

### Part 2 A: Home page - Open tracked item - 5 minutes

**PROMPT**: Now, we're going to imagine that the VA has requested evidence from you.

* What do you think this alert is communicating?
> Received my claim on the 15th. Oh, we requested more information, click the claim details to learn more. 
<br><br>This message will go away when we finish reviewing your response. That’s nice. It’s nice that it’ll go away and you don’t need anything else from me. In one of the previous ones it already said you don’t need anything else from me.


* Based on the text in this alert, when you upload your file, when do you expect the alert to disappear?
> Immediately. I gave you my information. I would think it would go away and change to we don’t need anything from you.

* If you want to know more about this request, what would you do?
> NOTES

#### Things to watch for:

* Do they understand that they need to take action?
> NOTES

* Is it clear that the alert will remain visible until VA has reviewed the file and not when the Veteran uploads the file?
> NOTES

### Part 2 B: Status page - open request - 5 minutes

[Click on "Details"]

* Describe to me what this alert is communicating?
> (Reads alert)
<br>Scrolls and reads “We opened a request” [also for 4142]
<br>I’d click on the Details and see what else you want


* What pieces of information would you say are important to you on this page?
> Well, this (alert) is very important. I can’t get my claim to continue unless I give this to you.
<br><br>This last updated is just staying on December 31st even though it’s January and I’ve been doing stuff and this was requested of me after December 31st. It’d be nice if the date changes.

* If you wanted to learn more about the alert, what would you do?
> I’d click details

### Part 2 C: Request page - 5 minutes

[Click on the details]

* Describe what you’re seeing here. Remember to think aloud as you do.
> Reads: You can download the form or fill it out online. 
<br>Reads: Use VA Form
<br>Reads: We sent you letter “Request for specific evidence or information”
<br><br>This is the first time I’ve seen this. I’d find this letter in my claim letters and see exactly what you need, then I’d go to this form, the 21-4142 and see what I need to give you and I have until Jan 30 to do it. Then after I have it filled out, I’d submit my files for review. I’m guessing that when I download the form or fill it out online and upload it. It’d be nice if after I fill it out online it would just add it to my claim. 


* In your own words, how would you describe what's being communicated?
> NOTES

* If you wanted to upload your response, how would you go about it?
> First I’d find the letter and see what you want. You went to dr so-and-so and you want an xray about my foot. Then I’d go to the form and fill it out.


When the participant see the pre-populated upload file remind them: 

**PROMPT**: Just a reminder for this demo, we’ve pre-uploaded a file to simulate selecting one from your device.

>(drop-down for file type)
<br>Oops! There’s a 4142 and 4142a. Looks like it’s not the a. So I’d choose this one (4142)


### Part 2 D: Confirmation for tracked item - 15 minutes

[Participant completes the File upload]

* If we were not here, what would be your next step? (Prompt them to scroll up and down. If they haven't.)
> I’d scroll down and look at recent activity. Yup. Submission in progress. So you’ve got it or it’s been submitted. I did what you asked me to do.
<br><br>I’d go great, they got it, and I’d log out. Then I’d come back in a day or two to see if it was received.

[Click on the alert, "Check the status of your document submission"]

**PROMPT**: Please scroll down to the "Documents" section. In this prototype, the page won’t scroll there automatically, but that’s the intended behavior in the final version.

* Is this what you expect to see?
> So I checked it. Now I need to scroll down. Submission in progress. It’s going to take 2 days to do this. So I guess I’ll check on the 21st if it’s been expected.
<br><br>Yes. It’s been submitted so submission is in progress. And it was the form. 

* What would you do next?
> I’d log out and check on the 21st.

#### Things to watch for:

* Do they notice the link to the document status in the confirmation message?
> NOTES

* Do they navigate to the Files tab to check the document status?
> NOTES  
⠀
## Part 2 E: Participant Logged out

**PROMPT**: Now we’re going to pause and imagine that you’ve logged off and 3 days later, you get an email notification on your device.

[Click on the name "Hector" on the top-right hand corner of the page]

**PROMPT**: Take a moment to review this page.

* What are you feeling when you see this?
> We can’t process the document you submitted. We’re sorry about this.
<br><br>OK. Document details. 
<br><br>Resubmit by mail or in person. 
<br><br>What if you know which document this is. If you don’t know – call you. 
<br><br>I’d be frustrated. Can’t I just try uploading again? I don’t want to go to any office. I’d print it. I’d be a little wary because you want my SSN on it. I’d look at my email again to see if this is a real email. 
<br><br>To be honest, I’d be hesitant about calling because I’d spend the next hour and a half on hold and that’s frustrating. I’d probably go ahead and print it out and call the number and ask if this is for real and then mail it in. Or I’d see where my regional office is to me. I’d just get it ready and the next time I go in to town, about 30 minutes away, I’d stop by. But I’d be frustrated.
<br><br>I’d call first and most likely mail it in. 


* In your own words, describe what is being communicated.
> NOTES

* Why do you think you are receiving this email?
> Well because they couldn’t process the form I sent them. I don’t know why. Just because there’s a problem with their system. 

* What would you do next?
> ⠀ I want you to explore the available options as if you were on your own and viewing the actual page.  
⠀
I want you to explore the available options as if you were on your own and viewing the actual page.

* Which option do you prefer and why?
> Mail it in. I’ve never been to the VA regional office near me. I go to the hospital. Is the regional office at the hospital? If it is, it’s not that far out of my way. But if it’s in a strip mall somewhere that I’ve never been to then I’d mail it in.

### Part 2 F: Return to VA.gov - 3 minutes

[Click on the "exit" button on the top-right hand corner of the page]

**PROMPT**: Now we’re logged back into the VA website to see your claim.
Without clicking anything, take a moment to review the page. Remember to think aloud as you scroll up and down.

* If you want to know more about this alert, what would you do?
> NOTES

### Part 2 G: Status page - Resubmit Error - 10 minutes

* Describe what you think this alert is telling you.
> We need you to resubmit. OK I got the email. This is exactly the same thing as in my email that’s now in my claim. I’d click on how to submit documents by mail or in person. 

* What do you think is the relationship between what you're seeing here and what you saw in your email? 
  * [If needed for reference click the “reference email” button]
  * [Click the email logo to return to previous screen]
> NOTES

* What do you expect to happen if you click the "X" button on the alert? If you sign out and then sign back in a few days later, would you expect to see this alert again?
> I’d expect I’d go back up here to my claim status and that I’d have to click the “details” again to see it again. 
<br><br>M: OK so in other words, what do you expect to happen to this alert?
<br><br>It would disappear. 
<br><br>M: If you sign out and sign back in a few days later, would you expect to see this again
<br><br>Yes. I’d expect to see the alert until you receive the document from me.


* Is there anything in the alert you're not seeing that you wish was there?
> NOTES

* What would you do next?
> NOTES

#### If they say click on the files page

* What are you expecting to see here? (prompt them to scroll down)
> Why couldn’t it be submitted? Did I miss signing something. Was there a problem with the document? I’d like to know why it wasn’t submitted.

* Looking at this card, can you describe what's being communicated?
> It says if you’ve already resubmitted, you don’t need to do anything else, which is nice. I’d print it out, fill it out, and get a 75-cent stamp now and mail it. Or first I’d look for where the regional office and if it’s convenient, I’d go there.
<br><br>To confirm: Call us. Oh. I don’t like that at all. Preferably I’d get an email that says we received it and your claim status has been updated. 
<br><br>My husband (also a Veteran) gave up his whole disability thing because he was so frustrated. He just gave up.


* If you wanted to resubmit your documents what would you do?
> NOTES

* [click the CTA to resubmit documents]
⠀
#### If they chose learn how to resubmit document

* [click the CTA to resubmit documents]

### Part 2 H: Resubmit notice page - 10 minutes
Without clicking anything, take a moment to review the page. Remember to think aloud as you scroll up and down.

* What do you think is the relationship between what you're seeing here and what you saw in your email? 
  * [If needed for reference click the “reference email” button]
  * [Click the email logo to return to previous screen]
> It’s the same information

* How likely are you to re-upload the document instead of sending a physical copy?
> Very likely. Very very. That’s probably the first thing I would have done. I’m just going to try again and see. Because it’s easier than to go somewhere or mail it in. 
<br><br>If it doesn’t work again, ok. But maybe it was just a glitch.

* What do you think will happen after you submit your document using one of these options?
> NOTES

#### Things to watch for:

* Do they use the "recent activity" section to track the progress of their upload?
* Do they understand why they are seeing an email?
* Can they identify the relationship between the email and in-app alerts?
* Do they understand the options available for resubmitting files to VA?
⠀
## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

* Overall, what did you think of what you saw today? Was it clear or confusing?
> Very clear. One of the challenges for me when I first started navigating the whole process. Even now, 5 years of my national guard are missing. Where do I go? There’s so many different places to go. It’s getting better.

* Was there anything specifically helpful?
> Yeah—it’s what it looks like when I go to the actual system. It was an accurate representation. I appreciate that somebody cares about our actual experiences. 
<br><br>Yeah—being able to go into my claim, see what’s been received, the current status. The links to the form, that I didn’t have to go out of the system and find it. That was helpful.


* On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel about being able to resubmit your document if you received a notice like this in real life? (1 being least confident, 5 being most confident.)
  * Why?
> 5 - Because I already did it and I can do it again

* On a scale of 1-5, How confident are you that VA will effectively manage the paper documents you’ve submitted? (1 being least confident, 5 being most confident.)
  * Why?
> 5 - They’re going to handle the documents that I submitted

* Any questions for me?
> I don’t think so. I appreciate that you guys are asking – to see how it’s going and try to make it better. Every time I submit anything it’s taken 1-2 years and having to go back and back. Recently, trying to get my husband as my dependent was really frustrating.

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
