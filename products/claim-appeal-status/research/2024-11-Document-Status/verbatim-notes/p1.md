## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Gary/Skyler], and I'm going to be guiding you through the session today. I'm on a team that works with the VA on the VA.gov website. Today we're going to tal k about disability compensation claims and the Claim Status Tool.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way. I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website.
* The people from Perigean who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Is it okay with you to have  [specific number] people join us to observe this session?
  * If yes: Admit observers.
  * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.
  * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
* In this session, we’ll ask you to use a test version of the website. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
* I’d like to ask your permission to record the screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments would be attributed to you directly. Are you okay with me recording my screen and audio during this session?

**Start recording.**

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you okay if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? <br>

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
N/A

## Part 1: Uploading a file successfully
N/A
### Part 1 A: CST Home Page - 5 minutes
N/A
### Part 1 B: Status Page - 5 minutes
N/A

### Part 1 C: Files Page - 10 minutes

[Participant clicks into the Files tab]

> It's telling you the type of files you can use. It's saying JPG, etc. It's also saying the file must be under 150 MB, so you need to check your file before you upload it. It also gives you the option to email the file too.

> Interesting? Yeah, it gives you a pending review status and DD214. It shows the status at the bottom. There's also a disclaimer that says documents received by mail aren't shown in this tool. It gives a disclaimer.

> It shows the file was received by the 15th, and the other means it was reviewed by the VA.

> DD214? It's saying 'received.' It's not showing 'reviewed.' It just says they got it.

> Different before the files with status? Reviewed' means the VA actually looked at it. The one that says 'received,' I think, just means they got it, but they didn't actually look at it.. 

> Anything confusing? Nah, the third one says 'pending review.' It says 'received,' but it hasn't been reviewed yet. Pretty self-explanatory.

### Part 1 D: Confirmation message for successful file upload - 10 minutes

[Participant completes the File upload]

* Now tell me what you see here.<br>

* How would you explain this message to a friend?<br>
> The submission is in progress, but it's going to take two business days to see my document. So, you guys put the link to check the status. You can follow that link to make sure if they received it or not... I mean reviewed it.

* If we were not here, what would be your next step? (Prompt them to scroll up and down. If they haven't.)<br>

> so..yea so... I would just wait a few days after it. so I couldn't do anything in general. So I'll check the document status in a day.
> Click the link to check status? I think it will show all my files and show me the newest one. and I will see something that says pending.

> yea it says submission in progress, this is what I suspeected. 

* What do you think this card is trying to communicate (referring to the submission in progress card)?<br>

> the card is saying everyting went through. and It could take up to 2 days to review it.

* Can you describe the relationship between the confirmation message and the "submission in progress" card?<br>

> pretty transparent, because before it says 2 business days to know it will be reviewed. so its in progress but we havwen't received it yet. 

**PROMPT:** Let's pause and imagine you come back later in the day to check on your uploaded.

[Click on the alert, "Check the status of your document submission"]

**PROMPT**: Take a moment to review this page.

* What are you feeling when you see this?<br>

> Of course, you want to do everything online, but now I have to mail it out and print it. I have to go to the post office, get envelopes, or go to the VA office. It's more of an inconvenience then. 

* In your own words, describe what is being communicated.<br>

> Looks like the file didn't meet their standards, so I have to do it again.

* Why do you think you are receiving this email?<br>

> Maybe I didn't complete it correctly. It reads 'the instructions for physical copy.' Seems like I have to send it by mail.
> 
* What would you do next?<br>

> I want you to explore the available options as if you were on your own and viewing the actual page.

* Which option do you prefer and why?<br>

I would submit it in person; the VA office is not too far from me. If I mail it, it could take more days—Wisconsin to Texas.

[Click on the "exit" button on the top-right hand corner of the page]

**PROMPT**: Now we’re logged back into the VA website to see your claim.
Without clicking anything, take a moment to review the page. Remember to think aloud as you scroll up and down.

* Tell me what you see here<br>

> Yeah, okay. We need you to resubmit a document for this claim. It's like what they said earlier: I need to resubmit it. I guess it pertains to the email.

> Ddetails. 

### Part 2 G: Status page - Resubmit Error - 10 minutes

* Tell me what you see.<br>

> Reading it, it says they need me to send it by mail or in person. Oh, yeah, it's basically like what the email is saying. If I click 'Learn how to submit,' it's probably going to send me to a page that has the same information as the email

* Describe what you think this alert is telling you.<br>
*[Notes]*

* What do you think is the relationship between what you're seeing here and what you saw in your email?<br>

> It's a close relationship. The email explains what's going on. It gives the same information but in a different way.

if there's antying you want to see? 
> this the document you need to send in. so it has everyting


  * [If needed for reference click the “reference email” button]
  * [Click the email logo to return to previous screen]

* What do you expect to happen if you click the "X" button on the alert?

> I don't know; it might collapse it, but I don't know. I still need to do it.

* If you sign out and then sign back in a few days later, would you expect to see anything related to this alert?<br>

> "I think it'll still be there. If I click 'X,' I'm closing it, but I don't think it will pop up tomorrow. If I don't click 'X,' it will still show the next day.

### Part 2 H: Resubmit notice page - 10 minutes
Without clicking anything, take a moment to review the page. Remember to think aloud as you scroll up and down.

* Tell me what you see?<br>

> Pretty much what it tells me in the email. We couldn't submit it online; we need to go into the email, print it out, write the Social Security number on there, and send it in. It also says if I want to confirm the VA received the document, I can call in.

* What do you think is the relationship between what you're seeing here and what you saw in your email?<br>

> Ah, I think it's the same relationship. It's basically telling me how to do it, so I think it's pretty much the same.

  * [If needed for reference click the “reference email” button]
  * [Click the email logo to return to previous screen]

* What do you think will happen after you submit your document using one of these options?<br>

> That's likely because it says... so it's going to be low. They said to do it in person, so I would just send a physical copy. It's less likely to resubmit online. 

> how long will VA take - hard to guess with the VA, 1 wek 2 weks. 
⠀
## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

* Overall, what did you think of what you saw today? Was it clear or confusing?<br>

> Like I said, it was very clear, very transparent, and intuitive. You upload your file. If it doesn't submit, there's something wrong with the system. It lets you know if something with the system didn't upload correctly, so you can write it out and send it to the VA another way. There's another instance where you submit a file and they give you two business days to know they've received it. There's another part where the VA shows they've received it, and another part where the VA has reviewed it. I mean, does 'received' mean the VA already reviewed it? Maybe 'received' means they don't need to review it.

* Was there anything helpful?<br>

> Status, recent activity (really helped me out). Step 3 out of 8. Then I can go see what happens in step 4. You know, that sort of thing.

* On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel about being able to resubmit your document if you received a notice like this in real life? (1 being least confident, 5 being most confident.)<br>

> I'll definitely say a 5. I'm very confident I submitted the document.

* On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel VA will effectively manage your paper documents you've submitted? (1 being least confident, 5 being most confident.)<br>

> Ugh, I'd say a 4.
  * Why?<br>
  > Like I said before, if I'm updating a document online and it says something is wrong with the document, now you're making it inconvenient for me. Now I have to reprint it out, get envelopes, etc. So that's why I say it's a 4, because if I was doing something online, I expect it to be 100% efficient.
* Any questions for me?<br>

> They have to work on the status labels, such as 'received' or 'reviewed.' Because if it doesn't say 'reviewed,' like with the DD214, it's unclear.
