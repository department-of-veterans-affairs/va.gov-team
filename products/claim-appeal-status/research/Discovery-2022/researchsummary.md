## Background
The Claims Status Tool is a highly-used VA.gov feature (27% of total pageviews) with some known issues that should be resolved to create a better user experience. Our goal is to extend the work of past CST efforts, and identify where meaningful work can be pushed forward.

## CST Research Plan
[Full Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/Discovery-2022/researchplan.md)

The goal of this research was to conduct a thorough analysis of existing relevant research from other teams, understand the history of CST, and talk in real time to subject matter experts across the benefits space in order to fully understand how their work might intersect with ours.

## Who we talked to 
- Michel McDonald (Benefits Eng)
- Melinda Bernardo Cuerda (Lighthouse UX)
- Shawna Hein (Cross-team UX lead)
- Emily Theis (OCTO Benefits PM)
- Shannon Ford (OCTO Benefits UX)

## Key Takeaways
- CST should be more understandable to the average person
  - High % of vets use VSOs to help them decipher what’s happening with a claim
  - Language is not always consistent
  
- CST should be more granular, with more detailed info about the claim
  - Vets feel like they’re “stuck” in various stages, and they don’t know what’s happening. 
  - Provide “signs of life” about the claim. Just giving an indication that it’s been looked at (e.g. time stamp) could help alleviate concerns that it’s been forgotten.
  - Alternately, we’ve heard of some “conspiracy theories” about how vets think it’s taking a long time because VA is trying to figure out how to “screw them out of” benefits
  
- The value of a human (VSO) is hard to match with digital-first self-service tools. Rather than try to replace, how can CST achieve its potential, and complement the overall experience of filing claims and appeals?

- There are a host of 3P applications and services that do not fall within the VA.gov umbrella that are nevertheless important to the benefits process (SEP, EVSS, VetConnect). 
  - How might we consolidate and streamline the full suite of tools used for accessing benefits?
  
- There are some known UI improvements that we could tackle straight away
  - Making it easier to track issues vs. claims
  - The ability to download notification letter
  - More granularity in CST UI to better communicate system status

## Next Steps
- Align on top actionable items
- Work with product to deliver feature briefs for new efforts based on the user needs identified in the research
