# Research Plan for BMT-1 | Evidence Requests | 7/17/2025

## Background
Previous research shows that Veterans currently struggle with understanding evidence requests related to their claims in the Claim Status Tool. Delays in responding to evidence requests result in delays to decisions on claims. The Benefits Management Tools team recently implemented a new design pattern and plain language overrides to some default content obtained from the Benefits Claims API.

This research will assess how Veterans perceive the structure, clarity, and usability of the evidence requests they receive on VA.gov.

## OCTO Priorities
This research initiative supports the following OCTO priorities:

- **Objective 1:** VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.  
- **Objective 2:** OCTO’s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.

## Veteran Journey
When Veterans need to check on the status of their VA claims, decision reviews, or appeals, they use the Claim Status Tool to stay updated on these important steps. This supports the following moments:

- Getting Out  
- Starting Up  
- Taking Care of Myself (e.g., managing ongoing disability claims and evidence submission)  
- Putting Down Roots

---

## Research Goals
The goal of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of changes to content and content structure in helping Veterans understand and navigate evidence requests in the Claims Status Tool.

### Goals
- Evaluate Veterans’ comprehension of evidence requests  
- Assess the effectiveness of the new content structure  
- Assess Veterans’ ability to navigate/locate features and content that support evidence requests  

---

## Outcome
This research will give us a better understanding of claimants’ experience of the VA.gov Claim Status Tool’s evidence requests usability, language clarity, and navigability. These insights will help ensure claimants can respond quickly to requests, reducing the time it takes to get a decision on their claims.

## Research Questions

### Goal 1: Evaluate Veterans’ comprehension of the evidence requests
- Do Veterans understand what VA is asking them to provide in specific evidence requests?  
- Can Veterans distinguish between evidence requests directed to them (first party) versus requests to third parties?  
- How effectively can Veterans understand what action they need to take?  

### Goal 2: Assess the effectiveness of the new content structure
- Do the headings and ever-present content help Veterans understand actions they can take, even when there’s default API content present?  
- Do participants find some response options more difficult or confusing than others (e.g., uploading documents, navigating to a VA form and choosing to download or submit it online, making a change in their My VA)?  

### Goal 3: Assess Veterans’ ability to navigate/locate features and content that support evidence requests
- How effectively can Veterans locate the associated claim letter when prompted?  
- What are some pain points Veterans experience navigating between CST and the claim letters section?

---

## Hypothesis
- Claimants find VA jargon confusing and are often unsure what they are being asked to provide. When we offer plain language explanations and descriptions of the actions they need to take, along with hyperlinks, claimants' confidence and trust are increased.  
- Claimants have concerns about whether VA is taking sufficient action on their claims. Understanding the requests that are being made of 3rd parties can reduce those concerns. However, when that information is unintelligible, it raises those concerns.

## Methodology
**Moderated semi-structured interviews.**  
Users are sent a Zoom link with instructions on how to join and share their screen. The user will log into `staging.VA.gov` and interact with the Claims Status Tool using a test user account containing the necessary claims and evidence requests.  
Testing will be conducted using evidence requests set up at https://staging.va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status/ for
vets.gov.user+64@gmail.com and vets.gov.user+150@gmail.com

Participants will complete a series of tasks related to evidence requests, and the interviewer will observe their natural flow and ask questions about their experience. Data will be aggregated and synthesized to analyze emergent themes and main findings.
