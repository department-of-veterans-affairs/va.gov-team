# Intro - 5 minutes

Hello [participant name]. Thank you for joining us today. My name is [MODERATOR NAME], and I also have 2 colleagues here to take notes and observe.
- If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
- If yes: Admit observers.
- Then, ask the notetaker and observer to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.



**Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:**

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we’re not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't take anything personally!
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You don’t have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way. If you decide you need to stop at any time, you’ll still be compensated for your time.
- I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way. I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website
- Today, we’ll be looking at a what we call our staging website–it’s all fake data, so it won’t affect your information or benefits in any way
- I’d like to ask your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today. We use the recordings to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately. After we complete our analysis, we delete the recordings, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings in groups (like 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to use a specific quote, we take away any identifying information. Knowing this, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
> - [If yes] OK–once I start recording, I’m have to ask you to confirm that you’re okay with me recording.

➡️ Start recording.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you okay with me recording my screen and the audio as we talk today?
[Record answer here]

> - [If no] OK–no problem.


# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

1. To start us off, can you tell me if you’ve used VA.gov before?
    1. What for? What’s something you’ve found useful on the site?

2. Can I ask – around when was the last time you submitted a claim to VA?
    1. Can you tell me a bit about your experience applying to VA for benefits?
    2. Did you get many requests for additional information?
3. [If they submitted a claim in last 2 years & have used VA.gov] Have you ever used VA.gov to check on the status of a claim?
    1. Anything you can tell us about what that was like?


# Getting signed in & navigating to Claim Status Tool
I’d like you to imagine that you’ve got a claim in to VA for disability compensation & you want to find out whether it’s making any progress so you’re going to take a look on VA.gov

I’m going to share a link with you, and a username and password to use to sign in to VA.gov. I’m going to ask you to share your screen. We’ll ask you to try to find some things and talk through what’s happening with your claim. I just want to remind you that this isn’t a test of you–we want to find where things are working well and where we need to make the site clearer.

> **Interviewer steps:**
> - Ask them to open a browser–whatever they use to go to the web, and go to staging.VA.gov (put it in the chat)
> - Walk them through sharing their screen
> - Share login information (user+64 or user+150)
> - Ask them to sign in. Help if needed.

**MyVA page**

> Now, could you take a look around and see if you can find information about your disability compensation claim? *(this is on MyVA; keep it brief)*
- (What do they notice about the claim card that appears, or the link to “Manage all claims and appeals” or do they try the main navigation” or do they scroll the page and not notice the Claims and Appeals section?)
- Prompt users to click on “Manage all claims and appeals.”

**Claim Status Tool landing page**

> Now, let’s take a look for the disability claim. What can you tell about the claim here? *(after they describe what they’re seeing:)*
- What do you think it means by “we sent you a development letter?”
- Okay. We’re going to focus today on the part about requesting more information from you. If you wanted to learn more about that, what would you do?
    - Prompt, if needed: Click on the “Details” link .

**Claim details page**

> I’d like you to spend some time looking over this whole page before clicking on anything. We saw that it said VA requested more information from you. Does this page tell you what information VA needs?
*(things to watch out for:)*
- Do they notice the heading “What you need to do?”
- Do they recognize that the 3 evidence requests are requests to them?
- Do they notice the 3rd party request “We made a request outside VA” – we’ll come back to it later, but can take notes / talk about it now if it comes up


## First Task: [Review Evidence Request: Provide Authorization to Disclose Information] - 10 minutes

> Take some time to read through this page, but don't click on anything yet.
- [ ] Please walk me through what you see and what you think you'd need to do on this page.
- [ ] What would you do if you wanted to find out more?
  - [ ] Prompt: go ahead and click on it
- [ ] How would you describe to a friend what 'authorization to disclose information' means?
  - [ ] Probe: What do you think the page means by 'non-VA source'?
- [ ] What would you be likely to do next here?
- [ ] Looking at “Next steps,” how would you describe the difference between "complete and sign this form online" and "using a pdf version and uploading it"?
- [ ] What questions do you have about this request?
  - [ ] Probe: Is there anything you wish this page had to make it easier to understand?
     
> OK– now let’s go back to the **main claim page** about the claim with the other information requests. Can you show me how you would get there?


## Second Task: [Review Evidence Request: Direct deposit information] - 10 minutes

> *Make sure the user is reoriented at the page we started them at: with Status of your compensation claim (link in breadcrumbs)*

> Next, please take a look at this request related to updating direct deposit information.

- [ ] What do you think this request is about?
- [ ] [If they haven’t already clicked] OK–let’s click on this one to find out more
- [ ] Take some time to read through this page, but don’t click on anything yet
- [ ] Please walk me through what you see and what you think you'd need to do.
- [ ] Is there more information you’d want about this before giving your direct deposit info?
  - [ ] How would you find out more if you had concerns or questions?
- [ ] Let’s go ahead and try adding or changing direct deposit information – we won’t add your actual banking information, we’ll just check it out.
  - [ ] Prompt: If we weren’t here and you wanted to give your direct deposit information, what would you do from this page?
  - [ ] Prompt: (If they’re not sure:) Under Next steps, let’s go ahead and click on “Add or change direct deposit information”
- [ ] [On direct deposit information page in Profile] OK–If you wanted to give your direct deposit information here, how would you do that?
> **(Happy path: Click edit button)**
  - [ ] Prompt: Go ahead and click edit button – we’ll just take a look but not enter any banking information
  - [ ] So if you entered your bank account information here, would you expect that you’d have completed the request VA made about direct deposit information?
    - [ ] (If they say yes): Yeah, seems like it.
    - [ ] (If they say no or not sure):
    - [ ] (Either way): Let’s go back and take a look at that request again
> **Looking for: How hard is it to get back to the claim?**
- [ ] [Back on Direct Deposit request details page] Looking at this again, how confident do you feel, on a scale of 1 to 5 that adding your bank account info on the page we were just on would satisfy the request?
  - [ ] (If not a 5): Anything you can tell us about what would make you feel more confident?

> OK– now let’s go back to the **main page** about the claim with the other information requests.


## Third Task: [Review Evidence Request: Asbestos exposure medical documentation] - 10 minutes

> Now, let’s take a look at the one called “Request for evidence”
- [ ] What do you think this request is about?
  - [ ] Probe: This one is very non-specific – does that cause any concern or confusion?
  - [ ] Prompt: Go ahead and click on it to find out what this is about
- [ ] What’s VA asking you to do here?
- [ ] How would you provide this information?
- [ ] If you wanted to know more about the request, what would you do?
  - [ ] **Prompt: Let’s go ahead and look at the claim letter**
> The link will take them to Claim Letters page
- [ ] Which letter do you think is the letter about this request?
> (The letter names aren’t specific–the date is the best information they have to go on)
- [ ] Since you can’t tell by the name, what would you do?
> (Encourage them to go ahead and click on one – the top letter is the relevant one – and others are weird uploads we can’t get rid of – if they open one, you can tell them it’s just from some testing someone did)
- [ ] Prompt: Read through the letter for information related to the asbestos request – does it tell you more about how to provide the information? What does it say to do?
- [ ] Prompt: OK–how would you go back to the web page about the asbestos information request?
- [ ] Looking back at this page, do you have an idea of what you’d do here to provide the information?

> OK– now let’s go back to the **main page** again with the other information requests. 

## Fourth Task: [Review Evidence Request: Third Party, SSA for MED EVID] - 10 minutes

> Alright, we have one more task to go through. Let’s scroll down and look at the Recent Activity. Let’s look at the request from August 6th.

- [ ] How might you explain to a friend what VA is telling you here?
- [ ] What do you think it means when it says, “outside of the VA?”
  - [ ] **Prompt:** Go ahead and click on it so we can find out more about this one
- [ ] Do you think there’s anything you need to do on this page? Any actions to complete?
  - [ ] Probe: What might make that clearer?
- [ ] Is there more you’d want to know about this?
  - [ ] Probe: Does this request affect your trust in the VA? Why?
- [ ] Do you feel like the VA is giving you enough information here to understand why they need this from you?
  - [ ] If you wanted to know more, what would you do?
> (We can point them to the “Need help” text at the bottom of the page)

>  OK! That’s all we wanted to look at on the site–I just have a few final questions for you.

# Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

1. On a scale of 1-5, where 1 is not at all confident and 5 is very confident, how confident are you that you would know how to respond to evidence requests you get on VA.gov?
2. Which request felt the easiest to understand? The hardest?
3. Was there any part of the site that stands out to you now as needing improvement?
4. Anything you noticed or would like to add that I didn’t ask you about already?


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Thank you so much for your time and feedback—it’s been really valuable.

Perigean will be sending you a thank-you message and info on how other Veterans can participate in the future.

We appreciate your service and your help today!
