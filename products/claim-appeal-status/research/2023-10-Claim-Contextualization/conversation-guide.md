## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Skyler, and I'm going to be guiding you through the session today. Today we're going to talk about disability compensation claims and the Claim Status Tool.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- (If applicable) **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you used VA.gov before?
- If yes, could you briefly describe the last time you used it? Do you tend to go there for a specific use?
- How else do you generally interact with the VA, if at all?
- Have you ever filed an application for disability compensation (Form 526-EZ) with the VA?
- If yes, how many times? Have you ever done it on VA.gov?
- [Time permitting] What military information do you recall being asked for have to provide when you submitted your claim?
- [Time permitting] How did you get that information (memory, had to look it up, etc)?

## First Task: CST Home Page - 5 minutes

So let's say you are signed into your VA.gov account and you're looking at this page. You submitted a claim a couple weeks ago, and you're logging in to check and see if there's been an update.

- Do you know what this page is? If yes, what is it?
- Describe to me what you're seeing here.
- Let's say you're waiting for this top claim to be decided. What would you say is the status of the claim, based on what you see here? And what does that status mean to you?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant recognize the Claim Status Tool?
- Do they recognize which claim is in progress?
- How accurate is their understanding of the status based only on what they see here?

## Second Task: Status Tab - 5 minutes

[Participant clicks into the in-progress claim]

- Based on what you see here, what would you say is the status of this claim?
- Do you feel satisfied with this amount of knowledge about the claim status? Why or why not?
- If you wanted to understand more about what is going on with your claim, where would you go from here?

### Things to watch for:

- How much additional information about what's going on "behind the scenes" does the Status tab provide?
- Do Veterans seem to want more understanding of what's happening than what is provided on the Status tab?
- Do Veterans know to navigate to the Overview tab to find out more details about what's going on with their claim?

## Third Task: Overview Tab - 15 minutes

[Participant clicks into the Overview tab]

- Now tell me what you see here.
- Based on what you see here, how would you describe the state of this claim? [Claim will be in Step 3: Evidence Gathering]
- Is there anything that is particularly useful about what you see here?
- Is there anything that is particularly confusing about what you see here?
- [Focus on the graphic] What do you think this is trying to communicate?
- [Focus on the "May repeat" message] What do you think this is trying to communicate?

[Have the Participant click into each of the six steps. Ask this question for each step.]

- Describe in your own words what is happening at this step of the process.

[Overall questions]
- Is there any information you're not seeing here that you'd like to see?
- On a scale of 1-5, how helpful would you say this page is? (1 being least helpful, 5 being most helpful.)
- On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate the level of detail provided by this page?
- What would you expect to happen next with the claim?

### Things to watch for:

- Is it clear to the Veteran what step their claim is in?
- What content is most useful to the Veteran? Least helpful or confusing?
- Do Veterans understand the graphic? Does it seem to be helpful?
- Do Veterans understand that claims may go back and forth between steps? How do they feel about that?

## Fourth Task: Checking Back on the Claim a Few Days Later - 10 minutes

Now let's imagine you log out, a couple of weeks go by, and you log back in. You want to check to see if there are any updates to the claim.

[Tap VA.gov header to jump to next scenario]

- Where would you go to check for updates to the claim?
  
[Status Tab]
- Based on what you see here, how would you describe the state of this claim? [Claim will be in Step 4: Rating]
- Is there any information you're not seeing here that you'd like to see?
- Is there anywhere else you would go to find more information about the claim?

[Overview Tab]
- Based on what you see here, how would you describe the state of this claim?
- Why do you think the claim is on the step it's currently on?
- Is there any information you're not seeing here that you'd like to see?
- What would you expect to happen next with the claim?

### Things to watch for:

- Is it clear to the Veteran how to check on the status of the claim from the CST home page?
- Does the Veteran feel the need to check the Overview tab to check on the claim, or do they feel like the Status tab is enough?
- In the Overview tab, does the Veteran seem to understand why the claim has gone "back" a step?
- Does the Veteran have a good understanding of what might happen to the claim next?

## Fifth Task: Checking Back on the Claim a Few Days Later - 10 minutes

Now let's imagine you log out, a couple of days go by, and you log back in. You want to check to see if there are any updates to the claim.

[Tap VA.gov header to jump to next scenario]

- Where would you go to check for updates to the claim?
  
[Status tab]
- Based on what you see here, how would you describe the state of this claim? [Claim will be back in Step 3: Evidence Gathering]
- What's your initial reaction to that?

[Overview Tab]
- Based on what you see here, how would you describe the state of this claim?
- Why do you think the claim is on the step it's currently on?
- Is there any information you're not seeing here that you'd like to see?
- What would you expect to happen next with the claim?

### Things to watch for:

- In the Overview tab, does the Veteran seem to understand why the claim has gone "back" a step?
- How does the Veteran feel about the claim being back in Step 3? Frustrated? Confused? Neutral?
- Does the Veteran have a good understanding of what might happen to the claim next?


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Overall, what did you think of what you saw today? Was it clear or confusing?
- If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about checking your claim status on VA.gov, what would it be?
- Any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
