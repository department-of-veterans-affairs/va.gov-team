## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Skyler/Gary], and I'm going to be guiding you through the session today. I'm on a team that works with the VA on the VA.gov website. Today we're going to talk about disability compensation claims and the Claim Status Tool.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you used VA.gov before?
- If yes, could you briefly describe the last time you used it? Do you tend to go there for a specific use?
- Do you generally interact with the VA in any other ways (on the phone, in person at an office)?
- Have you ever filed an application for disability compensation (Form 526-EZ) with the VA?
- If yes, how many times? Have you ever done it on VA.gov?
- [Time permitting] What information about your service history do you recall being asked for when you submitted your claim? (If they asked for clarification, I would say "I mean things like, where you were, or dates, your units or assignments. Things like that")
- [Time permitting] How did you get that information (memory, had to look it up, etc)?

[Ask participant to share their screen]

[Share [prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/bWELjWsVqkf3BDx0PXqqam/CST-Claims-Process-exploration?type=design&node-id=362-14421&t=NxYNpqn2qvaLzIp2-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=362%3A14273&starting-point-node-id=362%3A14421) with participant]

## First Task: CST Home Page - 5 minutes

So let's say you are signed into your VA.gov account and you're looking at this page. You submitted a claim a couple weeks ago, and you're logging in to check and see if there's been an update.

- Do you know what this page is? If yes, what is it?
- Describe to me what you're seeing here.
- Let's say you're waiting for this top claim to be decided. What would you say is the status of the claim, based on what you see here? (Point them towards "Step 3 of 8: Evidence gathering" if they don't reference it themselves.) And what does that status mean to you? 

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant recognize the Claim Status Tool?
- Do they recognize which claim is in progress?
- How accurate is their understanding of the status based only on what they see here?

## Second Task: Status Tab - 5 minutes

[Have the participant click "View details" on the in-progress claim]

- Tell me what you see here. (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)
- Do you feel like this tells you everything you need to know about the claim? Why or why not?
- If you wanted to understand more about what is going on with your claim, where would you go from here?

### Things to watch for:

- How do Veterans react to the Status tab in general?
- Do Veterans seem to want or need more details about what's happening with the claim than what is provided on the Status tab?
- Do Veterans know to navigate to the Overview tab to find out more details about what's going on with their claim?

## Third Task: Overview Tab - 15 minutes

[Participant clicks into the Overview tab]

- Now tell me what you see here. (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)
- Is there anything that is particularly useful about what you see here?
- Is there anything that is particularly confusing about what you see here?
- [Focus on the graphic] What do you think this is trying to communicate?
- [Focus on the "May repeat" message] What do you think this is trying to communicate?

[Have the Participant click into each of the eight steps. Ask this question for each step.]

- Describe in your own words what you think happens at this step.

[Overall questions]
- Is there any information you're not seeing here that you'd like to see?
- On a scale of 1-5, how helpful would you say this page is? (1 being least helpful, 5 being most helpful.)
- On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate the level of detail provided by this page?
- What would you expect to happen next with the claim?

[Have participant click into header to view the control]
- On a scale of 1-5, how helpful would you say this page is? (1 being least helpful, 5 being most helpful.)
- On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate the level of detail provided by this page?
- Between the two versions, which of these do you prefer? Why? (They can toggle between them by clicking on the header)

### Things to watch for:

- Is it clear to the Veteran what step their claim is in?
- What content is most useful to the Veteran? Least helpful or confusing?
- Do Veterans understand the graphic? Does it seem to be helpful?
- Do Veterans understand that claims may go back and forth between steps? How do they feel about that?
- How does the the new design to the control for Veterans?

## Fourth Task: Checking Back on the Claim at Step 6 - 10 minutes

Now let's imagine you log out, a couple of weeks go by, and you log back in. You want to check to see if there are any updates to the claim.

[Tap on anywhere on the control screen to advance to next task]

- Tell me what you see here.
  
[Status Tab]
- Is there any information you're not seeing here that you'd like to see?
- Is there anywhere else you would go to find more information about the claim?

[Overview Tab]
- Is there any information you're not seeing here that you'd like to see?
- What would you expect to happen next with the claim?

### Things to watch for:

- Is it clear to the Veteran how to check on the status of the claim from the CST home page?
- Does the Veteran feel the need to check the Overview tab to check on the claim, or do they feel like the Status tab is enough?
- Does the Veteran have a good understanding of what might happen to the claim next?

## Fifth Task: Checking Back on the Claim at Step 3 Again - 10 minutes

Now let's imagine you log out, a couple of days go by, and you log back in. You want to check to see if there are any updates to the claim.

[Tap VA.gov header to jump to next scenario]

- Now you can see here the claim is in Step 3. What's your reaction to that?
  
[Status tab]
- If you wanted to find out more about why your claim is in this step, where would you go?

[Overview Tab]
- Based on what you see here, why do you think the claim is in Step 3?
- Is there any information you're not seeing here that you'd like to see?
- What would you expect to happen next with the claim?

### Things to watch for:

- In the Overview tab, does the Veteran seem to understand why the claim has gone "back" a step?
- How does the Veteran feel about the claim being back in Step 3? Frustrated? Confused? Neutral?
- Does the Veteran have a good understanding of what might happen to the claim next?


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Overall, what did you think of what you saw today? Was it clear or confusing?
- If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about the experience of checking your claim status on VA.gov, what would it be?
- Any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
