# 2024 CST Refinement workshop for Claim Contextualization

## Background

On March 14, 2024, we met with disability claims process expert Andrew Gray to ensure accurate description of the steps in the disability claims process. As part of this dicsussion, we focused on the following objectives:

- Evaluate estimated timelines for each process step. 
- Discuss feasibility for getting time frame per step.
- Review steps descriptions for accuracy. 

**Note:** A link to the session recording, as well as pertinent artifacts leading up to this discussion, can be found in the resources section of this document.

## Open questions

### When a VSR marks a tracked item as “Reviewed” are they doing any qualitative assessment?

Yes, In most cases, when we receive medical information from BHA, veterans, private doctors, or DBQs, the primary responsibility is to review this evidence against the claim contentions. They assess whether there's a connection between the claimed condition and military service. If there is, they request examinations or medical opinions from private physicians. Upon receiving this information, they review the DBQ to ensure all necessary sections are completed. They review the information to decide the next steps. They conduct a qualitative assessment to figure out what to do next in that particular case.

### Do they mark individual document (tracked items) review or the claimed?

Yes, tracked items in the claim indicate what we're waiting for. VSRs use them to identify why a claim isn't progressing and where the delays are. For instance, if we request service treatment records, we'll add a tracked item to indicate that we're waiting for that information. This ensures that the claim won't be sent back out for processing until we receive the necessary data. The same applies to exam requests or similar actions.

### Are they checking to make sure the doc is the right one, or are they simply marking that something got received? 

They should be making sure that each tracked item corresponds to a specific document requested by the VSR. For example, a tracked item could be for service treatment records or a 4142 form if the veteran mentioned a private provider. Each request made to the veteran is captured separately, even if multiple requests are pending at once. So, if the veteran is asked for three different things and only provides one, it will close out one tracked item, not all three.

### If the Veteran only send back one document, do the others go into a suspension period? Does the VA notify the veteran that they're still waiting on the other two?

Once we send a letter to the veteran requesting specific information, we typically give them 30 days to respond. If they provide the information within that time, we accept it and use it for the claim. If they don't provide it, we close the tracked item and continue processing the claim. Occasionally, if they return a form incomplete or with missing information, we'll send it back to them for completion. But generally, it's a 30-day window for them to provide the required information.

### Do we currently measure the duration for each step? If so, does these time frames include claims that repeated steps (is it included in the average time)

As an agency, we track various data metrics in the claims process. However, we don't routinely collect data in the format proposed by va.gov, which breaks it down into eight steps. While this breakdown makes sense for veterans and captures our actions well, there isn't currently a wealth of existing data in this format. We would need to specifically gather this information. It seems like you're looking for a centralized source for estimated completion times, but such a resource doesn't currently exist.

### What I'm understanding is, it would require gathering information from various teams to estimate how long each step might take. Is that an accurate understanding?

Yes, we could gather data from various sources to determine the average time for each step in the process. However, this might not be the most effective approach. We could also consider specific attributes of the claim, for example an [EP 010](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000011474/Appendix-B-End-Product-EP-Codes#010) versus [EP 020](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000011474/Appendix-B-End-Product-EP-Codes#020), which can affect the time needed due to the amount of evidence required. For instance, a claim with more contentions generally takes longer. 

So there might be ways that we could break out information like that to try to get to how long the process would typically take given certain attributes within the claim. This approach would require a more in-depth discussion, but there isn't a single source to go that will give us average wait time per step.

> Current on the static pages for filing a disability claims, they post average number of days for a disability claim for the previous month. It gets updated regularlly. It would be really useful if we could tell them like based on the type of claim they submitted, which you know, like what a more accurate estimate would be. - Lauren

### For clairification purposes what is EP O10?

EP stands for end products, and it's how VBA manages its workload. When a veteran files their initial claim with the VA, it's categorized as EP 110 or EP 010. If they file for an increase or new contentions, it falls under EP 020. Asking for a decision or review is categorized as EP 030 or EP 040. This system helps us organize our work internally based on the type of claim submitted.

### Who should we talk to learn more about how time estimates are created?
generally speaking, likely not. VBA structured to be driven by policy and procedure not so much time estimate from business perspective. office cares about how long claims take, maybe data request would be more helpful to use as opposed to individuals. OBA team and Andrew can talk about thinks at a high level (which steps takes longer and why) but time specific is driven by data. 

### What are common reasons that a claim could go “back” to a previous step?

As a whole, missing dates aren't typically the main reason for delays in the process. Adding new evidence by veterans is a common cause for delays. Instead of saying "missing exam information," it's more accurate to say "Relevant medical evidence." This could include treatment records identified by the veteran that we need to obtain to make a decision on the claim, exams that weren't ordered by the VSR when it was necessary to, or doctor sending out a DBQ but missed a pertinent section that we need to have filled out before we can render that decision. There are various ways medical information is crucial and can cause delays, but I wouldn't want to call those each way specifically.


## Takeaways about claims process

**1. Avoid using job titles when decribing the claims process**

Using the specifi job titles maybe overwhelming for Veterans. So we should keep it general. If the studies show (referring to the claims contextualization user research) participants did appreciate seeing that there was a change of hands between staff and not sitting on one person's desk, We can use generaic terms like service representative or reviewer.


**2. Points in times where claim changes hand within the claim process**

- step 2 (claims assistant), 
- step 3 and 4 (VSRs another person, pre-develoment VSRs trained to do evidence gathering), 
- step 5 (rvsr) another staff, 
- step 6 (4th person, Senior VSR, post-development VSRs trained to generate letters, caluclate payments and pay the benefits assocaiated with the rating)

In Step 6, the VSR who generates the award and the letter calculates the payment amount for the veteran. If the claim is approved, they (the VSR) state the effective date and when the veteran can expect payment. Essentially, all the details of your award letter, whether it is approval or denial.

"In Step 7, the claim moves to the senior VSR, also known as the **authorizer** internally, who reads the draft decision letter and ensures accuracy regarding the payout, money, and effective date. They give the final approval to release the funds and send out the letter. We can think of this as the 'final review'."

> I would use generic titles not specific to like VSR. I think that will be more understandable to the veteran community.

**3. The claims process can go backwards if veterans add evidencence anytime after step 2**

Initally, we understodd that claims process may repeat between steps 3 through 6. However, we learned that if a Veteran submits evidence as late as step 7, their claim could move backwards. This will result in a veterans claim splitting.

**4. The claims process can split where a part of a veteran's claim can receive a decision and move towards completion, while another part of the claim may be sent back.**

An example of the way this can happen is if veterans add evidence anytime after step 2, particualiarly  after a decision has been made in step 5.

Typically, if the RVSR approves anything in Step 5, when it reaches Step 7, even if there's a grant, we'll still send an award letter to the veteran. But we will continue that [end product](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000011474/Appendix-B-End-Product-EP-Codes)
 we discussed earlier and route it back to Step 3. This means the veteran will still be notified of the decision made in Step 5, but the claim will stay active, and we'll use that new information to return to Step 3.

Veterans can receive payments based on the initial decision while the other part of their claim is still under review. 

**4. A claim can be in steps 3 and 8 simultaneously.** 

Imagine a scenario where a veteran submits 10 contentions for consideration. If the RVSR decides on 8 of 10, the process moves to steps six to step seven for award generation and payment. However, it then returns to step 3 for the VSR to gather necessary evidence to decide on the remaining two contentions. This situation occurs frequently.

Veterans will receive payment based on the decison of the 8 contentions. We'll tell them in the letter that we've made a decision on contentions 1,2,3...8 etc and that we have deferred the contentions 9,10 and so we'll detail it in the letter.

Within our internal VBA processing, we don't assign it a new claim label or anything. Instead, we simply send the original workflow back to the VSR in Step 3.

**5. After a split has occurred, Veterans are notified**

In the earlier example, we had 10 contentions to address. We made decisions on 8 of them and deferred 2 for later consideration. The initial letter sent to the veteran would explain the outcomes of the 8 decisions made and inform them that 2 decisions were deferred.

When the RVSR eventually decides on the remaining 2 contentions, the subsequent letter will only address those unresolved issues and won't revisit the previous 8 decisions. This letter will provide details on the overall monthly payment, including historical information. For instance, using hypothetical numbers, the letter might state: "On October 1st, 2023, you were granted a 50% disability rating with a monthly payment of $1000. As of the (new date of the letter), you are now 60% disabled, and we've calculated your new payment accordingly."

**6. When describing claim steps, refer to evidence using the same pattern as most of VA.gov.**

In many places on the government website, we use the term "evidence" and may clarify it with "supporting documents" in parentheses.

**7. Adding estimated timeline per steps is not feasible today**
> From my discussions with Julie, this is definitely something we want to pursue. However, I believe it will come later in the process when we have more time to fully develop it.
