## Research Goals
With this research we hope to learn how well our designs solve the comprehension problems that exist for Veterans around the claim process. We hope to learn how useful this type of informational content would be for Veterans who are filing disability compensation claims on VA.gov. Which aspects specifically do Veterans find useful (or not)?

## Research Questions

- How do Veterans react to this content? Do they find it useful?
- Does this new design set the right expectation for how the claim will move between claim steps? Do Veterans understand why and how the claim might move back and forth between certain claim steps?
- After seeing this design, do Veterans feel like they understand what is happening at each step of the process? How do they feel after seeing this information?

## Methodology 

We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. Veterans will find value in the information provided in the new Overview tab and will prefer it to the more basic "process list" design.

   - **DEFINITELY TRUE**: 10 of 14 veterans prefered the new Overveiw tab design on the process list design

2. Veterans will have a good understanding of generally what happens at each step of the process (they don't need to understand every little detail).

   - **MAYBE TRUE**: Many veterans had a general idea of each step, but some were unsure about key details.

3. Veterans will understand that it is normal for claims to go back and forth between steps.

   - **DEFINITELY TRUE**: most veterans understood that it is normal for claims to go back and forth between steps.

4. Veterans will find that the new timeline provides a detailed picture of what is happening with a claim.

   - **LIKELY TRUE**: Most veterans found value with having a timeline; some mentioned it reduced their level of anxiety.

## Key Findings

1. Most participants said they prefer the new overview page design over the current design.

2. Most people understood that our graphics represented the process steps and that some steps may repeat.

3. Participants liked the estimated time feature, but there's confusion about timelines when claims repeat steps.

4. When claims repeat steps, they wanted to know why and who's responsible for resolving the issue.

5. Participants had different preferences regarding the level of detail in the overview page, with some favoring more information and others preferring less.


## Details of Findings 

**1. Most participants said they prefer the new overview page design over the current design.**

Labels: BNFT: Disability, Claims Status, PRDT: Claim-status-tool

During the study, we discovered that **10 of 14** participants favored the new design. Many of them cited the content's level of detail as their reason. 

**Note**: Participant 1 was not counted for this question because they were having internet issues, we weren’t able to get their feedback on that question.

On a scale of 1 to 5 (one being the lowest), Veterans rated the helpfulness and level of detail of the new design as **4.5 and 4.8** respectively. Compared to the current design (control) which average scores 3.8 and 3.7. 

> _More detail...and it had that really great diagram. - P6_

> _I prefer to know that it can move back…in this version (current design) it can stay in Step 3 for months and make a person feel frustrated...in the other one someone has their eyes on it. - P9_


**2. Most people understood that our graphics represented the process steps and that some steps may repeat.**

Labels: BNFT: Disability, Claims Status, PRDT: Claim-status-tool 

The steps diagram and repeat symbols in the accordion clarified that some steps might repeat during the claims process. While reviewing claim details, some people used the graphic to anticipate when these steps could repeat.

> _[Diagram] 8 step process and it shows 3-6 potential revolving - P18_

> _[Graphic]: Represents the number of steps and shows the step that repeats - P8_

However, it's important to emphasize that the process steps will not skip ahead. If a claim step repeats, the number of steps will also remain constant.

> _I'm guessing maybe if you are step 3 you can skip to step 6 but if they don't have everything to make a decision they can go back to step 3 - P13_

> _out of 8 steps, it might have to turn into 11 steps if they repeat… - P10_


**3. Participants liked the estimated time feature, but there's confusion about timelines when claims repeat steps.**

Labels: BNFT: Disability, Claims Status, PRDT: Claim-status-tool

Participants found solace seeing the estimated timeline for each step in combination with the date when the step began. It helped set expectations on how long an individual step will take. A few Veterans hinted that this feature reduces their need to call VA to inquire about their claim being “stuck”.

> _… time frame, that's super important - P12_

> _...  It was very upfront like, Hey, this! This should only take one to 2 days. And then it was more detailed. Right? - P11_


Nevertheless, we must work with the VBA partners to ensure the accuracy of estimated times and provide clarity on how repeating steps might impact the timeframe.

> _… does the time estimate start over or does it continue with the time left. - P2_

**Note**: Our initial time estimates derived from various sources: VBMS Claim Flow (internal), SME workshops (internal), Veteran Disability attorneys and disability claims professionals with former VSRs on staff.

**4. When claims repeat steps, they wanted to know why and who's responsible for resolving the issue.**

Labels: BNFT: Disability, Claims Status, PRDT: Claim-status-tool

In our study, we found that most Veterans found the general overview content helpful. However, when their claims went backward, they wanted to know why specifically. Some were frustrated because they didn't know the exact reasons, especially when the site said, "Nothing is needed from you."

Some Veterans wanted to see a checklist of evidence needed by the VA to assess their claim. They asked two key questions:

1. What evidence is missing, and what can they do to expedite the process?
2. If the issue lies with VA staff, they wanted to know what happened. 

**5. Participants had different preferences regarding the level of detail in the overview page, with some favoring more information and others preferring less.**

Labels: BNFT: Disability, Claims Status, PRDT: Claim-status-tool


**Prefers more detail**

11 out of 14 participants appreciated having extra detail; we also noticed these people had more claims filed.

> _... if I logged on and saw this today and I saw all this info, It would take away all the anxiety I have. - P1_

> _I would give it a 5; compared to eBenefits, this is way more detailed. I would highly rate it. Any questions I’d want someone to answer, it’s already here. Everything has been explained, the verbiage is very direct. Compared to what we had before in eBenefits. - P14_

**Prefers Less detail**

Participants who liked less detail had different reasons why. We the high level snapshot on the status page meets their need.

> _I like this is better (referring to control design), it’s simple...cuts all the jargon down. - P17_

> _“found herself jumping around alot to find information.” <br> <br> “Content on mobile device should be concise, but on desktop, it's OK to have more because of screen real estate” - P13_

***Progressive disclosure Status and Overview tabs***

We think Key Finding #5 validates our overall design approach, which uses the principle of “progressive disclosure” and a tab navigation to provide both a high level snapshot of the claim (Status) and the option to dig deeper (Overview).

Having these multiple zoom levels we believe will accommodate the needs of Veterans who prefer simplicity as well as those who prefer more detail.

## Secondary Finding
1. Veterans desired an interactive steps diagram or one that highlights the current step in their claim.
2. Most people found that the status page provided sufficient information about their claim. We believe this meets the need for people who prefer fewer details.
3. A few participants were uncertain when they can add evidence.

## Recommendations

* Continue the workstream of breaking out the steps and improve the beloved features of the new design while simplifying the content.
    * _Majority of participants preferred the new design._
* Ensure the accuracy of the timelines by using the data available and collaborating with VBA stakeholders to set realistic expectations for the process.
    * _Many participants found the timeline helpful and believe it could reduce stress because it provides answers to questions they had regarding turnaround times._
* Provide Veterans more specific messages about their claim, particularly if it moves backward.
    * _Though participants found the overview content useful, they became uncertain about the status of their claim when a step repeated. Particpants wanted to know the exact reason why their claim repeated a step._
* Collaborate with content strategists and SMEs (subject matter experts) to clarify confusing areas of the content.
    * _We the claim repeated a step, we noticed different levels of confusion regarding certain content elements: timeframe, claim steps, and adding evidence. We aim to collaborate with content strategist and SMEs to ensure clear communication._
