# WIP - Research Plan: Claim Contextualization Concept Testing

Benefits Management Tools · October 2023

## Background
In [previous research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2023-05-Evidence-Submission/research-findings.md#secondary-findings), we have found that Veterans find limited value in the claim process overview in its current form. 

We have also seen in the same research a dissatisfaction with the current representation of the various "stages" in the claim process. In particular, we've gotten feedback that "Evidence Gathering, Review, and Decision" is not a very helpful description of what's happening with the claim, because it covers such a broad range of steps and activity related to the claim. 

With the [Improved Claim Process Understanding Initiative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/CST%20Product/Improved%20Claims%20Process%20Understanding%20Initiative.md), we set out to "improve veterans' understanding of the claims process in the CST, helping them distinguish their responsibilities from those of the VA, and guide them effectively in evidence submission." In this study, we will test designs created to help meet those goals. 

### OCTO Priorities 

This work supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md):
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
This work supports a Veteran whenever they are filing a disability compensation claim, which could occur across a wide swath of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf), ranging all the way from "Getting out" to "Aging."

## Research Goals

- Assess how well Veterans understand what is happening at each step of the claim adjudication process.
- Assess whether Veterans understand the steps that are available to them to increase the likelihood of a favorable claim outcome. 

### Outcome
With this research we hope to learn how well our designs solve the comprehension problems that exist for Veterans around the claim process. We hope to learn how useful this type of informational content would be for Veterans who are filing disability compensation claims on VA.gov. Which aspects specifically do Veterans find useful?

### Research questions

- How do Veterans react to this content? Do they find it useful?
- Does this new design set better expectations for how the claim will move between stages? Do Veterans understand why and how the claim might move back and forth between certain stages?
- After seeing this design, do Veterans understand actions available to them at each step in the process that might help strengthen their claim?

### Hypotheses
- The new design will set better expectations about the claim process, demonstrating to Veterans that it is not always linear. 
- Veterans will feel more informed overall about how the claims process works, and what's going on behind the scenes.
- Veterans will feel more informed by this information, and will better understand what they might do in order to improve the likelihood of a favorable outcome for their claim.
