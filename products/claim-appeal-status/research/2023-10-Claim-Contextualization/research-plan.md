# Research Plan: Claim Contextualization

Benefits Management Tools · October 2023

## Background
In [previous research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2023-05-Evidence-Submission/research-findings.md#secondary-findings), we have found that Veterans find limited value in the claim process overview in its current form. 

We have also seen in the same research a dissatisfaction with the current representation of the various "stages" in the claim process. In particular, we've gotten feedback that "Evidence Gathering, Review, and Decision" is not a very helpful description of what's happening with the claim, because it covers such a broad range of steps and activity related to the claim. 

The [Improved Claim Process Understanding Initiative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/CST%20Product/Improved%20Claims%20Process%20Understanding%20Initiative.md) highlights a number of Veteran pain points with the current CST experience. With this design and research effort, we aim to address the following: 
> As a veteran with an open disability claim, my preconceived expectations about the claims process frequently clash with the reality, causing me to become frustrated when the claim stagnates at a particular phase, or unexpectedly reverts to a previous phase.

> As a veteran tracking my open disability claim through the CST, I am mislead by the depicted claims process timeline, which incorrectly suggests a linear process and fails to illustrate the common occurrence of claims cycling between phases. This inaccuracy creates false expectations and compounds the difficulty of waiting for results 

### OCTO Priorities 

This work supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md):
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
This work supports a Veteran whenever they are filing a disability compensation claim, which could occur across a wide swath of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf), ranging all the way from "Getting out" to "Aging."

## Research Goals

- Assess how well Veterans understand what is happening at each step of the claim adjudication process.
- Assess whether the new timeline design creates a more accurate mental model for Veterans about how a claim moves through the claim adjudication process.

### Outcome
With this research we hope to learn how well our designs solve the comprehension problems that exist for Veterans around the claim process. We hope to learn how useful this type of informational content would be for Veterans who are filing disability compensation claims on VA.gov. Which aspects specifically do Veterans find useful?

### Research questions

- How do Veterans react to this content? Do they find it useful?
- Does this new design set better expectations for how the claim will move between stages? Do Veterans understand why and how the claim might move back and forth between certain stages?
- After seeing this design, do Veterans feel like they understand what is happening at each step of the process? How do feel after seeing this information?

### Hypotheses
- Veterans will find value in the information provided in the Overview tab.
- Veterans will have a clear understanding of what is happening at each step of the process.
- Veterans will understand that it is normal for claims to go back and forth between steps.
