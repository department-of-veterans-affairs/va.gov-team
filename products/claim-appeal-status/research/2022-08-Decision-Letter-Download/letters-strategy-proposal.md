## Background
During our [research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-08-Decision-Letter-Download/research-findings.md) for the Decision Letter Download feature, Benefits Team 1 tested compared our new Claim Letters feature against the existing Letters page for downloading benefit letters. 

We were initially considering adding the new [Claim Letters page](https://www.sketch.com/s/8b025901-295d-4929-95cc-8dbeb28454b3/p/CAA1846C-79ED-4BDB-94B9-BA0EBE74EC5B/canvas) to the existing [Letters page](https://www.va.gov/records/download-va-letters/). During our testing, we discovered some potential areas of confusion that we think require further research before determining how these various "letters" integrate in the VA.gov UI. As a result of this, we decided to intially launch the Claim Letters page within the Claim Status Tool. We recommend a sitewide audit and strategy for letters, that accounts for everything that might be reasonably deemed a "letter." As new types of letters come online, it will be critical for the site to have a holistic strategy for this type of content that is easily understood and accessible to Veterans. 

## Research findings
From our initial research, we found that the term "letters" in the UI did cause some confusion for Veterans. Specifically, when we included both the Benefit Letters and Claim Letters entrypoints on the same page, 4/10 participants were confused about how to get to their decision letters, and ended up clicking on the wrong button to do so. We think this demonstrates some confusion about the use of the term "letter."

We also found, however, that Veterans understood the different use cases for downloading benefit letters vs. downloading claim letters. We asked Veterans to describe the difference in their own words. Below are a few examples of what they said: 

> “(Claim letters) is for getting access to an archived copy of a claim letter that I’ve actually received in the mail.” - P8

> “With (benefit letters) you have proof that you’re a Veteran and what benefits you have access to.” - P17

> “(Claim letters) was a letter from the VA to me, whereas (benefit letters) is a letter the website is generating that supports me.” - P19

We think these quotes are a starting point in understanding how Veterans understand these various letter types.

## Recommendation
As a next step, we recommend the following: 
1. Conduct an audit of all types of "letters" that Veterans currently receive from the VA. Determine which of these are accessible on VA.gov, or which of these are not but should be accessible on VA.gov. 
2. Develop a strategy for these various letter types. Should they all be accessible from one sitewide "inbox"? Should they sit site-by-side with the Benefit letters page, or as a separate entity? 
3. Define a clearer content strategy for "benefit letters" vs. "claim letters" and other types of letters. Is there another term we should use to describe these things? How might be clear up the confusion and match the terms we are using to the different use cases these artifacts sit within?
