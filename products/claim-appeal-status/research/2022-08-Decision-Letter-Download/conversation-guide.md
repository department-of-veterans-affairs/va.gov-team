## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Skyler and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about a feature that allows you to download decision letters for disability claims. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you used VA.gov before?
- If yes, could you briefly describe the last time you used it? Do you tend to go there for a specific use?
- If no, how do you generally interact with the VA, if at all?
- Have you ever filed a 526 EZ or any other type of disability claim with the VA?
- If yes, how many times? Have you ever done it on VA.gov?

**Note:** Half of the participants will start with "First task," and the other half will start with "Second task." The goal of this is to test if there is a difference in behavior between Veterans who know there is a decision and Veterans who don't know if there is a decision.


## First Task: Checking on claim status - 15 minutes

Imagine you have a disability claim that you've been waiting to hear back about. You’re expecting an update any day now. Today, you go to check VA.gov to see if there's an update.
- [VA.gov home page] Where would you go to figure out if your claim has been decided?
    - Why would you expect to find it there?
- [Regardless of their answer above, direct them towards the Claim Status Tool] If you’re on this page, where would you go to figure out the status of your claim?
- [After clicking into claim] Tell me what you see here. 
-  Now where would you go to find out what the claim decision is? 
-  [Notification Letters page] Tell me what you see here.
-  If you clicked the Download link, what would you expect to see? 
-  [After clicking link] Is this what you were expecting?

Post-task questions:
- What do you think of this page overall, on a scale of 1 (least helpful) to 5 (most helpful)?
- Do you think this is a feature you would use as opposed to receiving the letter in the mail?
- What else would you expect to see on this Notification Letters page? What other types of content in the future? 

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand how to navigate from the Claim Status Tool to their decision letter?]
- [Does the participant understand what the letter is even with limited metadata associated with it?]
- [What does the participant expect the Notification Letters page to contain?]

## Second Task: Looking for notification letter - 10 minutes

- Let’s say you have received your notification letter in the mail, but you've misplaced it. You want to get a new copy from VA.gov.
- [VA.gov home page] Where would you go to find the decision letter?
    - Why would you expect to find it there?
- [Prompt them to open the megamenu from home page] From this list, is there a page where you would expect to find your decision letter?

### Things to watch for:

- [Where does the participant expect to find their decision letter?]
- [Are they able to intuitively navigate to the Notification Letters page from the home page?]

## Third Task: VA Benefit Letters Page - 15 minutes

- [Open megamenu on VA.gov home page] What would you expect to find in the "VA Benefit Letters Page"? 
- [Navigate to the Letters page] Explain to me what you see here. 
- What do you think is the purpose of this page? How would you use it?
- What type of content would you expect to be on this page?
- What do you think of this page overall, on a scale of 1 (least helpful) to 5 (most helpful)?
- How would you describe the difference between this page and the page you saw previously?

### Things to watch for:

- [What does user expect from the VA Benefit Letters page, after seeing the Notification Letters page?]
- [Do they understand the distinction between inbound letters and letters they generate?]

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Overall, what did you think of what you saw today? Was it clear or confusing?
- Do you think you would use any of the features you saw today?
- If you could change anything about what you saw today, what would it be?
- Do you have any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future usability research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
