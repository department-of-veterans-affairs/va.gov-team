## Background
Veterans are using the Claim Status tool to submit their Decision Review forms. This creates a problem because the forms get stored in the eFolder, without an EP code for tracking and does not notify anyone of their existence, and therefore could go unnoticed indefinitely. This issue was identified during a conversation with RVSR (rater inside VA).

## Goals
* The primary goal of this research is to understand how and why Veterans are using the Claim Status tool to submit their Decision Review forms. 
* The secondary goal is to understand how Vetarans are using the Claim Staus tool and discover opportunities to improve their experiences.
