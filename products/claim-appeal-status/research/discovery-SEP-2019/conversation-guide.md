## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing ourselves. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool.** The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - (5-10 minutes)

Before we look at the VA website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Tell me a little about yourself. (Where do you live? Which branch of service? What do you do for work?)

- Have you ever filed a disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?
    - How did you file it (online, mail, fax, VSO)?
    - How did you feel about the process?
    
- Have you ever filed an appeal with the Department of Veteran Affairs
    - How did you go about filing it?
    - How did you feel about the process?

## Setup Task: Share your screen with Zoom - (5 minutes)

- Please minimize or close any windows that you don't want to share with us.
- Navigate to va.gov in your computer's browser. 
- Click the "Share" on Zoom.

## First Task: Show me where you would expect to file an appeal for a denied claim. 

- Start on the home page of VA.gov.

### Things to watch for:

- What path does the participant take to file an appeal?
- Does the participant realize that they cannot file an appeal on VA.gov?
- What keywords and phrases does the partipant look for?
- What painpoints do they encounter?
- What works well?

## Second Task: Now I'm going to share a link to the prototype in the chat. Can you click on it?
