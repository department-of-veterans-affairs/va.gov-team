Kevin: Tell me about yourself. 

P4: Virgina Beach, Army guy. I own a business and sell and install garage doors.

Kevin: Have you ever filed an appeal online?

P4: Yes sir. 

It started a long time ago. Mail. The latest has been online.

K: How did you feel about the process?

P4: It’s okay. Sometimes I wonder if anybody reads what’s sent in, but that’s another issue.

I have an appeal in process right now. I filled it in online and sent it in online.

If it does what it says it does, it’s fine. I sent it 10 days ago, so we’ll see if it works out.

Kevin prompts P4 to screen share and go to VA.gov.

Kevin: Can you show me where you would expect to file an appeal on VA.gov?

P4: Um. File for claim compensation.

Kevin: What do you expect if you click on that link?

P4: Some instructions and a form telling me what to do.

Kevin: How does this compare with your expectations?

P4: That’s what I expected.

I guess all of it. Learn about fully developed claims …. Reads. It’s all self explanatory

Kevin: Any info helpful for appeals?

*Scrolls…*

P4: Not on that screen. But the original screen. File for an appeal has a line.

*Goes back to homepage. Looks through links on Disability.*

P4: I guess for appeals, you would, um. I guess check your claim or appeals status, I guess.
I’d expect to see the status of my current claim or where my appeal is in the process.

On file for VA disability increase -- means that I have new data that would support an increase in claim.  

*Clicks on File for VA disability increase link.

Scrolls through content.*

P4: It gives you the form to use. 526ez pdf. Um. Yeah. I guess that’s pretty good. 

K: What was helpful?

P4: It says 82.5 days to decide, so I know not to check everyday.

K: Anything unhelpful. Or not enough information?

*Scrolls…*

P4: Nah. I think it’s pretty good.

K: Is there anywhere else on the site to find out info about appeals?

P4: There are three new ways to do that. But I don’t see anything about an appeal itself.

K: If you did see something, where might you expect to see it?

P4: Under Disability.

*Kevin shares link to prototype.*

K: Tell me about what you can do on this page.

P4: I check the claim for compensation. They sent me a letter saying it was close. It reopened it. I can view the status of that. All of the other ones are closed.

K: Are there any actions you can take?

P4: View status, I guess. 

I’d expect to it tell me where we are in the process.

K: How might you view the most recent open dependency claim?
Reads…

P4: I’d like to click on View Status and see what’s going on.

*Clicks button.*

P4: It says they received my claim and they’re adding more information. If they need more information, they’ll request it from me. They haven’t done it.

Estimated completion date. That’s August 8th. Obviously long passed.

Once they have the info they need, they’ll send it to the rating specialist. Evidentally, I’ve done everything I can.

K: What do you expect to see if you click the Files tab?

P4: I’d expect to see information that I sent in. 

*Clicks on the tab.*

*Scrolls.*

*Reads screen…*

P4: Well, personally, I’d like to see the personal evidence that I submitted and see if they got it. If I hit View Details, will I see that?

K: what is helpful on this screen?

P4: What you’ve claimed is unavailable. I’m not sure why that isn’t available. 

Under Additional Evidence, you can view details and upload them.

It’ll probably have some VA form for me to fill out. Or a doctor’s letter, Nexus letter to attach.

*Clicks View Details button.*

It says Select Files to upload. If it’s as easy as it says it is. I’ve filed an appeal 10 days ago. Have they actually received those files?

*Clicks Add Files.*

K: After this is uploaded, what would you do next?
What type of documentation is this? Military Personnel Record. That’s all I see there.

P4: Click the checkbox. Then I’d hit Submit files for Review.

[Checkbox] is an acknowledgment that if something is unrelated, they won’t pay attention to it.

K: Is this what you’d expect to see after you submit files for review?

P4: Yeah. I guess.

P4: It said document filed. It does tell me that the files were submitted.

K: Is there anything missing from this screen?

P4: I’d like to see if the evidence I sent is the paperwork they got. They say we didn’t get that. Well, why didn’t someone tell me that?

K: Any other feedback?

P4: If I’m doing something wrong, I wonder if there’s a way for me to talk to someone. The only way to do that is to call the 1-800 number and wait 30 minutes.

K: So better forms of communication?

P4: Yes sir.

*Kevin wraps up.*
