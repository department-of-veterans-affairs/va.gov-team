# Background

### [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/discovery-SEP-2019/research-plan.md)

### [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/discovery-SEP-2019/conversation-guide.md)

### Goals

- The primary goal of this research is to understand where Veterans expect to be able to file an appeal on VA.gov.
- The secondary goal is to understand how Veterans are using the Claim Status tool and discover opportunities to improve their experiences.

# Methods

### Dates

We conducted user testing between September 25, 2019 â€“ October 1, 2019.

### Participants

We talked to **6 veterans**:

- All must have one of the following accounts: DSLogon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me.
- All must have filed a disability claim or appealed a disability decision.


### Tools

We conducted moderated remote usability testing via Zoom. We referenced the va.gov site and used [this InVision prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/S2U2NQZZ76A#/385489667_Intro-Page-2). 


# Results & Takeaways


### It was unclear to participants where they would go to file an appeal on the website. 

This is functionality that we do not yet have on the website; however, we wanted to understand where participants expected to find that process or information. All of the participants had difficulties in locating a single place where they could expect to file an appeal. Further, we received comments about making this process more action-based as opposed to information only.

**For consideration**: All participants looked for 'file an appeal' (or similar verbiage) as a link under the disability section on the homepage. It may make sense to add that link in that section of the homepage.

### It was unclear to participants where they would go to find information on filing an appeal. 

Participants had difficulty locating information specific to filing an appeal. Most participants began on pages without any information on appeals. When they did locate a page with appeals information, some stated that the information wasn't obvious (low down on the page, for instance).


### Participants would like a more immediate way to communicate with the VA.

Participants stated that they would like a better way to update their own personal information, as well as a better way to communicate with VA staff. Some referenced the 800 number and commented on wait times.


### Participants generally found the Claim Status Tool helpful.

Many positive comments were attributed to the 'landing' view of the Claim Status Tool. Specifically, participants liked the 'find out why we sometimes combine claims' information and the summarized information for each claim within the view. 

**Recommendation**: Based on feedback, a potential improvement may be to list the claims in chronological order.

**For consideration**: Though the users understood the 'view status' button indicated they would be viewing more details on the claim, they consistently called it 'view details' or referred to the subsequent data as 'details'. It may be valuable to change the button label to 'view details' rather than 'view status'.


### Participants found the information on the claim detail screen to be clear and relevant.

Many positive comments were attributed 'claim detail' page. Specifically, comments around the visual indicator of where the VA is in the process of reviewal of their claim and estimated date. 


### Participants expressed the desire to confirm file uploads and accuracy.

Participants wanted some sort of confirmation that they had sent the correct information to the VA. Comments around being able to view previously uploaded documents and even remove documents if uploaded in error.

**Recommendation**: Currently, they can see the title and document type they have previously submitted. However, there may be value in allowing users to view the document they previously submitted - and potentially allow them to remove the document if it was done in error.


### Participants found the confirmation checkbox wording to be clear and to give helpful instruction.

Participants commented that the checkbox was clear and provided extra instruction as to what should and should not be submitted.

**Recommendation**: Currently on va.gov, this checkbox does not exist - based upon the feedback, there may be value in adding and testing this further to see if it reduces the amount of decision review forms being uploaded erroneously.
