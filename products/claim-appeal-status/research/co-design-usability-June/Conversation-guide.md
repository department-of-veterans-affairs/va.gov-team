Conversation Guide for Claim Status Tool research, June 2020. 
==============================================================

Collaborative design sessions + usability test
==============================================

Moderator logistics
-------------------

Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.

Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).

-   In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute

-   In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked

-   Check your Zoom screen sharing setup

### Project-specific setup

-   Set-up a pre-filled Mural board.

-   Have one person controlling the Mural board and one person doing the moderating.

-   Have staging.va.gov open in a tab. 

-   Show current Claim status to participants. 

-   Have mock-ups of the claim status tool available.

-   Be ready to screen share

-   Do a small usability test of the current claim status tool if time/energy.

When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:

Intro - 3 minutes
-----------------

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Cristian Valla, and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Our team is working on re-designing the tool on VA.gov where you can check the status of your claims and appeals. Today, I'd like to talk through your current experiences checking the status of your claims, then we'll go through an activity that will help us understand what would make a new claim status tool most useful and efficient to you.

Before we start, I want to mention a few practical things:

-   This session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the claim status tool, to better meet Veterans' needs. We welcome all types of feedback.

-   You and I will go through a collaborative activity to help our team understand how we can design a claim status tool that best meets yours and other veterans' needs, wants and expectations.

-   We'll use a digital board to create a sketch of a new claim status tool: a colleague will draw or write your comments on the board. 

-   Again, please note that we're not testing you in any way and that there are no right or wrong answers here.

-   If for any reason you want to stop the session, please let me know.

-   Do you have any questions so far?

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? (We use the recordings only for our research, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.)

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

Warm-up Questions - 5 to 10 minutes
-----------------------------------

Before we start the activities I mentioned, I'd like to ask a few questions about how you use VA.gov and the pages where you can check the status of your claims and appeals.

-   Do you remember the last time you visited VA.gov? 

-   Do you remember what you were doing on the site?

-   How was that experience?

-   Have you filed for a claim on VA.gov? 

-   If yes, how was that process? 

-   How long did you wait for a claim decision to be made? 

-   Do you have a claim that's currently in process? 

-   Do you have someone assisting you in the claim process?

Kevin will now share his screen with you, and show you a tool to check the status of a claim, that we call the Claim status tool.

KEVIN SHARE SCREEN

-   Did you use this tool on VA.gov to check the claim?

If Yes,  

-   What were you doing the last time you came to this tool?

-   Did you accomplish what you came to do? 

If not - why?

-   Overall, how was the experience using this tool?

If No,

-   The intent of this tool is to provide a place for Veterans to check what's going on with a claim they have currently in process. 

We will now move on to an activity where we will have you design your ideal tool for this purpose.

(Note to the moderator, this should move on after participant glances at the tool for 1 minute or so, we don't want to bias them by having them explore it in detail.)

-   Great! Thanks for sharing that with me. Now, let's get started with the collaborative activity. 


Collaborative design activity: 
-------------------------------

Task 1: Create and Review Items - 15 minutes
--------------------------------------------

Begin screen sharing

-   Can you see my screen? Good. This is a tool called Mural, and we'll use this to sketch a new claim status tool based on your comments. 
For this exercise, let's imagine that anything is possible, allow yourself to think about anything and everything that would be helpful for you to have in a claim status tool. Feel free to suggest any designs, features, and possibilities here. 

-   I've created sticky notes for us to get started, and a few outlines that represent pages in the tool. Feel free to ask us to create as many sticky notes and as many pages as you want. 

-   First, we'll use the stickies to create items to include in the tool. Then, we'll organize them on a page, in a way that would be the most useful to you. 

-   Let's create stickies now for the items that are most important for you to see when you log in to your personalized claim status tool. (It'll be helpful if you can also talk about why each item is important to you.)

-   What information (and features and functionalities) would you want to see when you first log in to your claim status tool? 

(If participant hesitates: Think about the last time you were wondering about the status of your claims. What were you hoping to get information on?  Would stickies around those actions be a good place to start?)

Create sticky notes with each item.

-   Can you share details on why that's important to you?

-   What actions did you take when you looked at that in the past?

Help participants make any items that are too broad more specific.

-   What do you want to see in a claim status tool?

-   What do you want to be able to do in a claim status tool?

-   What info, features, functionalities would be most useful to you?

-   How would you use these features? 

-   What specific details are you looking for in a claim status tool.

-   Why are those things the most helpful for you? Please elaborate.

-   more

-   more?

How would it be different if this tool was personalized for you? 

-   Okay, I'd like to show you some other stickies we made ahead of time. Are any of these interesting to you, and why?

-   Take a moment to review them, and think out loud as you do - how do these resonate with you?

Allow participants to review stickies and encourage them to verbalize their thoughts as they do so.

-   Are there any items missing that would be valuable to you? We can go ahead and add them.

-   Any last items you want to add?

### Things to watch for:

-   How confident is the participant when listing the items they'd want to see?

-   How does the participant respond to "why" each item is important?

-   What details did the participant give about info they expect to see in an item?

-   How did the pre-populated stickies resonate with the participant?

-   Which items are the participant most confident they'd be interested in?

-   Any mention of notifications or updates?

Task 2: Organize the Items - 15 minutes
---------------------------------------

Great! Now, we'll move on to our pages.

-   Imagine that you have logged into your claim status tool and this is the first page you see. 
    Let's organize the stickies according to how important they are to you.

-   Tell me where to put each one, and tell me why you would place it there. 
    If there are stickies that are important to you, but you don't feel like this page is right for them, we can work with them later.

Organize stickies with the participant, encouraging them to continue thinking out loud and asking for clarification.

Use the size of a sticky-note to help reflect the priority.

If it doesn't happen organically, try to ask: should we group any of these together? Where would you want to see these groups?

As appropriate, ask:

-   Can you share details on why that's important to you?

-   What actions did you take when you looked at that in the past?

-   If participants have trouble, ask questions based on what they mentioned was a priority in the warm-up interview.

Once it feels like they're done: 

-   It feels like we're slowing down and things might be in a pretty good place. How are you feeling about what we've done here? Do we need to make any adjustments?

-   Now let's revisit the other stickies that aren't on a page yet.

-   Why are these still important?

-   Where would it be most helpful for you to be able to access them?

If it hasn't been discussed: 

-   How would you like to access the claim status tool? 

-   E.g.: would you navigate to it from the home page?

-   Or is it a widget that pops up after login? 

-   If it's a widget, what would this widget include?

-   Are there other ways you see yourself reaching this tool?

-   Are there any other forms you imagine such a tool could have, or such a tool could exist as?   

-   How personalized to you imagine such a tool would be? 

-   What would be part of such a personalization? 

-   What platforms would you use to access this tool? (phone, laptop, tablet etc.)

### Things to watch for:

-   Does any part of the organization cause the participant to hesitate or get stuck?

-   What sections or groupings does the participant create?

-   Where does the participant place notifications and updates?

-   What expectations does the participant have around notifications and updates?

Backup: Usability study of current Claim status tool. 10 minutes
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you feel up to it, we have one last exercise we can do. It is a usability study of the current claim status tool. Do you feel up to do a 10-minute usability study?

Task 1 (Wayfinding task): Imagine that you have logged into the VA.gov and from this page, the VA.gov homepage, you want to read about what is happening with a claim that you submitted April 9, 2020. What would you do? 

Please walk me through what you are attempting to do, what you are thinking and experiencing. 

The participant is doing the task.

-   Was anything on these pages confusing or unclear? 

-   Do you feel any information was missing? 

-   What was most helpful on these pages? 

-   If you could improve one thing, what would it be?

Task 2: Imagine your doctor sent you a letter you have been waiting to add to your claim. How would you go about and add this to your latest claim?

-   Was anything on these pages confusing or unclear? 

-   Do you feel any information was missing? 

-   What was most helpful on these pages? 

-   If you could improve one thing on these pages, what would it be?

-   After designing your ideal tool and then looking in more detail at the current tool, are there any large discrepancies? Was there anything you really wanted on your ideal design that wasn't on the current tool? Or was there anything on the current tool you want that you didn't think about when you were designing your page? 

That's helpful, thank you!

Post-Task Interview - 2 to 5 minutes
------------------------------------

-   Is there anything you'd want to see or be able to do in a claims tool that we haven't talked about?

-   Do you have any other thoughts on anything we discussed today you want to share before we wrap up?

-   Any questions for me?

Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute
--------------------------------

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to make the VA.gov site easier and better to use for Veterans. 

Thank you very much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
