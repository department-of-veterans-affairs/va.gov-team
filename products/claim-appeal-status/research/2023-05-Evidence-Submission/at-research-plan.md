# Research Plan for Benefits Team 1: Evidence Submission AT Usability Testing (WIP)

TBD

## Background

**This is the Assistive Technology usability testing plan for the Evidence Submission work that is underway. The Research Plan for the other usability study can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-05-Evidence-Submission/research-plan.md).**

In our research on the Decision Reviews and Initial Decision experiences, we've identified a number of issues with the Claim Status Tool experience. One of the main Veteran pain points relates to evidence submission: Veterans don't have a good understanding of what type of evidence to submit, and once the claim is in progress they are anxious about whether there is anything they need to do, or any additional materials they need to provide, to improve the likelihood of a favorable outcome.

With this set of design changes to CST, we hope to make it clearer to Veterans what actions – if any – they need to take to support their claim. We also hope to improve the experience overall, leading to a CST that is clearer, easier to understand, and leaves Veterans feeling more secure about the status of their claim.

### OCTO Priorities 

This work supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md):
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
This work supports a Veteran whenever they are filing a disability compensation claim, which could occur across a wide swath of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf), ranging all the way from "Getting out" to "Aging." 

## Research Goals	
- Assess the usability of these CST design proposals for Veterans who use a screenreader or other asssistive technology to access VA.gov.

## Methodology	
Usability testing

### Location
Remote on Zoom

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We would like to recruit Veterans who use screenreaders and have filed a disability compensation claim with the VA. 

### Recruitment criteria
For this study we woud like to recruit 12 total participants. All 12 participants should be screen reader users. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- 4 screenreader users who are at the level "advanced" or "expert."
- 8 screenreader users who are at the level "beginner" or "intermediate."

**Questions**
1. Have you ever filed a disability compensation claim with the VA?
2. Have you ever successfully logged on to VA.gov using your assistive technology?
3. Do you need to use assistive technology to use the internet such as VoiceOver on an iPhone, TalkBack on an Android device, or JAWS on a computer?
4. Are you able to join the Zoom session using this assistive technology?
5. Please list the name of the assistive technology or software you will use during the session.
6. We want to make sure our website works for people with various levels of experience with screen readers. Please rate your experience level using a screen reader:
[Response options: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert]
