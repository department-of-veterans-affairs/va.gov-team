# Research Plan: Evidence Submission Usability Testing

Benefits Team 1 · June 2023

## Background
In our research on [Decision Reviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-11-Decision-Reviews/research-findings.md) and [Initial Decisions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2023-03-Initial-Decisions-CST/research-findings.md) we identified a number of issues with the Claim Status Tool user experience. One of the main pain points relates to evidence submission: Veterans don't have a good understanding of what type of evidence to submit, and once the claim is in progress they are anxious about whether there is anything they need to do – or any additional materials they need to provide – to improve the likelihood of a favorable outcome. 

With this set of design changes to CST, we hope to make it clearer to Veterans what actions – if any – they need to take to support their claim. We also hope to improve the UX overall, creating a CST that is more accessible, easier to understand, and leaves Veterans feeling secure about the status of their claim. 

### OCTO Priorities 

This work supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md):
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
This work supports a Veteran whenever they are filing a disability compensation claim, which could occur across a wide swath of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf), ranging all the way from "Getting out" to "Aging." 

## Research Goals	
- Assess the usability of these CST design proposals for Veterans
- Uncover any additional ideas we should pursue to improve the evidence submission experience for Veterans in CST

### Outcome
With this research we hope to validate the usability of our design concepts for "Track 1" Evidence Submission work. "Track 1" is a set of near-term, concrete user experience and accessibility updates we want to make to CST.

### Research questions
- Does this new design make it easier for Veterans to understand when they have an evidence submission request in CST? Are they better able to understand exactly what that request is and how to act on it? 
- Does including the claim ID in the claim card make it easier for Veterans to distinguish between different claims in CST?
- Do Veterans respond positively to the new layout of the Claim Details page, with separate sections dedicated to Veteran actions and VA actions?
- Do Veterans respond positively to other UX improvements in this version of CST? 

### Hypothesis
- The new design will help Veterans distinguish between different claims in CST.
- Veterans will prefer the new Status page to the old Status page overall.
- The new design will give Veterans a strong understanding of what is happening with their claim at any given time.
- The new design will help Veterans distinguish between requests for them that they need to act on and requests for third parties that they don't need to act on.
- The new design will make it easy for Veterans to see requests for evidence submission and understand what those requests are.
- The new design will make it clear to Veterans whether or not they need to take any action to advance their claim.
