# Research Plan for Benefits Team 1, Disagreement Pathways

## Background
Today, the process for appealing an unfavorable claims decision is complicated and lengthy. Veterans have to decide on which disagreement pathway to pursue: supplemental claims, higher level review, and/or appealing to the Board of Appeals. Each pathway is associated with lengthy wait times, with veterans often waiting more than 100 days to receive a final decision. Disability compensation appeals make up the overwhelming majority of VA benefits decision appeals.

With this research effort, we seek to better understand this user journey and identify ways in which it can be improved. Our hypothesis is: “if we provide veterans who disagree with their claims decision clarity about which disagreement pathway is right for them and a means to pursue that pathway, then we expect them to receive the full disability benefits they've earned on a faster timeline.

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following OCTO Objectives: 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features=

### Veteran Journey
This work touches on various aspects of the Veteran Journey. Whenever they are applying for disability compensation benefits – which for many Veterans can be throughout their lifetime – this feature would be relevant.

## Research Goals	
With this research, we are hoping to speak with Veterans who have engaged in – or are currently in the process of – the appeals process. We want to know more about what the pain points in this user journey are. We are also curious to find out more about whether these journeys can be fully self-service, given the complexity and high stakes nature of appeals. We know many Veterans rely on Veteran support networks and even legal assistance in these cases, and we are curious to see the extent to which VA.gov can instill trust and save time for Veterans when dealing with claim appeals and other "disagreement pathways."

### Outcome
This research will include two parts. In one, we will get some foundational qualitative data to strengthen our understanding of appeals from the Veteran perspective. In the second, we will test a quick concept prototype to see if Veterans find value in this type of digital self-service tool. Based on the findings, we will proceed with our product development to identify ways in which we can address Veteran pain points. 

### Research questions
Part 1: General questions
- Did you use VA.gov to file your appeal?
- What were your main reasons for filing the appeal?
- Did you consult a third party (Veteran rep, lawyer) when filing your appeal?
- On a scale of 1-5, how would you have rated your appeals experience?
- What were your biggest challenges with the process? 
- Was there anything about the process that worked particularly well?
- How did you feel about the appeals process result (or how do you feel so far, if it’s underway)?

Part 2: Prototype

_Use the scenario from ppt’s own experience (i.e. “main reasons” in question #2)._

- Let’s say you just received a decision, but you’re unhappy with the result. What would you do next?
- [Indicating to the survey CTA] What do you think this is?
- [Take ppt through the questions] What do you think of this?
- [At the end] What did you think of that? Would you feel confident filing an appeal in this way?
- Is there anything else you would do at this point (doesn’t need to be on VA.gov)?

### Hypothesis
Our hypothesis includes a few elements: 
- We know from previous research that Veterans are frustrated with the amount of time the appeals process takes. We expect this to emerge as a major pain point. 
- We know from previous research that Veterans often seek out assistance from Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) or lawyers to assist them with their appeals. We have a hunch that a fully self-service experience will not instill the trust that Veterans need to feel satisfied in these high-stakes scenarios. That said, we are curious to test this hypothesis by taking them through a digital appeals flow with some asisstance from an "Appeals Survey," which is the design idea we'll test with the prototype.
- We suspect that Veterans might not fully trust the VA to appoint a representative for them. Given suspicions we've seen in data and anecdotally, Veterans might feel as though the VA is not giving them the "best" representation and they might express a desire to seek out their own.

## Methodology	
As mentioned above, the research sessions will be broken into two parts: 

**Part 1: Semi-structured interviews** 
In this fist part, the interviewer will ask the Veterans a series of questions with the goal of learning more about their appeals experience and the pain points they encountered. The goal of this is generative – to try and elecit problems that the team can solve with subsequent design ideation.

**Part 2: Usability testing**
We will be using a concept prototype for this, meaning we won't be looking for perfect usability. The goal is also generative: to explore whether this type of tool would be useful to Veterans, and also to see if there are any obvious gaps in its content that need to be filled in a subsequent iteration.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research is Veterans who have appealed – or are in the process of appealing – a disability compensation claim decision.

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
We would like to recruit 20 Veterans with the goal of successfully completing at least 10 sessions. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

We are primarily looking for Veterans who have experience with the appeals process for disability compensation claims. Participants must be able to speak to their appeals process, so ideally it has happened in the last ~5 years, or they are curently in the process of appealing a claim. 

> Question for recruits: "In the last 10 years, have you appealed a disability compensation claim decision?"

If possible, we would like some representation from the following underrepresented groups: 

- Primarily mobile users
- Veterans in a rural area
- Veterans without a degree

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email: TBD
