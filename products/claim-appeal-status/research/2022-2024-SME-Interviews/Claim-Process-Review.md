## Notes
- We removed some of the content from Step 1 after our last conversation
- The Intent to File and “established” dates are different
- Let’s not say “established” because it sounds too formal and might get confused with ItF. Maybe “We started working on the claim on [date].”
- Question: Can we show the ItF date if the Veteran submitted an Intent to File? To make it super clear that those are different dates.
- There’s no “Estimated time” for Claim Received step
- Step 1 is kind of a weird one because you can’t be in the step of “receiving the claim”
- What does the check communicate? In the past it’s communicated that the step is done.
- On the “Initial Review” the VSR checks to make sure it’s a complete application: 
- Dates of service, things are signed, etc.
- In “Initial Review” they also identify what they will need in the next step
- Request exam,  gathering evidence 
- VSRs goal during Initial Review is to request all the records. Suspense date is set each time evidence is requested.
- Might not be able to request everything at the same time (e.g. service treatment records and private treatment records or exams)
- “Initial Review & Development”
- As soon as there’s a tracked item, it has gone from Initial Review to Development
- Claim status in VBMS changes 
- Question: How much flexibility do we have over breaking out the Initial Review and Evidence Gathering steps? What data does that JSON file provide us? 
- The VA has a duty to assist in all cases
- If the Veteran sends in records and documents themselves, instead of waiting for VA duty to assist the claim is going to get processed faster and more effectively
- For private medical records, Veterans have to submit VA Form 21-4142 to give VA permission to access those records for them
- For employments records, Veterans submit VA Form 21-8940 
- Employment records are only needed when the Veteran is filing claim for individual unemployability
- The majority of which records/documents are needed are listed in the 526-EZ. We should link out to that, instead of trying to stuff it all into CST.
- C&P exams happen during Evidence Gathering
- Language of the claim status may change within Evidence Gathering and updates will be noted in the Recent Activity section of CST
- Review of Evidence: Once all the evidence is gathered, the VSR packages everything up and makes sure it’s ready to get sent to the Rater.
- Question: Should we remove “Review of Evidence” and go straight from Evidence Gathering to Rating?
- Rater can give partial rating – “deferral” when they make a decision on one thing but not on the others
- Once the VSR has it ready for the Rater, they change the claim status from “Open” to “Ready for decision”
- Every day “Ready for decision” claims get dumped automatically to regional offices for Raters to review them
- If we use “Estimated times” we need to double and triple check that they are accurate and consistent with the rest of the site
- “Preparation for decision” is a weird name. It should just be called “Rating” and it usually takes 1-2 days.
- Rating is when RVSR decides whether or not Veteran is going to get service connected
- RVSR doesn’t suggest a decision, they give the decision. It’s their job to give the decision.
- Senior VSR is not reviewing the evidence. They are reviewing the award/notification letter.
- Checking that all the contentions are there, that the date of claim is correct
- Preparing award notification
- Senior VSR is not going to question or overrule the RVSR’s decision
- It can go back to the RVSR rater if any of the details are wrong
- It can even go all the way back the chain in theory (back to Evidence Gathering – won’t go back to Initial Review because that only happens once)
- Once the Senior VSR creates the award the system clears the claim and it’s closed
- There is this other effort (Mr. Rocco) floating around where USB (Undersecretary of Benefits) wants there to be more updates on claim so that it doesn’t feel “stuck.”
