## Research Goals

**Goals:**  
1) Understand perceptions, trust, and actions across channels;
2) Identify tone/clarity effects;
3) Determine channel appropriateness for informational vs. action-required notifications.  

## Research Questions

* How do Veterans interpret and respond to decision letter and evidence request notifications across email, text, and in-app?  
* How much information feels appropriate in each channel (decision letter vs. evidence request)?  
* How do tone and structure affect clarity, trust, and urgency?  
* Which channel do Veterans engage with first, and why?  
* How can messages be clear, actionable, and trustworthy across digital channels?  


## Methodology 

- Semi‑structured interviews with scenario-based evaluation of notification examples (email, text, in-app).  
- Qualitative coding and affinity mapping of open-ended responses.  
- Conversation guide
- Figma prototypes: [Desktop](https://www.figma.com/proto/db26JCYXJtaakOdG4TiNXN/Notifications-BMT?page-id=2556%3A6200&node-id=2764-622&viewport=220%2C537%2C0.12&t=gPDuvgO4bofaBB0z-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=2764%3A622&show-proto-sidebar=1) & [Mobile](https://www.figma.com/proto/db26JCYXJtaakOdG4TiNXN/Notifications-BMT?page-id=2556%3A6200&node-id=2688-356&viewport=220%2C537%2C0.12&t=gPDuvgO4bofaBB0z-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=2688%3A356&show-proto-sidebar=1) 

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **Hypothesis:** Veterans prefer email for formal, detailed notifications, and text/in-app for time-sensitive messages.  
  - **Likely True**  
  - Evidence: Many participants reviewed notifications on phone (text/push) first but completed actions on desktop or via app; several preferred email for reading decision letters and text/push for urgent evidence requests (e.g., P4, P8, P10, P17). 

- **Hypothesis:** Plain, friendly language increases trust and comprehension compared to bureaucratic tone.  
  - **Likely True**  
  - Evidence: Participants repeatedly praised straightforward, “cut and dried” wording and bold emphasis; vague messages reduced urgency (e.g., P4: “straightforward,” P5: “cut and dried,” P7: “pretty cut and dry,” while multiple participants requested clearer deadlines and CTAs). 

- **Hypothesis:** Channel preference depends on sensitivity and comfort with digital tools.  
  - **Definitely True**  
  - Evidence: Strong variation: several distrust text links and prefer to log in directly (P1, P5, P6, P15, P16), while others click links readily (P4, P8, P10, P17). Trust in push/in-app was high for most due to prior installation and authentication. 

## Key Findings

1. **Evidence requests feel more urgent than decision letters; participants want explicit due dates.** (8/11 mentioned higher urgency and/or requested deadlines).
2. **Push/in-app notifications are widely trusted; text messages are most suspect.** (Majority rated push trust at 5/5; ~6/11 expressed reluctance to click text links). 
3. **Clear sender signals (VA logo, .gov domain, known short codes) drive trust.** Participants referenced VA logo/letterhead, .gov addresses, and known numbers (e.g., 53079). 
4. **Many prefer to authenticate via VA.gov or the app rather than follow links in messages.** (≈5/11 stated they’d navigate directly). 
5. **Multi-channel delivery is welcomed, especially for action-required items.** Most participants favored receiving via all three channels; some prefer staggered timing to reduce pressure. 
6. **Tone should be direct and action-oriented; vague phrasing reduces urgency.** Requests for “what, why, by when” were common. 
7. **Device choice affects actionability.** Participants often check notifications on phones but complete evidence uploads on desktops/laptops. 
## Details of Findings 

### Finding 1 — Evidence requests feel more urgent; deadlines are essential  
Participants wanted explicit due dates and urgency cues.  
- “The first thing is that I could easily miss this one… I probably want something telling me that this is urgent… act soon.” — **Pilot (Scenario 2, Email)** 3A20A8B77446%7D&file=BMT%20Notification%20Research%2012_25.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)  
- “Very urgent… more urgency on this one, because… this is requiring an actual action.” — **P1 (Scenario 2, Push)** 3A20A8B77446%7D&file=BMT%20Notification%20Research%2012_25.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)  
- “It should say it’s time sensitive.” — **P10 (Comparative Reflection)**   
**Count:** 8/11 participants described evidence requests as more urgent than decision letters or asked for deadlines (P1, P3, P5, P6, P8, P10, P16, P17).

### Finding 2 — Push/in-app trusted; text links distrusted  
Push feels legitimate due to prior installation and authentication; many avoid clicking text links.  
- “I trust text messages the least… I’d be least likely to actually open a link from a text.” — **P1 (Scenario 1, Text)** 
- “I’m not going to click that link… I rarely click links on texts.” — **P1 (Scenario 1, Text)** 
- “I would go to VA.gov and log in.” — **P15 (Scenario 1, Text)** 
**Count:** ~6/11 expressed reluctance to click text links (P1, P3, P5, P6, P15, P16); most rated push as highly trustworthy.

### Finding 3 — Sender signals (.gov, logo, known short code) increase trust  
Participants look for letterhead, .gov domains, and familiar numbers.  
- “It’s a .gov email… that makes it legitimate.” — **P1 (Warm-up)** 
- “There’s that specific, 53079 number. I know is coming from the VA.” — **P4 (Warm-up)** 
- “VA logo… letterhead.” — **P10, P16 (Scenario responses)** 

### Finding 4 — Preference to authenticate directly vs. clicking links  
Logging in is a common behavior to confirm legitimacy before acting.  
- “I wouldn’t click on the link in my email… I would navigate there myself.” — **P1 (Scenario 1, Email)** 
- “I wouldn’t click the link… I’d go to VA.gov.” — **P6 (Scenario 1, Text)**; **P15 (Scenario 1, Text)** 
**Count:** 5/11 preferred to log in rather than click (P1, P5, P6, P15, P16). 
### Finding 5 — Multi-channel delivery welcomed; timing matters  
Participants favored receiving action-required messages via email + text + push; some prefer staggered timing to reduce pressure.  
- “Please send it on all channels… maybe even multiple times… I don’t want to miss that.” — **P1 (Scenario 2 Wrap-up)**
- “Fine… adds legitimacy.” — **P3 (Scenario 2 Wrap-up)** 
- “All at once is fine; staggered feels like pressure.” — **P5 (Comparative Reflection)** 
**Count:** ~10/11 were OK with multi-channel delivery; several noted staggered reminders can help without overwhelming.

### Finding 6 — Direct, action-oriented tone improves clarity  
Vague phrasing reduces urgency; people want “what, why, by when.”  
- “There’s no due date… I have to click the link to find out.” — **P4 (Scenario 2, Email)** 
- “It would be helpful if it said what they were looking for, why, and how soon.” — **P6 (Scenario 2, Text)** 
- “No sense of urgency… nothing telling me what’s needed and when.” — **P7, P16 (Scenario 2, Push/Text)** 

### Finding 7 — Device choice affects actionability  
Many check on phones but switch to desktop to upload or complete steps.  
- “I usually start off with my phone… then initiate reading… [but] not likely to submit from phone.” — **P4 (Scenario 1 Wrap, Scenario 2 Wrap)** 
- “I’d get my laptop… log in.” — **P5 (Scenario 2, Email/Text)** 

## Additional Insights
*Include insights that do not represent patterns but are still valuable.*  

- **VSO/Lawyer support:** Some participants rely on VSOs/lawyers for evidence submission or clarification (e.g., P1, P6, P10). 
- **Short code familiarity varies:** Known numbers (e.g., 53079) helped some participants; unfamiliar codes reduced trust (P4 vs. P16). 
- **Opt-out expectations:** Many expect “STOP” to halt texts, but are unsure whether it stops all VA texts or just claims-related; they expect re‑enrollment via settings on VA.gov or in-app (multiple participants). 
## Recommendations

*Summarize actionable recommendations based on findings.*  

1. **Add explicit due dates and urgency cues for evidence requests (High).**  
   - Rationale: Drives timely action; participants perceive evidence requests as urgent but need clear deadlines.  
   - Evidence: Requests for due dates/time sensitivity across participants (e.g., P1, P4, P6, P10, P16).  
   - Expected impact: Faster evidence submission; fewer missed deadlines.
2. **Standardize trust signals across channels (High).**  
   - Actions: Prominent VA logo/letterhead, consistent “From” name; display verified .gov URLs; use known short codes; include “Do not click—log in at VA.gov” guidance when appropriate.  
   - Evidence: Participants looked for VA logo, .gov domain, familiar short codes; many prefer authenticating directly (P1, P4, P5, P6, P15, P16).  
   - Impact: Reduced phishing concerns; higher engagement. 
3. **Favor “Authenticate & act” over “Click this link” (High).**  
   - Actions: Encourage users to open the VA app or go to VA.gov to view details; minimize direct links in text messages.  
   - Evidence: ~5/11 said they’d navigate to VA.gov/app rather than click; text links are widely distrusted (P1, P3, P5, P6, P15, P16).  
   - Impact: Increased security and trust.  

4. **Use channel-appropriate content boundaries (Medium).**  
   - Actions:  
     - **Text:** Short, privacy-safe alerts + clear CTA to authenticate (“We need info to keep your claim moving. Check VA.gov/app.”).  
     - **Email:** More detail on context and next steps; still avoid PII.  
     - **Push:** Concise + “Open app to continue,” with urgency indicator for evidence requests.  
   - Evidence: Participants wanted clarity without specifics in text; email seen as better for detail; push trusted due to app context (P1, P3, P4, P8, P10, P17).  
   - Impact: Improved comprehension; maintained privacy.
5. **Sequence multi-channel delivery (Medium).**  
   - Actions: For evidence requests, send **push** immediately, **email** within an hour, and **text** as a same‑day reminder; allow users to set preferences.  
   - Evidence: Most favored multi-channel; staggered timing reduces pressure and helps as reminders (P1, P3, P4, P5).  
   - Impact: Better visibility without overload.

6. **Strengthen action-oriented tone and structure (Low).**  
   - Actions: Use “what, why, by when” framing; add bolded cues (“Action needed”), and clear CTA (“Respond on VA.gov”).  
   - Evidence: Requests for clearer CTAs and deadlines (P4, P6, P7, P16).  
   - Impact: Higher task completion and reduced confusion.

## Product User and Business Outcomes

*Explain how findings and recommendations align with the product's goals.*

### Desired User Outcome 
This research supports our desired user outcome by clarifying **what happened, what to do, and by when**—especially for evidence requests—so Veterans act confidently and promptly across trusted channels.

### Desired Business Outcome
This research supports our desired business outcome by improving **consistency and trust** in notifications, reducing delays in evidence submission, and supporting OCTO-DE priorities to deliver clearer, timely communications.

## Key Performance Indicators

*Explain how findings will support KPI measurement.*  

### KPI 1 — Notification comprehension & trust  
This research supports measurement by defining urgency cues and trust signals (logo, .gov, short code, authenticate-first), enabling surveys and analytics to track comprehension/trust changes post-implementation.  

### KPI 2 — Time-to-action for evidence requests  
By adding deadlines and sequencing delivery, we can measure reduced time from notification to evidence submission via VA.gov/app analytics.

## Next Steps

*Outline immediate actions based on findings, including owners if applicable.*  

- **Content design update (High):** Add explicit due dates and “Action needed” cues to evidence request templates (Owner: Content Designer).  
- **Sender & URL standards (High):** Standardize sender display, verified short code, and URL rendering; add guidance to authenticate vs. click (Owner: Engineering + Content).  
- **Channel playbook (Med):** Define content boundaries per channel; create sequencing rules for action-required messages (Owner: Product + Content).  
- **Preference management (Med):** Clarify opt-in/out behavior (what “STOP” affects) and surface settings in VA.gov/app (Owner: Product + Eng).  
- **Accessibility study (Med):** Plan follow-on testing with AT users to validate comprehension/trust with screen readers and zoom (Owner: Research).  
- **Create GitHub issues:** Convert recommendations into actionable issues (link back here).

## Further research needed

*Identify gaps in the current study and areas requiring additional investigation––such as demographics that were not included in this study.* 

- Validate notification accessibility with screen readers and magnification.  
- Explore comprehension with low literacy/paper-first Veterans.  
- Quantify optimal sequencing cadence (how often reminders help vs. overwhelm).  
- Clarify opt-out/re-enroll flows and their user mental models.

## Limitations & Confidence

- **Missing data:** Several “No Show” participants (e.g., P2, P9, P11–P14) and blank cells (“no response”) reduce the breadth of perspectives; pilot responses were used for refinement, not counts. [1](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/personal/melissa_lefevre_va_gov/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B488E43AE-39DC-4C2C-8B38-3A20A8B77446%7D&file=BMT%20Notification%20Research%2012_25.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)  
- **Self-report only:** No task performance was tested; findings reflect perceptions and intended behaviors.  
- **Demographics:** Limited/unknown demographic details restrict subgroup analysis.  
- **Confidence level:** **Moderate**—patterns are consistent across 11 completed sessions but should be validated with broader and AT-inclusive samples.
