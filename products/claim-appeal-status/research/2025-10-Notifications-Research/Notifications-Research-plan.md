## Background

### Product Overview
The **Benefits Management Tools (BMT)** portfolio supports Veterans in managing their benefits through VA.gov and the VA Health and Benefits (VAHB) mobile app. The tools include:

- **Claim Status Tool (CST)** – to track disability compensation claims and appeals  
- **VA Letters and Documents** – to access official benefit correspondence  
- **Payment History** – to review compensation payments  
- **Disability Rating** – to understand benefit amounts and eligibility  

BMT aims to provide Veterans with clear, accessible, and timely updates about their benefits, helping them stay informed and act when needed.

### Problem Statement
Today, Veterans primarily receive benefits notifications by paper mail. Currently, only **decision letter notifications** are sent digitally via email, while other notifications (e.g., **evidence requests**) are still delivered by paper.

As BMT expands to include **text messages (SMS)** and **in-app notifications**, we need to ensure these channels are clear, consistent, and trustworthy. We don’t yet know how Veterans perceive or act on these digital notifications—especially how they distinguish between **informational** and **action-required** messages.

This study focuses on **decision letter** and **evidence request** notifications to understand how Veterans prefer to receive, interpret, and act on these communications across email, text, and in-app channels.

Findings will guide VA in creating a cohesive, actionable, and accessible notification experience that helps Veterans quickly understand what happened, what to do, and by when.

### Product Location
The notification system (**VA Notify**) is integrated across VA.gov’s benefits management ecosystem and the **VA Health and Benefits** mobile app, primarily supporting the **Claim Status Tool** and related features.

### Veteran Familiarity
Veterans are familiar with receiving notifications by **paper mail** and increasingly through **email**. The new system expands these channels with **in-app alerts** and **notification settings**, giving Veterans more control over how they receive updates.

## Product Brief

### OCTO-DE Priorities Supported

**Objective 1:** VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

- **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with web and mobile products by 5 points.  
- **Key Result 2:** Reduce the total time Veterans spend waiting for responses by 50%.  
- **Key Result 3:** Ensure Veterans receive clear, timely notifications when an issue occurs.

**Objective 4:** OCTO positively influences VA's ability to deliver software products and services faster, safer, and with higher quality.

- **Key Result 1:** Deliver notification design standards and content guidelines that raise usability and consistency across VA products.  
- **Key Result 2:** Provide actionable research insights to reduce confusion and improve Veterans’ trust in digital communications.

---

## Veteran Journey
This research supports Veterans during:

- **Taking Care of Myself** – managing ongoing disability compensation and appeals  
- **Putting Down Roots** – maintaining access to benefits and records for financial stability  

---
## Research Scope
This study will explore and evaluate how Veterans interpret and act on decision letter and evidence request notifications across channels focusing on clarity, tone, and preferred sequencing. We will not test message delivery mechanics and interface usability at this time.

---
## Research Goals

### Goals
1. Identify what information Veterans expect and find most useful in **decision letter** vs. **evidence request** notifications.  
2. Explore which channels (email, text, in-app) Veterans prefer for each type of notification and why.  
3. Assess how content structure, tone, and sequencing influence understanding, trust, and task completion.  
4. Explore barriers, trust, and accessibility issues across Veteran segments (e.g., older adults, low-vision users, paper-first users, cognitive deficits).

### Outcome
This research will generate **evidence-based insights** to refine and strengthen VA’s notification and design guidance by focusing on how Veterans **receive, understand, and act** on decision letter and evidence request notifications across digital channels.

Specifically, the study will:

- Validate and refine **content standards** for digital notifications.  
- Fill gaps in **tone, structure, and sequencing guidance**.  
- Identify **design and interaction patterns** that support trust and task completion.  
- Surface **accessibility needs** and preferences across devices and abilities.

Findings will inform the next iteration of the **Benefits Management Tools (BMT)** notification experience, guiding the rollout of digital notifications that are **clear, accessible, and trustworthy**.

## Research Questions

1. How do Veterans interpret the purpose and importance of decision letter and evidence request notifications?  
2. What level of detail and tone feels appropriate for each channel (text, email, in-app)?  
3. What elements (subject line, sender name, preview text) most affect trust and engagement?  
4. Through which channels do Veterans prefer to receive each notification type, and why?  
5. How do Veterans decide which channel to act on first when receiving notifications across multiple channels?  
6. What types of messages feel too sensitive or urgent for certain channels (e.g., SMS)?  
7. How do accessibility needs or device use shape channel preferences and actions?  
   - How easily can assistive tech users read and understand notifications across channels?  
   - What language, tone, or formatting elements aid or hinder interpretation?  
   - How does message structure affect comprehension for cognitive or reading challenges?  
   - How do visual factors (contrast, font size, layout) influence legibility?  
   - Which channels are more accessible for assistive tech users?  
   - What challenges arise when switching devices (e.g., mobile to desktop)?  
8. How do Veterans perceive differences in tone, urgency, and next steps between notification types?  
9. What sequencing (e.g., text → email → in-app) best supports timely understanding and action?  
10. How can future design patterns clearly differentiate “informational” vs. “action-required” messages?

---

## Hypotheses

- Veterans prefer **email** for detailed updates and **text messages** for urgent alerts.  
- Clear **call-to-action** (what happened, what to do, by when) improves task completion.  
- **Friendly, plain language** builds trust; bureaucratic tone reduces it.  
- **Privacy concerns** vary depending on content sensitivity.  
- **Accessibility needs** reveal unique barriers to interacting with notifications.

---

## Methodology

### Method
**Semi-structured interviews** with scenario-based evaluations of sample notifications.  
Participants review and react to notification examples (text, email, in-app) to evaluate **clarity, tone, actionability, and trust**.

### Rationale
Semi-structured interviews uncover **mental models, trust signals, and tone perceptions** that quantitative data cannot reveal.

---

## Session Structure

Each 60-minute session includes:

1. **Introduction:** Explore how participants currently receive and respond to VA notifications.  
2. **Scenario 1 – Decision Letter:** Review and react to email + text/in-app mockups; discuss tone, clarity, next steps.  
3. **Scenario 2 – Evidence Request:** Review and react to notifications; probe urgency, trust, and sequencing.  
4. **Comparative Reflection:** Contrast experiences; discuss preferences for clarity, trust, and usability.

### Location
**Remote (via Zoom)** with screen share to view examples.
