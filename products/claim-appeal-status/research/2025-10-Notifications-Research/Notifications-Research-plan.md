# UX Research Plan: Benefits Management Notifications Study

---

## Background

### Briefly describe the background of your product
The **Benefits Management Tools (BMT)** portfolio supports Veterans in managing their benefits through **VA.gov** and the **VA Health and Benefits (VAHB)** mobile app. The tools include:

- **Claim Status Tool (CST)** – to track disability compensation claims and appeals  
- **VA Letters and Documents** – to access official benefit correspondence  
- **Payment History** – to review compensation payments  
- **Disability Rating** – to understand benefit amounts and eligibility  

BMT aims to provide Veterans with clear, accessible, and timely updates about their benefits, helping them stay informed and act when needed.

### What problem is your product trying to solve
Veterans currently receive **benefits notifications by email and paper mail**, which limits how quickly and clearly VA can share updates or next steps. As the Benefits Management Tools (BMT) team expands to include **text and in-app notifications**, we need to ensure all channels work together in a **clear, consistent, and trustworthy** way.  

We don’t yet know how Veterans perceive or act on these new digital notifications. Without shared content and tone standards, there’s a risk of **confusion, missed actions, or reduced trust.**  

The notifications initiative aims to create a **cohesive, actionable experience** across email, text, and in-app channels, helping Veterans quickly understand **what happened, what to do, and by when.**

### Where is your product situated on VA.gov
The notification system (**VA Notify**) is integrated across **VA.gov’s** benefits management ecosystem and the **VA Health and Benefits** mobile app, primarily supporting the **Claim Status Tool** and related benefits management features.

### What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool
Veterans are already familiar with receiving benefit notifications through **email and paper mail**. The unified cross-channel notification system is an **iteration on existing tools**, aimed at improving **clarity, consistency, and accessibility** across channels. It builds on familiar products but introduces new patterns for **in-app alerts and notification settings.**

## Veteran Journey

This research primarily supports Veterans during:

- **Taking Care of Myself** – managing ongoing disability compensation and appeals  
- **Putting Down Roots** – maintaining access to benefits and records for financial stability  

---

## Research Goals

1. Identify **channel and content boundaries**: what information belongs in text, email, and/or in-app notifications.  
2. Understand **how Veterans interpret and act on notifications**, including what elements encourage or hinder task completion.  
3. Explore **barriers, trust, and accessibility issues** across Veteran segments (e.g., older adults, low-vision users, paper-first users, cognitive deficits).  

---

## Outcome

This research will generate **evidence-based insights** to refine and strengthen existing VA notification and design guidance by:

- **Validating and expanding** current content standards across channels and benefit types.  
- **Filling gaps in tone and message structure guidance** to ensure clarity, trust, and consistency for Veterans.  
- **Identifying design and interaction patterns** that best support task completion and reduce confusion across digital benefit tools.  

These findings will inform the next iteration of the **Benefits Management Tools notifications experience**, directly contributing to improved usability, accessibility, and trust in digital benefit communications.

## Research Questions

1. How much content feels appropriate for a text versus an email when communicating about claims and appeals?  
2. How do Veterans decide which notification channel (text, email, in-app) to engage with first?  
3. What notification designs, tone, and structures best support successful task completion?  
4. What privacy or security concerns impact Veterans’ trust in text message notifications?  
5. How do accessibility needs, device use, or digital comfort impact Veterans’ experiences with notifications?  
6. How can tone and sequencing (e.g., text → email → in-app) best support multi-step tasks?  
7. How do timing and frequency affect Veterans’ engagement, understanding, and potential notification fatigue?  
8. How are Veterans currently receiving notifications regarding disability benefits?  
9. What do Veterans find helpful and unhelpful regarding notifications received in the past?  

---

## Hypotheses

- Veterans prefer **email** for official, detailed updates and **text messages** for urgent or time-sensitive alerts.  
- The **clarity of the call-to-action** (what happened, what to do, and by when) will significantly impact task completion.  
- **Friendly and plain language** builds trust, while **legal or bureaucratic tones** create confusion and anxiety.  
- **Privacy concerns** about text messages vary depending on content sensitivity (e.g., health vs. compensation updates).  
- **Accessibility needs** (e.g., low vision, screen readers, mobile use) will reveal unique barriers to interacting with notifications.

## Methodology

### Method
**Semi-structured interviews** with **scenario-based evaluations** of sample notifications.  
Participants will review and react to different notification examples across channels (text, email, in-app) to evaluate **clarity, tone, actionability, and trust.**

### Why this method
Semi-structured interviews allow participants to explain their reactions in context, uncovering **mental models, trust signals, and tone perceptions** that quantitative data can’t reveal.
