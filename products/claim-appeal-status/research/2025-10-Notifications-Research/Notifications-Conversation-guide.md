## 2. Introduction and Consent (5 min)

**Moderator Introduction**

> “Hi, thank you for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I will be moderating today's session.  
> [NOTETAKER] will be taking notes. We also have a few colleagues observing the session.  
>
> Today we’ll be talking about how Veterans and other claimants receive messages from the VA about their benefits. For example, notifications that tell you a decision has been made on your disability claim, or that the VA needs more information from you.  
>
> During today’s session, you’ll hear me use the word **‘channel.’** When I say channel, I mean the way the VA sends you a message — for example, by email, text message (SMS), or an in-app notification inside the VA Health and Benefits mobile app or VA.gov.  
>
> You’ll also hear me talk about **notifications** — a notification in this context refers to a message that the VA sends to let you know something important about your benefits. For example, an email, a text, or a mobile app(push) notification for the VA Health and Benefits app.  
>
> We’ll look at example notifications for each channel today, and we’ll talk about how clear they feel, what stands out to you, and how you’d prefer to get this kind of information.”  

- This session should take about 60 minutes.  
- There are no right or wrong answers; we’re interested in your honest thoughts.  
- Your participation is voluntary and won’t affect your VA benefits in any way.  
- You can stop or skip any question at any time.

**Consent & Recording**

- Are you okay with observers being present in the session?  
- Are you okay with us recording the screen and audio? (If yes, start recording and confirm.)  
- Are you comfortable with us sharing a short, anonymous clip of this session with VA partners for research purposes?

**Then:** Start recording, enable captions,welcome observers and allow short introduction and proceed.

## 3. Warm-Up Questions (~6 min)

**Objectives:** Build rapport, understand notification background and preferences.

**Prompts:**

- Rapport: *“How is your day going? Tell me a little about your past experience receiving notifications or messages from the VA.”*  
- How do you usually hear from VA about your benefits or claims? (paper mail, email, text, app)  
- In the past 6 months, have you received communication about a decision letter, evidence request, or claim status update?  
- Which device are you using to communicate with us today? What device do you typically use when reviewing information from VA?  
- When you receive a message from VA, what makes it feel important or urgent to you?  
- Do you ever feel like messages from VA come from different places or use different wording? What helps you know they are legitimate?

---

## 4. Screen Sharing (~2 min)

> “I just dropped a link in the Zoom chat. When you click it, it will open something called Figma.  
> Figma is just the tool we use to show design examples; it will open right in your web browser like a website.”

### If the participant is using a desktop or laptop

> “Once the page opens, please share your screen so I can see what you’re seeing. Here’s how to do that:”  
>  
> - Move your mouse to the bottom of the Zoom window.  
> - Click the green **Share Screen** button.  
> - Choose the screen or browser window where the Figma link is open.  
> - Then click the blue **Share** button in the bottom-right corner.”

*(Pause and confirm you can see their screen.)*

> “I can see your screen now. You should see an example message. I’ll guide you through where to click.”

### If the participant is using a mobile phone or tablet

> “When you tap the link in the chat, it might ask if you want to open it in an app called Figma or in your browser. You can choose browser.  
> Once it opens, you’ll see an example of a message we’ll be talking about. You can scroll or tap on the blue areas to move forward.”

## 5. Scenario 1: Decision Letter Notifications (~15 min)

### Set-up

> “Now I’d like you to imagine you’ve just received a notification from VA saying that a decision has been made on your disability claim. I will show you one example of that message in each channel: email, text, and mobile app(push) notification. After viewing each, we’ll talk about what you think about it and what you’d likely do next.”

### Show the Three Examples

**Email – Decision Letter**

- **Subject:** “Your VA claim decision is ready.”  
- **Body:**  
  > “Dear Sam,  
  > We’ve made a decision about your VA claim or review request. You can read and download your decision letter online or in our mobile app.  
  >  
  > Access your decision letter on VA.gov: {{link}}”

**Text Message – Decision Letter**

> “We’ve made a decision about your VA claim or review request. You can read and download your decision letter online: https://va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status  
>  
> Have questions? Call 800-287-1000 (TTY: 711). We’re here Monday–Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET.  
> Reply STOP to opt out.”

**Mobile App (Push) Notification – Decision Letter**

> “**VA Claims Update**  
> Your VA claims decision is ready.”

### Discussion Prompts (for each example)

- What’s your first reaction to this message?  
- On a scale of 1–5, how confident are you that you understand this message and know what you’re supposed to do next?  
- Was any aspect of this message (font, color, wording) hard to read or confusing?  
- On a scale of 1–5, how trustworthy does it feel? What about it makes you feel that way?  
- Is there anything missing here that you would normally look for to confirm the message is really from VA?

### Wrap-up of Scenario 1

- If you had to choose email, text, or mobile app(push) notification for this type of message, which would you choose and why?  
- Is there any aspect of the tone or format of these messages that felt off or confusing?

---

## 6. Scenario 2: Evidence Request Notifications (~20 min)

### Set-up

> “Now let’s look at another type of notification — one where VA needs more information from you (evidence request) to move your claim forward. Again, you’ll see one version in each channel.”

### Show the Three Examples

**Email – Evidence Request**

- **Subject:** “Submit information to continue your claim”  
- **Body:**  
  > “Dear {{Veteran First Name}},  
  > We need additional information to continue processing your claim. You can review this request online or in our mobile app.  
  >  
  > Respond to this request on VA.gov: {{link}}”

**Text Message – Evidence Request**

> “VA is reviewing your benefits claim. We need more information from you.  
> Learn about what we need and what steps to take: https://va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status  
>  
> Have questions? Call 800-287-1000 (TTY: 711). We’re here Monday–Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET.  
> Reply STOP to opt out.”

**Mobile App (Push) Notification – Evidence Request**

> “**VA Claims Update**  
> We need more information to continue processing your claim.”

### Discussion Prompts (for each example)

- What stands out to you about this message?  
- How urgent does it feel compared to the decision letter message?  
- On a scale of 1–5, how confident are you that you understand this message and know what you’re supposed to do next?  
- What should you do after reading this message?  
- How would you do it?  
- When does it need to be completed? How urgent does this message feel to you? 
- Was any aspect of this message (font, color, wording) hard to read or confusing?  
- On a scale of 1–5, how trustworthy does it feel? What about it makes you feel that way?  
- How would the device (phone, tablet, computer) you receive the notification on impact your ability to read, trust, or act on it?
- The text message says 'we need more information' but doesn't say what kind of information or why. Tell me what you think about that level of specificity?

### Wrap-up of Scenario 2

- If VA could use only one channel (email, text, or mobile app(push) notification) for this message, which would you choose and why?  
- If you got the same notification on your phone and by email, which would you look at first, and why?  
- How would you feel about VA sending you this type of message to all three channels (email, text, mobile app(push) notification)? Why?

## 7. Comparative Reflection (~10 min)

**Objective:** Compare the two notification types and channel preferences.

**Prompts:**

- When you think about both messages together, what differences stand out to you?  
- Did you notice any differences in language between channels? Did that affect how quickly you understood the message?  
- If you saw these two messages in your inbox without reading them carefully, what would help you instantly know which one needs urgent action vs. which one is just informational? Should they look or sound different?
- How would you expect the tone or level of detail to differ between these two types of notifications?
- For both of these types of messages imagine you receive a text message in the morning, then an email an hour later, and then see the same notification pushed to you on your cell phone in that afternoon. Walk me through how you'd respond. Which would you engage with first? Would receiving it multiple times feel helpful or overwhelming? 

**Text Message–Specific Reflection**

- If you wanted to stop getting text messages from VA about your benefits, what would you do?  
- What type of messages do you think this will stop?  
- How would you expect to start receiving them again if you changed your mind later?  
- How would you expect to be able to manage your VA notification preferences?  

**Safety and Privacy Reflection**

> “For some people, getting VA texts on a shared or visible device could create privacy risks.  
> Is there any situation where you think receiving text messages like these might put someone at risk, or make them feel unsafe?”

**Claim Status Notifications**

> “Claim status notifications are messages that update you on the progress of your benefits claim, for example, letting you know your claim has moved to a new step. These notifications don’t require any action; they’re just meant to keep you informed.”

- How interested are you in receiving regular claim status notifications like these?  
- How often would you want/expect to receive them?

---

## 8. Closing (~2–3 min)

- Thank you for your time and valuable feedback.  
- Is there anything we didn’t cover about how you receive messages from VA that you think is important?  
- As a reminder: your participation is voluntary, and your input helps us improve how VA communicates updates to Veterans.  
- **End session.**

## 9. Researcher Debrief Notes (Immediately after session)

- Notable reactions or quotes about trust, clarity, or channel preference.  
- Signs of confusion, fatigue, or frustration.  
- Accessibility issues or barriers observed/suggested.  
- Any channel-preference or message-style patterns.  
- Recommendations for refining future mock-ups or next-phase research.  


# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). <mark>**Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**</mark>
