# Conversation Guide

## **Benefits Management Notifications Study**

**Product / Team:** Benefits Management Tools (BMT 3) – Notifications  
**Date:** [ SESSION DATE ]  
**Moderator:** [ MODERATOR NAME ]  
**Note-taker:** [ NOTETAKER NAME ]  
**Session Duration:** ~60 minutes  
**Location:** Remote (via Zoom)  
**Recording:** Yes/No (as per consent)

## 1. Moderator Logistics (2–3 days before session)

- Review the VA Platform Research Checklist.  
- Confirm Zoom setup: screen share permissions, captioning enabled, device test.  
- Send observer instructions to any observers (via Slack channel `#feedback-backchannel`).  
- Mute your Slack notifications during the session.  
- Ensure the Veteran is provided instructions for sharing their screen.

## 2. Introduction and Consent (5 min)

### Moderator Introduction

> “Hi, thank you for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I will be moderating today's session. [NOTETAKER] will be taking notes. We also have a few colleagues observing the session.  
>
> Today we’ll be talking about how Veterans receive messages from the VA about their benefits. For example, notifications that tell you a decision has been made on your disability claim, or that the VA needs more information from you.  
>
> During today’s session, you’ll hear me use the word **‘channel’**. When I say channel, I mean the way VA sends you a message — for example, by **email**, **text message (SMS)**, or an **in-app notification** inside the VA Health and Benefits mobile app or VA.gov.  
>
> You'll also hear me talk about **notifications** — in this context, a notification is a message that the VA sends to let you know something important about your benefits, for example, an email, a text, or a message inside the VA Health and Benefits app.  
>
> We’ll look at example notifications of each channel today and we’ll talk about how clear they feel, what stands out to you, and how you’d prefer to get this kind of information.”

- This session should take about 60 minutes.  
- There are no right or wrong answers; we’re interested in your honest thoughts.  
- Your participation is voluntary and won’t affect your VA benefits in any way.  
- You can stop or skip any question at any time.

### Consent & Recording

- Are you okay with observers being present in the session?  
- Are you okay with us recording the screen and audio? (If yes, start recording and confirm.)  
- Are you comfortable with us sharing a short, anonymous clip of this session with VA partners for research purposes?

**Then:** Start recording, enable captions, and proceed.

## 3. Warm-Up Questions (~6 min)

**Objectives:** Build rapport, understand notification background and preferences.

**Prompts:**

1. How do you usually hear from the VA about your benefits or claims? (paper mail, email, text, app)  
2. In the past 6 months, have you received communication about a decision letter, evidence request, or claim status update?  
3. Which device are you using to communicate with us today? What device do you typically use when reviewing information from the VA?  
4. Do you use any assistive technologies or accessibility settings? (screen reader, large text, magnifier)  
5. When you receive a message from the VA, what makes it feel important or urgent to you?

---

## 4. Screen Sharing (~2 min)

> “I just dropped a link in the Zoom chat. When you click it, it will open something called Figma.  
> Figma is just the tool we use to show design examples — it will open right in your web browser like a website.”

### If the participant is using a desktop or laptop

> “Once the page opens, please share your screen so I can see what you’re seeing. Here’s how to do that:”

1. Move your mouse to the bottom of the Zoom window.  
2. Click the green **Share Screen** button.  
3. Choose the screen or browser window where the Figma link is open.  
4. Click the blue **Share** button in the bottom-right corner.

> “I can see your screen now. You should see an example message. I’ll guide you through where to click.”

### If the participant is using a mobile phone or tablet

> “When you tap the link in the chat, it might ask if you want to open it in an app called Figma or in your browser. You can choose browser.  
> Once it opens, you’ll see an example of a message we’ll be talking about. You can scroll or tap on the blue areas to move forward.”

## 5. Scenario 1: Decision Letter Notifications (~15 min)

### Set-up

> “Now I’d like you to imagine you’ve just received a notification from VA saying that a decision has been made on your disability claim. I will show you one example of that message in each channel: email, text, and in-app. After viewing each, we’ll talk about how you feel about it and what you’d likely do next.”

### Show the Three Examples

#### Email – Decision Letter

**Subject:** Your VA claim decision is ready.  

**Body:**  
Dear {{Veteran First Name}},  

We’ve made a decision about your VA claim or review request.  
You can read and download your decision letter online or in our mobile app.  

**Access your decision letter on VA.gov:** {{link}}

#### Text Message – Decision Letter

We’ve made a decision about your VA claim or review request.  
You can read and download your decision letter online:  
https://va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status

#### In-App Notification – Decision Letter

Your VA claims decision is ready. Tap to view.

### Discussion Prompts (for each example)

- What’s your first reaction to this message?  
- Let’s discuss clarity — from this message what do you think has happened and what should you do next?  
- How trustworthy does it feel? What about it makes you feel that way?  
- Which channel (email, text, in-app) feels easiest for you in this scenario? Why?  
- What would make this message better (clearer, more trustworthy, easier to act on)?

**Wrap-up of Scenario 1**

- If you had to choose one channel for this type of message, which would it be and why?  
- Is there any aspect of the tone or format of these messages that felt off or confusing?

---

## 6. Scenario 2: Evidence Request Notifications (~20 min)

### Set-up

> “Now let’s look at another type of notification, one where VA needs more information from you (evidence request) to move your claim forward. Again, you’ll see one version in each channel.”

### Show the Three Examples

#### Email – Evidence Request

**Subject:** Submit information to continue your claim.  

**Body:**  
Dear {{Veteran First Name}},  

We need additional information to continue processing your claim.  
You can review this request online or in our mobile app.  

**Respond to this request on VA.gov:** {{link}}

#### Text Message – Evidence Request

VA is reviewing your benefits claim. We need more information from you.  
Learn about what we need and what steps to take:  
https://va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status

#### In-App Notification – Evidence Request

Action needed: We need more information to continue processing your claim.

### Discussion Prompts (for each example)

- What stands out to you about this message?  
- How urgent does it feel compared to the decision letter message?  
- Is the next step clearly communicated — what you need to do, how to do it, and by when?  
- Which channel would you prefer for this kind of action-required message, and why?  
- How confident would you feel clicking or tapping a link in the message?  
- With your device and settings, how easy would it be to follow through (upload documents, meet deadline)?  
- What would make this message easier or more trustworthy?

**Wrap-up of Scenario 2**

- If VA could use only one channel for this message, which would you choose and why?  
- How would you feel about the VA sending you this type of message to all three channels? Why?

---

## 7. Comparative Reflection (~10 min)

**Objective:** Compare the two notification types and channel preferences.

**Prompts:**

- When you think about both messages together, what differences stand out to you?  
- Do these two messages feel like they each serve their purpose — decision letters to inform you and evidence requests to prompt action?  
- How would you expect the tone or level of detail to differ between these two types of notifications?  
- For decision letters, which channel or combination of channels feels most appropriate? Why?  
- For evidence requests, which channel or combination feels most effective? Why?  
- How could VA make sure both types of messages are clear and easy to understand for all Veterans?  
- If you could customize how you receive each type of message, what would your ideal setup look like?

---

## 8. Closing (~2–3 min)

- Thank you for your time and valuable feedback.  
- Is there anything we didn’t cover about how you receive messages from VA that you think is important?  
- As a reminder: your participation is voluntary and your input helps us improve how VA communicates updates to Veterans.  
- End session.
