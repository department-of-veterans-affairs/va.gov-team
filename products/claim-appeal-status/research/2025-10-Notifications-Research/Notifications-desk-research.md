## Research Goals
**Context:** This research audit evaluates existing research within the GitHub repository to create a unified understanding of identified opportunities to improve the notification experience across the Veteran's journey.

**Key moments this supports in the Veteran's journey:**
- Applying for benefits (disability compensation, education benefits)
- Managing ongoing care and benefits (prescriptions, appointments, claim status)
- Responding to VA requests (evidence submission, document uploads)
- Staying informed about benefit changes and deadlines

**Outcomes we're aiming to achieve:**
- Veterans receive timely, clear, and actionable notifications
- Veterans understand what actions to take after receiving notifications
- Veterans can easily manage their notification preferences
- Veterans trust and engage with VA communications
- Reduced support inquiries through better self-service

---

## Methodology

**Method:** Desk research (DR) / Review of existing research

This audit synthesized findings from 11 studies conducted between 2018-2025, including:
- **Usability testing** of notification settings and interfaces
- **User interviews** exploring notification preferences and experiences
- **Comparative research** reviewing notification best practices
- **Task-based studies** evaluating specific notification flows (e.g., evidence submission, paperless delivery)


---

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

### Hypothesis 1: Veterans prefer email notifications over other channels
**Definitely True**
- Email notifications are expected and the preferred method of receiving information across all studies reviewed
- Veterans value email because it's official, easy to save, and can be referenced later
- Supporting evidence from 7/2020, 3/2018, 7/2025 studies

### Hypothesis 2: Text messages enhance the experience but should not replace other notification channels
**Likely True**
- Text messages are valued for urgent, time-sensitive updates
- Concerns exist about privacy, findability, and information overload via text
- Veterans prefer text as a supplement, not a replacement for email
- Supporting evidence from 7/2020, 3/2018, 7/2025 studies

### Hypothesis 3: Veterans expect notifications to be actionable with clear next steps
**Definitely True**
- All participants across studies demonstrated ability to act when notifications included clear information about what happened, what to do, and by when
- Confirmation messages increase confidence and reduce anxiety
- Supporting evidence from 9/2021, 9/2024, 2/2025 studies

### Hypothesis 4: Veterans rarely manage notification settings proactively
**Definitely True**
- Veterans do not intuitively look in their profile to manage notifications
- Most update settings by unsubscribing via email links, not by logging in
- Supporting evidence from 7/2021 study

### Hypothesis 5: Redundancy in notifications is valued by Veterans
**Definitely True**
- All users mentioned redundancy as a welcomed and important feature
- Veterans prefer receiving notifications through multiple channels (email + text + in-app)
- Supporting evidence from 9/2021, 2/2025 studies

### Hypothesis 6: Electronic-only communication is preferred over mail
**Likely True**
- Majority of participants preferred electronic-only communication citing faster delivery and less risk of lost information
- Some Veterans may still need paper options
- Supporting evidence from 9/2024 study

### Hypothesis 7: Transparent timeline information reduces anxiety and builds trust
**Definitely True**
- When Veterans understand why there are delays and when they can expect their claim to move forward, they experience less anxiety even when waits are long. Conversely, unexplained delays erode trust.
- Tracked items research shows that 95% of "Development to Claimant" tracked items are non-actionable and take the full 30-day suspense period regardless of when evidence is submitted
- Veterans in 9/2024 study showed confusion about evidence waivers because they expected their prompt response to trigger faster processing
- General principle from research: "Keeping people informed is a good way to lower expectations, or lower anxiety" (3/2018 study)
---

## Key Findings

1. **Email is the preferred notification channel for most Veterans** because it feels official, can be saved for reference, and is expected as part of online transactions.

2. **Text messages are valued for urgent communications** but should supplement, not replace, email and in-app notifications due to privacy concerns and difficulty referencing later.

3. **Redundancy across channels builds trust and confidence** – Veterans appreciate receiving the same information via multiple methods (email, text, in-app).

4. **Clear, actionable notifications with direct links drive task completion** – When messages state what happened, what to do, by when, and include a direct link, Veterans are able to act confidently.

5. **Confirmation messages are critical for reducing anxiety** – Veterans expect confirmation when documents are received, settings are saved, or actions are completed.

6. **Veterans do not intuitively look in their profile to manage notification settings** – Most manage preferences by unsubscribing through email links rather than logging in to adjust settings.

7. **Auto-save patterns are strongly preferred over read/edit patterns** – All participants found auto-save interfaces easier and more intuitive for managing notification preferences.

8. **Certain notification content consistently causes confusion**, particularly around:
   - Evidence waiver purpose and implications
   - Which notification channels (email/text) are available for specific notification types
   - Confirmation placement when it appears in unexpected locations

9. **Veterans with disabilities face specific barriers** including cluttered pages, background-only alerts, and unclear icons that impact screen reader and low-vision users.

10. **Plain, calm, specific language reduces worry and builds trust** while legal-sounding or vague wording raises anxiety.
11. **System limitations create a gap between Veteran expectations and reality**

## Details of Findings

### Finding 1: Email is the preferred notification channel for most Veterans

**Description:** Across multiple studies spanning 2018-2025, email consistently emerged as the expected and preferred method for receiving VA notifications. Veterans value email for its official nature, ability to be saved and referenced later, and familiarity as part of online transactions.

**Supporting data:**
- "Lately I've been signing in about once every two or three days to check on a current disability claim I have. If the status changed and I automatically got an email or text then I could go look to see what the status is." – P5, 7/2020 study
- "The email, definitely - that's where I get anything important." – Paperless Delivery study, 7/2025
- All participants in the 7/2020 disability compensation study were interested in receiving emails throughout their application experience either in addition to or in place of existing paper letters

**Context:** This preference held consistent across all benefit types studied (disability compensation, health care, education benefits) and all participant demographics.

---

### Finding 2: Text messages are valued for urgent communications but should supplement, not replace, other channels

**Description:** While text messages are appreciated for time-sensitive updates and urgent alerts, Veterans have concerns about privacy, findability, and the difficulty of referring back to text messages later. Text should be used strategically to complement email and in-app notifications.

**Supporting data:**
- "I could print out or save an email if I need to refer back to it. Whereas text messages are more instant and I like seeing that, but it is probably not something I would depend on to keep or refer back to in the future. After I get so many text messages on my phone I end up deleting them." – P6, 7/2020 study
- "Not a text message, this is an awful lot to put in a text message. An email I can refer back to, I'd be perfectly happy receiving it that way." – P8, 7/2020 study
- "I honestly prefer a text notification… if it's just in my email, the odds of that thing getting lost in there…" – Paperless Delivery study, 7/2025
- "If that text message got sent to somebody that it shouldn't... now they potentially have your information..." – 3/2018 study

**Context:** Text messages work best for simple, urgent alerts that prompt Veterans to check their email or log in for more details.

---

### Finding 3: Redundancy across channels builds trust and confidence

**Description:** Veterans explicitly value receiving the same information through multiple channels (email, text, and in-app). This redundancy is not seen as annoying but rather as a feature that ensures they don't miss important information and provides backup options for accessing communications.

**Supporting data:**
- All users in the 9/2021 Action Items study mentioned redundancy as a welcomed and important feature
- In the 2/2025 Document Status study, all 7 participants recognized that the upload failure notification email directly corresponds to the failure alerts displayed in the Claim Status Tool: "The email just tells me that I have a notice, if I correct. VA.gov tells me exactly what that notice is." – P8

**Context:** This finding contradicts common assumptions about notification fatigue and suggests Veterans prefer over-communication to under-communication for important benefit information. 

**Why redundancy matters even more than we thought:** The tracked items research reveals that the VA system has inherent delays where evidence sits unprocessed even when submitted on time. In this context, redundant notifications serve as proof-of-receipt and help Veterans know their action was actually captured by the system, not lost in a 30-day suspense period.

---

### Finding 4: Clear, actionable notifications with direct links drive task completion

**Description:** Veterans are most likely to complete tasks when notifications clearly state what happened, what action is needed, the deadline, and include a direct link to take action. This pattern was consistent across different task types including evidence submission, document uploads, and settings management.

**Supporting data:**
- Users in the 9/2021 study were able to easily understand the amount of information shown in an alert and how to take action
- In the 2/2025 Document Status study, all participants knew they needed to resubmit failed documents after receiving a failure notification: "I would go ahead and print out my evidence and mail it in. Or I would go to my regional office." – P10
- Veterans reported high confidence (average 4.7/5) in their ability to submit documents successfully due to clear instructions: "...every step is very descriptive. You have all the information you need. Never did I feel like one of my questions or concerns wasn't answered by following along with the process." – P4, 2/2025 study
- **Notable Caveat:** However, the tracked items research reveals a critical gap: actionable notifications must align with system capabilities. Veterans can take action quickly, but if the system doesn't respond to their timely action (as with non-actionable tracked items), this creates a trust gap. Notifications should set accurate expectations about what will happen after the Veteran acts, including any system-imposed wait times.
Example: Instead of "Submit your evidence waiver to move your claim forward" → "Submit your evidence waiver by [date]. Once we receive it, we'll process your claim within 30 days of the original request date."

**Context:** The combination of clear messaging + actionable next steps + direct links was the winning pattern across all task types studied.

---

### Finding 5: Confirmation messages are critical for reducing anxiety

**Description:** Veterans consistently expect and need confirmation messages when they complete actions (submit documents, change settings, complete waivers). The absence of clear confirmation creates doubt and anxiety, while timely confirmation builds trust and confidence in the system.

**Supporting data:**
- "'Update saved' makes me feel like something happened." – 2/2023 study
- "It's notifying me that it's been saved. I'm trusting that this is going to work and I don't need to call." – 2/2023 study
- 7 of 7 participants in the 2/2025 Document Status study expected VA to send a confirmation email once their physical documents were received: "To confirm: Call us. Oh. I don't like that at all. Preferably I'd get an email that says we received it and your claim status has been updated." – P10
- "Keeping people informed is a good way to lower expectations, or lower anxiety." – 3/2018 study

**Context:** Confirmation messages serve both functional (proof that action was completed) and emotional (reduced anxiety) purposes.

**System context: ** The tracked items research shows that evidence submitted early often sits unprocessed until the suspense date expires. This makes confirmation messages even more critical – they're the only signal Veterans have that their evidence was received and properly associated with their claim, even if the claim isn't moving forward yet.

**Recommendation:** Confirmation messages should explicitly state:
- Evidence was received
- Evidence was associated with the correct claim/tracked item
- What happens next and when (even if it means waiting for the suspense period to complete)

---

### Finding 6: Veterans do not intuitively look in their profile to manage notification settings

**Description:** Veterans struggle to find notification settings in their VA.gov profile and rarely proactively manage these settings. Instead, most Veterans manage notifications reactively by clicking unsubscribe links in emails rather than logging in to adjust preferences.

**Supporting data:**
- When asked where they would look for notification settings, participants guessed locations like "under health care" or "refill and track your prescriptions" or the search function – not the profile – 7/2021 study
- "Probably under health care. I would say under refill and track your prescriptions. or, I guess, the other thing I could do if I didn't find it there, I'd probably go up into the search block." – 7/2021 study
- Many update settings by unsubscribing via email links, not by logging in – 7/2021 study

**Context:** This suggests notification settings need better discoverability and possibly proactive prompts when Veterans first sign up for notifications.

---

### Finding 7: Auto-save patterns are strongly preferred over read/edit patterns

**Description:** When tested side-by-side, all participants found auto-save interfaces easier and more intuitive than traditional read/edit patterns for managing notification preferences. The absence of a save button did not cause confusion when accompanied by clear feedback messages.

**Supporting data:**
- "This [autosave prototype] is a lot simpler. It's just easy, it just saves it and does it. I can quickly see that I don't have it on and I can just turn it on." – 2/2023 study
- "Instead of saying edit, it [autosave prototype] has the checkboxes right here which is infinitely better." – 2/2023 study
- No participants were confused by the absence of a save button; feedback messages (e.g., 'Update saved') reassured users that their preferences had been updated

**Context:** This finding supports moving away from traditional form patterns for settings management in favor of more modern, streamlined interfaces.

---

### Finding 8: Certain notification content consistently causes confusion

**Description:** Despite generally positive feedback on notification clarity, specific elements repeatedly caused confusion across studies: the purpose and implications of evidence waivers, which notification channels are available for different notification types, and where confirmation messages appear after completing actions.

**Supporting data:**
- **Evidence waiver confusion:** "Mostly the page is pretty self-explanatory, just more clarification around what the evidence waiver is and how that plays into the process" – P13, 9/2024 study; "Thinks that after he submits waiver, the claim will be 'locked' and that he won't be able to submit more evidence" – P5, 9/2024 study
- **Channel availability confusion:** "That was not clear to me. I don't like that. If you are going to give me the option, give me the option – don't limit my options." – 7/2021 study; "The VA just didn't make it an option on the website. I don't know why not. It seems like if they can do prescriptions [updates] and you get text or email option, you should probably get a text or email option for appointments too." – 7/2021 study
- **Confirmation placement confusion:** "The confirmation being in the files tab is weird because the waiver asserts you are done uploading evidence. But seeing the files upload and content about upload is confusing." – P9, 9/2024 study

**Context:** These confusion points represent opportunities for targeted improvements in content clarity and interface design.

**Evidence waiver confusion has a system root cause:**
- The tracked items research confirms that 5103 waivers are non-actionable tracked items – meaning even when Veterans submit them early, their claim doesn't move forward until the full 30-day suspense period expires
- Veteran confusion identified in the 9/2024 study ("Thinks that after he submits waiver, the claim will be 'locked'") reflects an accurate intuition that something doesn't work as expected
- Quote from tracked items research: "Vets would like to see get their claim moving faster, and it seems they're already under the impression that it's supposed to, but it doesn't. This negatively impacts Veteran trust and satisfaction."

**Content Recommendation: **Waiver notifications should transparently explain the 30-day wait period and when Veterans can expect their claim to move forward, rather than implying immediate action.
---

### Finding 9: Veterans with disabilities face specific barriers

**Description:** Screen reader and low-vision users encountered specific usability challenges including cluttered pages, background-only alert patterns, unclear icons, and repeated prompts that created visual noise.

**Supporting data:**
- Some visual clutter was noted, especially with repeated prompts to add an email address – 2/2023 study
- The background-only alert pattern and icons could confuse some users, especially those with low vision – 2/2023 study
- "It would be better if the highlight didn't go the full width of this thing and only highlighted the text..." – Low vision user, 2/2023 study
- However, when done well, assistive tech users appreciated the experience: "The feedback I was getting from this prototype was right on point." – Screenreader user, 2/2023 study

**Context:** These barriers are addressable through careful attention to accessibility best practices and testing with assistive technology users.

---

### Finding 10: Plain, calm, specific language reduces worry and builds trust

**Description:** The tone of notifications significantly impacts Veteran perception and confidence. Plain, calm, specific language reduces anxiety and builds trust, while legal-sounding or vague wording raises concerns and creates barriers to action.

**Supporting data:**
- "This gives me more confidence in working with the VA, unlike right now where I'm working with a VSO." – P1, 9/2024 study commenting on clear, straightforward notice language
- "Very straightforward and helpful: dates letter sent. Deadline to wait for process claims." – P12, 9/2024 study
- Participants in multiple studies valued concise, targeted communication over lengthy explanations
- Friendly confirmations like "Update saved" help people feel confident – 2/2023 study

**Context:** Tone should be adapted based on the situation (FYI vs. urgent vs. compliance-required) while maintaining clarity and respect.

### Finding 11: System limitations create a gap between Veteran expectations and reality
**Description:** The VA benefits system has inherent processing delays that are invisible to Veterans. Non-actionable tracked items don't trigger claim movement even when evidence is submitted promptly. This system behavior contradicts Veteran expectations that timely responses will expedite their claims, creating opportunities for notification design to bridge this gap.
**Supporting data:
**
- 95% of "Development to Claimant" tracked items (780,127 items from Oct '22 - May '23) are non-actionable and take the full 30-day suspense period regardless of when evidence arrives "If the associated evidence comes in on day 2, the claim will sit for 28 more days"
- 90% of Veterans, when asked, want to close tracked items sooner
- Evidence waiver confusion in 9/2024 study reflects accurate Veteran intuition that the system doesn't work as they expect

**Context:** This represents a significant opportunity for notification design to either (1) set accurate expectations about processing timelines, or (2) advocate for system changes that would allow notifications to trigger faster claim movement.

**Design/ Research Recommendations:**
- Notifications should include transparent timeline information
- Consider multi-stage notifications: "Evidence received" + "Claim moving forward"
- Avoid language that implies immediate action when system delays exist
- Test whether honest communication about delays maintains or erodes trust

## Additional Insights

### System-Level Context
**How the Backend System Impacts the Notification Experience**
The tracked items research reveals critical system limitations that directly impact the notification experience Veterans have:

**Non-actionable tracked items create false expectations**
- When Veterans submit evidence early (e.g., a 5103 waiver on day 2 of a 30-day period), the system doesn't recognize it, and their claim sits idle for the remaining 28 days
- This creates a trust gap: Veterans expect their timely response to move their claim forward, but it doesn't
- This explains why Veterans in the 9/2024 study expressed confusion about evidence waivers and what happens after submission

**Evidence association is manual and invisible to Veterans**
- Evidence can only be automatically associated with tracked items if uploaded via the specific "document upload" page in CST
- Evidence uploaded via other methods (general files tab, mail, fax) requires manual VSR association
- Impact on notifications: This may explain why confirmation notifications are so critical – Veterans have no visibility into whether their evidence was properly associated with the right request

**The 90% who want faster processing aren't getting it
**
- Research shows "90% of the time when Vets are asked if they want to close out a tracked item like this sooner, they say yes"
- This supports Finding 6 about electronic communication preference and adds urgency to notification timing research

### High-volume users need granular control
- Accredited representatives (2/2024 study) valued being able to control which notifications they receive and desired the ability to turn them on/off. While this study wasn't with Veterans, it suggests that power users dealing with high notification volumes need fine-grained control options.

### Electronic communication is preferred for speed and reliability
- The majority of participants in the 9/2024 development letter study preferred electronic-only communication for benefit notifications, with quotes like: "Would prefer only electronic communications for development letters 'it takes forever to get something from the VA through the mail...its ridiculous'" – P8

### Participants expect to act directly from notifications
- Best practices research (12/2022) emphasized that "where possible, enable users to act directly from the notification (e.g., via email)" – suggesting opportunities to embed more interactive elements in email notifications.

## Further research needed


### Timing and frequency gaps
- Best time of day, day of week for different types of notifications
- How far in advance Veterans prefer to be notified of deadlines
- Optimal spacing between initial notification and reminders
- At what point does notification frequency become overwhelming?
- If Veterans knew their evidence would sit for 30 days regardless of when they submit it, would they still prefer to submit early? Why or why not?
- How should notifications communicate suspense periods and why claims don't move forward immediately when evidence arrives early?
- Would Veterans prefer a notification when their evidence is received AND another notification when the suspense period ends and their claim moves forward?

### Evidence Submission 
- What causes evidence rejection/resubmission?
- Biggest barriers to evidence submission?
  
### Notification Channel Nuances 
- For different types of tasks, would you prefer email, text, or both? Why?
- How much information is too much in a text message?
- What are your privacy concerns about text notifications?
- Do Veterans want to know about tracked item suspense periods and system processing delays?
- What language would help Veterans understand these delays without eroding trust?
- Should notifications differentiate between "evidence received and waiting for processing" vs. "evidence processed and claim moving forward"?
  
### System transparency and trust
- How much do Veterans want to know about VA internal processes vs. just outcomes?
- Does knowing about system limitations (like non-actionable tracked items) help or hurt trust?
- What's the right balance between "your claim is processing" and "your claim is waiting in queue for 30 days"?
