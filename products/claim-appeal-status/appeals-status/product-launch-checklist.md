# Product Launch Checklist for Contact Centers

We need to identify who are all the contact centers we contact about our new product and how to use it. 

## Contact Center
- HRC (Sylvia.Palmer@va.gov) 
- VBA (Regina.Yount@va.gov, Jennifer.Rudisill@va.gov, Frank.Bryceland@va.gov)
- The Board at Wilkes-Barre (laurie.walkowiak@va.gov)

## Why the distinction between the contact centers matter

We have created a logic so that a specific contact center number is shown on the Need help information side bar depending on where the appeal is currently being adjurisdicted.

## Things worth noting

- In the fall of 2017, Brianne Ogilvie, who at the time was in charge of the Board Call Center mentioned that the National Call Center will be taking over Board calls. Gina talked to Theo Casey (Theophilos.Casey@va.gov), the new POC for Board calls on March 6, 2018 and it looks like this has been delayed and will not be happening for a while. 
- Denise Kitt (Denise.Kitts@va.gov) from the Veteran Experience team is working with the White House Call Center and is mentioned using the appeals status API for their current CRM tool.
