## Product Context, Portfolio, and Artifacts

### Portfolio Context

#### Claim Status Tool  
The Claim Status Tool allows Veterans to check the status of their VA claims, decision reviews, or appeals online.  
Users can view details such as evidence submitted, additional evidence requested by VA, claim types, and specific issues claimed.  
Additionally, Veterans can upload supporting documents for initial claims and download decision letters for certain types of claims, decision reviews, and appeals.

#### VA Benefits Letters  
Through the VA Benefits Letters application, Veterans can access and download various official VA letters and documents, including the Benefit Summary Letter (often referred to as a VA award letter).  
This tool provides Veterans with immediate access to their benefits information, which can be useful for verifying service history, disability ratings, and other benefits-related detail.

#### Rated Disabilities  
The Rated Disabilities tool enables Veterans to view their combined disability rating as well as individual disability ratings online.  
These ratings are assigned based on the severity of disabilities related to military service and are crucial in determining the benefits Veterans receive.  
By accessing this tool, Veterans can stay informed about their disability evaluations and ensure they are receiving appropriate benefits.

# BMT2 Initiatives – File Links

Below are the initiatives worked on during the contract, with links to their respective documentation or files.

## 1. Your VA Letters and Documents

[VA Letters and Documents Page - Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/CST%20Product/VA%20Letters%20and%20Documents.md)

## 2. Evidence Request Improvements

[Process for Updating Evidence Requests with Plain Language](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/evidence-requests-pattern/updating-evidence-requests.md)

[Evidence Requests Pattern Release Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/evidence-requests-pattern/release-plan.md)

## 3. Supplemental Claim (Discovery Phase)


## 4. Payments History – Suppressed 3rd Party Payments


## 5. Pension Claims Modernization (8-Step Workflow)


## 6. Intent to File
For the Intent to File (ITF) discovery phase, the team investigated how Veterans currently check their ITF status and identified significant usability gaps on VA.gov and in the Claims Status Tool (CST). They reviewed existing ITF workflows, upstream data sources (VBMS and Lighthouse ITF API), and confirmed there was no direct, user-friendly way for Veterans to see if an ITF was active or when it expired. The team gathered pain points from Veteran research, Reddit feedback, and contact center insights, revealing confusion around ITF timelines, expiration dates, and the association between ITFs and claims. They explored design concepts for displaying ITF information in CST, including scenarios for active, expired, and multiple ITFs, as well as empty states for education. They documented potential risks, and technical dependencies. This discovery work laid the foundation for a UI solution to make ITF status transparent and actionable for Veterans.
