## Current Status
### 03/08/2024
The bulk of the work has been completed for this endpoint. We have been at 100% for several months now and most of the UI code needed to support the EVSS claims list response has been removed from `vets-website`.

#### Next Steps
The feature toggle used in `vets-website` should be ready for removal soon. I'm planning on removing this once the UI code removal for EVSS claim details has been completed to make sure that there is no left over code that has been missed. Once this is complete and we have verified that the other teams are ready, the EVSS claims code in `vets-api` will also be ready to be removed
