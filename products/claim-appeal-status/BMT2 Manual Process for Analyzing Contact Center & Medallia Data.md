# BMT2 Manual Process for Analyzing Contact Center & Medallia Data

## Step 1 – Categorize Contact Center Data
The team reviewed raw Contact Center feedback logs and began categorizing entries. Each piece of feedback was tagged with labels such as:
- **Pain Points** – recurring issues or barriers experienced by Veterans.
- **Opportunities** – potential enhancements or areas for improvement.

## Step 2 – Team Synthesis Discussions
BMT2 members met to share observations and discuss patterns emerging from the labeled data. These discussions helped:
- Validate identified issues.
- Merge similar themes.
- Highlight initial priority areas.

## Step 3 – Cross-Check with Medallia Data
The team reviewed Medallia survey responses to identify any overlap or consistency with Contact Center themes. This ensured:
- Alignment between call center-reported pain points and survey-based Veteran feedback.
- Early detection of big, emerging themes across both sources.

## Step 4 – Prioritize by Frequency & Recurrence
Themes were ranked based on how often they occurred in both data sets. This provided:
- A clear picture of the most widespread pain points.
- Quantitative backing for prioritization decisions.

## Step 5 – Evaluate Feasibility & Impact
The team discussed each high-frequency theme, considering:
- **Feasibility** – technical or operational ease of implementing changes.
- **Impact** – potential benefit to Veterans and alignment with VA goals.

This resulted in a **final prioritized list of initiatives** to address first.
