## Benefits Management Tools Monitoring Handbook

## Monitoring

The enumerated monitors below (see ‚ÄúMonitors‚Äù sections below) are configured to send alerts to the #benefits-alerts-notifications and #benefits-management-tools-notifications channels in VA‚Äôs Slack.  The former channel contains alerts from all benefits teams, including our own.  The latter channel contains alerts from our Benefits Management Tools apps only.  We have a rotating Monitor Triage Duty role (see ‚ÄúMonitor Triage Duty‚Äù below) to monitor this latter channel.

### Monitor Triage Duty

Every sprint, at least one engineer is assigned to monitor the #benefits-decision-reviews-notifications channel and triage any alerts that pop up during the sprint.  That engineer‚Äôs monitor triage work is represented by a ticket like [this one](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/77054).  Please note the description in the linked ticket.  The goal of monitor triage is _not_ to immediately resolve any bugs that arise.  Rather, the goal is to conduct a preliminary investigation to determine whether no follow up is necessary, or if follow up is necessary, to draft a ticket to be discussed and prioritized at the next standup (see ‚ÄúCreating a Bug Ticket‚Äù below).  Traditionally, we have assigned 2 points to this ticket.

During that duty, it is important to respond promptly to any alerts and keep VA stakeholders informed of our investigations.  To indicate that you are looking into an alert, react to the alert with an üëÄ emoji.  If the alert was a false alarm, or otherwise resolved, react to the alert with an ‚úÖ emoji, and leave an explanatory comment.  Here is [an example](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05UPRR0HK3/p1710712459247059).  If you end up creating a follow-up ticket, post a link to the ticket in the alert‚Äôs thread, and leave any other notes you think our VA stakeholders may find helpful.

Towards the end of an engineer‚Äôs monitor triage duty, they should create a triage duty ticket for the next sprint if one hasn‚Äôt already been created.  Ideally, a different engineer should be assigned to the next triage duty.

### Types of Alerts

We have two types of alerts:  traffic anomaly alerts and error alerts.  

There are two types of traffic anomaly alerts:  low traffic alerts, and anomaly alerts.  Low traffic alerts are based on a lower threshold.  That lower threshold was originally estimated by looking at historical expected traffic over weekends and other periods of expectedly low traffic.  The anomaly alerts are a bit more complicated, but basically, they ask whether a certain percentage of traffic within a set time period is two standard deviations above or below the volume of traffic during that same time period, on that same day, in previous weeks.

We started out with low traffic alerts and then began trialing anomaly alerts some time ago.  I‚Äôve kept the low traffic alerts around as a check against the anomaly alerts.  There may come a time in the future where we feel confident enough with the anomaly alerts to formally deprecate the low traffic alerts.

Error alerts are triggered when the number of errors related to some kind of action are above a certain threshold.  Usually, that threshold is one.

### How to Triage Alerts

#### Traffic Anomalies

When investigating a traffic anomaly, you should consider the following factors: the time of day, the day of the week, whether it was a holiday or otherwise special day, whether traffic was anomalously high or low, what traffic has looked like on that same day at that same time in previous weeks and months, whether there were any known outages or maintenance windows during that time, whether we recently pushed any code, whether the drop in traffic corresponded with the daily deploy, and the length of the anomaly.  This is a non-exhaustive list.

#### Errors

Every error is different, but here are some general tips for investigating error alerts.  First, use the click and drag function to highlight the narrow time range where the error occurred, and pin that time in DataDog.  Then, go to the dashboard corresponding to the alert and track down relevant charts, and especially any log widgets.

You can oftentimes find the backtrace for an error by clicking on a log‚Äôs ‚Äútrace‚Äù tab, clicking ‚ÄúView Trace Details,‚Äù and then clicking ‚ÄúErrors.‚Äù

Many logs contain a user_uuid that you can use to find related errors in Sentry (via the `user.id` parameter).

### Google Analytics

We're transitioning to DataDog more and more over Google Analytics, however we still track the types of [downloads](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-events/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20230101&_u.date01=20240402&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&_r.drilldown=analytics.eventCategory:Interactions,analytics.eventAction:PDF%20Downloaded%20-%20Download%20Claim%20Letter%20(PDF)/) that occur within the DDL in Google Analytics.
