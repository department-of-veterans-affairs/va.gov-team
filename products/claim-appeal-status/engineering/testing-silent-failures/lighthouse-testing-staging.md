# How to Test Lighthouse Silent Failure Work in Staging

## Upload success when `cst_send_evidence_submission_failure_emails` is enabled
### Testing uploading a file in the CST
1. Make sure you have ArgoCD Access
    1. If you dont have access you can go to [this](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=external-request%2Cplatform-tech-team-support%2Cops-access-request&projects=&template=vetsapi-argo-terminal-access.yaml&title=Vets-api+terminal+access+for+%5Bindividual%5D) link and create a github ticket to get access
2. Make sure you have SOCKS ACCESS
    1. If you dont have access you can go to [this](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/engineering/onboarding/socks-and-sentry-access.md#how-to-get-socks-access)
    2. Make sure to Open an SSH tunnel after getting SOCKS access details in the link above
3. Go to [ArgoCD](https://argocd.vfs.va.gov ) and login
4. Search for the project `vets-api-staging`
5. Selected a pod with `vets-api-web` and select `Exec`
6. A new screen will open up with a terminal, type in `bundle exec rails c` (this will load the rails console)
7. 14. Run `EvidenceSubmission.count` and note how many records there are
8. Change the following feature flags...
    1. `benefits_documents_use_lighthouse` is enabled
    2. `cst_synchronous_evidence_uploads` is disabled
    3. `cst_send_evidence_submission_failure_emails` is enabled
9. Go to Staging and log into a user that has a claim.
10. Select a claim from the claim status tool list, navigate to the Files Tab and upload a file
11. Afterwards go back to [ArgoCD](https://argocd.vfs.va.gov ) and login
12. Search for the project `vets-api-staging`
13. Selected a pod with `vets-api-web` and select `Exec`
14. A new screen will open up with a terminal, type in `bundle exec rails c` (this will load the rails console)
15. Run `EvidenceSubmission.count` you should see the additional record added to your count
    1. To find your specific record you can do `EvidenceSubmission.last` OR `EvidenceSubmission.where(claim_id: <YOUR_CLAIM_ID)` OR `EvidenceSubmission.where(claim_id: <YOUR_CLAIM_ID>, tracked_item_id: <YOUR_TRACKED_ITEM_ID>)`
    2. The new records `upload_status` should be **IN_PROGRESS**

### Testing the lighthouse document upload status polling job
1. Perform steps 1-14 noted in the [Testing uploading a file in the CST](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/engineering/testing-silent-failures/lighthouse-testing-staging.md#testing-uploading-a-file-in-the-cst)
2. Within the ArgoCD terminal using rails console run the following commands to run the lighthouse document upload status polling job...
    1. NOTE: If you dont run this manually it is set up to run hourly
    ```
    // Find your evidence submission passing in your claim id and tracked item id if necessary
    es = EvidenceSubmission.find_by(claim_id: <YOUR_CLAIM_ID>, tracked_item_id: <YOUR_TRACKED_ITEM_ID>)
    es //run this to see the current evidence submission id
    
    // Check the current upload_status
    es.upload_status
    
    // Check the current delete_date
    es.delete_date
    
    // Run this command to run the document upload status polling job that updates the records upload_status
    Lighthouse::EvidenceSubmissions::EvidenceSubmissionDocumentUploadPollingJob.perform_async
    
    // Run this to verify that the records is upload_status has changed
    EvidenceSubmission.where(id: <YOUR_EVIDENCE_SUBMISSION_ID>).upload_status // should return SUCCESS
    
    // Should also see that there is now a delete_date
    EvidenceSubmission.where(id: <YOUR_EVIDENCE_SUBMISSION_ID>).delete_date // should NOT be nil
    ```
3. The record should have a `delete_date` and `upload_status` of **SUCCESS**

### Testing the delete evidence submission record job 
1. Perform steps 1-3 noted in the [Testing the lighthouse document upload status polling job](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/engineering/testing-silent-failures/lighthouse-testing-staging.md#testing-the-lighthouse-document-upload-status-polling-job)
2. Run the following commands to change the record to have an earlier delete_date and run the delete evidence submission record cron job...
    1. NOTE: If you dont run this manually it is set up to run daily
    ```
    // Find your evidence submission passing in your claim id and tracked item id if necessary
    es = EvidenceSubmission.find_by(claim_id: <YOUR_CLAIM_ID>, tracked_item_id: <YOUR_TRACKED_ITEM_ID>)
    es //run this to see the current  evidence submission id
    
    // Check the current delete_date
    es.delete_date
    
    // Update the delete_date to be a date that has passed. If you do the current date it wont be picked up until the date is in the past.
    es.update(delete_date: "<NEW_DATE>")
    
    // Run this command to run the delete evidence submission record job that deletes records
    Lighthouse::EvidenceSubmissions::DeleteEvidenceSubmissionRecordsJob.perform_async

    // Run this to verify that the record is deleted, nothing should come up
    EvidenceSubmission.where(id: <YOUR_EVIDENCE_SUBMISSION_ID>) // should return 0 results
    ```
3. Your record should now be deleted

## Upload failure for type 1 and 2 when cst_send_evidence_submission_failure_emails is enabled
1. Perform steps 1-14 noted in the [Testing uploading a file in the CST](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/engineering/testing-silent-failures/lighthouse-testing-staging.md#testing-uploading-a-file-in-the-cst)
2. Within the ArgoCD terminal using rails console run the following commands to change the record to a failure and run the document upload failure email cron job...
   1. NOTE: If you dont run this manually it is set up to run daily
   ```
   // Find your evidence submission passing in your claim id and tracked item id if necessary
   es = EvidenceSubmission.find_by(claim_id: <YOUR_CLAIM_ID>, tracked_item_id: <YOUR_TRACKED_ITEM_ID>)

   // Create a new personalisation with a date_failed
   new_personalisation = JSON.parse(es.template_metadata)['personalisation']
   new_personalisation['date_failed'] = "<YOUR_DESIRED_DATE>" // Example: "February 12, 2025 4:47 p.m. EST"
   
   // Update your evidence submission record template_metadata with a new personalisation
   es.update(template_metadata: { personalisation: new_personalisation }.to_json)
   
   // Update your evidence submission record from a successful record to a failed record
   // Set the acknowledgement_date and failed_date to a date that you want (if your hoping to run the failure email job next          // consider setting the failed_date to es.created_at date so that the job will process your record
   es.update(upload_status: 'FAILED', delete_date: nil, acknowledgement_date: <DESIRED_DATE>, failed_date: <DESIRED_DATE>,            error_message: 'EVSS::DocumentUpload document upload failure')

   // After the update check each field to make sure it is updated correctly

   // If you have an ICN in staging, look up your account id using your icn and update the evidence submission record with your       // account id. This will make it so that when we run the failure email cron job, you will receive the email
   account_id = UserAccount.find_by(icn: "<YOUR_ICN>").id
   es.update(user_account_id: account_id)
   ```
3. You should now have a record with a FAILED upload_status, a nil delete_date, an acknowledgement_date, a failed_date, an error_message and a template_metadata -> personalisation -> date_failed
4. Within the ArgoCD terminal using rails console run the following commands to update the User Account ID on a record and to run the document upload failure email cron job...
    1. NOTE: If you dont run this manually it is set up to run daily
    ```
    // If you have an ICN in staging, look up your account id using your icn and update the evidence submission record with your account id
    // This will make it so that when we run the failure email cron job, you will receive the email
    account_id = UserAccount.find_by(icn: "<YOUR_ICN>").id
    es.update(user_account_id: account_id)
    
    // Run this command to run the failure notification email job that sends a document upload failure email to a user or wait for     // 24 hours for the job to run automatically
    Lighthouse::EvidenceSubmissions::FailureNotificationEmailJob.perform_async
    
    // Look up your evidence submission record and you should see your record now has a va_notify_id and and a va_notify_date
    ```
5. If you changed the User Account ID of the evidence submission record then you should expect to receive a document upload failure notification email

### Query for mass updating records from SUCCESS to FAILED for Ligthhouse
1. Add uploads to stating
2. Within the ArgoCD terminal using rails console run the following commands to change multiple records to a failure...
   ```
   // Check number of records created today for Lighthouse (BenefitsDocuments::Service)
   EvidenceSubmission.where(upload_status: 'SUCCESS', job_class: 'BenefitsDocuments::Service', created_at: Time.zone.now.beginning_of_day..Time.zone.now.end_of_day).count

   // Note the # of failed records
   EvidenceSubmission.failed.count

   // Add limit to only grab a certain # of those records for Lighthouse (BenefitsDocuments::Service) and update them to be failed
   // Copy and paste all of this into rails c and it should work
   evidence_submissions = EvidenceSubmission.where(upload_status: 'SUCCESS', job_class: 'BenefitsDocuments::Service', created_at: Time.zone.now.beginning_of_day..Time.zone.now.end_of_day).limit(5)
   evidence_submissions.all.each do | es |
       new_personalisation = JSON.parse(es.template_metadata)['personalisation']
       new_personalisation['date_failed'] = new_personalisation['date_submitted']
       es.update(template_metadata: { personalisation: new_personalisation }.to_json, upload_status: 'FAILED', delete_date: nil, acknowledgement_date: es.created_at + 30.days, failed_date: es.created_at, error_message: 'EVSS::DocumentUpload document upload      failure')
   end

   // Note the # of failed records increased by 5
   EvidenceSubmission.failed.count
   ```
