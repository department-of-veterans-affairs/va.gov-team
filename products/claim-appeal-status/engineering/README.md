## Letters

To receive some benefits, Veterans need a letter proving their status. This service allows VA users to access and download their VA Benefit Summary Letter (sometimes called a VA award letter) and other benefit letters and documents online.

## View Payments

Veterans receive lots of payments for the various benefits they receive from the VA. This app allows Veterans to see what payments have been made to them as well as some basic information about those payments.

## Rated Disabilities

The VA assigns a Veteran a disability rating based on the severity of their service connected condition. They rate disabilities from 0% to 100% in 10% increments (e.g. 10%, 20%, 30% etc.). The VA uses a Veterans disability rating to determine how much disability compensation theyâ€™ll receive each month, as well as their eligibility for other VA benefits. This service allows veterans the ability to view their combined and individual disability ratings.
