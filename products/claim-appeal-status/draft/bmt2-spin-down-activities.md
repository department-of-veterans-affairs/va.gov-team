# Team Spin-Down Activities

**Document purpose:** State clearly what a contractor team needs to do in the last month of a contract. See [this link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/Transition%20hub/Transition%20Hub%20\(updated%20Feb%202023\).md#product-context) for a concrete example of what the result could look like.

Product, design, research, and engineering:

- [ ] Share an upstream service map with contacts, following [this example](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/Engineering/BackEnd/Architecture/Services/).   
- [ ] Share a stakeholder map that includes names, organizations, and common reasons you connected with each.  
- [ ] Download all documents (discovery notes, briefs, launch plans, etc), decks, and spreadsheets as Microsoft files – including subject matter expert discussion notes, playbooks, and documents of enduring value – and upload them into SharePoint or GitHub.  
- [ ] Transfer all Mural boards into the VA Mural account, and ensure they are cleaned and updated.  
- [ ] Transfer all Slack canvas ownership to the enabling team.  
- [ ] Update product outlines, active initiative briefs, and product guides, and share links to them.  
- [ ] Recommend which backlog tickets not yet on a roadmap should be prioritized next, and share your thinking.  
- [ ] Document any custom scripts run for production support or remediation; check them into GitHub, along with a ReadMe file.  
- [ ] Document anything that runs on a background schedule.  
- [ ] Ensure there are no uncommitted branches.  
- [ ] Cc the enabling team on all communications with VA employees (to ensure a smooth communication transition thereafter).  
- [ ] Share with the enabling team a simple release timeline that shows what features and changes were released throughout the contract.  
- [ ] Document dashboards used for application performance monitoring, analytics, and other purposes, along with short descriptions for how to interpret them.  
- [ ] Document any manual processes (e.g., data analyses) used during the contract that may need to be used again. 

Contract management:

- [ ] Coordinate with the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) for the final Contract Performance Assessment Rating (CPARS) or Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).  
- [ ] Prep final delivery report and invoice and inform Contracting Officer Representative that this is the last one for the Period of Performance, labeled “FINAL”.  
- [ ] Provide final receipts for software tools.   
- [ ] Coordinate with Contracting Officer Representative for any Government-Furnished Equipment returns.
