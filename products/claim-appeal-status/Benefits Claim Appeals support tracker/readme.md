# Support tracker for Benefits Claim Appeals team
The Benefits Claims Appeals team receives a variety of support requests from our partners at the VA, Contact Center, etc. In order to consolidate and track these requests, we have set up the [Benefits Claim Appeals support tracker](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/904/views/1).
## How to use the tracker: 
1. A member of the Benefits Claim Appeals team receives a request via any channel (slack, email, verbal)
2. Team member should enter the issue into the tracker *or* tag your project manager and ask them to enter the issue
3. Add the issue to the [support tracker](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/904/views/1)
4. Include: brief description of the issue, potential impact, and who reported the issue 

## Following up
The Benefits Claims Appeals team will open and prioritize the [support tracker](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/904/views/1) during biweekly refinement and planning meetings.
