# Subreddit Engagement Playbook


# Play 1: Establish a clear purpose and set expectations

Begin by crafting a clear mission statement for the community engagement initiative. This should outline the purpose and goals of the interaction, set expectations for both the VA representative and the community members, and create guidelines for communication. Share this mission statement with the subreddit community to ensure transparency.


# Play 2: Assign a dedicated community spokesperson

Designate a skilled and empathetic community spokesperson who understands the needs of veterans and has excellent communication skills. This person will be responsible for guiding the conversation, addressing concerns, and de-escalating any hostile situations.


# Play 3: Create a code of conduct 


Develop a code of conduct that outlines the acceptable behavior and language for VA representatives. This should include guidelines for respectful communication, handling disagreements, and maintaining a positive, constructive atmosphere.


# Play 4: Engage in active listening and empathy

Encourage VA representatives to practice active listening when engaging with the community. This involves being present, acknowledging the users' concerns, and validating their experiences. Empathy is crucial in building trust and rapport with veterans.


# Play 5: Use regular, structured communication

Establish a consistent schedule for VA representatives to engage with the subreddit community, such as weekly or bi-weekly Q&A sessions, feedback threads, or updates on improvements being made. This consistency will help build trust and a sense of reliability.


# Play 6: Provide educational resources

Share informative content and resources that can help veterans better understand the disability claims process, their rights, and available support. This not only empowers them but also demonstrates the VA's commitment to their well-being.


# Play 7: Highlight positive changes and success stories

Celebrate improvements and successes resulting from the community's input. Share updates on changes made in response to user feedback and showcase stories of veterans who have benefited from the collaboration between the VA and the community.


# Play 8: Develop a crisis communication plan

Prepare a plan to address and manage any hostile situations or communication breakdowns that may arise. This can include having links ready for the Veterans Crisis Line and other resources. It can also include off ramps to handing back community discussions to subreddit moderators or simply bowing out of contentious conversations gracefully.

Create boilerplate for crisis scenarios that can direct veterans to the appropriate VA resources.


# Play 9: Encourage peer-to-peer support

Facilitate a supportive environment where veterans can share their experiences and advice with one another. This not only fosters a sense of community but also helps to alleviate pressure on VA representatives to respond to every concern.


# Play 10: Continuously evaluate and iterate

Regularly assess the effectiveness of the community engagement initiative, gather feedback from VA representatives and community members, and make adjustments as needed to improve the process and achieve the desired outcomes.
