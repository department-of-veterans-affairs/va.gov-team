# CST: Evidence Requests "Friendly Language" Initiative

- **Product:** CST
- **Example Issue:** [HERE](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/106930)

## Problem Statement

At present, Evidence Requests within the Claim Status Tool frequently display "raw" fields -- that is to say, directly from the API -- to the veteran.
These fields can frequently be confusing or not particularly legible.

## Solution Approach

From a **backend** perspective, we are building a mapping of API fields-to-legible-strings and using that mapping to override data received from Lighthouse
before sending it out to the client. This behavior is managed by a feature flipper:

1. `cst_friendly_evidence_requests`, when enabled, turns on the override behavior.

- [The mapping lives here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/lib/lighthouse/benefits_claims/constants.rb).
- [The service overrides live here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/lib/lighthouse/benefits_claims/service.rb#L43).

From a **frontend** perspective, we are builing a dictionary to store the longDescription, nextSteps, isProperNoun, noActionNeeded and isSensitive for each updated evidence content. The page that is displaying evidence is already updated to read through the dictionary. New updated evidence content will just need to be added to the dictionary.

## Update

The `cst_friendly_evidence_requests` is removed. For future evidence request content update will just add to the mapping in backend and frontend.
