# VA Letters and Documents Page - Product Outline

## Overview
The VA Letters and Documents page redesign aims to simplify Veterans' access to their benefit-related documents and streamline the mailing address management process, delivering a user-friendly, single-step experience that prioritizes accessibility and clarity.

## Problem Statement
Veterans often encounter confusion on the VA Letters and Documents page due to a misleading two-step process, unclear navigation, and overly prominent mailing address management features, detracting from the page's primary purpose—downloading important documents. Additionally, inconsistencies in design patterns and accessibility issues hinder the overall user experience.
