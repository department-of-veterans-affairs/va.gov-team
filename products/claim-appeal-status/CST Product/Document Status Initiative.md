# Executive Summary

This initiative aims to validate the value of providing Veterans with real-time, in-app status updates and failure notifications for evidence submissions in the Claim Status Tool (CST). By introducing these updates, we hope to improve transparency, reduce Veteran anxiety, and provide clearer communication about document submission outcomes, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience and reducing support inquiries.

# Problem Statement(s)

* Veterans currently lack real-time visibility into the status of their evidence submissions within CST, leading to uncertainty and unnecessary stress.
* Veterans may only learn about failed document submissions after delays, which reduces their opportunity to take timely corrective action.
* A lack of clarity on document submission statuses results in increased support inquiries from Veterans seeking information.
* When a document submission fails, Veterans may not understand the appropriate next steps, potentially causing a loop of re-uploads that lead to further silent failures.

# Desired Outcomes

* Veterans gain real-time transparency into the status of their evidence submissions, allowing them to track each stage in the process (e.g., "Pending," "Received," "Failed").
* Veterans experience reduced anxiety due to timely updates, gaining confidence in the document submission process.
* Veterans receive clear, actionable feedback on failed submissions, including instructions on how to resolve issues, empowering them to take immediate corrective action.
* CST experiences a decrease in support inquiries related to document submission status.

# Audiences Served

* Veterans with pending evidence submissions for disability compensation claims within CST.

# Assumptions

* Veterans will benefit from increased clarity in document status updates and failure notifications within CST.
* Real-time status transparency will enhance Veterans' confidence and reduce anxiety during the evidence submission process.
* Providing in-app failure notifications will improve Veterans' ability to take effective, timely corrective actions.
* In-app status updates will complement email notifications, providing Veterans with additional clarity and reducing the need for support inquiries.

# Core Bet

Our core bet is that by providing real-time, in-app status updates and failure notifications, Veterans will experience greater transparency and reassurance in the evidence submission process. This added clarity will empower them to take effective corrective actions when needed and will enhance their overall satisfaction with CST. By reducing uncertainty, we anticipate a decrease in the volume of support inquiries related to document submission statuses, thereby improving operational efficiency.

# MVF

## Approach

* Create a low-fidelity interactive prototype to test the in-app status update and failure notification features with Veterans.
* Conduct user interviews and usability testing to gather insights on user expectations, preferred feedback types for submission failures, and general satisfaction with real-time updates.

## In Scope

* Real-time status updates for document submissions within CST.
* In-app failure notifications with instructions on next steps for failed submissions.

## Out of Scope

* Notification types or failure statuses unrelated to evidence submissions within CST.
* Other claim tools or status notifications outside the CST environment.

## How we will know if we are right (KPIs)

* Improvement in user comprehension of document submission statuses, as measured by survey responses and task completion rates in usability tests.
* Increased engagement with in-app status updates, shown through metrics on how frequently users check document status in the app.
* Higher success rates in Veterans taking appropriate corrective actions following in-app failure notifications.
* Reduction in related support inquiries or complaints to the Contact Center.

## Open Questions

* What type of feedback is most effective for Veterans in the event of a submission failure?
* How can we best communicate next steps or corrective actions when a submission fails?
* What metrics can we use to measure user anxiety reduction and overall satisfaction with the submission process?
* How can we ensure that in-app status updates complement the information Veterans receive via email?
