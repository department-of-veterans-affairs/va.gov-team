# OCTO: Fostering a Culture of Learning from Failure Initiative

* GitHub Label: octo-learning-from-failure
* Slack channel: #benefits-portfolio
* Product: OCTO Culture & Process Improvement
* GitHub Issue: [To be added]

# Executive Summary

This initiative aims to foster a culture of learning from failure within the VA OCTO Benefits Portfolio. By creating a safe space for teams to share their failures and learnings, we hope to improve cross-pollination of important insights, strengthen connective tissue between teams, and ultimately enhance the quality and effectiveness of products developed for VA.gov. Additionally, this initiative seeks to promote more rigorous data analysis and metric definition across teams.

# Problem Statement(s)

* As a product team within the VA OCTO Benefits Portfolio, we are disincentivized from sharing our failures due to perceived competition and a culture that primarily celebrates successes.
* As OCTO leadership, we lack visibility into important learnings from failures, which hampers our ability to make informed decisions and improvements across the portfolio.
* As OCTO leadership, it's sometimes unclear how teams are benchmarking metrics around success/failure.
* As a contractor working on VA.gov products, I feel pressure to highlight successes and downplay failures, which limits opportunities for cross-team learning and improvement.
* As a product team, we may not be paying close enough attention to the data that defines our success or failure, limiting our ability to make informed decisions and improvements.

# Desired Outcomes

* Teams feel psychologically safe to share their failures and learnings.
* Cross-pollination of important insights increases across different teams and contractors.
* OCTO leadership gains better visibility into challenges and opportunities for improvement.
* The overall quality and effectiveness of VA.gov products improve through shared learnings.
* Teams develop a more rigorous approach to defining and measuring success and failure metrics for their products and initiatives.
* The quality and depth of data analysis across teams improves, leading to more informed decision-making.

# Audiences Served

* Product teams working on VA.gov
* OCTO leadership
* Contractors and subcontractors involved in VA.gov product development

# Assumptions

* Teams have valuable learnings from failures that are currently not being shared.
* Creating a dedicated space for sharing failures will encourage teams to be more open.
* Learning from failures across teams will lead to better product outcomes.
* OCTO leadership support is crucial for fostering this cultural change.
* Focusing on failure analysis will motivate teams to improve their data analysis and metric definition.

# Core Bet

Our core bet is that by creating a dedicated, psychologically safe space for teams to share their failures and learnings, we can foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation. We believe that openly discussing failures will lead to better cross-team learning, more informed decision-making, and ultimately, better products for veterans on VA.gov. 

Additionally, we bet that this focus on learning from failure will motivate teams to pay closer attention to their success and failure metrics, resulting in more rigorous data analysis and a deeper understanding of their products' performance. This increased data literacy and analytical rigor will further enhance our ability to make informed decisions and improvements across the portfolio.

# MVP

## Approach

* Introduce a regular "Learning from Failure" event where teams can voluntarily present their failures and learnings.
* Ensure strong support and participation from OCTO leadership to model the desired behavior.
* Develop a framework for presenting failures that focuses on learnings and next steps.
* Create a repository of shared learnings that all teams can access.
* Include a data workshop component in the events to improve metric definition and data analysis skills.
* Implement a "Failure of the Month" award to celebrate insightful learnings.

## In Scope

* All product teams working on VA.gov
* All types of failures, from minor setbacks to major project issues
* Data analysis and metric definition related to product performance

## Out of scope

* Punitive actions based on shared failures
* Non-product related organizational issues

## How we will know if we are right (KPIs)

* Attendance rates at "Learning from Failure" events
* Number of teams voluntarily presenting at these events
* Qualitative feedback from attendees on the value of the events
* Increase in cross-team collaborations or solutions inspired by shared learnings
* Improvement in product quality metrics over time
* Increase in the number and quality of data-driven insights shared in team presentations and discussions
* Improvement in the specificity and relevance of success/failure metrics defined for new initiatives
* Increase in the use of data analysis tools and techniques across teams
* Number of product decisions or pivots directly attributed to learnings from failure discussions
* Creation of leadership dashboards used to make decisions, not just report results. 

## Open Questions

* How can we ensure psychological safety for teams sharing their failures?
* What is the ideal frequency for "Learning from Failure" events?
* How can we measure the long-term impact of this initiative on product quality and team performance?
* What incentives can we provide to encourage teams to share their failures?
* How can we balance the need for openness with the competitive nature of contracting?
* How can we best support teams in improving their data analysis and metric definition skills?
* What tools or resources can we provide to facilitate better data analysis across teams?
