What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?:  
<ul>
  <li>Zero errors logged in Sentry</li>   
  <li>Number of decision letters downloaded / # of pageviews</li>  
  <li>No calls to call center due to people not being able to download decision letter</li>
</ul>

## Post-launch Questions  
To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.   
1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?  
2. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?  
3. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?  
4. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
