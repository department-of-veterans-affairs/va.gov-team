# [Archived]  CST - Alerts - Product Outline 
The super epic https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/121959 is being used for the Collab Cycle product outline for this work.

## Overview
The Claim Status Tool (CST) currently uses alerts to notify users of status updates across various pages within the tool. Veterans currently don’t receive claim or appeal notifications outside of being logged into VA.gov, so they rely on an authenticated experience for viewing alerts in their specific context to understand the information being conveyed to them related to their claims, appeals, and decision reviews.

After conducting a thorough review of all alerts from an engineering, user experience, and content perspective, we identified various alert behaviors that were not up to date with VA design system (VADS) standards, including alerts stacking atop each other, alerts using outdated styling that doesn’t match the rest of VA.gov, overutilization of alerts to convey information to users, incorrect and confusing alert placement, and an overload of content within alerts. These alert inconsistencies could ultimately create a negative experience for Veterans due to the importance of these alerts and their contents. Our team grouped these alerts into clusters based on similar behaviors and/or location within CST and developed a systematic approach to updating these alerts to not only be VADS compliant, but ultimately to ensure Veterans receive pertinent information contained in alerts in a consistent, clear and timely manner.

## Problem Statement
As a Veteran or other claimant, I want alerts in CST to be clear, concise, and familiar to other VA.gov experiences so that I can clearly understand outstanding actions needed from me, informational status updates, and any other critical information related to my claims, appeals and decision reviews.

## Desired User Outcomes

*Why would a user want to use this?*

- There is significant VA research showing that Veterans prefer outstanding action items to be clear on the page. By reducing overuse of alerts and reducing alert content, Veterans would receive a clear and concise call to action for them to complete.
- Using alerts to convey short and timely information to Veterans rather than populating alerts with too much information prevents Veterans from becoming desensitized to alerts in CST, which could cause delays in their claims or appeals processes if alerts are overseen or ignored.
- Visual consistency for Veterans who use other pages in VA.gov and have interacted with alerts and their behavior can increase trust of the VA and of the website.

*With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?* 
- By updating alerts to their appropriate use cases, Veterans would gain transparency on the process of their claims and appeals without having to discern if there is any action to complete or if they’re only getting a claim status update (e.g., warning alerts versus informational alerts.)
- By removing stacking alerts, Veterans could more easily identify pertinent alerts on their claims and appeals pages on a mobile device
- By reducing content within alerts, Veterans could more easily read body content on the page and recognize alerts as they’re intended to be: to convey timely information


## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans feeling overwhelmed or frustrated with alerts and missing the critical information being conveyed
- Veterans not getting sufficient information or direction from alerts and needing to call for support regarding their claims and appeals
- Alerts don’t guide Veterans on how to take action or next steps, if needed


## Desired Business Outcomes
*Why would your business want this to exist?* 
*With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
- Alert improvements help build trust with CST, increasing user engagement and satisfaction
- These changes would clearly direct users on action items or status updates, decreasing the need to contact call centers for support
- If alerts properly convey timely updates to Veterans, it could reduce operational inefficiencies like missing court dates or not responding to evidence requests on time
- Build trust with the tool
- Decrease need to contact call centers for support
- Reduce operational inefficiences


## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Alerts cause more confusion and more call center support is needed
- Alerts fail to convey timely updates to Veterans
- Missing court date / hearings
- Administrative burden to the VA
- Distrust with the VA
