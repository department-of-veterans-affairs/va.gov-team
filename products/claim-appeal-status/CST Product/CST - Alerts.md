# [WIP]  CST - Alerts - Product Outline 


## Overview
The Claim Status Tool (CST) currently displays alerts everywhere through out the claim status tool such as stacked or on a different page. There are cards to help organize alerts related to the claim. 
When a veteran logins to mobile web or desktop an alert is displayed, there veteran would not have been notified of this via email or badge notifications. Currently, the veteran is not always able to resolve the alert (e.g. tracked items). Dismissable alerts are the only alerts that a veteran dismisses on their own (such as informational alerts) thus leaving the veteran with many alerts on their tool. 

## Problem Statement
As a Veteran or other claimant I want to be notified of: 
- Evidence Requests (stacked) 
- Board Appeals (pages)
- Services Unavilable (legacy design to cards) 
- Confirmation Alerts (UI consistency) 
Currently, there are too many alerts in too many places and
Alerts don't always mean the same things, yellow = warnings, blue = informational, red = errors, green = success
