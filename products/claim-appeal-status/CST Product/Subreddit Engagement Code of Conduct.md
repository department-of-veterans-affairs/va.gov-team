# Subreddit Engagement Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct for VA representatives interacting in the subreddit should focus on promoting professional, respectful, and empathetic interactions. Here is the suggested Code of Conduct for all VA representatives:



1. Be professional and respectful: VA representatives should maintain a courteous and respectful tone in all interactions, regardless of the tone or content of the community members' comments. Avoid using offensive language or engaging in personal attacks.
2. Stay on topic: Representatives should focus on addressing the specific concerns and questions related to the Claim Status Tool and veterans' disability claims. Avoid discussing unrelated topics or engaging in off-topic debates.
3. Be transparent and honest: When providing information, VA representatives should be open, accurate, and honest. If they don't have an answer to a question or need to consult with colleagues, they should clearly communicate that to the community members.
4. Protect privacy: VA representatives must adhere to privacy regulations and never share personal information about veterans or other community members. If a private conversation is needed, direct the individual to a secure communication channel.
5. Practice active listening and empathy: Representatives should listen carefully to the concerns and experiences shared by community members, acknowledge their feelings, and validate their experiences. Empathy is key to building trust and rapport with veterans.
6. Offer constructive solutions: When responding to concerns or issues raised by community members, VA representatives should aim to provide practical advice, resources, and solutions that address the veterans' needs.
7. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that community members may be experiencing stress or frustration. VA representatives should demonstrate patience and understanding in their interactions and avoid reacting defensively.
8. Uphold the agency's values and mission: Representatives should always keep the VA's mission and values in mind when engaging with the subreddit community, striving to provide the best possible support and service to veterans.
9. Escalate when necessary: If a situation arises that is beyond the representative's expertise or authority, they should escalate the issue to a higher-level VA personnel or the subreddit moderation team to deal with the issue effectively.
10. Continuous learning and improvement: VA representatives should be open to learning from their interactions with the community and committed to improving their knowledge and skills to better serve veterans.
