# Executive Summary

This initiative aims to improve veterans' understanding of the claims process in the CST, helping them distinguish their responsibilities from those of the VA, and guide them effectively in evidence submission. By achieving these goals, we hope to enhance the claim processing efficiency and veterans' overall satisfaction with the CST.

# Problem Statement(s)

* As a veteran navigating an open disability claim, I lack clarity regarding the VA's responsibilities versus my own at various stages in the claims process, which creates uncertainty and may lead to redundant or misguided actions on my part.
* As a veteran involved in the disability claims process, I often miss opportunities to contribute effectively to my claim due to a lack of understanding about my specific responsibilities at different stages in the process.
* As a veteran with an open disability claim, my preconceived expectations about the claims process frequently clash with the reality, causing me to become frustrated when the claim stagnates at a particular phase, or unexpectedly reverts to a previous phase.
* As a veteran engaging with the CST for my open disability claim, I encounter specific evidence requests whose purpose and requirements are unclear to me, leading to delays in response and submissions that may not be as strong as they could be.
* As a veteran tracking my open disability claim through the CST, I am misled by the depicted claims process timeline, which incorrectly suggests a linear process and fails to illustrate the common occurrence of claims cycling between phases. This inaccuracy creates false expectations and compounds the difficulty of waiting for results.


# Desired Outcomes

* Veterans have a clear understanding of the claims process, their responsibilities, and the VA's responsibilities at each stage.
* Veterans can easily differentiate between their own tasks and those of the VA at each stage of the claims process.
* Veterans understand why specific evidence is requested and what constitutes strong evidence, leading to more timely and effective submissions.
* The CST provides a more accurate depiction of the claims process, better aligning veterans' expectations with the reality of claim progression.

# Audiences Served

Veterans with pending disability compensation claims.

# Assumptions

* Veterans want more detailed information about the claims process, their responsibilities, and the VA's responsibilities.
* Providing clearer information about the claims process will lead to more relevant and timely evidence submissions from veterans.
* Veterans are often confused by the claims process, particularly about their responsibilities and what is expected from them at each stage.
* Improving veterans' understanding of the claims process will lead to fewer unnecessary cycles in claim processing and a smoother overall experience.
* A more transparent and understandable claims process will improve veterans' satisfaction with the CST.


# Core Bet

Our core bet is that if we provide veterans with a clearer understanding of their unique responsibilities versus the VA's at each stage of the claims process, they will be able to more effectively contribute to their own claims. By redefining how the claims process is depicted in the CST, not just as a linear timeline, but as a process that may cycle between stages, we can align veterans' expectations with the reality of the claims process. This increased understanding should lead to veterans submitting more accurate and relevant evidence in a timely fashion, thereby facilitating a smoother and more efficient claims process.

# MVP

## Approach

 * Expand the claim phases to the eight provided by Lighthouse, unpacking the evidence gathering review phase into multiple steps

## In Scope

* Disability compensation claims

## Out of scope

* Non-disability compensation claims and pension
* Supplemental claims, appeals and HLRs. 


## How we will know if we are right (KPIs)

### Claims Process Understanding Metrics

* Veteran understanding of the claims process: Measure the percentage of veterans who report a clear understanding of the claims process, including their responsibilities and the VA's responsibilities at each stage. This can be measured through post-interaction surveys or user interviews.

* Alignment of expectation and reality: Track the difference between veterans' estimated claim processing time and the actual time taken to process the claims. A decrease in this difference may indicate that veterans have a better understanding of the claims process timeline.

### Evidence Submission Metrics

* Quality of submitted evidence: Evaluate the quality of the submitted evidence based on a pre-defined rubric that takes into account relevance, completeness, and clarity. An increase in the average quality score would indicate that veterans are submitting more relevant and accurate evidence.

* Timeliness of evidence submission: Measure the average time taken by veterans to respond to evidence requests after understanding their responsibilities. A decrease in this time may indicate that veterans are submitting the required evidence in a timely manner.

### Claims Process Efficiency Metrics

* Claim processing time: Measure the average time taken to process claims after the improvements are implemented. A decrease in processing time could indicate that the veterans' better understanding of their responsibilities has led to more efficient claim processing.

* Number of claim processing cycles: Track the number of times a claim is moved back and forth between different stages. A decrease in this number may suggest that veterans' understanding of the process is leading to fewer unnecessary cycles in claim processing.

### Site Metrics

* Bounce rate: Measure the percentage of visitors who leave the CST page without interacting or taking any action. A decrease in the bounce rate would suggest that users find the redefined claims process information more engaging and useful.

* Time on page: Track the average amount of time users spend on the claims process page. An increase in time on page could indicate that veterans are spending more time understanding their responsibilities and the VA's responsibilities.

* Pageviews per session: Monitor the average number of claims process-related pages viewed during a user session. An increase in this metric could indicate that users are exploring the information about the claims process in more depth.

* Medallia feedback and ratings: Collect user feedback and ratings on the claims process page to gauge the overall satisfaction and understanding of the redefined content. Higher ratings and positive feedback would indicate that the improvements are meeting veteransâ€™ needs.


## Open Questions

* How might we communicate the non-linearity of the claims process to veterans in a clear and digestible way that doesn't lead to increased frustration or confusion?
* How can we best present the distinction between a veteran's responsibilities and the VA's responsibilities at each stage of the claims process?
* What methods of communication (visual aids, text, video, etc.) will be most effective in helping veterans understand their role in the claims process and what's expected of them at each stage?
* What information do veterans need to provide the best possible evidence for their claims?
* How can we ensure veterans have a clear understanding of what constitutes 'good' evidence?
