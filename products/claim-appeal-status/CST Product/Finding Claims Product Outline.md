# [Archive] Finding Claims Product Outline 
Using the epic for this work as the product outline: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/122238

## Overview
The Claim Status Tool (CST) currently displays all claims in a single list without any functionality to help claimants easily locate a specific claim. As additional claim types are added, it will become increasingly important for claimants to find and review their claims efficiently within CST on the VA Mobile App and VA.gov.

To start, we want to give users the ability to view open vs closed claims. But as new claim types are added, we'll want to explore possible alternatives for filtering (or sorting).

## Problem Statement
As a Veteran or other claimant I want to filter all my open vs closed claims so that I can easily track down a specific claim.
