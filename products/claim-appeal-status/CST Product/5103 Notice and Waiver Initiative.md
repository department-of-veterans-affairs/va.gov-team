* GitHub Label: 
* Slack channel: #benefits-management-tools
* Product: CST
* GitHub Issue: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/81212

# Executive Summary

This initiative aims to improve veterans' understanding of 5103 Notices and waivers within the Claim Status Tool (CST), helping them make informed decisions about submitting additional evidence or waiving their right to do so. By achieving these goals, we hope to enhance claim processing efficiency and veterans' overall satisfaction with the CST.

# Problem Statement(s)

* As a veteran, I am confused about what the 'Ask VA to Decide My Claim' feature actually does and how it supports my goal to receive a favorable claims decision in a timely manner.
* As a veteran, I may falsely assume taking the action to submit a 5103 waiver positively affects the claim decision process in ways it does not.
* As a veteran receiving a 5103 Notice first person request in CST, I lack clear understanding of what that request means and what actions I need to take.

# Desired Outcomes

* Veterans have a clear understanding of what a 5103 Notice is and what actions they can take in response.
* Veterans can make informed decisions about whether to submit additional evidence or waive their right to do so.
* Veterans understand the potential benefits and drawbacks of submitting a 5103 waiver.
* The CST provides clear paths for veterans to access their 5103 claim letters and submit 5103 waivers when appropriate.

# Audiences Served

Veterans with pending disability compensation claims who have received 5103 Notices.

# Assumptions

* Veterans want more detailed information about 5103 Notices and waivers.
* Providing clearer information about 5103 Notices and waivers will lead to more informed decision-making by veterans.
* Veterans are often confused by the current presentation of the 'Ask VA to Decide My Claim' feature.
* Improving veterans' understanding of 5103 Notices and waivers will lead to more appropriate use of the waiver option and potentially faster claim processing.

# Core Bet

Our core bet is that if we provide veterans with a clearer understanding of 5103 Notices and waivers, including when it is and isn't beneficial to submit a waiver, they will be able to make more informed decisions about their claims. By improving the content and user flow around 5103 Notices and waivers in the CST, we can help veterans submit waivers when it's truly beneficial and avoid unintended negative consequences. This increased understanding should lead to more appropriate use of the waiver option, potentially facilitating a smoother and more efficient claims process.

# MVP

## Approach

* Update content to clearly explain what 5103 Notices and waivers are.
* Provide clear guidance on when submitting a waiver may or may not be beneficial.
* Implement a user flow that guides veterans to their 5103 claim letters and provides an option to submit a waiver when appropriate.

## In Scope

* 5103 Notices and waivers for disability compensation claims

## Out of scope

* Other types of notices or waivers
* Claim types that don't receive 5103 requests

## How we will know if we are right (KPIs)

* Increase in the number of 5103 waivers submitted through CST when appropriate
* Increase in the number of 5103 notices downloaded through claim letters section
* Improvement in user understanding as measured by task completion rates in Medallia surveys
* Improvement in qualitiative feedback related to 5103 experience in Medallia surveys
* Reduction in related user inquiries or complaints to The Contact Center

## Open Questions

* How can we best present the potential benefits and drawbacks of submitting a 5103 waiver?
* What specific scenarios or claim types benefit most from submitting a 5103 waiver?
* How can we ensure veterans understand the content of their 5103 Notice before deciding whether to submit a waiver?
* What metrics can we use to measure the appropriateness of waiver submissions?
* How can we integrate this improved understanding of 5103 Notices and waivers into the broader claims process education within CST?
