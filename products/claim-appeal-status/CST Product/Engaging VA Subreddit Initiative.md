## 
Engaging VA Benefits Subreddit - Initiative Brief   



* GitHub Label: claim-status
* Slack channel: #benefit-claim-appeal-status
* Product: Claim Status Tool


## Executive Summary

The VA Benefits subreddit is an online community that has over sixty thousand members, most of whom are veterans. The vast majority of discussions revolve around the disability claims journey. This community has become highly knowledgeable about the claims and appeals process through organic crowd-sourcing; they have written entire wikis that guide veterans on how to make sound choices related to filing claims and appeals and interpreting benefit awards. Discussions often contain frank assessments of the Claims and Appeals user journeys and descriptions of pain points that are unfiltered, but insightful. This community is an untapped resource and could play an invaluable role in surfacing pain points and opportunities that could contribute to initiatives that improve the veteran experience and lead to positive outcomes.

This initiative proposes two strategies for engaging the VA Benefits subreddit: 1) passively “scraping” for feedback relevant to product initiatives and incorporating insights into the delivery cycle 2) a plan to regularly engage the VA Benefits subreddit in order to solicit candid feedback, dig deeper into known pain points, create transparency around priorities, and foster a sense of community between veterans and VA. 


## Problem Statements


### As a veteran applying for claims benefits: 



* I am detached from the software development process. When it comes to pain points I experience using VA products, I do not feel like my problems and concerns are being heard; I am unable to share my candid feedback with the people most empowered to do something with it.
* I may have a sense that there is an adversarial relationship between my community and the VA because I do not feel like we, collectively, are being heard and that steps are being taken to address pain points that are obvious to us. 


### As a member of a cross-functional team delivering software supporting the veterans’ claims and appeals journeys: 



* My primary way of surfacing pain points from users is through formal Ux research studies that require significant pre-planning and formal documentation and take weeks to schedule; consequently, I might miss the most obvious issues affecting users today. 
* Formal in-person or virtual Ux research studies are subject to well-known cognitive biases in which participants often soften or withhold feedback in order to spare the feelings of researchers; consequently, significant pain points may remain concealed and/or I won’t fully appreciate the severity of pain points that are revealed. 
* Ux research studies often contain between 10 and 20 participants, so what’s often missing from the final analysis is a sense of scale. 


### As a VA administrator: 



* I struggle to foster a sense of community between VA and veterans in the claims and appeals space. 


## Desired Outcomes


### For Veterans:



* Veterans are able to express more information about their pain points to a receptive audience empowered to actually act on that information to improve the veteran experience. 
* A two-way conversation between the delivery team and veterans makes veterans feel like they are collaborating with the VA instead of working against the VA. A deeper sense of community is engendered. 


### For cross functional teams delivering benefits: 



* The most impactful pain points surfaced quicker and with lower transaction costs leading to better prioritization, a faster delivery lifecycle, and accelerated positive outcomes for veterans. 
* The teams receive user feedback that is less influenced by cognitive biases. 
* The teams receive user feedback that has some sense of scale. 


### For VA administrators



* A sense of community forms between the VA and veterans in the realm of disability benefits delivery. 


## Assumptions



* Feedback from VA Benefits subreddit will be more candid and direct (tilt negative) than feedback received in formal usability studies and Ux research.
* Cross-functional teams will be able to surface and correct the most severe problems/bugs affecting new releases more quickly. 
* The subreddit community will appreciate the engagement and welcome team representatives to the community with open arms. 
* Reddit as a platform is skewed demographically; therefore it’s reasonable to expect the subreddit’s demographics will skew white, male, able-bodied, and tech-savvy. We might also expect it to be more knowledgeable about the claims process than users we might meet in other settings.

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The user demographics on the subreddit may skew towards the able-bodied and tech-savvy. If we over-index on their feedback, we might miss opportunities to serve disabled veterans and veterans with less technical skills. 
   </td>
   <td>We do not use the feedback as a <em>substitute</em> for other forms of research. We’ll still be conducting user research that includes live sessions with veterans and we’ll be sure to always seek out the perspectives of identity groups disproportionately left out of the conversation on Reddit. 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>VA representatives could be baited to engage in hostile conversations and make communications mistakes that diminish the VA’s credibility.
   </td>
   <td>We will craft a communications playbook and set guidelines for how to engage with the VA subreddit and respond (or not respond) to different types of feedback.

## Core Bets



* If we develop a dependable and automated means to scrape information from the subreddit, we can surface timely user insights that directly inform our delivery priorities and improve our solutions approaches; consequently, critical bugs will be fixed faster and the most impactful feature enhancements will get prioritized. 
* If we develop and execute an outreach plan connecting cross-functional team representatives with the VA Benefits subreddit, we’ll ultimately gain a deeper understanding of user pain points; consequently, we will prioritize the most impactful initiatives and accelerate the rate we achieve product objectives.

## Solution Approach


### Data Scraping


### Pilot Engagement: Sunsetting e-Benefits CST


#### Defining the rules of engagement



1. Create engagement playbook
2. Validate engagement strategy with appropriate VA stakeholders
3. Make appropriate edits
4. Finalize Guide


#### Outreach



1. Choose subreddit ambassador(s)
2. Ensure ambassador(s) know the engagement playbook
3. Reach out to subreddit moderators
4. Go through subreddit’s screening process (usually involves proving one’s identity via pictures of self and government badge with details blacked out). 
5. Determine w/ mods how ambassador(s) will be uniquely identified in the community
6. Make first post introducing self with a specific request


#### Request

The initial post will share with the community that, at some point in the near future, e-Benefits CST will be sunset. It will acknowledge that some members of the community still find unique value in the e-Benefits version of the tool and will invite users to share details about what they find uniquely valuable about it.
