# Product Outline: Common Attachment Validation Engine (CAVE)
---

## Overview
The Common Attachment Validation Engine (CAVE) is a backend component that uses intelligent OCR to automatically process and extract relevant information from unstructured document attachments, streamlining the benefits application process for Veterans and surviving family members.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the documents that claimants need to support their benefits applications are either:
- mailed to VA to be scanned into the Centralized Mail Portal and reviewed by a processor from there
- attached to a VA.gov web form, which is submitted as a concatenated PDF to the Centralized Mail Portal and reviewed by a processor from there

In either transmission pathway, the attached documents must be reviewed by a human to have any data extracted from them in support of the claim. This increases the Average Days to Complete the claim and introduces the possibility of error from human transcription.

Pilot test case: surviving spouses and children of deceased veterans face a cumbersome, paper-based process when applying for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits through VA Form 534EZ. The current process requires manual submission of numerous supporting documents (death certificates, marriage certificates, birth certificates, military service records, etc) that VA staff must manually review and process, leading to significant delays in benefit delivery during an already difficult time for grieving families.

How might we streamline the benefits application process by using CAVE to automatically extracting relevant information from supporting documents? Would this reduce processing time and minimize the burden on Veterans and surviving family members?

## Desired User Outcomes

- Surviving family members can complete the DIC application entirely online without needing to mail physical documents
- Automatic document processing reduces the need to manually enter information that already exists in supporting documents
- Faster application processing times due to automated data extraction and validation
- Reduced errors in applications due to automated data validation and pre-population

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Users become frustrated with technology barriers or complex digital processes
- User lacks clarity on what evidence they need/don't need to send to VA
- Automated document processing introduces errors or misinterprets critical information
- Users lose trust in the system due to privacy concerns about document scanning/processing
- Digital divide excludes users who prefer or need paper-based processes
- System downtime or technical issues prevent access to benefits applications


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Reduced manual processing workload for VA staff, allowing focus on more complex cases
- Faster benefit delivery to eligible surviving family members, improving customer satisfaction
- Lower operational costs through automation of routine document processing tasks
- Improved data quality and accuracy through automated validation and extraction
- Enhanced compliance and audit trails through digital documentation
- Scalable processing capability that can handle volume fluctuations without proportional staffing increases
- Better analytics and insights into application patterns and processing bottlenecks

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Increased technology support burden due to complex AI/ML systems
- Higher upfront development and maintenance costs that don't deliver expected ROI
- Privacy or security breaches related to document processing and storage
- Over-reliance on automated systems leading to reduced human oversight where needed
- System failures that disrupt benefit processing and damage VA reputation
- Regulatory or compliance issues related to automated decision-making in benefits processing

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Track quantitative and qualitative data to measure success of CAVE's automated document processing capability.

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      | Time to complete application (target: <30 min) | Application completion rate (target: >85%) | User satisfaction score (target: >4.2/5) | Document processing accuracy (target: >95%) |
| KPI      | Document upload success rate (target: >98%) | First-pass approval rate (target: >75%) | Net Promoter Score (target: >50) | System uptime (target: >99.5%) |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* Current paper-based Form 534EZ processing time: TBD
* Current user satisfaction: Unknown (no digital feedback mechanism)

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

- Objective: Streamline DIC benefit applications for surviving family members
  - Key result: Reduced average days pending (ADP) and Average Days to Complete (ADC)
    - current baseline TBD

## Assumptions
- Surviving family members have access to digital devices and internet connectivity to complete online applications
- Required supporting documents (death certificates, marriage certificates, etc.) are available in common digital formats (PDF, JPG, PNG)
- AI/ML document processing can achieve 95%+ accuracy on unstructured documents with varying formats and quality
- Current VA.gov infrastructure can handle the additional processing load from document analysis
- Veterans' families prefer digital processes over paper-based applications when properly designed

## Solution Approach

- **Initial MVP**: We will start by digitizing the core Form 534EZ application by re-using components that were already developed for the 527 and 8416 forms. 
  - This will also include basic document upload functionality with back-end AI/ML document processing capabilities.

  - The user-validated data will be provided to downstream benefits intake systems.

- **Why this approach**: A phased approach reduces risk by allowing us to validate user adoption of the digital form before investing heavily in AI/ML processing. This approach also enables faster time-to-value for users who simply want a digital application process.

- **Explicitly excluded from initial release**:
  - Advanced document types beyond core requirements (death certificate, DD214)
  - Integration with external data sources (Social Security, DoD records)
  - Mobile application functionality (web-first approach)
  - Real-time application status updates

- **Future evolution**: After validating core functionality, we will expand document types, add more complex data cross-validation logic, integrate with external systems for additional data validation, and potentially develop mobile app functionality based on user feedback.

- **VA Mobile App**: Initial release will focus on responsive web design rather than native mobile app to reduce development complexity and reach broader audience. Future phases may include mobile app integration based on user research and usage patterns.
  - The user experience would be similar to digitally cashing a check using your bank's moble app.


### Supporting research

- This work is **not currently supported by existing user research** specific to Form 534EZ digitization, but **will include comprehensive user research** as part of the development process.

- **Planned user research objectives**:
  - Understand current pain points and user journeys for DIC benefit applications
  - Validate document types and formats commonly available to surviving family members
  - Test usability of digital form design and document upload processes
  - Assess user trust and comfort levels with automated document processing
  - Identify accessibility requirements and barriers for diverse user populations
  - Validate effectiveness of automated data extraction and error handling

## Solution Narrative

### Current Status
- **Discovery Phase**: Conducting requirements discovery with VBA SMEs
- **Technical Research**: Evaluating AI/ML document processing technologies and integration options with existing VA.gov infrastructure

### Key Decisions
- **Decision**: Need a decision on OCR/ICR tooling (E.g. AWS Bedrock)
- **Rationale**: Required to support the aggressive timelines, low risk as it is completely back-end (e.g. not a chatbot)
- **Decision**: Integrating structured, user-validated data with the MMS API
- **Rationale**: Benefits Intake API unable to support data payload requirements within the timeline.
