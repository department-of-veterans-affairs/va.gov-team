# Shutdowns / Lapse in Appropriations

Content for shutdowns comes directly from the White House. This content will change with each administration. Communication of this content, when it should be launched, modified, and removed from the various VA properties is communicated from OPIA. There is no flexibility in the wording/style of how this content is delivered. 

Hereâ€™s what was posted and what was planned.
 
Appropriations Lapse Plan:  https://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/44567/va-appropriations-lapse-plan-agency-operations-absence-appropriations/
VA Contingency Plan: https://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/43654/va-contingency-plan-2017/

Also attached is the latest draft of the Veterans Field Guide.  This *did not* post to the blog in February, but was ready to go. We submitted the social media messaging, which included the banner language as well.  We used some of this the one time we updated the banner in January.
 
Hope this helps some.
