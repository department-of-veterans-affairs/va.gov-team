| Communication | 8/3/20 | TW and PATS-R don't use same tool for async communication | Inter-team communications are delayed and integration points are missed | Schedule inter-team daily/3x week standups?

| Communication | 9/17/20 | Attendees list for any call is 20+ | Meeting agenda is less focused and meeting outputs/goals are not reached in time | Reiterate that smaller focused meetings will produce better outputs, for both internal meetings and business SME meetings |
| Delivery | 12/3/20 | Holiday schedules have multiple team members on extended OOO | No significant work is completed in December to prep for SRA dev team coming on in January. | There will be some folks that have extended leaves they need to take in December, so MVP will be validated in the first few weeks of Jan.

| Delivery | 12/14/20 | SRA Dev team not onboarded before the December holidays | More onboarding time needed in January which could limit development time for June deadline | PATS-R will pull in the TW team as needed in onboarding/walkthrough sessions for the SRA team
| Delivery | 12/14/20 | Limited availability of MS Dynamics SMEs/architects | Missing expertise on the PATS-R system and integration work, slower development process | Work closely with the SRA team and have scheduled check-ins with the architects
