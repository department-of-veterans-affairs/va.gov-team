# IRIS Design + Content Specifications 


## IMPORTANT TO NOTE
Please note this document will be updated; the form and the project repository are more up-to- date than this document.


[Product Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/iris/IRIS-product-brief.md)

## High Level Flow Diagram
 
The developers are working with the VA Form Builder for the flow, which should follow the basics of the form, review form and confirmation as the 'happy path' for the user flow.

### Global Notes

- Since this is a publicly facing experience on the VA.gov site, the VA.gov header and footer navigation areas will be present
- Interactions will follow the VA Form Builder and the VA Design System - no anticipated new design patterns will likely be necessary.
- The content for the new form will come from IRIS, GI Bill and possibly myhealthevet; We are still evaluating content with stakeholders on what content is actually necessary - the myhealthevet form may end up being a stand-alone form as well.  We are using the Form Fields Mapping sheet to keep track of these, and not all have been included in the wireframes.
- Additional notes about interactions or content that apply globally will be updated as necessary and tracked on our [board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/orchidiris-5f29c3a0250c8f001f1397ac/board?repos=285091133
)
