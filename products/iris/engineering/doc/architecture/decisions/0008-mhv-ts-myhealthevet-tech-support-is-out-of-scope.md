Date: 2020-11-19

## Status

Accepted - decision was made out of scope for the ThoughtWorks team (Team Orchid)

## Context
Initially, the scope of the work has this team own the Veteran facing form for IRIS, GI Bill, and the MHV-TS to be integrated with one or more CRMs.    


## Decision

Member Services is also a Microsoft Dynamics based CRM, has been identified to house MHV-TS inquiries. MHV team and Kevin Clawson of Member Services team will be responsible for implementing the IRIS replacement for MyHealtheVet Tech Support.  
This will include creation of your “Ask A Question” page(s) and the backstage functionality required to respond to inquiries.
MHV Tech Support will NOT be incorporated into the IRIS replacement infrastructure based on PATS-R.
