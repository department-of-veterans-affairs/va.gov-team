The ThoughtWorks team facilitated a User Journey mapping session to pull together some of the different options available for a veteran to self serve as well as contact the VA for their questions.

The **primary goals** for this exercise:
- Define a streamlined ‘Get Help’ experience for the veteran
- Make sure there is a shared agreement on how all the different pieces integrate with each other

**Goal and hypothesis**

The exercise intended to get a holistic understanding of the various options available to a Veteran when they seek to ‘Get Help’ from the VA. The goals for the exercise were to:

* Identify all the different avenues available for a Veteran or a dependent or any visitor to VA.gov looking for VA related information
* Map the different options in the form of a user journey to define how they all fit together and how the hand off is expected to happen from one to the other
* Build a shared understanding of this landscape amongst the various teams working on the related entities 

The hypothesis that was set out to be validated was that a central Get Help hub will help Veterans get visibility into all the various methods they can get answers to their questions from the VA and based on the nature of their query, the Veteran will be able to decide which is best way to reach out to the VA. 

**Methodology** 

- Exercise
    * Team Orchid (working on IRIS replacement) put together the existing list of various options available to a Veteran when they visit VA.gov to get support from the VA
    * Each participant was handed a blueprint with all the different options that exist today and additional ones that are expected to be built in the near term and asked to map an ideal user journey using these various components.
    * The participants were encouraged to create their own components as required. 
At the end of an hour, all the participants had mapped out individually what an ideal user journey among multiple ‘Get Help’ related pages should look like
- The below were the various components used (includes both that are existing presently on VA.gov as well as those that are planned for in the future)
    * Various benefits hub (existing pages such as https://www.va.gov/health-care/, https://www.va.gov/disability/, https://www.va.gov/education/, etc.) 
    * LiveChat with an agent (Upcoming livechat with VBA-NCC)
    * Chatbot to do initial triaging 
    * Resources & Support (www.va.gov/resources) 
    * Global Contact Us page
    * Ask a question form (replacing existing IRIS) 
    * Secure messaging option (Upcoming in the context of IRIS/GI Bill replacement) 

**Learnings**

The key learnings from this exercise include:

* All participants saw value in the various components mentioned above as key vehicles that allow Veterans and others visiting VA.gov to get answers to their questions and the VA should ensure there exists a synergy in how these components work together. 
* Different users have different preferences in the methods of seeking help from the VA, and the VA should continue to invest in and nurture these various options. 
* Each of these components will have a niche area to cater to in terms of specific questions it is trying to resolve or specific patterns of resolving the queries, but will also have a degree of overlap with other options with the VA that help in providing a consistent experience to the Veterans, irrespective of the veteran’s chosen mode of reaching out to the VA. 
* The goal for these avenues continue to be to encourage self service among the Veterans so that the Veterans get answers to what they are looking for sooner and there is no additional burden placed on contact center agents and other support personnel in responding with information that is already publicly available to the Veterans and other family members. 
* **(Reactions to) Get Help hub page**
    * Majority of the participants saw the value a central hub that lists all options available to the Veteran can provide. Currently this functionality is a bit scattered on VA where all the options available are not made visible in a central place, and also there is no consistency in these options across the various pages on VA.gov and the other sub-domains 
    * There were different perspectives on which page serves as this central hub - is it a new page that needs to be set up, which will house all the options available to the Veteran, or can the existing ‘Global Contact Us’ page be restructured in a way that makes accessing these options more streamlined 
    * There were some ideas identified for further exploration:
        * Will there be a level of triaging done on this page, so the Veteran can be presented all matching information before they are routed to the next level of support appropriately 
        * There are multiple such triaging options on VA.gov - Get Help hub page (aka Help & Support landing page), the chatbot, Resources & Support homepage, the Global Contact Us page, among others can serve as a vehicle for initial triaging, but it is important to ensure the Veteran is progressively getting their inquiries resolved as they navigate through the multiple stages, instead of being sent around in circular loops. So it is important to define the user journey and user experience in a manner that is the most effective that ensures the Veteran has been presented the various options available to them, while also making sure they are encouraged to self serve where possible.  
* **(Reactions to) Chatbot**
    * Chatbot was seen as helping with triaging content and aiding self serve as well as a reminder of other ways to reach the VA
    * Chatbot could potentially be the middle ground between search behavior and navigation, e.g. “smart search” as an initial state, possibly something tied to specific hubs
    * Chatbot isn’t just a self service related product but also a tool to think about warm hand offs and a way to tie various channels together by pointing users to them
    * Some further exploration is required on the chatbot front to determine the positioning of the chatbot - will this be an option available on every page within VA.gov or available only when the visitors get to specific sections of the website such as Benefits hubs or Health-care and so on. 
    * Additionally the chatbot can also lead to further capabilities such as handing off doing a live agent for continuing the chat conversation, or handing off to a phone agent with necessary contextual information so the average call handling times can be better managed. 
* **(Reactions to) Contact Us page**
    * The new ‘Global Contact Us’ page is expected to fill in a lot of the gaps that exist today in terms of not having a central place that lists the various support options available to a Veteran.
    * “Contact us page leads with ways to reach a person (call, send a question, chat, log in to see messages), but then provides option to find an answer via resources or chatbot”
    * It is likely for the Global Contact Us page to serve as the new Help & Support hub page, but evolve over time to provide some additional triaging options to the Veteran 
    * There is expected to be some further work done on this to identify the triaging use cases 

**Areas for further exploration**

Some questions arose out of the session which ideally should be addressed in products going forward:

**Chatbot**
 
 Location: How do we position the chatbot - is it available on specific pages only, is it a VA.gov Virtual assistant, and is it an authenticated or un-authenticated experience, etc.  Chatbot can help to triage some queries before allowing them to post an inquiry.  Is Chatbot buried within R&S or be Level 1 triaging instead? Is R&S also a Level 1 triaging option? One participant noted not every page might get the same Chatbot experience - so which page would get it?  How can we identify the right channel for the right problem when users contact the VA?

   Livechat: There is also some question of where Live chat should show up (based on LoB). Hours of operation for the Live chat option and what the off-hours support looks like needs to be defined. 

**Contact Us page**
 
 Centralized place for support: What gaps in context exist for the ‘Global Contact Us’ page and how should this page support the various support options available to a Veteran and advise the Veteran on the right option to choose based on their needs 

**Content strategy**
 
 Knowledge repositories: Determine role of e-Gain and how/if it feeds into R&S (& other help content) - how do we maintain a consistent voice across multiple knowledge silos and products with many content authors?
 
 Handoff: Define warm handoff scenarios from chatbot to Inquiry form (Depending on the previous chat conversation, can chatbot default the dropdown values on Inquiry form?).  What does a ‘warm handoff’ look like across multiple channels? What would additional support look like if a user says 'no' to the 'did this help you' in Chatbot flow?
   Triaging: Before bringing Veterans to the IRIS form, how can we triage them to answer their questions without needing to submit the form? 

**Technical feasibility**
 
 360 view of customer: In addition to a warm handoff, is there a way to build a comprehensive log of a user’s support history across different channels (i.e. multi-channel experience) and how would that work?
