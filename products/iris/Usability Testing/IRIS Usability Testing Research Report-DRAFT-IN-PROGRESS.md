## Research Goals 

This study aimed to get feedback from Veterans on the IRIS MVP concept to evaluate whether or not the design supports the following goals:

1. Help Veterans find Tier 2 content in a way that doesn't dilute, distract, and clutter Veterans' benefit top task content and UX. <-- TO UPDATE


## Research Methodology 

We conducted 45-60 minute remote sessions using Zoom. 

- Each session included a moderator and one participant, and started with a brief warm-up interview.
- Participants used InVision to review a [clickable prototype]() that contained x, y and z.  <--- update for staging

Participants were asked to review the content under 2 scenarios:

1. Imagine you had recently moved and had to make sure the VA had your new address. How would you do that?  <---- to update

### Research Questions - TO UPDATE

(about 7 questions/topics) such as...

- Is the information easy to find using this search-focused, tag-based navigation?
- How easily are people able to navigate between learning center articles, and topics?
- Are the labels (ex: FAQs, Checklist, About, Step-by-step, etc.) useful?
- What do people see as the difference between the learning center search and overall site search?
- Do people get confused if they click on a content link or CTA button in the learning center and it takes them to a benefit hub page? And vice versa?
- Do people understand that information they don't find in the learning center might be in the benefit hub?
- Where would the most useful place be to provide links to the learning center?
