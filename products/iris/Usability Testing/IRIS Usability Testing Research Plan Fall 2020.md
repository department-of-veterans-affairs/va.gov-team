# Usability Testing Research Plan for IRIS redesign, Fall 2020

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team to ensure the usability testing is testing the right things at the right time to validate the right assumptions.	

## Goals

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This usability testing will be on the IRIS redesigned product and this document will go into the goals more at the tasks and questions during the testing.  We want to ensure that the redesigned IRIS experience is an improvement on the existing product.

2. Background: 
Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

Please view more about the IRIS project https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/iris/IRIS-product-brief.md

3. Research questions: 
What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

We have research questions which we’ll use usability testing to answer.  The goal is to understand what, if any, we need to change before releasing the redesigned IRIS within our scope (i.e. not testing the VA Design Library per se).  We also want to explore topics such as Customer Satisfaction & Trust, Findability and (Task) Service Completion, three key factors that the Analytics team has indicated are goals for products within the VA. 

We also foresee multiple usability studies for IRIS because of our development roadmap:

- Testing the IRIS form: validating the work done so far
- Testing the full IRIS experience: validating the rest of the backlog stories ncluding Help text,  File attachments etc.

See conversation guide for details questions and tests.

Exit questions

We would also ask questions at the end of the session from earlier in this document (‘Did the number of chapters/pages of the form feel like the right length?’). We may also use the System Usability Scale but may leave off until final usability test which tests the whole experience.

I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
I found the system unnecessarily complex.
I thought the system was easy to use.
I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
I found the system very cumbersome to use.
I felt very confident using the system.
I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.


## Method	

1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
Usability testing with a link to the site on Staging via remote moderated research.  Because our product has conditional logic we want to test users with a version that is as high fidelity as possible.
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
 
We want to run our redesigned product by our end users to ensure we're building the right thing in the right way at the right time - the right set of features and ensure that it's accessible.  Usability testing and an interview about their interactions with a product will allow us to answer research questions and validate our assumptions about the product we’re building.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
Remotely via Zoom because of COVID-19.

4.	What will you be testing?

We will be testing with a version of the product on Staging. 

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)
We will be using Zoom.



## Participants and Recruitment


1. **Primary criteria / Must have** 

1.	Participant criteria:

- what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.)

We would like to find Veterans (or their family members, but ideally Veterans) who have used the IRIS form in the past year.

Our preference is to test with the same users we originally interviewed at the start of the project to see if this addresses their pain points and because we have built rapport with these people, but are open to testing with others. 

We will work with Perigean who will identify users with an aim to have sessions with 10 users.

Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom.

We want to ensure at least 1 participant is a person with a disability.


2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 

We will work with Perigean who will identify users with an aim to have sessions with 10 users.


## When?

1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(If you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	

We would like to conduct this research post Thanksgiving.

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

- Version on Staging which will allow users to interact with a live form, with possible Invision prototype we could screen share.


3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?

These sessions will likely be one hour to allow for a relaxed conversation and the actual usability tests.

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? 

We can work with Perigean to determine schedule needs - post Thanksgiving is our requirement. Availability Monday to Friday 9 - 5 EST 

We would like it limit it to about 3 sessions per day maximum, with at least ½ hour in between each session.


5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 
	
We will pilot with the TW team internally to prepare for the session.
