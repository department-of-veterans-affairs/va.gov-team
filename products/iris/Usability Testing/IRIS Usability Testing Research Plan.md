# Usability Testing Research Plan for IRIS redesign, Fall 2020

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	

Accompanying story tracking tasks: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/orchid/issues/109

This draft is in progress.

## Goals	TO FINISH
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This usability testing will be for the IRIS product, which is being done by the ThoughtWorks IRIS team.

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	 TO FINISH

Please view more about the IRIS project https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/iris/IRIS-product-brief.md

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

- ACCESSIBLE: Is our design approach usable and respectful to those with any disability related challenges, especially cognitively?  TO ADD BELOW

- CHAPTERS: Have we divided the IRIS form into the right number of chapters as per the Form Library? Does having Veteran and person submitting the form on two separate chapters feel natural? Does having the Review page feel excessive?

- CONTENT HIERARCHY: Is the content organized (and grouped) in an intuitive manner and is it an improvement over the existing IRIS experience? Content here specifically refers to how we've reoganized Veteran's information TO ADD BELOW

- HOME/LANDING PAGE: Is having a landing page to route users to a particular option (health/education/etc.) a good experience? (We're assuming that having one question/place for them to funnel is a low lift).

- DROP DOWN MENU: Are they able to navigate successfully to their topic with three drop down menus? Do users use the autosuggest feature at the top of the dropdown menu?

- PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE: Does the progressive disclosure (only showing content that applies) feel natural? TBD if ASKING?

- SUCCESS METRICS: Are users able to succcessfully submit the form? Do they feel that the user experience has improved from the existing IRIS experience and if so how?  TBD if actual question here.

4. Hypothesis: TO FINISH

Using the following structure

The problem is/
By/
we will...increase the understanding of the form...
and know we are successful by.... user satisfaction

- We hypothesize that the IRIS experience doesn't feel similar to the VA.gov experiency. By applying the VA Design System we will find users will feel that the new IRIS experience will feel consistent with the existing va.gov experience. We will know that this is true when we interview users as part of the usability testing.

- CHAPTERS: We hypothesize that the Contact us form in long pages with a lot of content will be cumbersome to fill out especially using a mobile device.  By breaking the form up into separate chapters we will find users are able to successfully complete the form. We will know that this is true when we see that users successfully complete and submit the form.

- We hypothesize that users with cognitive challenges that may affect their ability to remember content on the first page, or users using a mobile device may not remember information entered on a first screen of a form flow.  By breaking up the form into multiple pages or chapters users will be able review the form before submitting and feel empowered that they understand what they're submitting. We will know that this is true when we see that users successfully complete and submit the form and feel comfortable with the extra review step.



What we'll do is have a series of usability related tasks we measure the success of the redesign and combine that with an interview here we ask questions re: reorganized content, rewritten content, if the experience feels part of the VA brand etc.  We'll add the tasks to the Conversation Guide.


## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Usability testing with medium or high-fidelity prototypes via remote moderated research
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
  - We want to run our redesigned product by our end users to ensure we're building the right thing in the right way at the right time - the right set of features and ensure that it's accessible.  Usability testing and an interview will allow us to answer research questions and validate our assumptions.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
 - Remotely via Zoom because of COVID-19.

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 		TO FINISH
 -  We will be testing a prototype - fidelity TBD.  We have been uploading designs to Invision, but may need to set up a lightscale prototype with code (i.e. on Staging) to allow users to add content and in order to properly validate our hypothesese.

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)
 - We will be using Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment	 TO FINISH
1.	Participant criteria: TO UPDATE

TO FINISH

1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) - TO DELETE

 -  Our preference would be to test with the same users we originally interviewed at the start of the project to see if this addresses their pain points, and additionally test with users living with accessibility challenges.
 -  We would also like to ensure that some of the people we test the redesign with have cognitive challenges

People who are dependents, who had a Veteran pass away?


2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?	TO FINISH

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 

We will work with Perigean to have the same existing usrs we worked with (the same recruiting contract) wherever possible.


## When?
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	- TO FINISH
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) - TO FINISH	

- Version on Staging which will allow users to interact with a live form

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?

These sessions will likely be one hour to allow for a relaxed conversation and the actual usability tests.

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?  - TO FINISH
**Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?
