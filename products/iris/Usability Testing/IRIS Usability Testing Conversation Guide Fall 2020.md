# IRIS Usability Testing Conversation Guide Fall 2020
**11/20/2020**

# Introduction

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Rachel and I’m a designer working with the VA.  We’re looking to understand how to improve the Contact us experience so we’re speaking to users like yourself to better understand what your experiences have been like.  Today we're going to talk about your experiences with Contact Us, or IRIS, the Inquiry Routing & Information System (available at https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/), It’s the form you see when you go to  ‘Contact Us’ > ‘Ask a Question’ at the top of the va.gov site you can go to the FAQs or Ask a Question.  Before we get start, a few things I want to mention:


- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better serve Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- PROMPT FOR USABILITY TESTING - Have you ever participated in a usability test? If so, can skip.
- IF NEW USER: ask warm up questions. If not new user, skip.
- What we're going to do is have you interact with the redesigned IRIS form and have you do a couple of tasks.  I'll give you a task to complete and we'll have you talk us through it as you complete the task. Try to complete it as you normally would.
- The point of this is that we're testing the product - NOT you - so be as candid about what works and doesn't work as you interact with it.
- Then we'll follow up with a few questions and grab any additional feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
- Any questions?
-Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"



# Warm-up Questions

(Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session)  Will also validate: Do you have any accessibility requirements - do you use any assistive technology to access any part of va.gov (a screen reader or magnifier, for example)? 

## Tech and mobile usage

Before we get into your experiences with the VA site, I’d love to know more about your experiences with technology.

What type of desktop, tablet and phone do you use (and operating system).  How long have they had that?

What do you used to access va.gov and where do you access it?
Probe for mobile usage, network use (broadband)

What browser do you use to access IRIS?

Generally, how comfortable would you say you are with technology? Novice/Intermediate/Savvy

## Product Experience

Have you contacted the VA? If so, when and how 
- When
- How (i.e. prompting for IRIS usage vs. picking up the phone) Web/Phone/Email/Other

Do you always contact the VA the same way? Prompt for why they called vs. using IRIS Why did you choose the method you chose?
 
How often have you used IRIS? Did you use the COVID-19 Chatbot - how was that experience using it? What was the reason you were using IRIS? Tell us about a time when you used it and the purpose - what were you looking to do the last time you contacted the VA using IRIS.  

# Usability tests

_Instructions for notetakers in italics_

_Note if the task is completed, not completed, where they stopped or struggled and why (‘couldn’t find button etc.) and anything useful about the problem.  Don’t focus on solutioning - just how they experience the product._

_Decide on laptop hugging method and if testing for mobile - Reference  _

Scenario: filling out the form

We have an early version of the IRIS form we want to share with you - not everything will be working but want to get your feedback. 

Go to this address: https://staging.va.gov/ask-a-question/introduction 

Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here.

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Atlanta.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself.

_Note if they go to sign in or not_
_Note if they select the right values from the drop downs_
_Health and Medical...then Prosthetics then Eyeglasses then medical facilities_

Now go ahead and fill in the rest of the form - you can just use fake data. (test@test.com)

_Stop them after they’ve filled out their contact info, before they get to the submit page_

Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is 
that what you expected to happen?

So we’re going to review the pages you went through and I’m going to ask you for feedback on what you experienced.


# Questions on the redesigned IRIS form

## Intro page

Now that you’e seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?
As we go through these pages again I wanted to ask you your thoughts about the following: (go back to first page and slowly walk through these again).

## Chapters

- Did the number of chapters/pages feel like the right number? (Chapters are the individual ‘screens’ - inquiry, vet info, contact info).  
- Was it correctly organized? Was it frustrating to have to click through multiple chapters - would all on one screen be a better experience?
Would you use this on your phone?

## Content strategy

- Is the content organized properly on the individual pages - the order of fields (i.e. dates all together,  time of service?)
- Do you understand the topics in the drop down menu? If you didn’t, how would you resolve that? 
- ON HOLD: Did you notice any help text and would you use it? Why or why not? Is more help needed (i.e. a glossary?) 
- Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see?
- Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?
Probe for ‘removed Middle Initial and Title in order to simplify the form’ if they ask for what changed?
Probe/watch for too many options for Branch of Service 
Probe for any extra fields (from an end user perspective)

- Were there any moments of confusion?
- Did you understand where you were filling out your contact information vs. the Veteran’s information?

##  Mobile
- Would you complete this form on your phone - why or why not? 
 
## Review chapter
- What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info?
- Do you find the the ability to review before submitting valuable?
- If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

##  In general
- Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?
Probe for va.gov look and feel

- Content: We simplified the categories in the drop down menu - what was that experience like?


# Additional topics for roadmap

If time allows we may also discuss three additional topics - both asking questions and sharing early concepts for feedback.

- Authentication: How users feel the need to sign it affects the IRIS experience (showing mockup)

- GI Bill: How users feel about having 2 forms vs one consolidated form for GI Bill and IRIS inquiries and how confusing it might be (may be question vs. mockup)

- Secure Messaging: How users feel about the simplified approach we have (showing mockup)


# Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work 
on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson?
If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
