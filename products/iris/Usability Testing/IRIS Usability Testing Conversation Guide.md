# IRIS Usability Testing Conversation Guide - DRAFT
**7/21/2020**

## Introduction - 5 minutes - TO UPDATE

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Rachel and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experiences with IRIS, the Inquiry Routing & Information System (available at https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/), and ways you use it to find important information.  IRIS can be accessed by clicking on ‘Contact Us’ > ‘Ask a Question’ at the top of the va.gov site.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better serve Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- PROMPT FOR USABILITY TESTING - Have you ever participated in a usability test? If so, can skip.
- IF NEW USER: ask warm up questions. If not new user, skip.
- What we're going to do is have you interact with the redesigned IRIS form and have you do a couple of tasks.  I'll give you a task to complete and we'll have you talk us through it as you complete the task. Try to complete it as you normally would.
- The point of this is that we're testing the product - NOT you - so be as candid about what works and doesn't work as you interact with it.
- Then we'll follow up with a few questions and grab any additional feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
- Any questions?
-Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"



## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

## Thank You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work 
on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson?
If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

Learning Center Content to borrow from:


Intro… 
I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or VA account?
Xxxxx

What was that question about?
Xxxxx

What was the first step you took to get that answered?
Xxxxx

Did you have to take additional steps beyond that to get the answers you needed?
Xxxxx

What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?
Xxxxx

Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?
Xxxxx

Was that a typical experience for you?
Xxxxx

Prototype... 
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4
Things to watch for: 
•	What has happened in the past when they've tried to answer questions on our website?
•	Might they have familiarity with the benefit hubs already?
•	Do they default to google? Or site search? Calling someone?
•	What do veterans think is in a “learning center”?

If you saw a section of VA.gov called "Learning Center", what kinds of things would you expect to see there?
Xxxxx

Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. How would you do that?
Xxxxx

Task 1: General impression
Things to watch for: 
•	What was the participant’s initial response to the page?
•	What did they say about the name "Learning center"?
•	What did they say about the difference between site search and this page?

What do you think about the different ways you can find information on this page?
Xxxxx

Do you think name Learning Center makes sense for what you expected?
Xxxxx

What did you notice about the search?
Xxxxx

How do you think this is different from the site search in the navigation?
Xxxxx

Task 2: Find article on a specific topic - 5 minutes
Things to watch for
•	Did the participant notice the search bar?
•	What were the participant's comments on the Search radio buttons above the search bar?
•	Do users notice or get confused between the search link in the top nav (which opens to a search box) and the in-page search with the radio buttons?
•	Participant reaction to audience and topic tags and content?
•	Did the participant decide to look up information on the topic by searching or scanning the page links?

Going back to that scenario from earlier - imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. Please show me what you would normally do and continue to think out loud as you do so.
Xxxxx

Since this is a prototype, not everything will work as you might expect, but it'll be very helpful to hear and see how you'd interact with it if it were a live website.
Xxxxx

Take a look at this page and tell me how you'd make sure VA has your new address. Think out loud.
Xxxxx

Task 3: Review topic results 
Participant will be looking at the View all VA account and profile articles result screen.
Things to watch for
•	Is the format of each search result helpful, or is a link farm more appropriate?
•	Is the format of the topic articles results page sufficient and helpful to the participant?
•	What were the participant's comments, if any, on the topic and audience tags for each result?
•	Do the template labels help the user choose the most relevant article to their search?

Scroll around, and go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here.
Xxxxx

How does this line up with what you expected?
Xxxxx

Would any of these articles help you figure out how to make sure VA had your new address?
Xxxxx
Prototype has three clickable results: Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online. 
What helped you determine that article was the right one for you?
Xxxxx

Great, go ahead and click and see if you can find the info you're looking for.
Xxxxx

Task 4: Navigate between learning center articles 
Participant should be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online article.

Things to watch for
•	Did the participant get confused navigating between articles?
•	How did the experience align with participant's expectations?

Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here.
Xxxxx

Does this page answer your question?
Xxxxx

What if you thought one of the other articles you saw in the list would be better information, how would you get to that information?
Xxxxx

Okay, and based on this article, show me what you would do next.
Xxxxx
Encourage participant to click on hotspot if they have not done so already.
o	On How to change address online page, hotspot is in alert, and to related info section at bottom of page
o	On Change address on file page, hotspot is in body text
o	Sign in FAQs page, hotspot is in to related info section at bottom of page

Task 5: Navigating between topics, and between Hub and Learning Center 
Things to watch for
•	How does user expect to be able to get to unrelated topic information?
•	Did the participant navigate easily between the benefit hub and learning center?
•	Did the participant get confused at any point going back and forth?
•	What changes did the participant notice between LC and hub?

Participant should still be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online article. 
We're going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?
Xxxxx

Since this is a prototype, we don't have all of that set up, so I'm going to send you a link you directly to a page.
Send participant link to Exposure to hazardous chemicals page in prototype: https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4#/screens/424624543
Now again, scroll around, and take a look at this page. Please continue to think out loud - you're doing a great job with that.
Xxxxx

How does this line up with what you expected to see?
Xxxxx

Go ahead and see if you can find the information you're looking for anywhere.
Xxxxx

This should take participant to LC Agent Orange article. 
Now, how does this line up with what you expected?
Xxxxx

Based on this information, what would you do next?
Xxxxx

If participant doesn't want to click Learn How to File a claim button:

Okay, now imagine you wanted to take it a step further and see how you would go about getting that compensation. What would you do?
Xxxxx

After participant clicks Learn How to File Claim.
And, once again, how does this page line up with what you expected to find?
Xxxxx

Task 6: Review tag results 
Things to watch for
•	Did the participant realize the topic and audience tags were clickable? If not, why not?
•	What did they think the tags would do?
•	Are the tag results useful?
•	Is the format helpful to the participant?

If participant is not already on LC page:
Can you please go back to the Agent Orange page we were just looking at? 
From here, show me how would you find more articles that might be of interest to the same group of readers.
Xxxxx
If participant doesn't click on audience tag.
o	Did you notice the audience and topic labels?
o	What would you expect to happen if you clicked on one?
o	Did you think they were clickable?
o	Go ahead and click on the audience label.
User lands on Learning center articles tagged: Vietnam War Veterans page.
Take a look at this page. How does it align with what you'd expect?
Xxxxx

What do you think about how this information is presented?
Xxxxx

If participant doesn't comment on tags:
Are there any aspects to the page that you think are interactive?
Xxxxx

What would you expect if you click on one of the audience or topic tags?
Xxxxx

Did you notice any articles that sound like they could be the same?
Xxxxx

What differences do you notice between them?
Xxxxx

Post-Task Interview 
From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don't already have - education, home loan, something like that.
Xxxxx

From what you've seen today, can you describe how the learning center is different from overall site search?
Xxxxx

If they didn't address the radio buttons above the search bar, get their perspective on that.
Xxxxx

We don't know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the type of information that's here, what you think of the name Learning Center?
Xxxxx

Say you went to VA.gov today and knew we had launched this product. How would you find it on the website?
Xxxxx

Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?
Xxxxx

What do you think could be improved about what we've reviewed today?
Xxxxx

Any questions for me?
Xxxxx
