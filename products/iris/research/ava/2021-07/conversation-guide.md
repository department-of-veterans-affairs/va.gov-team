## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ian and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about methods of giving feedback, like complaints or compliments, for the tools and services found on VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

## **Set Up - 5 minutes**

To get the most out of this session, I would like to be able to see your screen. What device do you feel best using today; laptop/desktop, tablet, mobile device?

**If desktop participant**

- Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features

**If mobile participant**

*For iPhone:*

- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?
- Tap 'Share content' (Green button at the bottom middle of the screen)
- Tap on Screen
- Tap Zoom
- Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
- Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments. For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing

*For Android:*

- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. Then hit the back arrow. Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe) For Android troubleshooting, try here: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**If the participant is using assistive technology, ask them:**

- As you are tabbing through to get to your screen share before you reach that there should be an option to "share computer audio." Can you enable that for me? That way we can hear your assistive tech readout.

**Recording Instructions**

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
 - *If yes:* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

**Start recording.**

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?"

Great. Now we're ready to begin!

## **Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes**

- Do you think this page is easier to understand?
- Would you describe this page as better or worse than the previous button?

## **Task: Submit an Inquiry - 10 minutes**

*Send the participant the link to the* [*AVA dev link*](https://dvagov-veft-qa.dynamics365portals.us/)

As you walk through the process of submitting an inquiry, please think out loud. Let us know of any problems or questions you have. Again, we are not testing your ability to fill out the form, we're testing whether or not the form is easy to use.

Imagine you accessed this page to ask the VA a question about (refer to scenario decided upon).

- Can you walk me through how you would submit a question?
- What is confusing about this inquiry form?
- What questions do you have on how to fill it out?
- How many steps are in this form?

*After the user submits a question:*

- Is this the screen you would expect to see after submitting a question?
- After submitting a question, would you navigate to a different page? 
  - Or would you just close the window?

**Things to watch for:**

- Did the user attempt to click on anything that was not clickable?
- Were there any errors in the users' submission?
- Was the user able to successfully use the "Look Up Modal" features?

## **Task: Access Previous Inquiry - 7 Minutes**

*Send the participant the link to the Figma prototype link*

- This is a clickable prototype of your AVA dashboard after you have logged in. 

  - What information would you expect to find in your dashboard?
  - What questions do you have about the content on this page?
  - Does anything need to be explained?
  - Does anything need to be added or removed?

- If you wanted to access an old inquiry you submitted in the past, how would you do that?

## **Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes**

Thank you for working through that. Now we have a few closing questions.

- How did Ask VA compare to what you expected when submitting a question online?
- Would you use the Ask VA tool we just tested today? 
  - Why or why not?
- What did you like about Ask VA?
- What was frustrating about Ask VA?
- What about the Ask VA form was difficult to understand?
- Does anything within this product seem out of place or unnecessary to you?
- Is there anything in this process we didn't cover today that you think we should know about?
- Is there anything we should change?

## **Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes**

Well, we greatly appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
