Intro
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ian and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to be talking about the various ways to submit questions to the VA.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
Set Up
In order to get the most out of this session, I would like to be able to see your screen. What device would like to use today; laptop/desktop, tablet, mobile device?

If desktop participant
Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features

If mobile participant
For iPhone:
When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?
Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
Tap on Screen
Tap Zoom
Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share
Great, now I can see your phone screen! I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments. For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing

For Android:
When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
Tap "Share"
Tap "Screen"
May give a "sensitive info" alert
May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
Tap "Start now" (maybe) For Android troubleshooting, try here: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen

Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:
Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
[Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

If participant is using assistive technology, ask them:
As you are tabbing through to get to your screen share, before you reach that there should be an option to "share computer audio." Can you enable that for me? That way we can hear your assistive tech read out.

Recording Instructions
Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.
I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?"

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!
Warm Up Questions
Are you aware of VA.gov’s “Ask a question online”, “IRIS” feature or GI Bill Help Portal?
If Yes:
Can you tell me what you know about it?
What did you like about it?
What was frustrating?
Have you ever used it to submit an inquiry?
Why/why not?
If Yes:
How did you figure out how to ask a question?
Were you able to ask the question you needed to ask?
If No:
Can you think of a situation where you would want to ask a question online?
When asking a question to the VA through the website, can you tell me:
What information do you think will be necessary to ask a question?
How long will the process of asking a question take?
What happens after you submit your question?
Who processes your question?
How long will it take to answer your question?
Would you log in to use Ask VA?
What benefit would logging in provide, if any?
Usability Tasks - Submitting an Inquiry
Send them a link via the zoom chat to https://www.va.gov/

If you needed to reach out to VA to ask a question, how would you go about doing that?
 If necessary, guide them to the “Ask a question online” link. Once the page loads, proceed.

As you walk through the process of submitting an inquiry, please think out loud. Let us know of any problems or questions you have. Again, we are not testing your ability to fill out the form, we’re testing whether or not the form is easy to use.

Imagine you accessed this page in order to ask the VA a question in regards to your GI bill.
Can you walk me through how you would submit a question?
What is confusing about this inquiry form?
What questions do you have on how to fill it out?
How many steps are in this form?

After the user submits a question:
Is this the screen you would expect to see after submitting a question?
After submitting a question, would you navigate to a different page?
Or would you just close the window.

Things to watch for:
Did the user attempt to click on anything that was not clickable?
Were there any errors in the users submission?
Was the user able to successfully use the “Look Up Modal” features?

Logging In
Send the user the link to the Ask VA login prototype

PUT THE LOGIN QUESTIONS HERE
I’m not sure of the order (test login first, then the form or the other way around). 
We could have them test logging in or walk through that, get their expectations on logging in, then have them fill out the form logged out
Or could have them fill out the form the form unauthenticated, then test the login experience and ask how they think logging in would change the experience.
Follow Up Questions
Thank you for working through that. Now we have a few closing questions.

Would you use the Ask VA tool we just tested today?
Why or why not?

What are your thoughts on the language used in the product during this task?
Does anything within this product seem out of place or unnecessary to you?
Is there anything in this process we didn’t cover today that you think we should know about?
Is there anything we should change?
Wrap-up and close
Thank you! Those are all of the questions that I had for you today, do you have any questions for me before we end?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans.

Thank you, enjoy the rest of your day!
