P7.IRIS interview notes.202008051400 (2020-08-05 2pm)

Facilitator = Rachel

Veteran = V

R: Do you have any questions before we get started

V: Do you work directly for the VA or with another company

R: For Thoughtworks

V: ok good, otherwise I might have to cut the call short because I’m having an issue with the VA right now

R: SO I understand you’re based in Pennsylvania,

V: right now in Maryland, self-quarantining, I got a COVID test, but also got the antibody test, and I figured why not.

R: I understand you’re also a caregiver for another veteran

V: I’m a caregiver for my husband who’s a veteran yes

R: if your husband’s experience is applicable here, feel free to share that as well

V: ok

R: what kind of laptop/tablet/phone/technology do you use

V: HP laptop, generally what I use for work, I do have an ipad and iphone, would never get a mac laptop, not that technologically smart, have enough trouble dealing with the iphone. I actually have another small HP that I bought on a whim but I generally don’t use it anymore

R: what do you primarily use to access va.gov?

V: my phone, because it’s always in my hand

R: on the road and everywhere?

V: yes

R: any assisted technologies?

V: no

R: what browser to access va website?

V: on iphone safari, on computer it’s google chrome

R: have you downloaded any VA applications?

V: I have, downloaded… the VA COVID coach and MHV (that’s for my husband). Which I learned about through a caregiver phone call. I do a lot of, the webinars and stuff that orgs are doing due to COVID, Elizabeth Dolan org (?), I’ve sat through most of their series as well

R: When you mentioned the COVID application, are you aware of the COVID-19 chatbot on the VA website?

V: I think I am, that might be what I’m thinking of. That’s on the VA Website?

R: Yes

V: yes, that bot on the website

R: Did you find it useful

V: I didn’t really use it as frequently as the COVID Coach app, I find it to be more user friendly I”m not a big chatbot person, a lot of times, they just keep asking you the same question over and over again. I’ve used the IRIS feature (app?) as well.

R: Perfect timing. We’d love to hear about your experiences with that. Thinking about a time when you contacted the VA, I’d love to hear more about that, your experiences using IRIS, why you chose to use IRIS…?

V: My husband was actually, recently, taken by ambulance to another facility because the VA wouldn’t take him because it was a critical issue. I got info from IRIS and VA app. I got the information to call to notify the VA that we were at another facility and why. I was kinda able to navigate through that. At the same time, I had an issue with my husband’s primary nurse. So I put in a request through IRIS for a complaint. I did get an auto response, and then they say I forget how many days, they did get back to me and about who I should reach out to. But by then I had already called and gotten a hold of the medical leader assistant and not very happy with that.

One thing I wish they could do, is come up with an app for caregivers whose spouse/SO, don’t want to share a lot of information with you, but for instance, the situation we were in, going to ER, he didn’t have his phone, VA wouldn’t send over the medical records, and I didn’t know his list of medications.
A way for caregivers to access basic information, last vital signs and medications. It was a net critical moment that we didn’t have his prescriptions. Then I finally went out to the car to get him his phone, then it took him a while to log in and get his prescriptions there. We tried to wing it, some frustrations, whether it’s a separate app, or somewhere where we can access basic information. The issue he was having was his heart. Last vital signs and test results.

R: when you submitted the IRIS query, how long to hear back

V: maybe 5-7 days? I think when you initially submit it, it tells you 3, 4, 5-7 days. It gives you that information, so you kinda know if you hear back from them

R: did you submit the AAQ form?

V: yes

R: there’s also a FAQ part

V: I looked at it, but it wasn’t giving me what I was looking for.

R: Do you remember what you were looking for

V: maybe complaints? But I was so angry at that point

R: Do you use answers others

V: Advanced search if I know what I’m looking for, usually don’t refer to other ppl’s questions because everyone is different

R: Once you submit, how do you keep track of your correspondence with the VA?

V: I have many folders and many (I work for attorneys so I write everything down), generally a piece of paper with date/time/who I talked to, if I know I need someone to get back to me, I put a calendar invite for myself to remind to follow up

R: bookmarks in your browser?

V: sometimes, more on my phone, then I have a gazillion, don’t have a way of organizing them, sometimes I save to the homescreen from the va.gov website

R: using your phone primarily to fill out IRIS form?

V: I was on the VA website looking for information but that particular day I did use my phone [to submit the query]. And the responsive email once you submit, was fairly quick.

R: what would you say works well?

V: I like submitting the form, because I think you can get more out of it (trying to pull up the form on her laptop). You can customize it. Sometimes the FAQs don’t help. It’s helpful if I needed to find a number, the information for who to contact after 72 hours with the ER visit, but the form, the page itself (customer help) is more, I feel like it’s too much for me. So when I saw the ask a question (towards the bottom of the page) part, then I used that particular function.

R: When you say you like to customize the form?

V: Let me give you an example, there’s not too many big topics, because it’s, I mean, there’s a few. I think there maybe should be another one, oh there’s caregiver support, I skipped that one. If you have a complaint for instance, then I don’t see that in the initial topic list. I don’t remember what I put in there. I think I just picked one. I couldn’t really find a subject that was quite suitable.

R: when you got a confirmation email

V: It had a number, like confirmation number. And it might have had, the timeframe, within 5 days. But basically just an auto-response. And a phone number if you needed to call.

R: thinking about how to improve IRIS experience and FAQs? What doesn’t work?

V: Again, I’m not a big fan of FAQs. I don’t do it very often to anything I’m looking for, I just find it… I mean some of it is helpful, I’m not gonna lie. Status of a pending claim, that kind of stuff, but I don’t know. Haven’t really thought about it, because I don’t really do FAQs. I like to get right ot the point, I want it right there, it’s my OCD or something. I kinda just want an answer and I want an answer now. Not read 3 different answers.

R: Totally understand. Thinking about the contact form, how to make more usable?

V: No, I think it was pretty simple, to navigate through. How you want to be communicate with, it’s really not that difficult

R: Anything missing? The copy? The functionality?

V: Yeah I mean, it’s pretty, I like it, it asks you the topic and inquiry type, then you have a question. The bottom self-explanatory where it asks for your contact information and asks your response method. I know for a while the VA was trying to call me and it was being thrown into my spam. If there could be a main number, tell us to put that number into our contacts (like an 1-800 general number) maybe 1-800-VA-IRIS, then that call won’t go straight to voicemail. I’ll know it’s the VA calling about my inquiry.

R: Preferred contact?

V: Email. I try to stay away from phone when it’s someone not in my contacts. And my husband, has a million voicemails, probably overloaded, but he doesn’t clear them out. He is probably missing lots of calls from VA. But all of this goes along with his PTSD and depression and all that. Sometimes I think he shouldn’t have a phone. But then when you spend all day on social media, it’s really not that fun. That’s all he does, he plays these games. But it occupies his mind. That I’m okay with.

R: Using the IRIS form, is there confusion between MHV, IRIS, GI Bill? Where to send a message

V: No, generally the boxes underneath the yellow, it tells you are you looking for education benefits, I think it kinda breaks it down. The crisis line and MHV are at the top. I think the layout is pretty good. If you can’t navigate it, then that’s a problem. Maybe the older people can’t as much. I like the layout of it, even if you look at the far right, the most popular questions over there, that might help someone who knows what they’re looking for. Yeah, I think the layout is fine. The top gives you the options and categories it can be.

R: Still redesigning VA.gov, etc. working on same fonts and stuff

V: Not an app right?

R: yes

V: Could they have an IRIS app? That might be helpful. It would just pop up. It would fit to the screen but you could also have it saved, you could just click on it, maybe it would have your name and stuff pre-filled.

R: MHV does have login

V: It becomes frustrating when (my husband) he needed to get on and couldn’t do it fast enough, if they have a dual process for login. Like you can login but then you have double authentication so they have to send you a code before you can actually login.

R: Any other things to improve? Magic wand for contacting the VA

V: I mean, my biggest thing is to get the access to his MHV but just the prescriptions and vital signs and test results. And I wouldn’t probably think that if we hadn’t been in the life or death ER situation. So a caregiver in that situation, we weren’t home at that time, maybe I would have the list but they weren’t with me. It could be with his approval or something, here’s what I’m going to give them access to. I’m sure he doesn’t want me to know what he talks about with his psychiatrist. And if there’s a 911/emergency, he doesn’t remember appointments and then he sends them to me, I put them on my calendar so I remember and then I have to remind him before or the day of, even that though. If I could get a reminder for his appointments, because he doesn’t answer his phone, but he doesn’t listen. Another person/contact person, his caregiver, to be the second person getting the reminders. Even older generation with alzheimers or something else, this would help.

R: How do they get reminded

V: Phone call automated and email, but both are not good for him. He doesn’t check his email, or pick up the phone. Maybe a text message would work. Unless he’s logged into MHV, he’ll forget. I have a few doctors who will text me, like a week out or a 2 day reminder.

R: Any other ideas? Making the experience intuitive

V: The two suggestions of the caregiver having access and the reminders going to someone else as well. Just because there are some veterans who can’t remember from one day to the next or one week to the next.

R: Experiences around how you share information? With other vets? Online forums?

V: Ironically, the incident was on the 4th, a lot of my husband’s close circle are still active duty/military, so luckily when it happened, we had medics on-site. So they were able to help us and they haven’t become vets yet, so I can help them with that
I’m very active in the Metro dc area

- Elizabeth Dole foundation (under their umbrella Hidden Heroes for caregivers only)
- Blue Star Families

I went through a program that’s how I originally started connecting with people

- Yellow Ribbon fund
- Operation Gratitude, they send out packages to caregivers, active military, responders and vets
- Various facebook pages to keep you informed

If you have a question, most recently about caregiver stipend (I don’t get this), then they have normal everyday people who will respond or if no one can get the answer, we’ll get back to them
Caregivers, like military spouses, we are a tight-knit group, which is extremely helpful. If we need to vent, cry or whatever, we’re there for each other.
Hidden Heroes is my first venting source, I know the VA website has a caregiver hotline, to ask questions or just talk, they’re very helpful. Having support is the biggest thing. Even to have those resources on IRIS, I’m not sure if they’re there. Something around caregivers.

R: No further questions, would like to share something once we redesign it

V: Oh absolutely! For sure. I’ve participated in a few calls like this, and it’s good change for me.

R: Sending good vibes to your husband

V: Thank you, yes he’s just crazy! Oh I tell him that. Doing a neurology consult. He’s okay though. Trust me, I’ve very persistent. His doctor was ready to hang up but that’s why my husband puts me in charge.

R: Stay in touch

V: Thank you so much, my pleasure
