P6.IRIS interview notes.202008051300 (2020-08-05 1pm)

Facilitator = Rachel

Veteran = V

His wife is stepping in for the interview. Pigs got out in his pasture, and she is also a veteran.

R: You mentioned that your husband is in the army, and you are also a veteran

V: army retiree

R. you are based in TX?

V: yes, georgetown near porthood

R: technology?

V: android, samsung I use it for apps and things; restaurant rewards I’d like to do. Computer: laptop I use on Windows. Chrome because I like how google gmail /google suite all links. Log into anything and different platform is nice.

R. Primary?

V: laptop, phone, equally. Quick lookup , hours of operation: use phone
Deep dive: on computer for bigger screen, more tabs

R: any VA download apps for phone?

V: I don’t remember… Myhealthevet? Maybe under quarantine. Under appointment, I’ll use it. I haven’t done much on it.  I’ll poke around and “that’s cool” Women’s health are neat. Some are earmarked.

R: Use chrome?

V:  Yes

R: any accessibility needs?

V: no

R: also speak to Travis’s needs

V: yeah, about the same. Desktop on microsoft and same phone; he maybe has little less patience for technology; if it’s super easy, then he’ll use it. He’ll research on laptop; on phone stuff, I’ve used app for like 10 years, he maybe finally embrace it now. On his stuff, he’ll get on it, and see data, get what benefits, he’ll often ask me, what’s the login for this? I’m both caretaker/vet.

R: Va.gov website, when you contacted VA and experience

V: Most recently, used few times.
1. Researching, power of attorney, what requirements we may have, (godforbid anything happens, referring to COVID-19 related) free legal resource, looking up different options and exploring (different avenues possibly)
2. Taxes (looked up payment history), verifying any kind of taxable requirements for recording
Asked several times and get different answers. Scheduling appointment, past 30 days, they have to refer you to out to community, they keep cancelling appointments due to covid-19;
Vision, dental, waited 1 year for them. They cancelled 3x in 6 months. Looking to wait another
Due to covid, But seeing civilians at va
Keep contacting, until you keep asking the same thing (squeaky wheel gets the grease type of mentality)
Doubting if she’s marked the right checkboxes

R: which method?

V: go in, ask a question, everytime I have selected specific facility: texas waco area, and ask a question through that. Sometimes I get a response from a person; sometimes a template; most recent thing. I see people using facilities.

R: response?

V: once time, it was next day; other time, generally next week, 3-4 business days

R: use covid-19 chatbot?

V: didn’t use it. That’s a good idea

R: when you were able to submit the form, did you use FAQ?

V: looked around that, but not for this specific issue; have looked there for legal references

R: wills?

V: yes, power of attorney; if something happens to me, .. heard horror stories from vet; accounts frozen, and kids; married, for decisions, sometimes not always easy, especially with covid, (guardians) not allowed in doctor’s face

R: FAQ experience, advanced search? Answers others found helpful?

V: search bar and put in “power of attorney”. Then just going through what articles there were linked. A lot of times, questions have already been asked before. Just seeing general info, pretty good, pretty common search. Pretty good info there.

R: did you use Form “ask a question”

V: yes. This week. About Care piece. I’ve been using different avenues, but didn’t hear back from last submission yet.

R: trying different avenues:

V: healthevet, care provider, local VA representative, every avenue that I find, there are so many different websites, idk if they are all linked to a specific person: hopefully  one will get me a different response

R: preferred order?

V: depend on what i’m doing; for pay, benefit: online, and get routed through regional rep somehow, used for education benefit; health things, will use directly through provider but hasn’t been great lately


R: inquiry routing IRIS system, what works well?

V: well, I like the dropdown menu, there are good enough info there. It goes a lot of topics than I would think of. I should look at this in the future. That part I like

R: earmark?

V: folder, bookmarks; different folder for different things; when I have free time, I’ll go take a look at this again… will need to revisit in XYZ time

R: when you are trying to track of different submission, do you have a notebook? Folder? To keep track of? How do you store info?

V: most things in bookmarks, and print >> save as pdf, and download folder inside VA; then I can go back and refer; sometimes will print it off. Used to keep a folder and too fat, and too clunky. To do list with running chart. Haven’t been able to update it recently. Bookmark, folders, sometimes I will set calendar reminders for to do task.

R: Where do you track tasks?

V: gmail, google calendar to link email. Set up oh phone, with a reminder. On computer, it will pop up oon all places. I have 5 kids and busy.  4-16 ages.

R: what’s challenges on IRIS?

V: recently hasn’t been too bad this week on VA stuff. There were few weeks ago, try to log in, but get routed to something else, and it wasn’t working. neverendin g labyrinth to login. Frustrating. Password saved on computer, so I can secure save.

R: logging into myhealthevet?

V: need to check that, and portal, and then another portal. A lot of the times, sometimes, one or the other, will not work. For whatever reason. “Which one is not working today?” sometimes, will use “contact me” and send “technical info” if i have the patience; that happens.. Luckily, this week’s been pretty good. This week with DEERS/DMCC website, different association. Otherwise, this week… thinking)everything went well. Logged into myhealthevet, Asked for appointment for husband, refills for my medication.

R: Is there anything missing? Functionality? Content?

V: all the different websites are sometimes confusing; when looking at VA letters, and things have moved recently. Sometimes it’s new, and transferred to old one, confusing. Idk if i’m confused or forgotten. Sometimes I’ll go through three or four logins to get to the right place. It’s not a huge deal but will eventually log in. How do I get to this? Now you’ve all added “I don’t remember this other login” the “extra civilian login” ID.ME that’s kind of neat. Idk how long it’s work, now that it’s integrated. Myhealthevet login to be more dependable. Husband: it’s not letting me login. Password change? “Is it broken? Is it my password?”

R: how are you storing passwords?

V: chrome secure settings: phone: secure Norton password , use few main ones; used DS login there

R:

V: he tries to log in and it’s always getting prompted to change passwords, Idk how frequently; I understand the importance, but as age, it’s frustrating; often we had to recover; sometimes we share; not always, depending

R: magic wand for contacting through VA

V: if I go to one website, log in, straight through, no 10 directs or this one’s not working; very straightforward menu; what issue am I looking at? Health benefit? Education? Legal? Very number facets to VA care, but so many Vets who don’t even have clue, and not sure what’s available; we learn by looking at the menu; like the current dropdown because it goes to a person; in the years past, it was only FAX. It was search, and hoped you find something. That’s  nice. Get a real time response is nice. Won’t complain about 4-5 days. Will call someone in an emergency vs email. Honestly, my complaints are more actual dysfunction of VA bureaucracy, to be honest. Too many organizations, red tapes, things changed. Contact us isn’t necessarily.

R: friends are vets. Experiences of how they share info?

V: event forums where people will ask Q, and that’s neat in the vet community. Benefits manager, coordinator, we have each other; little boost; among friends, are most of them are officers, and little savvyness there, although we definitely help each other with legal aspect. Oh, what about this? What do I need to do about this? We bounce back, this happened, what about you? This helps us gauge (is this issue)legitimate?

R: Forums, what drives you to those forums?

V: I would say…. Couple of big issues with health care and befits over the year. I was retired at 15 years, at 100% disabled on VA side. I’ve had some mishaps with letter six months ago, and they drop benefits. What in the world, can I do to fix this? Usually very short notice, you are not going to get paid in 3 weeks. Glacial speed, bureaucracy speed, is it going to fix? Forums are nice because some people will have a good rep in the area, or whatever, that part is good and it makes you feel like doing something worthwhile. Sometimes you get no response. And don’t find out until you don’t get paid.  

R: your experience, or any confusion on submitting on myhealthevet vs contact us vs gibill?

V: depends on when someone has interaction; ever changing function. What submit works today may not be two years ago; i went through this two years ago and submitted XYZ and no longer there. That’s the only thing that someone will chime in. I see a lot of that.

R: How do you keep up with change?

V: idk it’s hard. I would say, a newsletter; blog will tell you. This has updated. For future changes, update bookmarks. Newsletter, most vets won’t read it and won’t work. “Website to inform we’ve updated XYZ” would be helpful.

R: social media usage?

V: little bit; local vet forums; not in there, too busy. Has been helpful at times; usually someone’s on and has a clue on where to go; helpful

R: thank you. Would love to stay in touch, with redesign

V: yes, absolutely.
