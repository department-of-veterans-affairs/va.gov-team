# IRIS Discovery Study Notes

P10.IRIS interview notes.202008071300 (2020-08-07 1pm)

Facilitator = Rachel

Veteran = V

R: Located in Missouri

V: in Union, west of St.Louis

R: experiences with  technology

V: Graduated in my late thirties. Now at 53. I’m familiar with health records, I have operated e-medicine, I got a fax machines here that still  works, I text, I am familiar with Zoom

R: Primary thing to access VA.gov

V: prefer to access on the PC after I get to the office, cos reading PDFs  on phone is odd

R: preferred method of contact from VA

V: I like  text reminders. My patients like text reminders. I  think the VA might be an overkill. I get a week out, couple of days out, and so on - it might be too many. Its for medical appointments
I recently got a VA home loan. I had to go  thru the hoops. To get a copy of home loan certificate or copy of DD 214 - its cumbersome to get them online - to find them and get them, would love for it to be simplified.
There are 4 different ways to login - why! Now there  are 4 different passwords to keep track of

R: Login is something people have mentioned a lot. Our focus is on redesigning the IRIS contact form.

V: one of the big gripes - I was in Fort  Knox during last week of training. A week to go before discharge after training, VA did  their initial exam on me - you quality for disability, and you have coverage for only your  disability from VA. We have to get you medical assistance, but the earliest available is 9 months from now.  
I keep logging into VA to check: Do I have any health care benefits, any home loans, etc. - I see nothing.
Then I get cataract last year (and how am I going to pay)
I am 10% disabled,  and others said I should have coverage.
Then he learns ‘U have coverage since 2008…, we already sent all the info to your home address..’(This is  the address back from college days) Now the   VA has my current home address - because they are sending me the  $130 check every month!!

R:  Computer at work, which browser

V: Chrome

R: How do u usually contact VA

V: Usually call into the local office at Missouri. Since Covid, I have been dropping  them an email and usually they get back in a day or two - filling out the  IRIS form. Works for non critical queries.

R: Why were u contacting them

V: About a house. I moved from old house to new house and then got hernia.

R: Thinking thru he contact us form on IRIS - when was the last time and why did us ent a  message

V: I  do not remember

R: Did u have a chance to check the coronavirus chatbot. Is that an experience you would like  

V: I missed that chatbot.

R: Share screen

V: I have got multiple things open

R: Share desktop

V:  Share all windows

R: go to VA website and pretend you want to go to IRIS page

V: Scrolling to the footer, missed contact us at the top. And clicked on ‘Ask a question’ from the footer

V: I think last time I was looking for my updated DD 214
I don’t  use FAQs - I have looped them through before

R: Do you remember your experience about asking the question, using the dropdown

V: I was generally frustrated. I  don’t remember how I got here. My DD214s weren’t easy to access. Someone had to teach me.
Looking to raise an inquiry on IRIS for  DD214 and is scrolling t hru the topics on the dropdown
I have gotten an answer back - in couple of days. But I don’t remember what I selected back then

R: what worked well

V: I did eventually get what  I wanted from VA - dd214, and certificate of eligibility

R: what improvements with this experience u would like to see

V: simplify and streamline it. I was able to get to it because back in March things were slow at teh office and I was able to get to it.  Not sure how many of my veteran friends can  do it

R: “Simplify” - what do you mean

V: I had to scroll to bottom of page for Contact Us. My bank has ‘chatbot’. So something like ‘ok you need to be here, this is  where you should be..’

R: preferred response type default is email. Is that good

V: I  would prefer text. Especially if its not going to be an immediate response. Most  of my friends are keeping  up with  technology.

R: Having to fill in contact info.

V: yeah login would be useful as compared to the frustration of entering the same info multiple times

- Using  VA on mobile: “Do-able but not enjoyable”

R: do u use social media

V: laughs. No. its mostly in person we  share stories  with my veteran friends.
I have had  many veterans sit in  my office and i  have walked  them thru how to get  something on VA.gov - acting like a service rep

R: multiple silos. Do u feel confused when u are on VA.gov

V: and there’s 4 different logins. Yes absolutely its confusing. Combining them  would be useful.

V: I like the way I can order prescriptions on MHV, but its a clunky system. It seems like it was  written 25 years ago, its not intuitive.

R: what about the copy - does it feel clunky. Whats your experience with it

V: I wonder about a form-filled layout like this - why it cannot  be like ‘I send a text, let me get answer.’ I think this is 15 years old -  Am I wrong?
I wonder if AI technology could help them - especially for things like my friend - a vet with PTSD,  even if the front end had AI,  thank you for your question, we are looking for this and this, and we will get back to you

R: Does AI imply ‘friendly, smart’, etc.’ for you

V: You have AI  that can play strategy games - makes it appear seamless. AI could have access to your background, have access to your research, for e.g., home loan.

R: Are checklists or dashboards useful for you

V: yeah maybe.. Not sure. I think it would be easier to have AI working for you. Now do this next.. Next this and so  on. My homeloan company had.

R: a magic wand - what would  you do -  IRIS form and FAQs in particular

V: what i am seeing now on the screen is the best of 20 years ago. I think forms have improved to the best they can be. What needs to happen is - chuck the forms. Go to AI.

R: when u have contacted the VA, can u speak a little about how u store info after contacting the VA

V: I have a file folder - separate files for home loans, healthcare, etc. one of the things I like about text messaging, I can go back and scroll thru the text msgs. I like MHV  as well since it has my inquiries. If there is something like this for  the rest of the stuff too/if u had  AI, you could have a bucket - this is what you recently worked on.

V: So much of the stuff is stored on the cloud now. Having an individual cloud for the vet - things are uploaded and easy to access - that would be beautiful.

R: Do u use any tools out there to find  a form

V: I google first. Google usually points me to where in the VA website I need to go.  Usually its in the right direction

R: Anything else you would like to be able to do to make this experience more delightful

V: Compared to back in 2000 when I was discharged compared to today: I have been shocked and amazed. The fact that I have been able to get what I want. The fact that you are reaching out now to ask how can we improve - I will reach out to my VA friends. They let me  pick  my eye surgeon for my cataract - AMAZING! Jumping through all the hoops - keep working on it, you guys have been awesome. Keep working. Thank you!

R: Have u downloaded any VA apps for your phone

V: Woah.. I think I did. Haven’t used it  in a long time

R: whats the  reason for downloading apps vs using the website  or on a desktop

V: You know Geico - my car insurance has an app and has AI attached to it. I used it few times - it asked me few questions, what about this.. That..etc. - it got me what I wanted within 40 minutes

V: The forms are as polished as they can be from a form perspective. It is a form, an old school form - it is what it is.
Its time for the next generation wrt user interaction - AI it is
You are spending thousands of  dollars rewriting  and you still have a 20  year old form.

V: will be interested in providing feedback  on the redesigned screens. Shoot  me an email
