P9.IRIS interview notes.202008061200 (2020-08-06 12pm)

Facilitator = Rachel

Veteran = V

V: are we being recorded?

R: No

V: before you do, can we talk about things? I’ve been working with a dev on an app, make it easier to senior vets, I run a non-profit vet orgs, radio talkshows, on ux experience, and develops connections with younger vets, I hate money, I’ve lost too many friends, and will like to leverage TW and want to make this idea come to implement to save lives. I’ve lost too many friends. Masters in instructional design. Too many older vets who have given up.

R: your wife is also a vet?

V: she is an assault survivor; we get along well because we speak the same language

R: background on technology used

V: use everything; run tech teach center to veteran and coding; languages in sql, python; learned BASIC; in the Airforce, was a MS Server (ran email servers for intel), was a Oracle server maintainer where learned SQL; recently switched to mac last 5 years and still have windows and linux

R: cell?

V: iphoneX; too much per day (4 hours a day of usage) from iphone nag-a-meter

R: active text

V: hearing loss; preferred email and text; memory loss

R: assistive tech?

V: none

R:

V: use voice to text; thumbs are dumb

R: what computer?phone to use?

V: have to use macbook pro laptop for the last 5 years because it has password; pain in the rump to change password; frustrating experience is to log in for myhealthevet or ds login; mostly at home

R: VA apps downloaded for phone

V: no, didn’t realize they existed

R:

V:remembered why I used IRIS: can’t comm with doctors; IRIS used to send me email “secure messages” I’ve missed appointments, physical therapy and sat for 3 weeks ; not sure when it changed, but i didn’t change any notification settings, because I wouldn’t; but didn’t change

R:browser

V: FIREFOX v78 64bit

R: when contacted IRIS form

V: IRIS form to ask them on july 30th last week, got an email from shannon; on inquiry on why i’m not receiving any more secure messaging; no response yet and it’s been a week

R:

V: primarily call; will call to get to the appointment; or will go to myhealthevet to use secure messaging to access any VA contacts

R:

V: primary is to medical side of things not pensions; interfacing with doctors and nurses, they are always on myhealthevet for immediate response; myhealthevet is legacy, and it’s always been there; IRIS is more like “tech very IT/ticket management system” atlassian puts it out like JIRA. IRIS feels like JIRA and it’s not comfortable for me. Myhealthevet screen looks softer. The way it’s designed. Corners are softer. More inviting. Easy layout. To quickly find things. IRIS is not so much with pull down menus.

R: use chatbot?

V: pulling up, I saw it, glanced over and it was it. Skipped over.

R: would you like to share screen?

V: yes

R:

V: i’m wearing pants. Put that in the notes.

R:

V: VA. gov and i’m having issue with myhealthevet not sending me
Why would i go to va.gov? I would have to  end up at myhealthevet later. It was on ebenefits va? Has it changed? Do I click on these things and then jump back to ebenefits? I see this, and (I see the footer). I actually don’t know what to click on “ask a question”. I’ll log in and use DS login to just. I hate this checkbox. I can’t tell you how many times I hate the checkbox. There used to be a checkbox that I would have to click ,” I agree to all the stuff” Using browser password saved to try/error on login. There is no button for tech question. “Ask a question” link  found on a footer. I’m looking for email. It sends me to IRIS. This is a little 2005-2007 HTML 3 going on right now. Topics makes it easy. My issue was a technical problem, and I’ve got dropdown within a dropdown, and it’s horrible.
I’m going to say it’s access problem. Scrolling… Is there an Other option? I don’t even know if this give me the option to Other. I won’t put down the question.

- Inquiry type: Suggestion. For
- Service Complaint: made me pick a topic. I remember.
- Yeah, I’m the veteran.
- Preferred response type: was email. Got no response.

MyHealthevet: response was within an hour. Nurse has it open all the time and respond.
Doctor respond by eta.

Response: 5 minute to say I got it.
I need to get something within 24 hours for response via email. To get “we’re overwhelmed” we’ll get back to you”
Amazon, ebay, I get a response within 5 minutes.

R: FAQ?

V: not used recently

R: trying to locate IRIS FAQ

V: are they hidden under my zoom? In my world of tech, FAQ should show (back on va.gov, scrolling up and down looking for the FAQ. ) I don’t see it. Is it under About VA? There are Coronavirus FAQ? Is this a test? Are there no FAQ?

R: will break a rule and show.

V: I don’t see FAQ on the main page (va.gov)

R: Contact Us > Ask a question>> contact Us >> FAQ

V: FAQ Number 1:  Where’s the FAQ?

R:

V: I’ve never used this. I would use #3 obtain a copy of DD-214.

R:

V: I’ve been helping with vets for 10 years now. I know what forms they need. We just use google. It’s the easiest for vets to use google to find forms they need.

R:

V: google.com with pdf in the first or second link. Google doesn’t change and reliable.

R: do you use bookmarks?

V: yes, I won’t show you.

R: how to save info? save receipts? Notes?  

V: bookmark this page and probably text the URL to me. Using ctrl + c.

R: what works well?

V: answer is short, succinct, and point to point. This simply stated. I would recommend: instructions, make them bullet points instead of sentences. With accessibility, dyslexia, will get lost. It can be a lot in paragraph. In military, we’re trained off manuals. Step by step. I like the Others found helpful. Breadcrumbs are helpful. Those are “i was curious about that”. “What was Answers others found helpful seem irrelevant. If I click on the “find va locations”, it’s not optimized for mac, can’t do the swoop with zoom in on location. This should be clickable on the hours on yellow notification “limited services and hours” draggable around the map, interaction is delighting the user when things work. There’s room for improvement.

R:  with IRIS

V: it’s very JIRA interface; try to soften with font; font changes from the form and the FAQ. Oh, it’s the IRIS home.

R: categories: compensation helpful?

V: is it helpful to have categories. You have a lot of open space (; mouseovers are annoying; on four icons: the money; job; medicine; health I need to worry about whether I can get meds this week. When people come to IRIS, how urgent are they? Are they loudmouths like me willing to give feedback to anywhere? I have axe to grind, because I have taxpayer money. Or I need help.

R:  running a nonprofit, and helping other vets

V: where’s the back button? There would be a chat button and chat would pop up, it woul dbe incredibly helpful. Vets over 70, education with less than High school grad, “need help? Chat”. They grew up with zenith, and not apple computers.

R:  

V: chatbot is more breadcrumbish. There are lot of vets who would like to help other vets. It’s shame that VA has not monopolized that pool of help to improve.

R:  

V: I got a question from someone who moved and “how do I get meds?” “send old doctor to send prescriptions to new cvs location” I’m in VA and he’s in WA.

R: after you in service, when do you feel more comfortable, is it more overwhelming?

V: as you go to VA, military in connection always there. It doesn’t happen in the VA. my local clinic is very helpful. My doctor helped found it. Nurse team he has. They are so helpful. Main VA hospital is very difficult. Police called on me twice. Volunteer in the front desk asked me why I have a gun. They have font size 14 on pillars on VSO that way. I took a photo. Some of the interface, you don’t have trust in the VA. People who don’t give a crap. Chat who have trained, volunteers, who want to keep serving: live chat with live vet. VA is giving us second opportunity to serve the country. VA - i’m terrified of them. I’ve interviewed 100s of vets in the last 5 years in the Charlottesville and they don’t deserve it. Impostor syndrome. Everyone has it. It’s disabling. We’re always afraid of taking money from somemone else. I’ve been in this 5 years, but I still feel like I don’t deserve it. I used to be a teacher.

IRIS is more intuitively. VA. Am I still alive? Just a phone call. Engagement sucks at. It can be done on this website.

R: Any from live regional VA?

V: they respond within an hour. They care. They talk normally. they don’t read from scripts. We know scripted stuff. We need high tech. high touch. We need soft side. This looks very corporate VA.

R:

V: look at my healthevet, from clinical IRIS. Here you go. It’s not optimized for Firefox.. Bigger fonts. Myhealthevet has VA Videoconnect right here.   IRIS doesn’t.

R: given a magic wand

R: myhealthevet has its own separate form, IRIS has its own separate form

V: cognitive dissonance. There is no point of that to happen. Ux 101. Remove cognitive dissonance. Same palette, font, size. Not this on IRIS.

R:

V: am I the first person to mention JIRA?

R: given magic wand, IRIS the best contact us help experience?

V: I would like a response from my submission. I’m very simple. That’s it. Doesn’t need to be 500 million dollar contract. It’s automatic response, we received your ticket, here’s your ticket number. WE can’t see it. How about a partnership? “Veterans realize we’re not the customer” “Congress is the customer, because they are paying for it. “Veterans are just look like user”

- House, dog and a job: shelter, Companionship, purpose (job) (maslow’s pyramid of needs)
- Why are people coming to IRIS? Something else failed. Someone has to have a intuitively and be a partner to go through their healing“ and not just”
- Prior to this, seniors didn’t have connections/community.
- Magic Wand: no dropdown within pull down menus. Send them to Department of energy. Go make them write manual for nuclear power plants.
- There are 928 responses to FAQ, so must be similar in number in dropdown.
- Delight? That’s not the word I would ever use.
- Build trust within community that has distrust. Idk how to do that.
- If it’s mechanical, i can fix it. But emotions, relationships, idk.
- To overcome distrust, eliminate interfaces. Have a guide.
- There is a minefield. There is only one way to go through the minefield, to walk behind a guide.

And i’m a tech savvy. And i didn’t know which one to click on.

We’ll always give you some trust. It’s longer to rebuild that trust compared to civilian.

27million users and we’re not idiots. (there are some are).

Why would VA employee not listen?

This encourages me that VA is paying for sessions like these.

R: would love to get feedback on prototypes

V: yes
