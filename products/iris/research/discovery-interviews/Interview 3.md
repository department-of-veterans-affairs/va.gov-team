P3.IRIS interview notes.202008041000 (2020-08-04 10am)

Facilitator = Rachel

Veteran = V

R: I understand that you’re a veteran and caregiver of a veteran?

V: Yes

R: Who is that person?

V: My husband

R: Any accessibility requirements?

V: No

R: I’d love to know more about technology you use

V: Android, and HP laptop

R: What do you use to access VA.gov?

V: generally my laptop
I used to have some of the apps on my phone, but because there were so many apps, I ended up getting rid of them and just using laptop. Easier to find things on the website.
Generally use chrome.

R: How do you contact the VA

V: Most of the time through phone call or email, or in person (pre-COVID). I have used IRIS to ask questions about caregiver, benefit-related things because there’s a lot to navigate. Caregivers program is a little limited.
I’ve used IRIS prior to COVID

R: Example of a time you used the website

V: I was trying to help one of my friends figure out a veteran benefits, as far as accessibility, and what needed to happen in order for someone to have access to VA benefits post-service, in regards to discharge, kind of discharge, stuff like that.

R: [?]

V: I did send in an inquiry through the form, using Compensation, Filing for compensation benefits through the inquiry form. I’ve gone through the FAQs before but sometimes it’s easier to ask a specific question. I remember it being pretty straightforward, I don’t think I had any problems submitting it.

R: Did you use any functions like advanced search, answers others found helpful

V: No, I think I typed in a keyword, skimmed through the FAQs. But I think the question we had was something specific to the FAQs. Since it was compensation I typed in compensation, drilled down 2-3 pages, but ended up submitting a question.

R: How long to get a response back?

V: It was within two weeks, but I could be wrong.

R: What works well with that experience, what doesn’t work well?

V: For the FAQs, keywords are pretty easy to type in. When you search for something compensation-related
I just typed compensation in again, and most of the suggested searches aren’t related. The first two seem related, but then the other ones don’t. Making sure that those keywords are similar to things like compensation, so if a veteran is looking for things like that they

R: What to do if you can’t find an answer?

V: I have a ton of caregiver and veteran facebook groups I’m a part of, and a reddit page or two, a subreddit that I follow. Because it’s interactive you get people sharing their own experiences.

R: Is there anything missing in the experience, content, functionality, something you expect to see?

V: Perhaps if there was a chatbot. I know sometimes those things can be super annoying, but some kind of routing system within the routing system, where someone could chat with someone, automated and then routes you to the right person. For people who aren’t super confident in navigating websites, they’re able to find what they need.

R: What’s annoying about chatbots?

V: If it’s just an AI and it’s too scripted and you don’t have the option of eventually reaching a person, it can get kind of frustrating. If something like access to forms or something, AI totally works, but if you’re looking for more personal help, finding that connection can be kind of tricky.

R: Were inquiries routed to the right place?

V: A lot of the inquiry forms that I’ve filled out I haven’t gotten the return information on because I’ve filled them out for other veterans. The feedback that I’ve gotten is that they’re gotten the information they need. Because I’ve become well-versed in VA paperwork, end up helping on phone call or facebook chat, end up being one to help / put in the question for them.

R: Magic wand, what would you love to do?

V: From entering the VA post-service, I would make it really clear on how to access compensation and stuff like that. The only reason I knew how to fill out the paperwork is I had gone through with my husband, we had to read through so many papers.
I’ve seen so many veterans, don’t understand what the VA has vs what the DOD has. If there was some way for the VA to catch these service members, this is the amount of time you have to fill out this paperwork, here is how you find everything. To access most things in the VA, you have to have your compensation paperwork in. Having a button up at the top for that, or have that be the

Husband: some people just need a button, one simple button to click. I know a lot of veterans that basically think they don’t deserve VA benefits, they don’t think they did enough.

V: The MHV system is great once you’re in the VA system, but trying to enter the system can be such a black hole.

R: Veterans think they don’t deserve benefits?

V: [Yes, observed this across age ranges / groups]
Schedule of ratings is really hard to find.

Once you get into the system it’s not that bad.
When you do SSL path on the way out of the military they don’t tell you this is an option, they don’t tell you the VA is there to take care of you. Typically people think the VA is for people who transitioned out, or served 20+ years. If there was a toggle or button for that at the top of the page, that would be a big thing. I think that’s just as important as -- a lot of people love their education benefits and stuff like that -- but other benefits are important

R: Any other thoughts?

V: I’m usually the one who handles the website stuff. I’m looking at IRIS landing page. Button for crisis line, myhealthevet.
I don’t see anything missing, to be honest.

R: Would love to stay in touch if you, if you want to see design, get your feedback

V: Sure, I’d love that
