V: I use everything from widgets for  calendar, weather,  stocks, cryptocurrency, emails, photos, camera, FB, messenger, banking,  CC,  shopping sites, etc .

R: Is there a reason u use mobile version vs call in

V: Mobile version is easier, benefits of using apps is already logged in,  no research required, etc.

R: Have u contacted the VA recently,  when and how did u do it

V: I was recently rated a 100% through VA SC. I have had trouble getting that connected to  my medical files for  getting extra benefits. Make  sure that my house is paid off and my little girl can stay there and so on. I tried getting access to get details reg my case. My case was  still in Appeals, so I had to contact the VA for it. I used my phone for contacting VA.

R: How often have u contacted VA thru the Contact US form

V: Probably once or twice every week

R: When u were on VA.gov website, did u use Covid chatbot

V: No

R: Can you share screen of how u use and get to Contact Us.

V: On my phone or laptop

R:  Has to be laptop, and share your screen

V: Haven’t used Zoom as much

R: What would u say service members use for VC

V:  I don’t know. Looks like people were on Zoom, now they are switched off Zoom

R: Can u walk us through

V: Went to Check Claim Status, why am I getting letters when the decision isn’t final
Chooses to sign in using MHV, don’t remember my login on MHV cos I always use my phone. Generally use the MHV login. Cannot remember the password

Error msg: MHV did not find any account with this info.

V: Tries again:
Same error.
If I  try once more, I might get locked out.

R: Lets skip it for now. Going thru the web version, if u wanted to ask a q, where would u go

V: I would go to Contact (User  has clicked on the Contact Us menu on top of the screen). It would be a give or take. Ask a question or  call thee number they have listed here

R: When  u are contacting the VA, do u interact with the FAQs at all, or do u use filling out the form

V: I have used FAQs for simple questions, don’t specifically recall it. I have used for requesting Military record. I did not sign up for educational benefits, so I have never pulled it up. Because I’m starting a SB, I was looking for Diabled Veterans Small Business Loans

R: So primary looking thru VA.gov homepage to get info

V: Yes, its nicely separated, I have not had vocational rehabilitation training. I see support for small businesses, but thats probably not what I am looking for

R: When u have contacted ask a query form, how was the experience. What worked and what did not  work

V: I did not like putting all of my info on there - name,  social, etc. I was looking  for life insurance and I was asking specifically if u were rated  at a 100%, if there is a better company to go thru for better efficiency/better alternative. I know thats they identify you, but i din’t like putting in all those details for a simple question.

R: What about dropdown experience

V:  I don’t think there was a specific thing for  what I was looking for, the dropdown values did not match what I was looking for.

R: When you couldn;t find, what did u do

V: I just put what I felt was the closest

R: In general what would you say works well with how you are using FAQ or AAQ. Do u find it helpful things such as ‘what others have found helpful’.

V: No. I tend to ask for off the wall that are specific to me.

R: Do u want to use advanced search

V: No I  have never used it. Might be useful if u have ranked most popular questions -in case those general questions are asked frequently.

R: Did u try calling anytime

V: No, I have a 4 yr old daughter running around, its not easy to call

R: When u were filling in the form, was the content in the right order, or were there things missing that wasn’t helpful for you

V: I cannot say that, since my needs could be different from others

R: when u get response from VA, how would y like to be contacted

V: I prefer phone, so there’s no 50 different emails back & forth, which leads to misunderstanding, more effort, irritating, reword my query if misinterpreted, etc.

R: Lot of dropdown menus, multiple options, can u talk about that experience about navigating that dropdown tree

V: Not that I recall. As far as navigation, I helped the airforce create the first webpage. So navigation, I kinda know where to go to. I submit a question and then wait for 3-4-5 days to get a response.

R: Do u Create bookmarks?

V: Yes, yes, on my phone when I don’t have an app I rely on bookmarks.

R: Is there anything else missing that u cannot do now, but would like for it to be considered for the future

V: The one thing I was bummed about. When I left the military, I had a will done by ‘Jag’. Getting  a new will would be very helpful. If u get off the road and do it, its quite expensive - ~800 or going to some ‘janky’ lawyer. I would like some help from VA, even a template from VA will be helpful, since its additional money thats not easy to come by.

R: Is there enough info on the website to speak to that

V: I have friends who have helped me, i would go to them than instead of coming to a website. There are VSOs but its not obvious I can lean on them for these things. It took me 7 years after leaving the military that I can reach out to VSOs.
Now the first people I would go to be VSOs. instead of look on website, submit a question, wait for a week, wrong answer, oh let me reword  it..  And all that. The last thing I submitted  was on health insurance and I haven’t heard back anything yet. Been at least a week. When  I last called, the lady at the medical center said u might  have to wait for a week to  hear back on the phone, but if you email then, you can get a response  in a day. And its been 2-3 weeks since I sent that query and I have still not heard back

R: When u submit, is it thru MHV

V: Yes, its usually on MHV for medications, etc.

R: How does sending query on MHV compare with sending on IRIS form

V: It just reminds me of the ‘Hurry out of the way’

R: How long does it take for u to reach out again

V: My MHV has everything about when u submit, they can go back and contact u.

R: if u had a magic wand to make Contact Me  the best experience

V: I will tell u, but it will never happen.  I am associated with  Ashville, VA. I know there are  thousands of veterans at these places. If there’s a place to consolidate ‘these people  are from Hickory, and we can put  people into  assisting veterans based on their last names or something’, so it becomes more manageable in dealing with such large numbers.  U  are always required to contact Primary Care. We do not have a Social  worker who is assigned to us to  navigate the stuff,  regarding veteran care and health workers and stuff. People cannot get the info they need. Its ridiculous. If its very necessary, I contact the VA otherwise I would just go to the  VSO.

V: VSO are faster. I’m getting a service animal. I’m having to go to an outside agency for the same. When I called VSO, they called back within 24 hours with the info I need. And mentioned they they will contact the right person at VA to help proceed with getting access to the service animal, etc.  Contrast that to if I call VA directly, then ‘Oh thats good  to know’.  VSO service is much better. I  had to  help  VA with PTSD related research. I only go to  VA if its 100% necessary that I have contact with a doc, otherwise I usually go to VSO.

V: Texting with medical facilities, or  online  chat will be helpful.  Better than calling.

One other thing you might  want to look  into.  Its called DocuSign to have documents signed for back & forth, etc.Those kind of things would be awesome to have at VA, it  makes things  a lot quicker.
