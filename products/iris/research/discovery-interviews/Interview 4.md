P4.IRIS interview notes.202008041100 (2020-08-04 11am)

Facilitator = Rachel

Veteran =  V

R: You’re based in Texas, do you have any accessibility requirements?

V: No ma’am I don’t. My hearing in one of my ears is bad, I might need it in the future but right now I’m fine.

R: Tech used?

V: I’ve got rid of my computer, I got a laptop I use, ASUS older model
now, it works well for what we need to do but there’s a problem with the battery.
I have an ipad for whatever occasion. I’ve got an iphone against my will. Got married 5 years ago, my wife to get on the same plan wanted to get the same phone. Easier is better for me.

R: Which do you primarily use to access VA.gov?

V: Laptop, I would use that religiously. I’ve been using my ipad, easier to see on the same page, instead of using my phone.

R: Browser?

V: Safari

R: If you had to describe your relationship with technology?

V: Intermediate. Not a beginner, but I know there’s a lot more I can learn.

R: When accessing website, are you at home?

V: 9/10 times I’m at home. There have been times I’m in my car waiting for VA appointment.

R: Recent time that you’ve contacted the VA, and how you did that?

V: Recently, with everything being closed due to virus situation, I hadn’t had any means to contact the VA. But before that, my understanding was to keep my disability rating I have to once a year go to see a doctor. What normally happens is the doctor, has the lab results.
Call once a day to try to make an appointment. Once everything hit the communication kind of stopped.

R: experiences using the website?

V: I normally don’t have any problems with the website, because it’s really easy the way it’s laid out. The website, I really like ease of use, easy to get to, easy to access. It’s really easy to use, I really like it.

R: Did you use the covid chatbot?

V: I was trying to find out information before it got bigger, if that makes sense. I was trying to find out if there was any sort of offering from the VA, advice, recommendations from the VA in terms of diet, exercise, go to your favorite restaurant. Wanted to see what was out there. My wife’s a nurse, I get 90% of my information from her but when she’s not around I like to get information from elsewhere. It was a general search for COVID19, nothing specific. I kept looking for information about what it is, prevention, that sort of thing.

R: Experience when you were contacting the VA? You’re on your ipad right now.

V: That’s correct. They sent me the information, my labwork was due on January [] this year. But for whatever reason, I got the blood drawn, not knowing how long it takes, I waited about a week then called to ask Hey do I need to make an appointment?
I called for maybe two weeks, it got pushed back, cancellation. I stopped calling at that point. I tried to make an appointment on the website.

R: Was there a time you filled out the form, submitted an inquiry?

V: I didn’t even think to do that, honestly.

R: How about the FAQs, part of what you’ve done?

V: Oh absolutely, I go there first. What time does the [Center] open? I go there first, to me it’s easier to go there if I don’t know the proper term to look for.

R: Do you use bookmarks?

V: sometimes

R: In FAQs, are you using advanced search, answers others have found helpful?

V: Yes, they’re very useful, that way I can tell if someone has the same problem

R: Is having the category useful?

V: Yes, very

R: General whole experience contacting VA, what works well today with that experience?

V: It works well - I don’t like using my phone. I can do it myself online and I like doing it that way. If I can make an appointment online I like doing things that way. If there’s a clinic

R: How do you keep track of the appointment?

V: The VA is good about mail, they’ll send a letter/postcard in the post. They don’t call, but they’ll send you postcards. I like that because I have something physical I can show, here’s my proof.

R: What doesn’t work? How can we improve?

V: I don’t know if it needs to be improved. I don’t know if a lot of people access it as much as it should. I don’t think I’ve ever really had a problem, I don’t know how to improve something that’s not working in my opinion.

R: so when you say, people don’t know what to access it?

V: not the right term, my neighbor won’t do anything online, he yells at me for help, widower, kids are all out of state, so he’s trying to figure out on his own, I try to make it easier for him but he won’t listen. I honestly, I don’t know… how to use things like that… is there way to get him information, or if he’s interested in learning

R: to get help, he (your neighbor) would pick up phone?

V: yeah, he would pick up the phone. I’m younger, and can use internet. With everything closed, it would take 34-40 minutes to get to the office, but easier to get to on the internet

R: Let’s say you experienced a problem with contacting, how would you resolve it? After you contacted, how long it takes to hear a response back?

V: On previous appointments, if I’ve called an say I need to see doctor so-and-so, what happens if they say okay it’s going to be a while -- I try to just call. Call and just say, my appointment was on the 13th and now it’s on the 15th or on the 30th, person … online would not give me that option.

R: thinking about your experiences, with using VA website, do you expect to see on VA website? Is there something missing? Any functionality? Content? Anything you’d like to do?

V: I don’t think so… (thinking..) for whatever reason, i’m not working right now, just to give an idea, I don’t rush, I’m not in a hurry, with all the vets I keep hearing lack of staffing, we’re hiring, Go online, and let me try website; there always seem to be answers to what i need.. I haven’t really explored a lot of things I should do online vs just making phonecall to get an appointment. I try to call as much as possible even if I have to wait a while. It’s hard to say.

R: That personal touch of actually knowing Fred helps.

V: If I talk to him on tuesday, he might say oh you’re that loudmouthed guy
Most of the time, making appointments it’s not the same person, but if I walk up to the counter it’s usually the same person. There’s two of them, male and female. The guy, Fred (I don’t know if that’s his name), we have a bond, he was in the navy I was in the navy

R: thinking about your experience, when you go to VA center, can you think about what experience, going to reception? digitally?

V: As an example at the clinic I go to, if you’ve never been there they have a couple of old veterans there, they’re volunteers, they tell you where to go. In lieu of that, my doctor is actually in a VA office further down the road, you can scan you veteran card, check if everything is up to date. That might expedite things, for veterans who might not be as computer savvy, afraid their information will get taken or something.

R: Is there anything else to help you feel like the contact center experiences are more trust worthy or speedy or any qualities in real world?

V: scheduling: VA vs real world is the same. Within and outside of VA.. airlines: too many people coming in for overbooked ; fasting when blood drawing, when there are 20 to 30 people ahead of you, waiting to draw blood but can’t eat anything; maybe they get appointments come at the same time, older you get, the earlier you get there faster; i’m not willing to go at the crack of the dawn, i have to wait more

R: mobile app helpful?

V: If there was a mobile app where I can make an appointment, change the appointment, that would be tremendous. A lot of the younger veterans would use that. I would definitely download that if they had that.

R: i’m curious about you must have a lot of paperwork, managing healthcare. How do you keep track of all that stuff, even if you had a request in, and even with phone to speak with someone. Do you write down on a notebook?

V: Paperwork for visits and all that, I’ve got a folder, and it’s chronological. I’m bad at not writing stuff down when somebody calls, when I call. I know when I called because I can look at the phone, but I’m bad at writing that down.

R: if you could submitted something, using online form, confirmation helpful?

V: confirmation via email, reference, that would be very valuable, that my message was received, and reference number if I need to call later for action

R: Let’s say you’re been given a magic wand to create best Contact Us or FAQ experience, what would you like to do in the future?

V: whew, wow. That’s a great question. There’s a lot of veterans that can use help.

R: any particular group?

V: Group? I don’t know, in San Antonio I live … I think to make things better for everybody, along the lines of what you had asked, let everyone know there’s a VA app, provide better financing/funding for the VA to hire more people. Maybe send groups [to military base] to answer the questions. I’ve got friends, it kind of shocked me, a guy in the navy who was a cook, he never knew he was eligible to apply for health care. I just thought it was common knowledge that people who were veterans should apply for health care. If you have an ID card, tell them, let people know what they can do.
Hire more people, volunteers, other veterans. More people answered the phone, got them registered, got them to their appointments, that would be the best thing.

R: for your friend, Tomm is he aware of vets helping other vets?

V:  he’s stubborn. He says things like “I’m not going there”, looking down on the VA. His parents are well off, but I’ve never met them. I’ve earned my benefits. I’ve got no problem going there (VA regional center)

R: I’m interested in how people stay connected with the community while they’re in service and out of service?

V: You get together with friends, I had gotten together with Tom. I met up with him at a bar. Vs going to the big methodist baptist university hospital. Since he’s lost his job, I think he would consider the VA now if he had to.

R:

V: I’d like to be independent, I know I can’t be right now, but that’s why I like the VA. For me right now, it saves us money. With everything uncertain right now, it saves us money. That’s got to be our bottom line right now

R: thinking about anything else that would make experience talking with and contacting VA easier? Anything we haven’t mentioned?

V: I don’t know if it’s, it goes back to maybe more staffing to answer things quicker and things like that. The options are good, you can ask questions, on the VA site, talk to someone on the phone. Making information available to people who might not go to a VA site, who might need help, tell them how to get in touch with somebody. Maybe even online, put out ads. If veterans need help, if you can’t get a hold of them right away try again but call this number

R: how long? What’s the timeline from inquiry to response?  

V: in the VA world, anywhere to 4 to 6 working days to get a response, answer, date or time change with appointments. If you are in the system, it’s easier, if you are not in the system, not easier, takes longer.

R:

V: Getting in the system is. Getting in is kind of like, okay you need this, you need this. Once you get started, great. Once you’re in, it’s easier to get the things you need. To get in, it’s kind of like you’re trying to get into a sorority or fraternity.

R: initiation process

V: exactly

R: don’t have any more questions. Would like to stay in touch, and show you

V: Absolutely

R: any folks we can contact?

V: I can check with friends. sign me up, more than happy to help.

R: We’re interested, a lot of vets give back and we don’t realize if you’re helping your friends navigate forms, we want to make sure you get what you need so if you are helping people you’re able to do that. Would love to stay in touch, thankful for your feedback and ideas

V: Sure, sounds interesting. I’ll tell you all day long what you want to hear.
