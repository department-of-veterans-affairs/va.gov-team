## Notes

Where would you go to to submit a question or comment to the VA? 

* (Scrolls whole page until he reaches the bottom) I scrolled all the way down and there's a contact us with a plus    (on staging.va.gov)

What do you expect to see on a ‘Contact us’ page?

*  Did not capture

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Allentown PA.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself and that you want to find out kinds of glasses you can get with your benefits.

*  Did not capture

Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is that what you expected to happen?

*  I see all of the  information to whoever sent it?

# Questions

Now that you’ve seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?

* if it says sign in then i  probably would, yeah 

Since you said signing in at the beginning, a lot of it would be already filled in

* yea thats good 

_Chapters:  What was your impression of chapters?_

*  Did not capture

Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see?

* Re: info on confirmation page:  Doesn't matter to me 

Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?

*   You have to get all of the information from them so it's a win or lost situation, but you have  to get the information somehow 

Do you like to be contacted by email, mail, or phone? 

* Phone as in text? That or email is fine  

_Review chapter_

What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info

*  No, I’m in and out  

If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

* Did not capture 

_In general_

Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?

* Did not capture

_Content_

We simplified the categories in the drop down menu - what was that experience like? Did you feel confused?

* Yea, it all makes sense to me 

_GI Bill_

Have you ever used GI Bill? 

* Yes,back in 2000

So the idea is that GI Bill is a separate form and the contact us experience doesn't include all of it but we are looking into combining it into one place Do you feel like it's useful to have it in one place?

* Yes

_Single text box for search_

Thinking of another way of navigating through the categories, would it be easier to have a text box that you can type into and the categories would be filtered based on what you typed?

* Yea, it's simple and quick, easy

If you have to choose which would you go with? Just type in what you want? I’d want the big box


_Secure messaging_

We are exploring the idea of secure messaging so that if you sent a message to  the VA you'd have one place to see it (in addition to the email). Would that be useful?

* Definitely 

How often do you think you would check it?
* It depends on if I have health issues or need to go see the doctor. So when I need it. 

_Contact Us_

We're working with another team so I'll show you something that they are working on. They want to have  a place that is a front door to contacting the VA. Like resources and support, FAQs, and providing guides, and they would point to the Ask a Question page, also provide numbers to call, and a list of tools that people are using frequently like their appointments, do you think anything is missing do you find it useful?

* I like it, it's helpful

Do you find yourself taking a lot of time to find out where something is on the website?

* No

Would you by default pick up the phone? 

* It depends on whether or not I'm getting  the information that I need

Is there any type of information that you would call for? Do you remember the last time you were searching for information?

* I just turned 50 so i needed a colonoscopy and I had call the VA to be connected to the correct people  
Is there any other feedback to make this form better for you to make it the form of your dreams?

* Nothing really, just finding the number or info that I need to get in contact with somebody right away by phone or email so I don't have to wait as soon as possible 

In something like the medical list when you see a list of geographic things, do you look for your state first and then your town?

* I look for california and then my town 

Would seeing the address be useful?

* Definitely, i'd find it eventually but it'd be nice

If you didn't know what something meant in the dropdowns would it be nice to have a glossary?

* Sure, it'd be helpful 

R: Any final feedback?

* I think it's very useful and i think if i did have an idea i would be able to contact somebody?

Like a specific person?

* Yes, the idea is that because the VA has so many different parts, the education people can see it and it gets sent to the right folks. Like if you know a vso officer?
* Sure, but as long as i get directed to the right people and get my questions answered

Thank you and thank you for your service (:
* (:
