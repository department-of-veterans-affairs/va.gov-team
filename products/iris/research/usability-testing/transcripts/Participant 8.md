# IRIS Usability Testing Notes

P8.IRIS usability testing.202012161200 (2020-12-16 12pm)

## Participant Info

Do you have any accessibility requirements - do you use any assistive technology to access any part of va.gov (a screen reader or magnifier, for example)?  Yes (and what technology) / No

* No

## Tech and mobile usage

What type of desktop, tablet and phone do you use (and operating system).  How long have you had that?

* HP laptop
* “Do they make big computers anymore? (laughs)”
* iPhone
* Uses mobile phone 90% of the time to access VA.gov

What do you used to access va.gov and where do you access it?

* Safari

What browser do you use to access IRIS?

* Safari

Generally, how comfortable would you say you are with technology? Novice/Intermediate/Savvy?

* between novice and intermediate, “I’m pretty savvy but technologically if there’s something a little more complex, I get frustrated, but for the most part, I’m pretty good at figuring things out. And if I don’t know, my geek tech husband will be able to figure it out”

## Product Experience

Have you contacted the VA? If so, when and how 

* I actually called the VA a couple weeks ago

How often have you used IRIS? 

* Because we were checking the status of his comp/ben appeal so it was easier to call them bc the information isn’t always up to date on the app
* How often have you used IRIS? Maybe once or twice a month, a lot of times it’s used to re-order meds, but for the most part for any little question, I’ll go on the IRIS app

Did you use the COVID-19 Chatbot? If yes, how was that experience - do you usually use a chatbot? 

* Annie on VA website - I don’t like it as much as I like COVID coach (?) app - Find it easier to navigate the covid coach app
* Not a big fan of chatbots actually, I find them to be… sometimes not understanding what you want, so it seems to take longer to get what you want
* Do you use FAQs? Yes I do use FAQs if it’s something I haven’t already done. For instance, to try to get the phone number to call to check the status of the appeal bc it wasn’t the regional number it was the main VA”s number

What was the reason you were using IRIS?

*  did not capture

## Notes

Where would you go to to submit a question or comment to the VA? 

* There’s all these different things, I need to move some things around to find it. I would click Contact Us to see if there’s any FAQs or search a specific question, but my mouse is no longer moving. If I had a specific question, I would type it.
What do you expect to see on a ‘Contact us’ page?

*  n/a

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Allentown PA.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself and that you want to find out kinds of glasses you can get with your benefits.

* he user thinks typically such a page will provide: Search a question, call in, send a question functionalities 
* Generally I wouldn't sign in, I only sign in if it’s something specific for instance medicine refill, because it could just be me giving feedback, an experience good or bad, I might want to remain anonymous
* (start message without signing in)
*  Chose Health/Medical issues & services > Medical care issues at specific facility 
*  Husband is “creature of habit”, doesn’t want to switch facilities, still goes to the one in PA
*  Looking for facility, “Can’t I just type?” (scroll seems slow or laggy?) It would make it easier if while I was in that box, I could type a few letters to start the search
*  If i have a problem i would say the problem with my glasses - so not a question
*  How do you generally like being contacted? Phone, well depends on what it is, but in this case, problem with my glasses so I want them to call me back. *  For something different, might want them to email me
*  Make sure everything is correct and then I would submit it (reviews as she goes)
*  Make sure I didn’t mess anything up, review that everything is correct, and then I would think there would be something that says thank you for your question, we will be in contact with you shortly or give me an immediate confirmation number or something so I can track it if they don’t contact me, an incident number, that way you know one, it’s submitted and two, that you have something to look back at. I’m a paper person, because I work with attorneys. I have everything organized
*  Having the conf number? Yeah that’s perfect, it does say too print this page for your records, so if I don’t hear back

Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is that what you expected to happen?

*  n/a

# Questions

Now that you’ve seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?

* n/a

_Chapters:  What was your impression of chapters?_

*  Chapters? Yes like if my husband was filling this out and doesn’t have the patience, knowing what step of what, is helpful. For other veterans or spouses who need to know, I’m on step 1, I have 3 more steps to go. That is very helpful. I think that is extremely helpful

Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see?

* n/a

Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?

* I always question the service number, because 9 times out of 10, I don’t see his service number, maybe in parentheses put “if applicable” or “if known” (next to this field), but it also doesn’t show it’s not required. So people don’t go crazy trying to find numbers that they can’t find, like I’ve done that!
* Intuitive selection of topics? Yes
* Haven’t used GI Bill


_Review chapter_

What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info

* Review page intuitive? Yeah because if you make a mistake, it’s easier to make a mistake if you’re in a hurry
* (Type search) if it would make the process a bit quicker, perhaps helpful? But then again, not every subject will be able to be searched that way

If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

* n/a

_In general_

Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?

* Secure messaging - My husband has signed up for MHV.  Yes definitely, centralized SM would be helpful
* I always question the service number, because 9 times out of 10, I don’t see his service number, maybe in parentheses put “if applicable” or “if known” (next to this field), but it also doesn’t show it’s not required. So people don’t go crazy trying to find numbers that they can’t find, like I’ve done that!
* Intuitive selection of topics? Yes
* Haven’t used GI Bill
* Review page intuitive? Yeah because if you make a mistake, it’s easier to make a mistake if you’re in a hurry
* (Type search) if it would make the process a bit quicker, perhaps helpful? But then again, not every subject will be able to be searched that way


Magic wand suggestions?

* I don’t think so, trying to think off the top of my head


Global Contact Us page/R&S

* (Seemed to like the designs)
* I like the block in the middle of the page, it stands out and in a different color, that’s just like why don’t you check here before you go, brings your attention to look here first, normal ppl would look there first. It’s still on the Contact Us page, but it’s in a spot where you can do minor things before you ask a question.
