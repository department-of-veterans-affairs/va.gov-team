## Product Experience

Have you contacted the VA? If so, when and how 

*   couple of trips to the VA, and didn’t take care of the problem even though they should have (at Friday afternoon appointment); they gave a tip about Mission Act; accessing va.gov to find facilities near me to vacuum out my ear; wasn’t just washing out; that had urgent care on a weekend

Did you use the COVID-19 Chatbot? If yes, how was that experience - do you usually use a chatbot? 

*   No

What was the reason you were using IRIS?

*  Did not capture

## Notes

Where would you go to to submit a question or comment to the VA? 

* Contact Us at the navigation bar
* not able to scroll anything on Chrome on Windows; user is struggling to navigate through scroll the page; I’m afraid of disconnecting
* got to the top where they can see the VA.gov main bar that was covered by the coronavirus header

What do you expect to see on a ‘Contact us’ page?

*  did not capture

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Allentown PA.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself and that you want to find out kinds of glasses you can get with your benefits.

*  “Sign in” - I don’t have an account
*  Thinking.. I don’t remember, I probably do, I always use MHV
*  start without signing


Now go ahead and fill in the rest of the form - you can just use fake data. (test@test.com) - but don’t submit the form. (Stop them after they’ve filled out their contact info, before they get to the submit page)

*  I had laser correction after cataracts, and won’t need eyeglasses. 
*  Health & Medical
*  closest would be “but the I don’t feel accurately describe my glasses, if I had to pick one, I’ll use “Prothestics” is not correct, but I will choose that
*  eye glases, ah, okay
*  allentown
*  Question - Should I fill this out? “my glasses do not feel comfortable… hurt my ears…” -how’s that?
*  do you want my social security number?
*  complete? Last 4? They want the whole; if it’s last 4, it’ll say there; I’ll put complete
*   idk if the VA is changing that, but i’ve noticed when they’re asking for my social security number  in ful
*  Service number - don’t remember; it will be AS something. Why do i have to add my service start date? For my glasses? Maybe to distinguish you
*  Claim number - i guess i would have one if i had glasses
*  i don’t have the exact dates; can I just put anything in here? I’ll hav eto grab my ID
*  i’ll skip this
*  how should we get in touch? If it were my glasses - not urgent, then email If my ear, then i’ll put phone It’s in the system, old email address though, i’ll leave it 
*  Review “all looks good”, and collapses/uncollapses and review all

Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is that what you expected to happen?

* It will send it like email
* I think it will say something like my message has been sent
* “We’ve received your message”
* For glasses i would, but not for emergency

# Questions

Now that you’ve seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?

* See above

_Chapters:  What was your impression of chapters?_

* Um, to answer that, yes, that was good, that was fine
* Mobile use - When i’m away from my laptop/home, then i would use it on my phone 10:35 MHV - get a response from mhv, get a email notification and will access the response; and i access that on my phone
* On secure messaging: In a perfect world, “with all the veterans, with all the various aspects of VA, benefits, doctor, for simplicity sake, it would be okay to have a central place; it would be not workable; it would be frustrating for a wider audience. There’s so many different places within the application to find the thing you’re looking for
order , it’s not the problem for me, order is fine 

Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see?

* “Is this the first time you’re contacting us for this issue” or is it a follow up? Have you previously contacted us for this? Would be useful.

Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?

* Idk why people are assigned service number, they’re asking ssn, idk why they’re asking for service number, doesn’t seem necessary; that’s one thing I would take off
* Social security number is adequate
* Categories are confusing; “list of categories were confusing to me”
* Number of questions are adequate, minus the better qualification of the “first drop down of why you are contacting us “not overwhelming that some people might “forget it”

_Review chapter_

What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info

*  Most valuable - because not necessarily, you see a mistake, cable bill , and missed a routing number change, and got a 30 fee, and didn’t have a chance to correct and it was already sent
*  Review button Really, really like that a lot
*  For first glance, it looks good. 
*  Contacting VA: this year - being a covid year, I’m also a deputy commander for VA, but haven’t been able to do anything; any of contact has been ; most my contact has been for health questions; i have done my pre-burial for myself, my adult son has autism, and on the autism spectrum, took 2 years for burial with me; got rejected; and got approved for review board
*  I’ve used VA for Numerous forms to find it

GI Bill

* Looked at it; but don’t qualify. Been out of the service for years; after years of discharge, no longer (qualify)

If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

*   did not capture

Contact us

* List of phone numbers is great; that’s also a frustration; where do I even start to figure out who to call, and would be great to have that
* (nods) Contact directory - my clinic; my nurse on the ENT wouldn’t see me, so, there she said: for Mission act, call this, number’s been changed; could be very frustrating when doctors send you wrong numbers
* That would be great
* (nods) “Schedule and view appointments” - common links

_In general_

Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?

* Did not capture

_Content_

We simplified the categories in the drop down menu - what was that experience like? Did you feel confused?

* Did not capture

Other comments

* Before sending message, at least options, and the numbers to call; most helpful to have that; great addition to that
* Chatbot?  I would find it very useful; and others will too; 
* Opportunity to find in a chat would be great addition
* Searching by keywords = that’s what i would do “keyword search” would be helpful to send you to the form or the contact number
* Three dropdown vs single dropdown where you can just search
* “So user friendly!” that’s key; keyword search there
* My former husband was in Vietnam, and has PTSD, lot of younger ones, have PTSD and gets frustrated; very easily; because of PTSD; will alleviate a lot of stress for those people
* Glossary/cheat sheet - Before you got the glasses - didn’t know how to get to the dropdown. Cheat sheets would be helpful; issues you know how to contact for. “Less is more” because then not relating to 
* “They send you to another screen to find another screen”; “just concise list would be best”
* I’m glad it was helpful. It’s a privilege to participate in this. Sometimes it will go to my junk folder and it’s too late”
* I appreciate the fact that Veterans can offer input because we’re using this
* You’re very good at what you do
* Why would I participate if I’m not honest with my feedback
* “I thank you very much”
* “Appreciate your time, you’re a great moderator”
