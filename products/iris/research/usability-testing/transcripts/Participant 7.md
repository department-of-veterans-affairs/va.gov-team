# IRIS Usability Testing Notes

P7.IRIS usability testing.202012161000 (2020-12-16 10am)

## Participant Info

Do you have any accessibility requirements - do you use any assistive technology to access any part of va.gov (a screen reader or magnifier, for example)?  Yes (and what technology) / No

* no

## Tech and mobile usage

What type of desktop, tablet and phone do you use (and operating system).  How long have you had that?

* HP laptop, generally what I use for work, I do have an ipad and iphone, would never get a mac laptop, not that technologically smart, have enough trouble dealing with the iphone. I actually have another small HP that I bought on a whim but I generally don’t use it anymore

What do you used to access va.gov and where do you access it?

* my phone, because it’s always in my hand  (used phone for testing)

What browser do you use to access IRIS?

* on iphone safari, on computer it’s google chrome

Generally, how comfortable would you say you are with technology? Novice/Intermediate/Savvy?

## Product Experience

Have you contacted the VA? If so, when and how 

* (On how they contacted) It depends on where I’m at, If I’m at home I use the computer if I’m out I use my phone Last contacted VA about a week ago. Actually went in to the office.

How often have you used IRIS? 

*  did not capture

Did you use the COVID-19 Chatbot? If yes, how was that experience - do you usually use a chatbot? 

*  I have, downloaded… the VA COVID coach and MHV (that’s for my husband). Which I learned about through a caregiver phone call. I do a lot of, the webinars and stuff that orgs are doing due to COVID, Elizabeth Dolan org (?), I’ve sat through most of their series as well
* Vet is still living in Georgia, still using HP laptop with Google chrome, still has ipad and iphone and uses Safari there
* Not live agent chat: those are a little harder because you usually don’t get to the answer that you need

What was the reason you were using IRIS?

* did not capture

## Notes

Where would you go to to submit a question or comment to the VA? 

* did not capture
 
What do you expect to see on a ‘Contact us’ page?

* did not capture

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Allentown PA.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself and that you want to find out kinds of glasses you can get with your benefits.

* Would probably sign in
* Hesitating reading labels
* Scrolls down all of page 2 before filling anything out.
* fill in all of this too? I guess if you don’t sign in you have to fill the fields in.  Autofill on phone

Now go ahead and fill in the rest of the form - you can just use fake data. (test@test.com) - but don’t submit the form. (Stop them after they’ve filled out their contact info, before they get to the submit page)

*  
Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is that what you expected to happen?

*  

# Questions

Now that you’ve seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?

*   

_Chapters:  What was your impression of chapters?_

*  Did not capture

Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see?

*   It was pretty easy to navigate dropdowns

Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?

* “It makes sense,” didn’t think it was too many fields
* Did not feel like there was extra information or too many words on the page

_Review chapter_

What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info

*  Useful to review your information, because I tend to mistype when I’m in a hurry

If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

* Did not capture

_In general_

Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?

*   

_Content_

We simplified the categories in the drop down menu - what was that experience like? Did you feel confused?

*   


_ GI Bill_

Vet has used GI Bill things before - is combining them a good idea? 

* Yes, it is useful for GI Bill and the main Contact Us to be combined


_Single text box for search

Ability to search, dropdown menus - One search box instead of dropdown?

* Yes, that would be useful (‘There are times I can’t find exactly what I’m looking for, if I could search it, that would help’)

_Secure messaging_

* is registered with MHV, has sent messages through it.  Yes, it would be useful to have one secure messaging place
With secure messaging, it takes them days to even read it, or respond.
* Yes, it would be useful to have a status like “message received”
