# IRIS Usability Testing Notes

P3.IRIS usability testing.202012141400(2020-12-14 2pm)

## Participant Info

Do you have any accessibility requirements - do you use any assistive technology to access any part of va.gov (a screen reader or magnifier, for example)?  Yes (and what technology) / No

* Retired military, do a lot with the VA, retired 6 years ago, 100% disabled, most medical stuff is through VA, lots of equipment, it’s great because as they get more and more tech advanced, there’s more stuff I can use
* I have a hearing aid (new since last session), linked through bluetooth?

## Tech and mobile usage

What type of desktop, tablet and phone do you use (and operating system).  How long have you had that?

* Windows laptop + Desktop + tablet + android phone
* I do enjoy apps, I like the rewards (?) app, shop through the app for different places, I like that my history and account stuff is there, I appreciate that part of it
* Her computer doesn’t do BT, so that’s the only challenge, but she can call in to use it
* VA Apps on her phone: Prescription app, VA Retail app (used recently), tried to use some others but had issues with her DSLogon acting up, there’s two other login things now (MHV and ID.me), but for some reason the ID.me doesn’t let her login on her phone, that’s been the only thing, login has been funky


What do you used to access va.gov and where do you access it?

* Laptop

What browser do you use to access IRIS?

* Chrome?

Generally, how comfortable would you say you are with technology? Novice/Intermediate/Savvy?

*  Probably intermediate, maybe 5 years ago I’d say I was pretty savvy
*  But now more at the consumer level, when I need to update something, I’m not having to go to my teen to get something now :) 

## Product Experience

Have you contacted the VA? If so, when and how 

* I used to call for everything or go in, now that a lot of the stuff is getting streamlined, I’ll send Messages to primary care and pharmacy etc. Things are more accessible online than they would be, most stuff is on the web now
* 85% online - 15% is requests involving phone - from clinic, medical etc. or case manager.
* Sometimes I don't find an answer and they call me back i f i can’t find it.

How often have you used IRIS? 

*  Frequency: ~Once a month
*  Some of this is more than in the past, bc of COVID, 
*  Many of my appointments got cancelled and I’m trying to get back on in the queue 
sometimes I call and leave messages but could be the wrong number, so I find it better sometimes to use IRIS and get it handled there, asking a question
*  I’ve been able to get a prescription fixed that’s been wrong for years (!!), so it’s been shortening the red tape which has been really good


Did you use the COVID-19 Chatbot? If yes, how was that experience - do you usually use a chatbot? 

* Trying to think - it prompted me - yes, done
* If you saw a chatbot, would you reach for that? FAQs? If have a specific problem, say I did a search real quick, but couldn’t find the answer, I would use the chatbot, or if I know I need to talk to someone, I would call . Sometimes the questionnaires like that get a little tedious, that’s the only thing, don’t want to go through the 10 levels of that, did you say you want baloney?
* Did you say you wanted - clippy

What was the reason you were using IRIS?

*  Did not capture in notes

## Notes

Participant joined by phone! :) 

Where would you go to to submit a question or comment to the VA? 

* Where would you go to submit a question - I would normally scroll down to the bottom, look for contact me - contact us button
* Why Bottom? - antique thought process - contact us is traditionally at the bottom, if I was looking for something specific I might use the search bar, and kinda poke around, but that’s my first instinct going to the bottom
* So I see the Contact Us, they say it’s equal to the Form 0873, so that’s good that means it’s an official thing, save time and save your work in progress, sign in, oh yeah good idea, so I would sign in, (see login screen) so I would normally use MHV
* DS login always hokey on my computer 

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Allentown PA.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself and that you want to find out kinds of glasses you can get with your benefits.

*  I would hit start your question, which category best describes your message?  Health and medical probably, chosen
*  Maybe prosthetics or medical issues, guessing with prosthetics  so I’ll go with that, then chose eyeglasses
*  I would rotate my screen so I can see the full description
*  Found the Medical center list Allentown PA
*  Asking if the glasses are covered under her current benefits
*  I turned my screen bc sometimes it cuts off what you can see and click on (intuitive about this possibility)
*  Fills out generic/dummy SSN, DOB,
*  “Service number is not required, so I’m not even going to mess with it”
*  Tried to submit and saw the SSN validation, oh dashes are allowed (so she scrolled back up and added dashes)
*  Her example on another form, there was no validation while she was typing in DOB, so she had to call to find out the issue
*  Using pseudonym “imalittlepiggy” Imalil Piggeaux? :) for spam
*  Review page: Crosses/hashtags that open boxes - maybe I would have verified but then I would have clicked on submit
*  Good to be able to verify info.  Especially if you do have glasses
*  Confirmation number good

Now go ahead and fill in the rest of the form - you can just use fake data. (test@test.com) - but don’t submit the form. (Stop them after they’ve filled out their contact info, before they get to the submit page)

*  (user completed actions)

Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is that what you expected to happen?

*  Not captured in notes


# Questions

Now that you’ve seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?

*  Use autofill - lazy that way. I like that
*  Chapters were good, separate pieces, seemed intuitive
*  At first I was a little, like which section (dropdown) should it be (talking about choosing prosthetics)
*  When I didn’t see the full description, I was able to turn my phone and see for each category, that was nice (mobile friendly)
*  Only thing is if my medical center was in the middle of the list (alphabetically) - like m - want to save time and type in a letter or select a letter (typeahead search!)
*  Understood everything - maybe in first categories (drop down) - is it benefits issue?
*  That’s kind of how the VA is - not sure if a little pop-up (chatbot?) - yeah, or a definition or something (tool tip?) - parenthesis - definition or explain
*  I liked how I was able to go back and forth and it didn’t clear everything
*  I like how you could click the little crosses or hashes to review what you have in there

Magic wand: what else would you add??

*  Let me go back to the different category section real quick just to see…

_Chapters:  What was your impression of chapters?_

* did not answer or answer not captures

Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see? Were there too many/not enough things on the page? 

* I think it was about right, I like that y’all have the service number and claim number, a lot of vets go by that stuff, when they’re older in the service  so it’s good to have it there just in case, I like that it’s optional though, my stuff is already tied in with that

Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?

* did not answer or answer not captures

_Review chapter_

What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info?

* did not answer or answer not captures

If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

* did not answer or answer not captures

_In general_

Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?

* Signing in: It did say down there you could send a message without signing in, but that’s actually interesting… I always kind of felt like I had to sign in to send a message, so I have. but even if the login was giving me a hassle, that’s ok because I could still send a message so that’s good, that’s actually pretty cool

_Content_

We simplified the categories in the drop down menu - what was that experience like? Did you feel confused?

* did not answer or answer not captures

_Additional notes

GI Bill experience

* A few years ago went through this process with my husband, I was the caretaker, did application for myself recently, haven’t used it yet myself though, still in the application process
* (We’re looking to combine GI Bill/IRIS forms) That could be helpful actually, because what I find, for some reason where I live, I exactly 49.2 mi from this Austin VA and 49.3 mi from the Temple VA, so exactly in the middle, but I prefer Temple because otherwise I get stuck in traffic and it’s right by the center
* If gi bill was tied to main profile so it defaults to Temple and knows where i go then that could be good - temple or austin
(Looking at GI Bill categories in the IRIS form on her phone) Oh yeah, now I see the topics, oh now I’m post 9/11, so I’ve transferred my allotment to my dependent just in case before I got out, I have two juniors in high school, so definitely will be looking at this next year. (filled out options from the GI Bill top dropdown) Oh that’s cool, yeah that would be helpful, cut out some of that red tape
* Inquiry: Sometimes it’s gotten rerouted - at this point just putting a note in that it’s wrong location, but i still have to call.

Single text box for search - useful?

* I do use it but the only question i would have is - is my mind thinking the same way the category is set up.

R&S
* That’s nice to have that, people might not know what they’re looking for
I don’t like to call necessarily, but if I’m in the parking lot or something, I left that piece of paper at home, so I could look up information like that or something
* I really like the little shortcuts page (Helpful online tools links?), especially if you’re just hopping on to check appointments or direct deposits or claims, not to have to go through 10 diff things, being able to just click, that’s pretty nice

Is the ability to customize important to you? 

* I think about my banking app, when I go to my front page, I can see my tiles, just my accounts or budget or whatever, so for this, yeah that would make sense. The couple of things that I always need (like a quick MyVA page)
We got new ducks and they decided to go in the pool! Mama duck with her 5 ducklings! Re-homed them, they are so cute, found the pool in 30 degree weather haha <3 
* I’ve had doctors appts on my phone, that’s been really nice, bc of COVID and stuff.

Ways to make things easier?

* Google and search - on my phone, maybe way to have it from the VA
* It makes me feel important to be able to give back to my country still (via usability testing)
* Rotated screen to see full - Android formatting weird issue - not va.gov style.  Keyboard affecting visibility of form - android?
