# IRIS Usability Testing Notes

P10.IRIS usability testing.202012171000 (2020-12-17 10am)

## Participant Info

Do you have any accessibility requirements - do you use any assistive technology to access any part of va.gov (a screen reader or magnifier, for example)?  Yes (and what technology) / No

* no

* (about IRIS) It’s absolutely amazing, it’s amazing, I appreciate what you are doing. Its amazing. Its been a paradigm shift. I have been with the VA 30 years. Anything I can do to help the VA, pls dont hesitate to call. 
* In the military system, have to wait. And vets get confused and frustrated. 

## Tech and mobile usage

What type of desktop, tablet and phone do you use (and operating system).  How long have you had that?

* iPhone 8
* 2018/2019 Macbook Pro
* Google Fiber
* I have been connected forever
* Was involved with eBay when it got started 
* Friends of mine from high school were part of 30 original engg for Google
Went to school with Jimmy Wales (who started Wikipedia) - I can call him anytime. He’s not a rich guy, he came through the system. We weren’t flashing & burning the Amazon rainforests 
* Jim makes about 125K per year from Wiki - if he’d run it like Bezos he’d monetized everything and we would have got where we are now lot sooner


What do you used to access va.gov and where do you access it?

* Between Phone & laptop: Its kinda seamless, when I need info, I somehow get it. Most of my VA info, I do it on my ‘box’, I’m nearsighted 

What browser do you use to access IRIS?

* Chrome

Generally, how comfortable would you say you are with technology? Novice/Intermediate/Savvy?

*  I changed out the battery in my laptop, I’m as comfortable as I need to, and if I can’t fix it, I go get another one. 

## Product Experience

Have you contacted the VA? If so, when and how 

* VA called me yesterday. As far as me contacting the VA, I have direct line to most of my primary care people. After you have been in the process for long enough, the protocol goes out the window. I have the cellphone number for the lead nurse. I’m not going to call unless I need them.
* Why phone vs web vs the same way all the time? Old school - old man way. In the old days, you get on the phone, have 3 hours waiting and you make the best of it. Now with all the instantaneous stuff, you don’t have time to read.

Do you use FAQs, product guides, generally

* No, usually the facts are stuff that usually don’t answer anything anyway. Does that make senae? Its not really going to drill down into what I’m looking for. 
* I get most of my drilldown info from archive Reddit, that operates in realtime. The Vets section in Reddit is phenomenal. Reddit operates 24/7 and there are people who don’t know what they are talking about, there’s another section like us who know and we can provide the info to those people. 
*  https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/ Its evolved far better than Facebook. 
* He’s with a mid-western or great Plains state UniversityVets office. The guy is good. He doesn’t get paid, but he knows stuff.  (we should run the form by him)
* Many vets establish themselves as informal experts/hubs and direct other vets 


How often have you used IRIS? 

*  not captured

Did you use the COVID-19 Chatbot? If yes, how was that experience - do you usually use a chatbot? 

*   not captured

What was the reason you were using IRIS?

*  not captured

## Notes

Where would you go to to submit a question or comment to the VA? 

* Lets see..probably I would ‘topic-ally’. Family member or Health care.. Hmm.. thats a good question. I’m trying to look at it.. ‘From my perspectibee’ or a Consumer’s perspective,  I would go to the heading under what I was looking for, and then drill down from there. 

 
What do you expect to see on a ‘Contact us’ page?

* not captured

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Allentown PA.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself and that you want to find out kinds of glasses you can get with your benefits.

* Now I gotta sign in. So I’m gonna need to sign in. And once I sign in, i need to go back or it will run me straight thru with my stuff prefilled.
* Do you generally sign in? Yeah yuou have to. DoD tosses you out every 90 days if you don’t use it. It drives many of us crazy.
* Category, sub-topic, looking for Allentown next  Its not ‘alphabetical’.. Ah-ha ah-ha.. (starts signing Billy Joel’s Allentown! :) )
* Such a list - I’d do it by State, and then break it down from there, Tennessee valley health care - doesn’t cross state lines. 

Now go ahead and fill in the rest of the form - you can just use fake data. (test@test.com) - but don’t submit the form. (Stop them after they’ve filled out their contact info, before they get to the submit page)

* ‘Can’t see’ - free text question
* A general question, click on Continue 
* Plays around with ‘Suffix’ - only goes to ‘IV’? I’m joking.  A friend of mine is ‘IV’ and his son is ‘V’

R: How do u like to be contacted 
V: I like hard copy because a lot of times (well its not as bad as it used to be). Well if anyone contacted you via email from VA, you cannot believe it. They just send out the most unmitigated garbage that I have seen for years. All of a sudden it stopped. It seems like they figured it out. If you send people a wall of junk all the time, they are not going to pay attention to it. ‘You guys have helped to make it stop.’


Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is that what you expected to happen?

* Delete all info, and I will have to wait forever.. Haha. Seriously: It will submit this info and will send some kind of receipt to my email. If i dont get something immediately in a bounce back as a receipt, it will make my stomach hurt. Now I’ll ‘Send’ the info. 

R: Conf page: Is that the right kind of info to get?
V: yeah, thats awesome 

# Questions

Now that you’ve seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?

* I hate signing in.. from your perspective, with bots and things, you need to protect yourself from pre-qualifying people, there’s a gatekeeping that needs to exist. Me not wanting to sign in. Your defensive posture outweighs my inconvenience. Some people are petulant. My kind of people need to understand that. 
* Moderator: The sign in box helps to talk about some of those benefits, do people just scan past it. V: I did not read the blue box. Honestly I wouldn’t give them that option, I would make them sign in.
The idea is to get these people registered on these system. I don’t understand the premium they do for members vs others. That seems ‘elitist’. It seems to be if you are a veteran, no one needs to give you the illusion that you are not already an enhanced user. I’m an Amex Platinum user, I’m ‘That guy’, I can probably run it better than Wilky could. Are u a premium member? Do I need to give you another ‘kidney’? What else do you want? 


_Chapters:  What was your impression of chapters?_

*  No. I like the dropdown. The Vision is a bit tricky. Brooklyn is a nutty place to let your mind wander. The initial thing: Its just ‘I’m not sure what I’m trying to say’. Its minutiae. People will get bogged down anyway. 

Idea of a big search box, instead of the multiple dropdown?

* Yeah, i think that would dumb it down when even old ‘?’ can understand.

Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see?

* did not capture

Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?

* did not capture

_Review chapter_

What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info

*  did not capture


If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

*  did not capture

_In general_

Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?

If u had a magic wand..

*  Hmmm.. No. I would also throw that to my email. The conf message send to email as well.  And if I actually read that (conf msg), it would have been better too. 



_Combining IRIS and GI Bill_

Did you have a chance to use GI Bill related benefits or. programs 

* Yes

They have their own hub and separate form. We want to combine. So its all in one place.

* Yes, that is SO necessary, since there are so many competing fiefdoms. If u go on VA.gov, they have 57 different sub-degradations. What in the world was anybody thinking! Its all 1974 internet yak! Its embarrassing! 
Hope this isn’t my missile tracking system

_Secure messaging:_

Log in and see all your messages in one place 

* Yes, and having different formats/different colors for education vs health care vs different stuff - if you can make them look different within the content of email, if you are getting messages from one vs the other - when you are trying to sort through it...my god the health care system sends SO much junk.. Its tough to sort that stuff out!

+Preview of Global Contact Us page_

More of a landing page, with R&S, FAQs, guides, etc. Encourage people to look at this before sending a message. One place to start putting phone numbers, other quick links, etc. Will you use this before you send a msg. 

* Yes definitely. People are used to having a lot of info at their fingertips. And they are going to get less in love with calling with VA. If they can find what they want, they will leave you alone.  You mean I need to write something down, with verbiage and language!
