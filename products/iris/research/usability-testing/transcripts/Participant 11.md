# IRIS Usability Testing Notes

P11.IRIS usability testing.202012171200  (2020-12-17 12pm)

## Participant Info

Do you have any accessibility requirements - do you use any assistive technology to access any part of va.gov (a screen reader or magnifier, for example)?  Yes (and what technology) / No

* Did not capture

## Tech and mobile usage

What type of desktop, tablet and phone do you use (and operating system).  How long have you had that?

* PC laptop, Dell, Win 10
* MacBook Pro = personal
* iPhone

What do you used to access va.gov and where do you access it?

* Work laptop (Win)
* Not phone - hasn’t tried.  Is usually a duration of time that he’s on VA.gov and easier on the computer since he takes notes
* Notes = tracking benefits claim and appeals/supplement claim.  Helps him prepare for an in-depth conversation
* Prints sometimes but not as much as he takes notes.  At 50 there are some things - helps him remember if he writes it down

What browser do you use to access IRIS?

* Did not capture

Generally, how comfortable would you say you are with technology? Novice/Intermediate/Savvy?

* Is comfortable but likes to write things down to help him remember

## Product Experience

Have you contacted the VA? If so, when and how 

* July 2020 - request for a benefit.  He wanted to see if could get money for education.  Needed to prove employability.  Had to do the work for that online, and then go back and add more, then talk to a person. Claim is for VRNE.

How often have you used IRIS? 

* Claim is vrne (?)

Did you use the COVID-19 Chatbot? If yes, how was that experience - do you usually use a chatbot? 

* No chatbot.  Hasn’t had a reason to.  Wanted to know positivity rate for the county and the visitor rate is based on that rate.
* Use chat if have an issue with something
* Chats in general are faster than calling and being put on hold for a while.  

What was the reason you were using IRIS?

*  Did not capture

## Notes

Where would you go to to submit a question or comment to the VA? 

* Thought it would depend on the topic that he was commenting on - was looking at Health care vs Disability blocks.
* Thought the links at the top level were really helpful.
* Had been trying to find out about ID cards and was happy to see that link.  “All the stuff that I need to look into is all right here”

What do you expect to see on a ‘Contact us’ page?

*  Did not capture
*  “That’s an interesting though about pre-filling my message based on nmu account details - not sure what predictive AI or ML you have going on in the back.”  Thought it was AI and not just using information that we already have to save him typing.
*  Don’t mind signing in - i expect.
* ‘is this the same as the IRIS form, same content’?

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Allentown PA.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself and that you want to find out kinds of glasses you can get with your benefits.

* He can’t do anything that he needs to do without signing in anyway so it doesn’t bother him to sign in.
* Would see if there are other things at the bottom that apply - is more higher-level stuff so goes back up
* Message - “Would glasses be considered Medical Devices?”  I’ll try that since it doesn’t really fit in anything else
* Found eyeglasses in the next drop-down
* Found Allentown “Got a Billy Joel song in my head”
* “How would I get replacement glasses as I just recently broken my pair and don’t have a backup with the current prescription”
* Bottom question Vet vs on behalf of a Veteran is “interesting” - “Some good options there”
* Surprised to see a second form “Oh, um, so.  All the claim numbers are SSN.  Not sure of the Services Numbers - do Veteran’s still use that instead of SSN?”
* The only thing that’s required is Branch of Service. “ Why is that significant in this setting?  Is there a Marine desk that will work with me?”
* Usually uses email for contact.  If doesn’t recognize a phone number he lets it go to voice mail.
* If not logged in he’s hesitant to put his SSN in

Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is that what you expected to happen?

*  Thinks it will ask for more information.  No - it’s letting him take a look at all the stuff he put in.  

# Questions

Now that you’ve seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?

* Not discouraging since he needs to log in for certain things anyway

_Chapters:  What was your impression of chapters?_

*  Hesitantly agreed ok but wasn’t easy to find optometry.

Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see?

* Seems right - assumes someone from the Allentown VA will take a look and then send him an email.
* SSN was never intended to be a unique ID for an individual but that’s what it is,  WOuld rather use something other than SSN so folks couldn’t steal his ID- use EDIPI 
* He has a common name so you won’t find him if you Google hm - there were 9 Daniel Scott’s on base so he needs something else to narrow it down,  Phone number or DOB.  Unique but can’t steal ID.
* Could the Service number be there for folks who have never signed up on va.gov?  Doing this without signing in could be either someone who has no ties with va or someone who does but can’t remember the password there is some other way to log in.  Wasn’t sure if he was a member of the VA

Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?
* The page with all the non-mandatory fields feels like superfluous information. Do you need it to narrow down who this person is? Last 4 of social also works.
* Re: multiple service time periods - so how do I add those in… which one do you want
* He has 3 dbd214s - has one from when he was enlisted, another from when he was commissioned because he went from reserve to active duty officer,  Therefore “Service Date” isn’t that simple. “Which one do you want?” These are all different ways of identifying somebody, so they make sense to him but are simultaneously superfluous.
* Start with state so he doesn’t have to find his way through Ohio and PA to find his clinic in VA.
* Is there a scalable mobile version for the younger folks who do everything on their phone. You can use your phone to say “this is my insurance card” can it also be my ID card?
* USAA uses app more than website.  Was in a car wreck so used that because had his phone to take pictures and was easier to then use the form on the phone so not need to upload to computer.

_Review chapter_

What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info

* Is helpful since it gives him a chance to look at it again.  

If there was a magic wand, what would you have it do?

* Not sure what he would have it do.

If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

* Did not capture

_In general_

Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?

* Did not capture

_Content_

We simplified the categories in the drop down menu - what was that experience like? Did you feel confused?

* Did not capture

Additional content

_Contact Us_
* Any place that takes al of your possible questions and helps you narrow it down is always a value-add.  Looks similar to what’s on the va.gov page.  Change you address would require a log-in, right.  Mark those things that are log-in required.  * One of the things that has been a challenge is trying to find my disabilities page - the one page that shows me all of my percentages  >> frequently-used pages or recently-used
* “Check your benefits” “That would save me an incredible amount of time and frustration”  Has not had to log into it for a while since the last time he needed to go in was to print a letter to send to the county for his property tax.
* Last week, works in a shop with someone who got out 10 years ago, and wanted to look into some of the things that he knows was caused by his time in the service.  
* Law Firm that has a VA benefits counselor.  You punch in the percentage and it tells you what you should get for benefits and tells you what you would get under that percentage.  He’s shown this to others.  There’s VA math that you need to understand 50% unhealthy and then keep figuring out the percentages.  Doesn’t understand the bilateral - the more left and right the more it jumps.  In order to accurately capture based on the US code, he need to research what he needs to do to meet the code and get the documentation (MP note - my neighbor’s son has spent 2 years trying to get his disability).  VA is creating a business for this lawform (Hill and Pond) - wants some sort of counseling on that page so he doesn’t need to call a lawyer to help him navigate.  
* He went through a DaD rep who helped him for 8 months who warned him that he would be surprised with the results, then that guy left and he had to figure it out “Google is my friend”  Was download DBQs.  Trying to figure out how to document his and finding apps.
* Vets help each other navigating the paperwork.  Using apps to document. 
* Any place that is usable to help take all the questions and narrow it down is going to be valuable. These all look similar to wha’ts on the VA page.  
* Check your claim - do I need to log in? Let people know login required after the ‘check login’.

_Use of FAQs, Chatbots, and why. Trustworthiness of them_

* Thinks chatbots are useful when you don’t want to hang out on hold or work your way through a phone tree.

_Secure messaging_

* Would have to look at - id try out a beta.
* “Conceptually that sounds OK” but is thinking about the practical solution.
* Need to make sure people know the limits that “secure” is not “instant” - what’s the SLA
* Ok to have this separate from MyHealtheVet? OK if everything is in one place.  Uses Hawkins MyChart so he doesn’t need to figure out which number to call, so he uses MyChart to send messages all the time.  This is a really good example.  “Why redo the work when there’s something else out there that works?”  Plagiarism is a good thing.

_Form consolidation of IRIS and GI Bill_

* When you see Education, there’s the Chapter 30 and the old form, if I had a question on the old one…? Yes, there it is in the drop-down.
* (MP Note - he’s been so trained on form numbers and filling out the right form that he wants to make sure that it’s the right form)
* When doing the VRW research he found himself bouncing around looking for information.
* Accessed GI Bill? Yes - he has looked into it
* Contact Us test - MHV + IRIS + GI? “A one-stop whop would make it more easier” for things related to the VA

_Expanded Search_

* It’s like anything else you get accustomed to - if you roll out something different…  Is there a still a section that helps me figure out if there’s a way to get my question answered (the prompts play a role since he main concern is getting an answer to a question)
* Can we tie that so that we type in glasses and it gets him to the point where he can skip the first three steps and it auto-fills them. 
* “Your lowest common denominator is the generation older than mine.”
