# IRIS Usability Study Notes

P1.IRIS usability testing.202012141000  (2020-12-14 10am)

## Participant Info

Do you have any accessibility requirements - do you use any assistive technology to access any part of va.gov (a screen reader or magnifier, for example)?  Yes (and what technology) / No

* No glasses, mobile limits for my right arm
* Clamp thing - VA took too long, clinic couldn’t get it right, so ended up paying for it out of pocket - also meds out of pocket
* When it comes to websites where I need both hands, lots of typing involved, then it’s a bit of a challenge, apply my creams and my medicine, if I need something at 4pm, then I’m on my own because I’m on central time, I have to change what I’m wearing to change the pressure here, I only wear a bra certain times, can’t lift it up, depends on my pain situation that changes how functional I can be that day
* Can’t sit in the car too long, chronic disorder? Never going to book appointments during certain times, i’m not going to start my day with the VA, the fact that the VA thinks that’s okay
* It affects when i use va.gov or paperwork - can’t sit in car etc.

## Tech and mobile usage

What type of desktop, tablet and phone do you use (and operating system).  How long have you had that?

* Answer: laptop Mac pro, sometimes mobile phone but mainly the computer but unless I’m taking one of my kids to the doctor and sitting in the car or taking care of my elderly father, my phone is an apple as well, I don’t have an android
* No facebook no instagram, don’t download things that want to access too much, I’m very wary of that Dont download VA apps on phone 

What do you used to access va.gov and where do you access it?
* Apple phone mac.os - always used mac for va.gov

What browser do you use to access IRIS?
* Safari

Generally, how comfortable would you say you are with technology? Novice/Intermediate/Savvy?
*  I definitely wouldn’t say I’m an expert on VA connect stuff, it wasn’t until I logged in, that I discovered I need to download an app I’m very fluid in word and excel, I know how to manipulate that, but if it’s something that I’ve never interacted with, then I’m okay saying I’m a novice


## Product Experience

Have you contacted the VA? If so, when and how 

*  Usually contact over the phone
*  I had to call Pensacola, curse them out, had to tell them I don’t understand, they don’t pick up their phone, they ask me if I have an appt, not communicating well with the VA right now (frustration at ppl who have changed their jobs, not in their usual roles since COVID)
*  Goes to location in person because of trust.

How often have you used IRIS? 

*  I’ve used it to send me a message, sends it straight to my cell phone but I don't actually know how to get there

Did you use the COVID-19 Chatbot? If yes, how was that experience - do you usually use a chatbot? 

*  Answer: No bc at this point, nothing aggravates me more than anything with the VA, unfortunately for me, I’ve already had too many times with the VA that haven’t gone well,
*  The way mental health works for me, esp if I’m in pain, I’m no longer patient, 7 months in,
I use MHV, that’s how I center the messages, but if you tell the VA to send msgs through there, they’ll insist on calling, if I ask them to call, they’ll send messages through there (frustration)
*  If I tell you the preference to contact me, then they just waste your time
*  I just told you that It’s better to contact me by phone, so I’m waiting for a call, I’m not feeling the VA, their lack of commitment or communication, I’m not interested in doing too many things, 
*  42 days later, they sent me a message every day, even though I asked them to call me! I’m ok with using whatever they want for communication, but I don’t think the preferred way has worked
*  The only way to get it to work is to go over there and have a meltdown to get something done
(preferred communication method) - don’t fill up voicemails that’s for doctor
*  Need to have a meltdown to get anything done.

What was the reason you were using IRIS?
*  Mike roland (didn’t get a response?) (care worker?)
*  Waiting for 7 months for them to get back to me, to get a guard 
*  $700 to cover that, they have to redo the cast, the cast was MIA for 5-6 weeks, 
*  Used it before for dental issue - 7 months

## Notes

Where would you go to to submit a question or comment to the VA? 

*  I see a contact us form, response burden is 10min, so I assume they have 10min to respond to me, I don’t think that’s right for the VA
 
What do you expect to see on a ‘Contact us’ page?

*  I expect to see actual contact information, like emails, phone numbers, names of people, not sign in or respondent burden, like who is responding? They are doing the job to answer the phone but they don’t know much about, they are just the operator, I don’t care about your job title
*  What does respondant burden mean?
*  Would I have signed in to use this? Typically no, if I go through and am trying to get contact info, I don’t need to give them my whole life story you know, the VA is trying to do too fuckin much, but still can’t answer me, we’re not going anywhere, I have to play with the DSLogon, after a certain logins, I have to change my pw
*  Dont’ want to give my full life story - too fucking much.  It’s going to a robot that i don’t know, we’re not going anyway.

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Allentown PA.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself and that you want to find out kinds of glasses you can get with your benefits.

*  I would look at the dropdown, I’m not dead, I’m not a caretaker, Health and Medical issues and services that’s the one I would pick
*  Is it about glasses or benefits? I’d do medical care at facility.  I don’t think glasses are in prosthetics
*  Look for Allentown VA clinic, found it in the dropdown
*  This dropdown of the medical facilities is a lot to go over, not my favorite way of looking at it
*  Is state useful? This is a lot to go over (options) and if you have a weird VA in the chunky middle (of the list of locations) it might be harder to find.
*  The less you have to click, the happier you’ll be, I’m not going to want to be clicking forever
*  It’s easy to find if you know how to spell, if I need glasses, then this would be too small, probably would be better with bigger font, should be able to type (typeahead search)
*  Too small font.  Need to type ALL to allentown (that would help)

Now go ahead and fill in the rest of the form - you can just use fake data. (test@test.com) - but don’t submit the form. (Stop them after they’ve filled out their contact info, before they get to the submit page)

*  Drop down - is it a service complaint if glasses? This is a question.  I need an appointment so i can walk in. 
*  Probably I’ll type in I need an appt and they’ll say oh bc of covid we’re no longer doing that, so I’m like I’m supposed to just stay blind?
*  If I was doing this in public, I would have to stop and go back into my car bc I don’t trust ppl, when I’m typing in my SSN, you don’t know my whole social bro, bc at the end of the day, I’m giving you my last name and last 4 of my social, so all of this is too much, you’re doing too much, if I would show up and talk to a human and they only need ⅛ of this, then you’re already aggravating me, don’t ask me a million questions, I’m already aggravated
*  That’s part of my thought process, if I was talking to a real person, and I wouldn’t give you all this information, then why are you asking all of this? They don’t ask you for your full social, they ask you last name and last 4 (social) and then verify your DOB

Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is that what you expected to happen?

*  Where is this going - drone in sky? Again, if you go to any other company, right after these 3 blocks, they should give me a snippet of information about allentown, like these are the hours and address and phone number
*  Dummy confirmation number
*  Am I going to get an email with this number too? Otherwise you’re relying on me taking a screenshot here
*  This whole process is going to take me 10min, after that I find that you’re going to take 5 days to get back to me??
*  My friend, she needs glasses and she’s been waiting for 9 months! Her migraines are out of control, her neuro says she needs a new prescription
*  And for me, for 5 months I didn’t have a functioning arm! How am I supposed to help my family? I’m supposed to be getting a nursing degree, then my blood pressure is (through the roof), how am I supposed to help my patients? 
*  I think they need to let go of all this asking for your SSN, the DoD has stopped asking for it, I’m over it, stop asking for my full social
*  What if i’m having a crisis - 5 days?

# Questions

Now that you’ve seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?

*  We don’t need to ask people to ask their social 

_Chapters:  What was your impression of chapters?_

*  i did like the separate pages.  
*  If you’re on your phone and spotty connection - friend doesn’t have reliable - so 
*  So every time you go to another page, you run the risk of starting over,  some of those pages could have been merged, you don’t need my full social, if you ask for my DOB, cut out the extra, less pages to load, less potential connectivity problems
*  If you could limit down less pages, that would be ideal
*  I have fantastic internet and it’s great so when my friend comes here, it’s great, but hers isn’t
*  Saving is essential for mobile
*  Slim it to less pages 

Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see?

*  Long drop list isn’t useful - having search would be beneficial for states etc. First two or three letters of clinic would be useful.

Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?
*  See above

_Review chapter_

What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info?
*  Here I’m working on my computer, I don’t really need to review, but 90% of the ppl that will use this, will be on their cell phones and the phones are fantastic at autocorrect, CBOK or other words that will be autocorrected
*  Who’s more important? If I type into the box “I need glasses” or “I could see last week and now this week I also crashed because my vision is so bad”
*  Always good to review stuff, if i’m on computer 
*  90 percent of people using phones - but there's autocorrect so that helps but i’s not great. Fat fingering on phones happen all the time, a is right next to s or d

If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

*  Answer: I would have to go back and see the dropdown again, there were three dropboxes (expandable boxes on the review page), but I think that is excessive
*  All I need is contact info in one area (not three boxes on review page?)
*  Don’t review the contact info bc you’ve already had them look over it and that’s just repeat and repeat then no one likes that
*  Who am i sending this to? Location and what message is.  That's all i need (to review).
*  Sometimes when I’m helping people, I’m doing lots of amounts but all I need to review is the clinic/facility location and what I’m asking for, everything else I don’t need
*  Confirmation number doesn’t help me - is this going to allentown clinic? Entity you’re contacting and what you’re trying to say is what should be in the review
*  If it’s not a requirement/required field, then maybe it shouldn’t even be on the page at all!

_In general_

Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?

*  5 business day wait is absurd. That’s like 7 whole days (pulls up a calendar to show how long it would be, especially with holidays in December) Don’t wanna wait 5 business days, that’s crazy talk
*  They never get back to me in the time allotted.
*  (She’s helping someone on the phone) Friend’s husband is still active duty, but me helping her is making all my hair fall out, her husband needs to retire soon!

_Content_

We simplified the categories in the drop down menu - what was that experience like? Did you feel confused?

*  A single text box would help
