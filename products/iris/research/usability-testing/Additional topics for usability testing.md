# Additional topics for usability testing

## Purpose

- This document details possible research areas for usability testing of the IRIS product. This will be migrated to conversation guides (example for Fall 2020).

- Note thread on recruiting the same users: typically we are not allowed to go to the same veteran more than 2x in a year, so if we expected that we are going to talk to them more than once i'd want to make sure to tap folks we have not talked to.

## Conditional views by VA lines of business

- Vet providing more details upfront to ensure a higher chance of relevant response vs VA having to go back to the vet for more details leading to longer cycle time for the ticket overall
- Are we looking to validate if people are willing to provide more details in these conditional pathways - how to make that usable?
- Add questions around H3/three levels of drop downs (topics and states) - how they expect to interact with the state?

## IRIS and integration with Get Help 

- There are a number of ways the VA is working to help people when they get help, including chatbots, FAQs, IRIS, search and others. What is your preferred order of how you use them?
- What you’re looking to do on them - why you use what you use and when
- Would they use chatbot or FAQ before submitting the Contact Us form? Why or why not? What needs to change before

## Landing page/triaging 

- Issue  How might we create a more customized experience before the form to get triaged help?
- Tie previously engaged content (across channels like FAQs) into the pre-populated form (‘we noticed you search for health…’, because you selected x, we’ll need y…’)’ - the ‘users like you found this helpful’?
- Is this a better experience than selecting options via the drop down menus?
- Would you engage with these FAQs before submitting your question?
- Does having triaging or encouragement to stand in the way of the form completion?
- Is the content on this page overwhelming? Would you find icons helpful here?

## Search Experience

See related story (#224) on a concept of a single free text dropdown.

- Explore if this matches their language expectations (like seeing a destination/path name) - are there challenges with Type Ahead and not knowing what something is called?
- Explore if this feels less overwhelming than three drop downs
- Explore if visually this feels like a modern Web experience (i.e. VA.gov search does this type ahead)

During usability testing we received validation about exploring one big text field - a search field similar to Google, rather than drop down menus.  Users responded positively to this idea, but we should understand any accessibility challenges as necessary and technically if and how topic based authentication would affect the single text field experience. Note in Slack there have been discussions about the usability of type ahead type feature from previous implementation in the VA because of concerns people may not know what something is called, so that would be somethign to validate.

## Secure messaging 

- Moved to conversation guide for usability testing.  Note this is a topic that requires much more research; while wireframes were done in the context of a future version of IRIS, we would require actual usability testing to validate them.
