# IRIS Usability Testing Conversation Guide Fall 2020
**11/20/2020**

# Introduction

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Rachel and I’m a designer working with the VA.  We’re looking to understand how to improve the Contact us experience so we’re speaking to users like yourself to better understand what your experiences have been like.  Today we're going to talk about your experiences with Contact Us, or IRIS, the Inquiry Routing & Information System (available at https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/). It’s the form you see when you go to ‘Contact Us’ > ‘Ask a Question’ at the top of the va.gov site you can go to the FAQs or Ask a Question.  Before we get start, a few things I want to mention:


- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better serve Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- PROMPT FOR USABILITY TESTING - Have you ever participated in a usability test? If so, can skip.
- IF NEW USER: ask warm up questions. If not new user, skip.
- What we're going to do is have you interact with the redesigned IRIS form and have you do a couple of tasks.  I'll give you a task to complete and we'll have you talk us through it as you complete the task. Try to complete it as you normally would.
- The point of this is that we're testing the product - NOT you - so be as candid about what works and doesn't work as you interact with it.
- Then we'll follow up with a few questions and grab any additional feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
- Any questions?

_Start recording_

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

# Warm-up Questions

_Validate if user we previously spoke with_


(Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session)  Will also validate: Do you have any accessibility requirements - do you use any assistive technology to access any part of va.gov (a screen reader or magnifier, for example)? 

## Tech and mobile usage

Before we get into your experiences with the VA site, I’d love to know more about your experiences with technology.

What type of desktop, tablet and phone do you use (and operating system).  How long have they had that?

What do you used to access va.gov and where do you access it?
Probe for mobile usage, network use (broadband)

What browser do you use to access IRIS?

Generally, how comfortable would you say you are with technology? Novice/Intermediate/Savvy

## Product Experience

Have you contacted the VA? If so, when and how 
- When
- How (i.e. prompting for IRIS usage vs. picking up the phone) Web/Phone/Email/Other

Do you always contact the VA the same way? Prompt for why they called vs. using IRIS Why did you choose the method you chose?
 
How often have you used IRIS? Did you use the COVID-19 Chatbot - how was that experience using it? What was the reason you were using IRIS? Tell us about a time when you used it and the purpose - what were you looking to do the last time you contacted the VA using IRIS.  

# Usability tests

_Instructions for notetakers in italics_

_Note if the task is completed, not completed, where they stopped or struggled and why (‘couldn’t find button etc.) and anything useful about the problem.  Don’t focus on solutioning - just how they experience the product._

_Scenario: filling out the form_

We have an early version of the IRIS form we want to get your feedback on.  Note this is an early version so not all the content is finished and not all the parts are finished, but wanted to get your feedback on what we have so far.

_Depending on the number of users recruited, aim to have at least one mobile testing session where they log into zoom and bring up staging on their phone OR laptop hugging_

I’m going to put an address in the chat and have you click on the link to get started: https://staging.va.gov - should work in any browser. Can you see the link? So we’re on the Staging web site, which is a rough draft so some of the things work and some don’t.

Great now I’m going to have you share your screen as we walk through the prototype so click on the  Share button and have you talk out loud if what you see.

- Where would you go to to submit a question or comment to the VA?

_Things to watch for:_

- Probe to understand what to call the form (as per Martha feedback)
- See if they go to Ask a Question, go to header or footer 

Before you click on anything:

- What do you expect to see behind a "Contact us" option 

_Things to watch for:_

- Probe for insight on the relationship of this form and other methods of contacting VA

Now go to the address in the chat window: https://staging.va.gov/ask-a-question/introduction  Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here.


_Things to watch for:_

- Probe for users being confused - ‘is this the same as the IRIS form, same content’? - or deciding to go straight to help.

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Allentown PA.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself and just sending a question about what kinds of glasses you can get with your benefits.


_Things to watch for:_

- Note if they go to sign in or not - can let them know they don’t have to sign in.

- Note if they select the right values from the drop downs - Health and Medical...then Prosthetics then Eyeglasses then medical facilities

- Note for any comments about the copy (what does this mean, where are all the values…)

Now go ahead and fill in the rest of the form - you can just use fake data. (test@test.com) - but don’t submit the form. (Stop them after they’ve filled out their contact info, before they get to the submit page)

_Things to watch for:_

- Any confusion not knowing what words mean or where they are, chapter to chapter

- How they interact with the Review page.

Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is  that what you expected to happen?

Thank you - we’re done with that portion of our session.


# Questions on the redesigned IRIS form

## Intro page

So we’re going to review the pages you went through and I’m going to ask you for feedback on what you experienced.  I’m going to have you stop sharing your screen.  

_Go back to first page and slowly walk through these again, chapter by chapter

Now that you’ve seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?

## Chapters

- We have info on a number of different screens or chapters.  Did the number of chapters/pages feel like the right number? (Chapters are the individual ‘screens’ - inquiry, vet info, contact info).  
- Was it correctly organized? Was it frustrating to have to click through multiple chapters?
- Would you use this on your phone?

## Content strategy

- Is the content organized properly on the individual pages - the order of fields (i.e. dates all together, time of service?)
- Do you understand the topics in the drop down menu? If you didn’t, how would you resolve that? 
- ON HOLD: Did you notice any help text and would you use it? Why or why not? Is more help needed (i.e. a glossary?) 
- Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see?
- Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?

Probe/watch for too many options for Branch of Service 

Probe for any extra fields (from an end user perspective)

Probe for facilities list - browse by state in a separate drop down 

- Were there any moments of confusion? Did you understand where you were filling out your contact information vs. the Veteran’s information?

##  Mobile
- Would you complete this form on your phone - why or why not? 
 
## Review chapter
- What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info?
- Do you find the the ability to review before submitting valuable?
- If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

##  In general
- Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?
Probe for va.gov look and feel

- Content: We simplified the categories in the drop down menu - what was that experience like?


# Additional topics for roadmap

If time allows we may also discuss the topics below - both asking questions and sharing early concepts for feedback.

## Form consolidation of IRIS and GI Bill

_Do users prefer to have the GI BIll contact us form integrated into IRIS?_

Our hypothesis is that users are wiling for now to have TWO places to contact- MHV/’medical stuff’ in one place and IRIS/GI Bill in another - because while it may be difficult to migrate medical contact/messaging over to IRIS, we can at least integrate IRIS and GI BIll and give users one less place to visit.

Have you used the GI BIll or access GI Bill related content on the va.gov site? (if yes, ask question)

Show me where you would go to find GI BIll related help.  (Should be Nav > Education and Training (https://www.va.gov/education/) then right rail leads to IRIS - can note that goes to IRIS)

When we are looking for is VBA Benefits for GI Page here: https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/ and which leads to this contact page https://gibill.custhelp.va.gov/app/home 

Note if they know where to go or don’t.

We’re exploring having one place to go for the Contact Us experience.
https://staging.va.gov/ask-a-question/introduction with the GI Bill topics in the form and  you would go to one place (Show GI BIll topics integrated into the drop downs.  MHV would be ONLY health, and you’d logged in and see health info so it would be separate, but we’d  combining IRIS and GI BIll - so the form here: https://gibill.custhelp.va.gov/app/home would go way and we’d have ONE contact us experience. is that a better worse or same experience? Why or why not?


IF TIME ALLOWS:

## Authentication

*How do users feel the need to sign it affects the IRIS experience?* 

We have a few approaches we want to share with you about how a logged in experience (where you have to provide your username and password) might look like; some of the areas in the VA require it and so we want to see how this might be made easy for you.  The benefits of authentication is that you wouldn’t have to fill in as many fields - it would pre-populate with your VA profile.   So we want to explore this and have a few early ideas here.

- One option has authentication the topic level in the drop down menu and then you sign in as necessary.
- One option has the ‘select administration’ segmentation outside of a drop down and then sign in 

Questions:  
- Do you have a preference of which approach? Why or why not?
- Does having to authenticate discourage you from completing the form? If yes, what your next step be to resolve it (probe for phone or email)

## Secure Messaging

*Do users want a secure messaging system - and if so, is a simple messaging design sufficient to meet their needs?*

Issues (in Github to bring up as necessary).
- A basic secure messaging alternative to a secure messaging tool
-  Build a tabular view to display all messages received by the user  

We are exploring having a way to send messages back and forth between users and the VA - and have a design we want to run by you.

You would be able to view your inquiry history with the VA - this is similar to the GI Bill way it is in GI Bill.
- Is this right amount of information to see for messages?
- There are also ways to make this more like traditional email (with the ability to have folders etc.). Would you find that useful, why or why not? 
- MHV would be separate from this.  Would that be ok - why or why not? 


# Closing

Those are all our questions! We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Would you be open to having another session with us in the future? Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session?
