# IRIS Design + Content Specifications 

Please note this was an early draft created with Peggy the VA SME for content.  Please see the project repository for the up to date version.

## High Level Flow Diagram
 
The developers are working with the VA Form Builder for the flow, which should follow the basics of the form, review form and confirmation as the 'happy path' for the user flow.

### Global Notes

- Since this is a publicly facing experience on the VA.gov site, the VA.gov header and footer navigation areas will be present
- Interactions will follow the VA Form Builder and the VA Design System
- The content for the new form will come from IRIS and GI Bill
- Additional notes about interactions or content that apply globally will be updated as necessary and tracked on our [board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/orchidiris-5f29c3a0250c8f001f1397ac/board?repos=285091133
)

## Draft Specifications

We worked with Peggy, the VA content SME to determine what content from IRIS needed to be reworded.  Please see her Word doc for suggested revisions.  We incorporated these into the stories into our backlog.
