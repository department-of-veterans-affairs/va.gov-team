# IRIS Form - Confirmation Page

Please note this was an early draft created with Peggy the VA SME for content.  Please see the project repository for the up to date version.

### Description
This page serves to let the user know that their message has been successfully received by the VA, and for them to be able to track the message in the future.

### Interaction Notes
- No main interaction design notes here - no calls to action
- Content confirming receipt of message dynamically updating with date received
- If the users wants to navigate from here, they'll do it via normal interaction (i.e. go to navigation bar at top etc.) - no calls to action on this screen

### Questions
What tone for this page ? (Story #76 - has existing language) Going forward, use this page: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/content/form-confirmation-page.md

### Content

Please note Peggy has sent over a Word doc with content so this page will be updated
