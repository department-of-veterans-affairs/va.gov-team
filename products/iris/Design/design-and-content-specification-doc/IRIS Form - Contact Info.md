# IRIS Form - Contact Info

Please note this was an early draft created with Peggy the VA SME for content.  Please see the project repository for the up to date version.

### Description
This page will be the main Contact Us form that will allow users to include their contact information, and will allow the VA to understand who is contacting them and why.

### Interaction Notes

- The main way of interaction on this page is via a series of drop down menu boxes that follow the VA standards for contact information (name, addres etc.)
- There is conditional logic tied to some of the drop downs - so that if a user selects they are a beneficiary of a Veteran, for example, they will indicate more about the type of relationship they have to the Veteran.
- Standard VA form calls to action (buttons at the bottom allowing users to go back of forward) are included.

### Content

The two main pages of the Contact Us form - the Contact Us page and the Inquiry Details page) - are different lengths, but I believe it makes sense to keep these separate pages, even one is very long and one isn't.  

Since most of these are standard contact us (name, address etc.) this should be fairly easy for people to fill out; we should ensure conditional logic (selecting beneficiary triggers another drop down) is well understood, especially the copy. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: this is for the IRIS form - we'll be adding the GI Bill form elements to this (possibly the bio and inquiry detail) so will likely have to think through the order of form elements on the page.  The main task is to think through the order of these to be intuitive for users.

This is the content that Peggy has suggested we go with.

TO ADD:
- Peggy: I recommend separating “personal information (name, branch of service, dob, etc) and “contact information (email, phone, etc) into separate chapters


Please note Peggy has sent over a Word doc with content so this page will be updated
