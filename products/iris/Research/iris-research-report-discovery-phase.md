# IRIS Research Report for Discovery

Prepared by Rachel M. Murray on August 10, 2020

## Summary

The purpose of this research is to understand Veteran’s experiences using IRIS, including what works with the current experience and what could be improved, as well as what an improved user experience might look like.

## Goals

The goals of this research include:  
* Understand how Veterans use IRIS - the Ask a Question and FAQ pages in particular
* Identify what a preferred redesigned experience might look like


## Methodology and Participants

Interviews were conducted with 7 Veterans over a week in August 2020. During the interviews, Veterans (and some of the Veterans who also indicated they were caregivers for other Veterans) were asked about their experiences contacting the VA via the IRIS form and their use of the FAQS.

Participants: 
* 3 male, 3 female, 1 transgender
* Ages 25-64
* Geographically diverse across the US

## Findings

### Themes

There were three main themes that we’ve established grouped around the major areas of IRIS and one tied to more general findings.

#### 1. The Ask a Query experience was functional for some participants, but others felt frustrated by the design of the form and how they interacted with the content in it.

Several participants felt that their experience with the form was cumbersome and antiquated. It was not aligned with  the rest of the VA.gov (the redesigned design system) nor their  expectations for digital experiences in 2020.

##### Key Takeaways
* For some Veterans, the instinct will always be to pick up the phone to call rather than use the form. 
    * [On using the form] “I didn’t even think to do that, honestly” - P4
    * “My neighbor (another Vet)  won’t do anything online, he yells at me for help, widower, kids are all out of state, so he’s trying to figure out on his own - honestly, I don’t know… or if he’s interested in learning” - P4
* For a few, the other parts of the VA.gov experience were the gold standard of what digital communications should be. 
    * “My MHV has everything about when you submit, they can go back and contact you” - P1
* The drop down menus for topics appeared to be the main source of problems, so revisiting them is essential for improving the user experience.
    * Not successfully finding what they’re looking for - “the dropdown values did not match what I was looking for”  - P1
    * “I don’t remember what I put in there. I think I just picked one. I couldn’t really find a subject that was quite suitable” - P7
    * “My issue was a technical problem, and I’ve got dropdown within a dropdown, and it’s horrible” - P9
* Getting confirmation and a reference number would make the process more transparent especially when getting a response can be deleted because of COVID-19. 
    * “Confirmation via email, reference, that would be very valuable, that my message was received, and reference number if I need to call later for action” - P4

_How might alternative ways of navigating the form reduce usability challenges especially for Vets where accessibility is a challenge?_

#### 2. Veterans often struggled with finding content in the FAQs which made them hesitant to use it.

Many participants were willing to use the FAQs as a first attempt to answer their questions,  but they were often unsuccessful at finding what they wanted to find. Feeling sufficiently frustrated, they would resort to calling the VA or just asking another Veteran instead using the FAQs.

##### Key Takeaways

* The time commitment for digging through the content felt like a lot of effort without a clear guarantee of a positive result.
    * “I’ve gone through the FAQs before but sometimes it’s easier to ask a specific question” - P3
    * “I just typed compensation in again, and most of the suggested searches aren’t related. The first two seem related, but then the other ones don’t. Making sure that those keywords are similar to things like compensation, so if a veteran is looking for things like that” - P3
* Finding the FAQs was a challenge for some participants.
    * “Are they hidden under my zoom? In my world of tech, FAQ should show. (User back on va.gov, scrolling up and down looking for the FAQ. ) I don’t see it. Is it under About VA? There are Coronavirus FAQ? Is this a test? Are there no FAQs?” - P9

_How might improving the FAQs help users browse and access the right information without frustration?_

#### 3. The Veterans helping Veterans experience should be a consideration for our work.

Whatever we build with IRIS, we should also think holistically about how an online experience can replicate the best parts of how Vets help one another with knowledge transfer in the offline world. Veterans often lean heavily on one another in informal networks, and tapping into that standard could be a great touchstone for the work of IRIS as it explores chat bots and improving the overall experience.

##### Key Takeaways

* Veterans will actively support one another, acting as domain subject matter experts and knowledge sherpa, and in some cases people will investigate alternative ways to resolve outside of the VA site
    *  “I was trying to help one of my friends figure out a veteran benefits, as far as accessibility, and what needed to happen in order for someone to have access to VA benefits post-service, in regards to discharge, kind of discharge, stuff like that” - P3
* The personalized human touch matters in feeling like the right information is available - so the VSO and having a trusted source matters. 
    * “I have friends who have helped me, i would go to them than instead of coming to a website”- P1
    * “I have a ton of caregiver and veteran facebook groups I’m a part of, and a reddit page or two, a subreddit that I follow. Because it’s interactive you get people sharing their own experiences”- P3
    * “I only go to VA if its 100% necessary that I have contact with a doc, otherwise I usually go to VSO” - P3

_How might we replicate the warm, high touch caring in person experience Veterans have with one another in the online experience of IRIS?_

### Additional Findings

Interviewees identified future functionality that will be out of scope for this release of IRIS, but should be included in a backlog for consideration post official first release.  These findings included:

* Texting with medical facilities, or online chat will be helpful.  Better than calling. - P1
* One other thing you might want to look  into. It's called DocuSign to have documents signed for back & forth, etc.Those kind of things would be awesome to have at VA, it makes things  a lot quicker. - P1
