# Using digital communications and evolving interactions to improve the IRIS experience.


## What is the opportunity?

Owing to mounting operating costs for the current IRIS system, the VEO has kicked off an initiative to migrate to more modern technologies. This effort involves migrating the following three systems from Oracle Service Cloud to a new CRM: 
- IRIS Interface
- GI Bill
- MHV

The existing contract for the Oracle backend supporting IRIS ends on Dec 31, 2020. The migration to a new platform will take place on an accelerated timeline in order to allow current users to begin utilizing the replacement system before the final shutdown date. Feedback from existing users will be collected to address required modifications for the new system prior to fully decommissioning IRIS.

There exists an opportunity to improve the experience for end users of IRIS, GI Bill and MHV Contact Us Form, in alignment with the current VA Design principles, and backed by data from user research. 

## Proposed Solution

As part of this effort, initial research has indicated that existing Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM instances of PATS-R and UDO will function as the new CRM system to support IRIS inquiries.. 

The bulk of the CRM migration from the existing Oracle Service Cloud to Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM will be undertaken by a team from SRA (3rd party vendor) working closely with Dennis Peterson and the Microsoft team supporting PATS-R. 

Replacement of the veteran and other beneficiary facing side of this system will be undertaken by the ThoughtWorks team that will look to build an alternative for the following existing components:
- Ask A Query form on IRIS
- Submit a query on GI Bill interface
- Submit a query on MHV Contact Us page
- Homepage for IRIS
- Homepage for GI Bill


## How will we measure success?

A list of metrics is being worked on and will be added in the coming weeks


**Pending decisions and outstanding questions**

- Consolidated interface for raising inquiries across IRIS, GI Bill and MHV
- Replacement solution for IRIS FAQ and GI Bill FAQ
- Do veterans need to login before raising an inquiry
- Introducing a chatbot to address initial information seeking by veterans before they are directed to submit an inquiry to VA 
- Consolidation of categories and topics for a more efficient and enhanced experience
- Hw can we utilize design standards within the VA to modernize the experience
- How might we create a better inquiry experience in light of larger initiatives that are improving the Get Help experience


Note this list will be expanded on in the coming weeks
