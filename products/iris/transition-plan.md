| [Analytics] Oracle metrics for IRIS, GI Bill and MHV-TS 	| Metrics for the existing IRIS, GI Bill and MHV-TS pages on Oracle can be pieced together from different sources. There are monthly reports generated by Michelle Hoxsie-Quinn (Oracle Service Cloud Administrator) which include numbers about total FAQ views and inquiries created (by inquiry type). There are also some high-level metrics around page views and device types by users captured by DAP Google Analytics for the IRIS page. In order to access either of these sources, you will need a VA.gov email address.

| Veterans-facing Service Platform [Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle)    	| Team Orchid worked with DSVA and the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) to align our product development with the VSP collaboration cycle. The collaboration cycle includes key steps such as, accessibility review, usability testing and privacy/security review. Though the IRIS replacement work will be utilizing the omnichannel portal, parts of the collaboration cycle are still relevant and should be addressed.                                                                                                                                                             	|                                                                	|
