| [Analytics] Oracle metrics for IRIS, GI Bill and MHV-TS 	| Metrics for the existing IRIS, GI Bill and MHV-TS pages on Oracle can be pieced together from different sources. There are monthly reports generated by Michelle Hoxsie-Quinn (Oracle Service Cloud Administrator) which include numbers about total FAQ views and inquiries created (by inquiry type). There are also some high-level metrics around page views and device types by users captured by DAP Google Analytics for the IRIS page. In order to access either of these sources, you will need a VA.gov email address. To get access to DAP for IRIS, please contact dap@gsa.gov. 	| - [Monthly FAQ views & inquiries created for IRIS, GI Bill, or MHV-TS](https://vaww.va.gov/IRISINFO/reports.asp) <br>- [IRIS page views by date range](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?pli=1#/savedreport/5SwE7A3tQGiTNxaERqWhlw/a33523145w60822123p65544933/_.advseg=&_.useg=&_.sectionId=&_r.dsa=1&explorer-table.advFilter=%5B%5B0,%22analytics.pagePathLevel1%22,%22PT%22,%22iris.custhelp.va.gov~2F%22,0%5D%5D&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D/)<br>- [IRIS users device breakdown by date range](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?pli=1#/savedreport/ZtvyUjcQRe-oF8Yh01VJKA/a33523145w60822123p68076838/_.advseg=&_.useg=&_.sectionId=&_r.dsa=1&explorer-table.secSegmentId=analytics.pagePathLevel1&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.advFilter=%5B%5B0,%22analytics.pagePathLevel1%22,%22BW%22,%22iris.custhelp.va.gov~2F%22,0%5D%5D)                                   	|

| Veterans-facing Service Platform [Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle)    	| Team Orchid worked with DSVA and the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) to align our product development with the VSP collaboration cycle. The collaboration cycle includes key steps such as, accessibility review, usability testing and privacy/security review. Though the IRIS replacement work will be utilizing the omnichannel portal, parts of the collaboration cycle are still relevant and should be addressed.                                                                                                                                                             	|                                                                	|
