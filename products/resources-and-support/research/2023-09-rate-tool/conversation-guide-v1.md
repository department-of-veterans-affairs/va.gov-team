## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Camille Green and Perigean is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about  Medallia's Feedback Survey Tool that we are interested in utilizing that will allow veterans to rate multiple pages on Resources &Support .

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we get started with the discussion, let’s start with a few general questions so I can learn a little bit about you. 

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself. What do you do in your spare time?  
2. How long have you  served in the military? What is your branch? 
3. What do you typically do day-to-day in your current role? 

Excellent. Thanks so much for your answers. 


## Scenario

Imagine you are searching for Resources and Support because you are unable to sign in to your VA.gov account. Before you leave the resources and support page, you want to ensure that you leave feedback to rate your experience, so you expand the rate tool to review the resources and support page in detail. Once you have finished leaving feedback for the resources and support page, you want to return to VA.gov. Today we’ll test a concept for rating your experience when searching for resources and support on VA.gov.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
