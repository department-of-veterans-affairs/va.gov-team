# Notetaking Doc for Resources & Support Search Enhancements

## Warm-up Questions

1. I understand you are a (Veteran/service member/family member/caregiver). Is that right? 
   Yes.
1. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone) 
     iPhone 15
1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I can dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, or (smartphone only) my colleague could text it to you. I have never used Zoom chat before but I see it here so we can use Zoom chat.
1. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? 
I used my VA certificate for a Va home loan, and I received post 911 GI bill benefits and currently receiving disability pay.
1.	When you want to learn about a program or service offered by the VA, where do you go to look for information?
Three areas, first I will probably talk to a local veteran service officer, whether in title of by function. I’m near a community that’s active locally for veteran organizations. Also, I would go on line going to the VA website. And then finally I would probably call using the phone number on whatever documentation I have, if it’s related to the actual question.

1.	About how often do you use VA.gov?
It varies, certainly not daily. Over the course of a year a couple times a month.
1.	Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for? 
I had just completed a video interview/evaluation. The interviewer indicated that certain medical documents were not received or uploaded to the VA website from my health record. So I went ahead and accessed va.gov in order to upload those documents.
     - What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for?
It was successful and I was able to upload the documents in their entirety. About half a dozen. It was fairly seamless once I understood the system. You know, like anything else there was some frustration. The IT system or whatever is in place, I’m sure functions well, but for those of us who don’t work it often or maybe this is the first time it takes a while to kin fog navigate and learn some of the tricks. So initial frustration but not major. I got a response that the upload was successful.
1.	How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov?
Again, I think a lot of it gets down to just you know, navigation up front. Once you have kind of figured out what’s happening it gets a lot simpler. I think that is probably true for everything over all. When you have an particular site that you are using it is going to take an initial ability to navigate in to them. I’m going to use a poor word here, but I can’t think of a better word, particular zone, you know or section of that website I’m looking for. In other words, I’m having to disregard, yeah, I’m not here for education benefits I ‘m not here for other benefits. I’m here for this particular issue. So, it takes a little bit,

## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have.
Over all, I take a top to bottom approach. So I’m noting an information aspect for an official Government website. The veterans crisis line, again both things I don’t necessarily want to take a look at. I see that I’ll need to sign in, that’s one of the first things I try to do on the site just to make sure that I’m remembered and can get to whatever functions I’m looking for. I don’t know if that makes a big difference on the VA site but it does on others. Obviously resources and support, got it. Show filters. Yeah this is what I’m talking about, how on one side it’s great but it takes a little while to go through. Okay, what am I after. You know burials, careers, disability, education, health you know. So, I mean that’s a slight frustration.
Can I ask what causes some of the frustration?
I know what I’m looking for but now I gotta go through 9 different links. Where I’m looking to upload say for example those health record documents. I’m going to have to make sure I get to the right bin, let’s call it a bin. I’m just you know giving you a stream of consciousness here. 
It’s an initial frustration particularly?
For those of us who may not go in it very often, or it’s the first couple of times since there’s been an update or change.
Go back to the top of this page if you don’t mind. As you first came in, what does Resources and Support mean to you?
Well, I think it’s identified for me what I’m on the site for. In other words, it’s gonna tell me that even though I’m on the site, I ‘m not where I eventually need to be. So, I’m going to find out what the VA has for resources, and then I’m going to go and get you know whatever it is I’m after, i.e. support.

## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here. Yeah, I think probably something I didn't mention earlier, even though I may have scrolled down here to your browse by benefit. I have used the search bar function before. In fact, that’s one of the things I did uploading those documents, was I typed in how to upload documents for claim. So, for something like that I might just go straight to the search bar function. Again, I would first sign in and then probably, obviously go to claims, claim status for that. Well, no I take that back, decision reviews and appeals I might go there first and then back up to claims status or vice versa.
You mentioned you might use search. You mentioned you would likely sign in and then go back to the area below with some of the links. Which link would you go to?
You gave a specific instance, assuming I have already signed in, if it’s related to a claim, I would look in claims, claim status first, if I’ve got an existing one. I would probably go into decision reviews and appeals to see if that had been made first and then go in and see what perhaps the status is. I don’t know, maybe both will take me to the same location, I haven’t clicked on that before.
Now if you were to search, let’s for example go ahead and engage with that. What would you do if you wanted to search for your key words?
First, I would frame the question, what is the exact question I’m asking myself. What’s the status of my review? I may not type that entirely out but use key words like you said. I am a 3-5 guy that means 3 to 5 items or bullets you know. Pieces of evidence I use when writing a paper. In other words, I would come up with 3-5 words and search for those key words.
This is where the Test aspect of our site is just showing those. Can you go back and select option E. What would you do after you had entered your search phrase or key words, what would you do from here?
I would hit enter or the search icon. 
What are you looking for, what would you expect to see?
It took me to application documents. I expect to see the different types of applications. I see VA claim PACT Act, DIC, I guess I expect a little longer list. It says applications documents I would assume is more then what is listed here.
After coming in on the results page from your search, if you didn’t find what you were looking for. What would you do next? That pretty much happened when I was uploading those documents I went ahead and used there was a chat function that that was that enabled it allowed me to ask a question. It was a little frustrating because it wound up, taking me to a messaging type of or email type of system. So it wasn't what I thought a pure chat with, you know, somebody online right then with me. I used that to frame the question Hey, I need you to send me the link, don’t talk me through step by step. Just send me the exact link. I got a formatted response that was more than what I needed but it gave me what I needed.
In this case where you submitted a VA benefit application to reconsider. Are there any of those items on here or where you expecting to see anything on that list?  I’m not understanding your question.
In what you’re seeing here in the results are you finding anything that would jump out to you as relevant for what you are searching for?
 Yeah, I mean, if I'm initiating something, obviously, I would, you know, go into intent. I you know I may or may not know whether my claim falls under the Pact Act. I guess that's important. I'm going to be lazy and say, hey, it's up to you all to let me know you know what I'm falling under. But, you know, it kind of just depends.
Go ahead and do that. Tell me what your thoughts are, what are you seeing here? What would you like to do here?
I’m not sure what the tag is showing me, I don’t know if that’s information I really need. 
Those tags you said you weren’t sure what those tags are. What would you think they could be? I’m not sure it’s not something that I think I can use, I mean it basically confirms that I’m kind of in the right place. But to me I’m not sure why it’s being shown I’m not sure what it is. What I’m expected to do with it. If there’s not something I’m expected to do with it, I’m not sure why it pops up and you know clobbers that space. In other words, you know if it’s a hey, you know more information or you know, do you think you’re in the right place. I’m not sure you know whether it’s a, you know kind of like when I swiped your video off the screen it gave me that little gray box with the right bracket, to obviously enlarge it again or bring it back. I would expect maybe something like that. But again, that’s just a small nuance. I mean if I’m doing it on my phone space is obviously a premium. And I know I can just scroll down, but that’s just more scrolling. You know that’s frustrating for us
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
Yeah. If it was my intent to file a claim, I would obviously just go straight to my intent to file a claim, and you know, start laying out what it is. I'm asking for. You know it’s frustrating for us old guys, particularly when you have enter your year of birth. It used to be a couple of swipes but now it seems like you got to hit the slot machine or something.
If this page didn’t answer your question, what would you do next?
I would have to reset; I would need to maybe go back to the search and see what’s going on. Like I mentioned it’s really handy to have somebody help out. Obviously when I was ready to submit a claim I asked for help form the VSO. You know somebody who’s been through it can help me out or you know the chat function.

## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you.
It sounds to me like community care. I would probably go there first to see what it told me. If I was pretty confident in my question, I would go back to that search bar and type in keywords of community care.
In this case which of those do you think would do?
 I would probably first go to community care. (after clicking on that) Alright, so it said eligibility for community care outside the VA. So that sounds pretty close to what we were asking. So, I would click before you know I sometimes get a little bit impetuous, I don’t read all the options. If I see something that looks close, I automatically hit it. I may not have scrolled all the way down so hopefully that was right. 
Go ahead and do what you think you would do in this case. Now what are you wanting to do since we’ve come to this new page.
If I understood you correctly this, should you know tell me what the program is and the basic ground rules for what my question is related to. I would expect it in English you know.
How would you rate the process of trying to initially find that information and then kind of drilling down into the site as we’ve come through? And what aspects of the site or components of the site were helpful for you? 
On a scale of 1-10 10 being the best I would give it an 8. I think it was fairly easy, I got you know to an area with in a couple of clicks. I probably wouldn’t have done it on my mobile phone, but on a laptop with a larger screen. But this is handy I appreciate it. I would again, expect if this was my first time doing this there is going to be some frustration because you know it requires thought process. And obviously sometimes we don’t like to think things through, we just want instant gratification.
You had mentioned that it wasn’t too complicated for you, but you mentioned there might be some frustration. As we’ve gone through a couple different areas of this website now how are you feeling about the whole aspect. You know familiarity of understanding the lay of the land on this page. Is that helping to ease that frustration?
Yeah, I think it helps ease, I mean it’s you know everybody’s got a methodology and every organization has their own say format. As a retied marine I got used to how the marine corps wrote orders and publications. You know if I had a question I would go to the paragraph pertaining to that question, I didn’t have to read the whole thing. I think that’s the case here or any website. Certainly, on this site once I kind of figured it out it makes it easier to start navigating without wasting time on areas that I don’t need to. 
Okay are there any particular features of the navigation that stand out to you? 
I mean you know, it’s the hot links being able to click on a sentence or a phrase that takes me with having to navigate the whole URL. You know, you start looking at lag time I didn’t get the whole spinning circle of death as things are loading. Again, fonts and colors being able to read in this case fonts are certainly large enough I didn’t need my reading glasses. I really appreciate not getting any ads that pop up. If you start giving me lots of pop up adds I start getting irritated, so I appreciate that. 
We’ve talked about the tags earlier. For this scenario looking for you know a non-VA provider do any of these tags stand out to you?
Again, if we are talking about a non-VA provider, I’m assuming it relates to Community care. So that’s what I am looking for. Okay you gave me a tag of a veteran. Yeah, I guess I’m in the right place. I mean I’m being a little sarcastic, and I don’t mean to be. I get why it’s there, I just again you know. Why do I need to see it? What am I supposed to do with that? Because otherwise I’m where I think I should be, so I don’t need to see. 
Let’s assume you weren’t sure; you went to this page and you scanned it. You weren’t quite seeing everything. A moment ago, you mentioned that community care might jump out to you. Can I ask you to tap the community care tap here? Now what are you seeing on the page? What would you be wanting to do? Let’s say on the last page you hadn’t found everything and now you’re on this page what would you be wanting to do?
Well, it looks like it went back. I thought I had already clicked into the eligibility for community care outside the VA. So, it looks like it jumped me back. Eligibility how to get, okay. I mean pretty informative. It gets down to that age old answer of it depends on what I am trying to do. 
If you could scroll back up a little bit. So, when you clicked on community care it brought you into this page. What do you notice anything thing about the interface here?
Same type of layout and format. It's you know, the I'm still getting you know, up top, you know. Talk to the veteran crisis line. Now, I think we've moved past that. But it's, you know, obviously, on every page that's fine. And that helps. I think, that gives you some structure I appreciate. You know again standardization. So. it helps me as I navigate, if you keep changing fonts, colors, sizes you know paragraph structures screen layout, that makes it more difficult because you’re trying to get used to certain things.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
I remember seeing earlier the reimburse VA travel so one of the benefits of having a list to choose from is you play the memory game. So yeah, here I found it I would click that. 
Alright now what do you want to do in this new page, what are you thinking?
It tells me to read the page so I would scroll down to find submitting claims reimbursement. I might look for train but that isn’t critical. How would I do it I may not be interested in a milage rate at this point I know I want to submit my receipt I would wan to know how to do that.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information.
Oh boy, yeah, I would probably enter that in a search box because it would depend oh what my payments are for. (pension benefits in this case) yeah I would probably type that in then, pension payments. But, I see down here I could probably just have gone straight into the payments and debt link.
Go ahead and do that. What are you wanting to see as you come into this page? What would you be looking for? First I would need to find out what exactly the payments relate to then I guess I would get down to my specific question. If my question was how can I get my payments deposited directly to my bank, I could see direct deposit information. I have no clue what a VA form 56, 55 is or why I’m looking at that. Obviously, this is more a frequently asked questions to try to get me in the right area. Oh, direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement. Okay that’s interesting.
What do you want to do here? Especially as you’re looking at these different articles.
 Yeah. So, you know, if I had again get back to the issue direct deposit, you know, I kind of keyed in on this one straight up. What I see down here. Here's another, you know. This may be closer to what I was looking for. So, you know, it's good to have. Yeah. I think you know, these are again. This is all you know, all fine. Again, I might have originally gone into that search bar to try to keyword it a little better.
Alright. And notice here under the search bar. What do you do you notice anything about the navigational elements? The tag piece is different, in other words the layout it doesn’t show tags like it did on the others. It’s also good to show filter all the time that way I can see if my filters are off. 
How often do you use those filters.
Well for shopping I might be looking for men’s clothing, you know a shirt, maybe price.
Go ahead and let’s try to take a look at those filters. What would you want to do as you engage with those filters? Okay. So, I laughed earlier about, you know, veterans as a filter, which is obvious. But then, now I'm gonna have to eat my words a little bit, because this does make sense that you know, family members, caregivers. Yeah. So there's some differences. I like active service members, because one thing I was frustrated with was when I was on active duty getting ready to retire. It would have been nice to have you know some of this, so that I could you know, filter in some of the things I need to be thinking about now before I retire. You know what I'm talking about. But yeah, this kind of gets back to what I was talking about. The online shopping your audience is, you know, a different way of framing. You might search it for men, clothing, women's clothing, or children, clothing.
Does that phrasing of this Audience, does that seem like it would be okay for you to understand what you can do with that. Or would there be another phrase that you think would better explain what that is for? No, not off the top of my head. 
Okay what about the other options here can you explore those as well and let me know.
Yeah, I liked it. I like the expand and minimize that makes the, you know, screen cleaner.
Are these options under each of these expandable areas representing what you would expect to see? Are they clear as to what they can help you zero in on in your search?
Yeah, I think you know, it gets into layouts, you know. Here you've got them listed in really an alphabetical order based on the keyword. You know, burials before careers, careers before disability, and the like. So you know, I don't know if that's six to one half dozen the other. As far as I'm concerned, I think it's a little easier to use. But you know I'm going to have to scan the list. There's nothing intuitive. That would tell me, hey, I'm looking for life insurance. So that should be at the, you know, mid to the bottom of the list. In other words, I'm going to have to go top to bottom to kind of see what I'm looking for. But sure, if you know, like I said, I've used Va home loan. I've used education Post 9/11, GI Bill, and I've used disability so and health care most recently. So yeah, I mean, it looks like you’ve got everything there.
How might you use these filters? For example, you’ve mentioned a couple of times here what would you do next if you wanted to drill down into any of these options you see here?
Yeah, I would probably activate. You know the filters, you know, if it was I'm interested in, you know, maybe what my caregiver could rate you know I would obviously key in on that because now I'm doing a more specific search not necessarily for me as a veteran, but for my caregiver. Again, you know, I'm not sure I would activate the filter for the particular benefit. You know, because what I do today may be different. I'm assuming, once I've signed in that my filters remain unless I clear them for my next excursion on the website.
Why would you want those filters to stay active?
If I'm navigating a website that's very expensive in sort of saying that this is, in other words, that covers a lot of territory. If I've got questions related to that particular benefit, I could see the advantage of keeping the filter, so that you know, the next time I come on the website it'll. It’ll help otherwise, I don’t know. I’m not sure if personally I want to keep a lot of filters on. 
Go ahead and activate one of these filters.
Alright, well so you know, caregivers. I’m thinking I want to find out what my caregiver would rate for certain things. I would apply the filters. (go ahead) I’m not sure if I’m in the right place. I would probably go back to the search engine. 
This is a mock up, you might see what you are looking for in the full version there. 

What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this. 
Yeah. The first thing is, I would look to see if there was. You know that chat box open. If not, I would go into my menu and click on that to pull up contact us to see how to get a phone number or an email link or something. 

Okay, okay? And as you, as we've gone through this site. We've interacted with different areas of this, the structure of the site, the different navigational options that we have available to you. You've mentioned the times like the menu that, we've looked at the search. We've looked at the filters. We've looked at those links. How much you use those different navigational elements at different times. And would there be a different like cases that you would want to use the search compared to the filter compared to those links that are available to you on the page?
That’s a tough one to answer. I would think up front again. Is that a terrible response. It depends , I think in large measure to how I feel, if I’m in a rush or not. If I want an immediate answer I would go to search. If I was in a casual mood I might scroll through. Tough one to answer.
## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this.

What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.

## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes
1.	Overall, about everything you've seen in this session...What worked *well* for you?
The layout is good, I like the presentation. The lag time. I appreciate not having to go through a series of questions that are unrelated. I'm presuming if I'm going on the VA Side, I'm a veteran, so you're presuming that, too. So, you know but I think in in large measure it's you know, it's helpful. I mean, you know. Part of it is you try to not appease everybody. But you know you got people do things different ways, and they're looking for different things. So you know being able to have the ability to drill down straight or go in to a search function certainly helps give me the options I was looking for. 
1. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you? No I think you know like you said this is your test site. Obviously I’m not going to gripe about any of that. I think you guys are on.
1. What would you like to *change or add*?
1. *[If they didn't use filters]* Did you see the words with light blue underneath them?
     1. What do you think they are, and how might you use them?
     1. I don't remember you using them before. Can you tell me more about that? 
     1. Would you like to try them now?
          1. What do you think about using them? 
     1. Which ones are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any missing that you think should be there? 
1. *[If they used filters]* Let's look back at the filters you were using.
     1. What did you think about using them? 
     1. Which filters are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any filters missing that you think should be there? 
1. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?
Again, I am a big fan of the chat box that pops up. Here you need help you know give me the 1-800 number, it’s good to have the link so that I can you know just click go.
