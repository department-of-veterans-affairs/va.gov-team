# Notetaking Doc for Resources & Support Search Enhancements

## Warm-up Questions

1. I understand you are a (Veteran/service member/family member/caregiver). Is that right? 
It's actually my husband, and I use the application more than him, because he's a disabled vet. And so I have lots of critiquing because trying to get services is always frustrating. And it's always fun. And we've been trying to use the integrated website and some of the applications and trying to see how they work. So I'm looking forward to this opportunity.
1. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone) 
     Mobile device, it said to use my phone.
1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I can dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, or (smartphone only) my colleague could text it to you. 
Oh I prefer text, because then I can just click into my text. Please
1. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? 
   Most of them. So we've gone everywhere from the veterans’ health Administration to Champ Va trying to get Champ Va linked in there, and it's not linked in yet. I use his My HealtheVet, which is kind of cumbersome at this point. And then we use the certificate of eligibility and some of the letters in the forms. I've tried changing my last name and updating documents, and the uploaders didn't work in the I wanna say, it was the veterans benefits tab and it was for updating the benefits. So, I'm his fiduciary. So, we tried to update it through that way. We ended up not being able loader. We had to send documents, and it was time consuming and kind of annoying. But eventually it got done.
1.	When you want to learn about a program or service offered by the VA, where do you go to look for information?
It depends on what it is pertaining to. But usually, we go to the VBA website. I'll Google it. We'll go to the VA first and then to the VBA tab.
What is the VBA?
Veterans benefits administration.
1.	About how often do you use VA.gov? More so now.
Haha. More so now we tried using it when it first rolled out and so we use the My HealtheVet the longest and for the most. Then then, a couple of years back, they started integrating. Everyone's different, from the different agencies, and the application seemed to start disconnecting. And it wasn't working, and so we would just call directly to get services or make appointments to go in.
1. Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for? 
It was just a couple of weeks ago. My husband hurt his knee, and we had called 3 times to set an appointment with our local clinic, the Va clinic. But they weren't calling us back to set the appointment. And so it was taking time. I was like, did they get the appointment.  So on My HealtheVet there is this place where you can contact or set an appointment or request an appointment. What we found out from the nurse at the clinic is, it doesn't really contact your local clinic, anyways, and I don't know who or where it goes to. She was like, but never request an appointment through there, because you'll be ignored. So we had tried (participant cut out here) and it was from the clinic to set (participant cut out again) our local VA clinic at your clinic for you to set up an appointment. So, when we had tried using the website when we were talking to the lady, we're like, Hey, we sent in this request. And she's like, Oh, yeah, we never get those. So, it doesn't go. I'm not sure who answers those appointment requests online or where they go, but that might be something that might be helpful to clarify, for people seeking to get appointments.
What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for?
We ended up getting a phone call back from our 3 previous phone calls. 
I think my internet was cutting out a bit there can you please restate what you had to do and what was the outcome?
Yeah, we ended up getting a phone call back from our previous 3 phone calls to try to set an appointment for an injury. And we had re-asked what had happened with the appointment request because we didn't want it just pending out there for our local clinic. But we had gone through the my healthy vet request an appointment tab, and requested it gave us a calendar. It gave us times we had selected one, and I asked the lady. Hey? Can you just fill that appointment slot, or can you put us in there? Because I didn't want to overbook people? I know that happens a lot with the clinics. And she said she never got the request, and it wasn't linked up to them.
1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov?
If I haven't navigated the VA For as long as I have, and it's been years almost 15 years, I would say it's difficult for most laymen people. I work Federal government. I understand how agencies work. I understand that they don't overlap and work, and they work in silos. When we 1st started navigating it. We aren't where we are today. With the services. It was difficult. It was very difficult to find information and who to contact. It's gotten easier. It's more streamlined with the websites and some of the AI kind of generated stuff that they have coming up. You can put in searches, and it does give you better results now than it did in the past. But for people that might have any sort of cognitive issues or not have support. I think there needs to be a lot of work on locating where you would find certain things.
## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have.
I I think I'm not on the homepage, and it's telling me that I'm looking for resources and supports. I see a sign in option, a menu, and then a way to go back home. I like that it tells me and indicates the way to go back home. If I'm not looking for resources and supports. Just my links there, and if I know what I want from a menu, or if I want to sign in, I can just go in automatically and sign in. And that's usually what I do with my USA.gov login. And then, of course I am looking down, I’m just seeing what the other benefits are and where I am at in this. So I like it.
That you're looking for in particular. Yeah, what are some things that you like about what you're seeing here?
Yeah, like I said, the VA. To go home. The menu option at the top. I always like looking at the menu because I usually don't visit the va.gov. For information or general information. I usually have an agenda to file something that's required or looking for eligibility, documents or documentation to prove at payments and debt, I mean, I guess I would go there if we weren't getting our payments like if something comes up and they start messing with the disability payments, I would look there. 
And when you come into this, this page here, what does what does resources and support, what does that mean to you?
Well, when I generally, when I see resources, I start thinking of where we qualify and how you qualify, because not everyone qualifies for the same thing. So resources. I would think that it would link me at least to some of the different services available like I saw education down here. That's one thing I would automatically think if I was looking for training, or if I was trying to do some of the chapters, for when the kids go to school. My husband's 100%, so they'll get the chapter 35 benefits. I know I can go here and find that information. I wouldn't necessarily think resources in healthcare, but since I know they do VHA, which is the veterans health differently than they do the Champ VA. I would look in this section for Champ VA stuff.
## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
I would automatically. If I just filed something I would want to see if they received it. I would go to claims and claim status to see if it would go there. It doesn't seem like the link. Oh, maybe it did, yeah, claims and claim status. And then, I think you can file online, cant you? Now some of the stuff, or do you still have to use... if I recall correctly, I've been able to file. I don't know if it was exactly a claim. It's been a long time since he was approved for his benefits. But I thought we were able to fill out a form online. And it submitted it online.
Okay, what would you be looking for if you came into this page from clicking on that link earlier?
Oh, I would be looking for the status tool. I would look to see where we are in the process if it was approved or not, approved. I would want to see if it was received or processed, you know, different meanings, and and maybe a language to support my idea. Oh, it was it received? Okay, now it's being processed. Okay, what's the timeline? Or when can I expect this to the average amount of days that it takes to process claims at that time. Those are the things I'd be looking for, or I'd call and ask.
How are some of the elements you’re seeing on the page for you, as far as what they might provide you for value or objective?
Yeah. Tags are helpful because they kind of give you an idea of what types of claims I don't know if I would want them right in the front, or if it could be expanded and like smaller, it's pretty big. But if that's what I was looking for, I'm like, oh, okay, yeah, I hit claims. But I don't know if I need all these other like disability or pension or education training. But if you're applying for something, and if your claim is more than one thing, and you're looking for a specific type, maybe a filtering tool for oh, I want to see what's going on with my chapter 35, or I want to see what's going on with my pension or whatnot. I would want to be able to filter by them.
What would you gather you could do with the tabs? What would you assume that you might be able to do with those tags that you mentioned earlier?
I think I would click it. And it would take me to a different area of the actual website or to a different area within the organization, not necessarily still be in claims and claim status, even though that's what I selected.
And what are you seeing here? Versus? What? What are you looking to do?
Oh, I just pressed the claim status to see if it would do something different, and it worked like a filter, which is what I was wondering if it was doing.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
Oh, I would go back to the home menu. I I usually start at the home menu instead of at the resources and support page. Unless, like, I said, if I'm coming and I'm familiar with it, I would probably just sign in and then go to my menu. And then from the menu I'm used to picking out kind of the different options and knowing where to navigate. If I was new to it, I wouldn't necessarily know where to start.

## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you.
I would go to health care and then check eligibility. Yup eligibility for community care outside of Va. That's the top one. Look at that. So yeah. So, that’s very quick. And that’s where I would look.
So as you came in here, what were you looking for verses what you saw as you came into the page?
Eligibility I'm usually looking for, just like the paragraphs, how it's broken down. I'm looking at the titles I'm looking for the what's going to say, hey, when will we pay for your care outside of our network? In what situations we have had outside? VA care. But we've had to, they've given us numbers or voucher numbers. I'm guessing. Anyways, it's almost like a line of accounting that we give to the nurse, or administrator, or whoever's doing the billing over at the other place, but they tell us where we can receive the community care to. So it's like a list of places. So, I would be looking for lists of providers or if you've been approved a link, maybe, or acknowledgement of what that line of accounting is, or what to provide to the billing people because they usually like to look at your phone and say, Oh, what was that? And I just send them the emails or the text messages directly from the nurses, because it's easier that way, and then things don't get confused.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
I would probably go to either community care or and it's for an actual health appointment for his health care. So, I would go to health care and see if under health care there's reimburse. Yeah, VA travel expenses and mileage. Then I go in there and then I'd look for loading little button, usually like the safari one like down at the bottom. I would look for more of an upload button and or a little button that says, upload documents here and hopefully, there's a drop down, menu, so you can label it accurately, receipt for mileage or bus ticket or whatnot.
What are your thoughts as you came in to these pages, as when you're looking for info about the reimbursements?
Well for the reimbursement, for the health care. I think it's valid underneath the health care, because whether you're getting it at the VA. Or whether you're getting it at the community care center for the Va. That's getting it. The person that's getting it. We don't really care how it's paid. We just want it to be paid, right? And so, I think it makes sense underneath healthcare. If I was just submitting it for the first time, I would almost want just like this upload document option. And then it says, type a document, and it would tell me then I could use the select button, travel, or whatnot.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information.
I would probably go to records and documents. and I just selected it. And it's going like it's going kind of slow. That's change… Protect your identity. Now, how to change your legal name and file with Va, so no, it's not there. Then I guess I would go for review. I would look for reimburse the pack deck and your benefits. How to change direct decision reviews.
What are you looking for? 
I’m looking for key words, eligibility documents or application documents applying for what's required. Evidence to support VA Pension DIC, or accrued benefits claim. And that's what I was filing a claim. Right? Yeah. And so that's what I would be looking for. Paticipant scrolls through page… Not sure!
If you weren’t sure, what are some things you might do to try to find?
I would search.
So in this case, this is just a temporary mock up like I mentioned in this case, let's enter. In this case, let's enter the let's select the option. Search term P. 
Did it take me to search term P, or did it? Bump me back out, okay, so, Ova, money.
Let’s try E.
And what are you expecting to see? You're hoping to see as you.
A list of requirements. (Participant cut out) that I filed how to file VA, The Pact Act, waivers for benefit debt, claim status tool and then evidence to support.
What are your thoughts as you came into this page after?
It's still. I mean, it lists out a bunch of things. I really don't like the abbreviations 1st thing in a title, unless you know what a DIC is. That's not gonna help you out. But evidence to support VA pension. I would almost. That's it's too much information, I think, all in one. It's was good, and then maybe specific types of applications that you could be filing for, or what you're wanting to review would be helpful.
This time you came in from the search field. How is this for you? Earlier you were kind of scrolling through and looking for the links. How is this for you and finding information using that search compared to when you were just scrolling through and trying to find those links that were on the top page?
I think, I said in the beginning, and I'm going to say it again. The searches have gotten 10 billion times better since they started. They are getting a lot better, and it's easier to find your information when you do searches. And I think, as we get older, and we're kind of narrowing in on what keywords people are using and learning to tag things. So everyone's kind of getting systemized in this, we are getting better at using keywords or identifying what to be looking for. So I use search a lot now, like if I don't have an intention to go in there for a specific thing, and if I was looking for information I wouldn't scroll through a bunch of pages.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this. 
Oh, I would go find out who is the phone call for the actual site. Probably the USA.gov. because that's the login that we usually use. So I would go down to the bottom of the page to find site information. And then I would click the U.S.A. dot Gov. Link find contact information to find trouble logging in troubleshooting, logging in. And then there was signing into the VA I clicked that, too, just because I saw it. I was like, Oh, okay, well, what's that? Having problems signing into the VA well there you go? There's also contact us, I guess. If I couldn't figure it out from that page, I would go to the contact us and see if they have a specific contact for the logging in login requests.
What is your thought on the ways that you can dive into information or search for you know? Look into getting more information as you come in from that initial start point?
•	I'm I'm really liking the tags that they're working. And they're linking also to other sources of information where you can drill into kind of more specific information. If you're not finding it on the landing page that you get. I like that. There's a couple of different options where you can go from the menu or to the tags. And then underneath there's other information that says, Well, if this isn't, if you still need help, you can call us, or you can contact us.
•	

## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this.
I think there was a debt, one payments and debt. I would check their first.st I've had overpayments for school, or where I've had to pay them back. It's not fun, but it's easy to kind of get your bill. They they're really nice about sending you a bill automatically, too. I don't know if they're going to get away from sending out the bills, but it's really hard to miss that you owe them money.
And as you're scrolling through here, what? What are you? What are you looking or expecting or hoping to see as you come in to these this list of pages?
I was looking at submitting a financial status, you know. Sometimes you can appeal like if they've overpaid you, you can appeal paying it back or ask for a payment plan. They don't expect you to pay it all back all at once, if it's on fault for overpaying you. And that's what I was for. Okay, what's waivers? Okay, here's your debt management. That's how much I would owe. But okay, let's see, how else can I pay. Can I just send it through a direct deposit, or do I have to mail a check, or can I just make a payment and it go through? And I have my receipt sent to my email. That's what I was looking for like a payment portal.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
I would go to the search menu. But I didn't see it right there, so I would go back to the search. Seeing all sorts of stuff. I was wondering what this the financial status report was. Repayment of debt relief. So, okay, that's the form that you submit to ask them for certain payments right.
What would you want to do at this point, as you're scanning these articles here?
Oh, I would read. I would read about submitting a financial status form and see if that would help with the debt, relief, or how to pay it back or whatnot. I would dive into that before figuring out exactly how much I owed them. I would like, Hey, do I have to pay it all back at once. Let me know. Let me see if I need to submit this with my payment too.
## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
Yeah, we've done this before. He actually went and got a profile and career and employment right there went to some facility to get his kind of what type of work he could do. Yeah, career resources for military and spouses enter. O*net interest, profiler career assessment. I think it was that. I guess they do it online now. But he went in person, and he was profiled, and they gave him a list of things that he was good at and the types of jobs. And then they actually gave him a list of contacts for some of the area places that preference hire for vets, and he was to reach out to them and call them. It was actually really neat, and it was very appreciative, because when people transition out of military into civilian life, whether they have disabilities or not. It's a different ball game altogether. And so, going back into or working for the 1st time for regular civilian job versus a military job. It's very different. So that helped him out a lot.
## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes
1.	Overall, about everything you've seen in this session...What worked *well* for you?
The search tool like I said, I love the sign in and the menu at the top. I like seeing where I am in relation to home to be able to go back. The bolded colored links that tell you where you can go. In the common topics. I would almost put browse by benefit above the common topics, but I guess common topics would be the most frequently visited sites, and where people are looking for the information that might not be as important as the benefit type, because not everyone applies for the same types of benefits or is affected with all of them.
For you and for your husband. Why, why would you ideally like to see that browse by benefit, come before the common topics?
For me, it's because I'm usually going in here for a specific reason. And so like healthcare. Or I want to know about my Champ VA, or I'm gonna go in here for the education and for my reimbursement, or getting my filing my VA credits with my VA counselor over at the school, you know. It's just to go by the benefits. But do you have the search option, too, and if I'm not signing in and going to the menu and going directly to what I need. I could do the search, too.
1.	What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you?
No, the biggest one that I've had issues with, and it drives me absolutely crazy. Even now is the champion being separate from the health administration so like when I was trying to change my last name. So, I had kept my maiden name for the longest time, and then the military, issued me one of their identification cards with my husband's last name. My name hadn't legally been changed, so I finally went and got my name legally changed because they wouldn't reissue my military Id with my correct last name. So, I went to go change it here, and I changed it in every single place I could imagine to change it. But Champ VA would not update my last name for my filing of claims and my claims because they go by social security, but they have to match the exact way, like Medicare, or whatever. Anyways. they kept referring me back, and the VBA would refer me back to the Veterans Health Administration. And every time I talked to somebody at the Veterans Health Administration, there's like, you're not in our system. You won't be in our system. Because you're Champ Va, you're not. You don't go to the VA  and so, having maybe even an integration or a transition person that could direct people, or where they could see both sides of care for dependence of people. That go from the veterans health to see if they're covered by Champ VA, like linking them there. That would be very helpful. I know you guys don't have that control. And this is the application. I'm just saying, I want you guys to reorganize the whole place. So it works easier for me.
1.	What would you like to *change or add*?
No, I think you're doing great as a product owner for these trying to integrate all these different age benefits. It's a huge task. I would not want to be you, but it's getting better. I've noticed it getting better. One of the things that I didn't do here that I do use is the uploader tool, and I don't know if there's a different way to allow the verification of identity when you're uploading the tools. But like, when I was trying to change my name. It kept going in a circle, and it couldn't validate who I was, because my driver's license had changed, but the people that they had on record for whatever was still under my other last name. So that was cumbersome to get through that I think I tricked the system in order to do that. But then when I went to go upload, the documentation of the name, change the uploader wouldn't work, and then we tried sending it via email. And it blocked my email. So just yeah, some sort of way for a full access, like, maybe just like a drop box where almost any VA Person, if they were told to go there, they could go to this drop box and pick up this number documentation that somebody drops in to the uploader, and it identifies by our sign in, or something.
How would you go about, or when would you want to use these different aspects of these different components of the page? You know the sign in versus the search versus the common topics versus the browse, by benefit?
I usually automatically sign in, because I feel like it takes me directly to our our identifying information and things that are pertaining to me like most frequently visited. I almost say I feel like it remembers when I go in there like the last place that I visited. It might be my imagination, but I always feel like it's easier to find stuff that I've just recently done. That's one of the reasons why I sign in most of the time when I first go in. I don't know. Maybe that's just a habit and a personality thing, but if it didn't have that memory or that where this idea, where I think that it kind of does this frequently visited page kind of thing, then I wouldn't sign in as often. I would just use the menu and the search option the most. Occasionally I would scroll through just to see what's being offered or being said, or if there's new news or a new tab just to see if there's something I'm missing or something new that's come up. Otherwise I don't know how often I would be scrolling, just looking for things.
The title of the page here, resources and support. What does that tell you? The type of information you'll find?
Yeah, in the resources and support I would expect to find the actual links to the benefit types and then them connecting me to the different agencies that would provide those benefits instead of searching by agency or by the the provider. And I think that's what a lot of my confusion has been with the Va. Is like. I didn't know whether to go to the Veterans, health administration, or to the veterans. Benefits information like even as a fiduciary like changing information for pay. I couldn't just go to payments and debt. I had to go to the fiduciary unit. and I don't know if that was gained through experience and having to navigate the system. So if I was just coming to this website, I would hope, under payments and debt that if I was looking to see what we owed, or seeing what was being paid, that it would also make a note or a link to like hey? A disclaimer like. If you have a fiduciary, you can't use this, you won't be able to change your own benefits. Your fiduciary has to file this form, and this is who you contact.
Thinking about like some of the tasks we've gone through today. Does the name of this section resources and support. Does that kind of encompass what you would envision you can do? Or is there a different phrase that might.
No, I think resources and support is inclusive, and it uses everything. One thing I would be kind of concerned about is if you are looking for support like some. I'm not sure if other vets or something, but if they were looking for support, you know, kind of like those 1 800 numbers for the suicide. It's a big thing in Vets where they're committing suicide. So, if they're saying support that they need help like help immediately, there should be something that is under support. That's the first thing when I saw the support. But the resources? Yes, I definitely think that encompasses what's on this page?
1. *[If they didn't use filters]* Did you see the words with light blue underneath them?
     1. What do you think they are, and how might you use them?
I'm I didn't think much of them, but just like the little tabs. I would think. More like, Oh, am I looking for family members and caregivers? I would use this in this in the case of if I really couldn't find something that I was looking for, I didn't even see the benefits. Okay. So it does do the benefits up there, instead of having to scroll down.
Go ahead and interact with some of those? What would you like to do like you just clicked on something. What would you be hoping to see?
Yeah. I was just saying like, earlier, when we were looking at the payments and the that. So these I did not mean to do that sign in and profile. But I would expect it to do the same as the links down here without having to scroll for it. I really like the tags better than the actual filter button, and expanding the filter.
What do you like about the tags compared to the filter?
They're easy. They're blue, they're colorful. They link automatically to it. I don't have to expand it. I don't know. I feel like the tags and the filter create the same kind of effect. But it's good for people that have different ways of looking at pages. So you have multiple ways to get to the same spot that links to the same spots, or will get you to where you want to go. I think that's awesome.
     1. I don't remember you using them before. Can you tell me more about that? 
     1. Would you like to try them now?
          1. What do you think about using them? 
     1. Which ones are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any missing that you think should be there? 
1. *[If they used filters]* Let's look back at the filters you were using.
     1. What did you think about using them? 
     1. Which filters are you unsure about what they mean?
Yeah. The audience, the only the one that kind of threw me was seeing the active service members. I didn't realize that they interacted with the VA as much. I don't know. There's usually hospitals on site, you know. At the bases and whatnot. So, I just didn't expect to see active members at the VA. But no, I'm this encompasses everything that I would expect to find and more. Again. Some of the benefits I don't use, and I wouldn't need information on them or use them, so I ignore them a lot of the time.
     1. Are there any filters missing that you think should be there? 
1. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?
