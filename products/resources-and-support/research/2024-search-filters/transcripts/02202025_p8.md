1. Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for? About 6 months ago I weas looking for community care information.
     - What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for? I found what I was looking for.
1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov?
It was fairly easy, it took some digging but I found what I was looking for.
How do you describe digging?  I had to put in several searches to find what I was looking for and I had to navigate through what I was actually looking for. 
## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have.
I see a sign in right at the top, which makes me think I probably need to sign in if I want any personalized information. I see a menu I hate menus and a search bar. Filters I assume would be once I search. There are some links I assume are common links people search for. 
What do you hate about menus? I think they tend to be broad, I have to go through multiple layers to find what I am looking for I would rather search instead.
## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
Going down to claim and claim status or decision reviews and appeal, I’m not sure which. I’m going to claim and claim status. There is a filter and some links. I want to find out how long it’s going to take to get information. I don’t know if the claim status tool will take me there. I’m not sure I’m in the right spot. I would probably clear this and go back to look at the other link I was looking at. 
Go ahead and do that. 
I was looking at decision reviews FAQ, I’m not perfectly sure. (scrolling up and down, not finding what was expected). I was looking to see how much time, maybe an FAQ, I’m just not sure at this point where I expect to go. Nothing is jumping out.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
I would probably search here.
Select E please. What would you do next?
I click the search button. It’s filtered it down, now I am going to search and see if I can find what I am looking for. I’m guessing I want the claim status tool. That looks like what I am looking for right there the FAQ that will tell me what I am looking for. This is confusing here the tags at the top I don’t know what that means. I expected that I would have a list of FAQs with answers that I am looking for. I would assume that these tags would narrow down what I am looking for. I’m not sure what they do if I select them. I don’t know why I was taken here with all these tags. I went into Claim FAQ but now I am and tags with burial. Claims and claim status might be what I’m looking for. Now I am already confused I have already clicked on Claim and Claim status a FAQ and now I am here with Claim and Claim status FAQ. 
Now that you have used a tag what is your opinion? There is no indication what the tags are for. It just says tags instead of options. Tags just confuse me. 
What does resources and support mean for you?
That’s an over all where I would search for anything, documentation, where I would go to get specific information on my claim.
## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you.
Let me see I’m going to scroll through here to see if there is any information right away. I know community care is health care out in the community so I would click on that. If I didn’t I would go up here and search for non VA care.
Let’s go ahead and search here, and lets use C this time.
Okay, eligibility for community care outside the VA, I think this is what I am looking for. 
What makes you think this is what you are looking for?
The first blurb under the link.
Go ahead and click on it.
Oh boy more tags. It looks like there is an article here that I am looking for to get more information.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
Again, I am going to look and see if there is anything already here. I see nothing there so I am going to have to go search for that. I don’t see anything that says anything about travel. Maybe payments and debt but I’m not sure so I am going to search for travel pay.
Okay lets search for that and use term T.
Reimbursed VA travel expenses and milage rate, That looks like what I am looking for. (After clicking and scrolling) Again I’m not sure what the tags are for. 
Let’s select and explore the family member’s tag. What do you expect to see?
I see nothing to do with what I had searched for originally. Now I am really confused with the tags and what do they mean.
What does the blue bubble that says family members and caregivers mean to you? 
I think family members and caregivers. 

What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information.
Claims and Claim status is where I would go. I’m scrolling down to see if there is anything I’m looking for. I would guess it’s intent to file but I’m not sure. This says evidence to support btu it says pension DIC and benefits. 
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
I would do a search. If I was going to select a tag I would go to disability because that’s the claim that I want to make.
## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this. 
Okay, scroll to see if I have any information. Signing into VA.gov that’s what I am having a problem with that is where I am going to go. Again tags… Okay you know signing into VA.gov sign in and profile is probably what I am looking for as an additional link that I am looking for.

## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this.
Payments and debt, if I think I owe the VA money that is where I think I would go because I think I might have a debt. Let me scroll down again, GI bill doesn’t answer my question, reimburse travel doesn’t answer my question. Va debt management that looks like where I would go. I don’t see anything else that would be it. Again, it’s got tags, I had already selected debt management. It seems a little redundant here. I am expecting to already be into payments and debt I wouldn’t expect to select that again. 
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
I would search, I would not expect to find anything on the home page, let’s give it a quick scroll, I do not see anything. I would search for career or something. 
Okay let’s search and select J.
Career resources for military, that doesn’t tell me. I would guess maybe the O*NET interest profiler career assessment might work. Let’s see what it came up with, now that I have figured out what the tags mean I might click on veteran for more information.
## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes
1.	Overall, about everything you've seen in this session...What worked *well* for you?
The featured links worked well because they took me right to the information, I was looking for they were direct links. Everything else was a filter. I’m understanding of the filters, they were a little confusing and the tags I don’t know what they mean. Clicking on the tags didn’t take me to what I was looking for so I just avoided them. The search took me to what I was looking for, but the tags didn’t. I would probably bypass the tags and just do a search.
1. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you?
1. What would you like to *change or add*?
1. *[If they didn't use filters]* Did you see the words with light blue underneath them?
     1. What do you think they are, and how might you use them?
     1. I don't remember you using them before. Can you tell me more about that? 
     1. Would you like to try them now?
          1. What do you think about using them? So yeah if I knew what the filters was for it looks like I might be able to find the information I’m looking for more directly if I used the filters.
     1. Which ones are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any missing that you think should be there? No this really looks like what I was clicking on in the links, so I can do all the filtering at once.
1. *[If they used filters]* Let's look back at the filters you were using.
Veteran, careers and employment. It has two things. I don’t know if this is the mock up I would expect to see more. This really helps me it takes me more directly to what I was looking for. 
When would you want to use the different features?
Having gone through this now I would want to use the filters. That would help me really narrow down my search. 
Is there anything that might make the tags more useful or the filters more useful?
There needs to be more explanation of what those things are to help.
     1. What did you think about using them? 
     1. Which filters are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any filters missing that you think should be there? 
1. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 
No
**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** *(yes / no)*
Yes
- [If yes:] Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
