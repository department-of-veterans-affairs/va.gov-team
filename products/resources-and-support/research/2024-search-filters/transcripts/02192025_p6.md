# Notetaking Doc for Resources & Support Search Enhancements

## Warm-up Questions

1.	I understand you are a (Veteran/service member/family member/caregiver). Is that right?  Yes. I am a caregiver for my father-in-law
   
1. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone) 
     Samsung A23 smart phone
1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I can dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, or (smartphone only) my colleague could text it to you.  Put it in the chat.
1. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? 
   Medical, mental health, and stuff like the GI bill and benefits that were available to me post service. And life insurance.
1.	When you want to learn about a program or service offered by the VA, where do you go to look for information? 
I don’t go to any VA sites first, I usually do a google search. If it leads me to a VA website I’ll go to that. But it’s usually 3rd party sites. To be honest I find the website convoluted. 
2.	What do you find convoluted about the VA site?
It's not very user friendly, the Va's website. In my opinion, it's hard to find a certain precise thing without spending a lot of time searching. Now, having said that, you know you use it long enough, you kind of know the tricks where to find things, but like, if I'm looking for. Like GI benefits, they have a search part in the on the website. But, when you type, something in nothing is exact, and it seems like it takes a long time to pinpoint what I'm looking for. Now the GI bill as an example, because of the times when, as a veteran, when you go to the VA site, one of the main things you're looking for is forms. So you can print out, fill out. And the search engine on the web VA's website makes things very hard. It’s not user friendly; it takes time. It’s not, how do you say, it’s not very precise. And so that's why I use a Google search. And there's some other VA organizations around here that it's just easier to use their resources than the Va's website, the V. There's just too much in the VA. I mean, it's huge.
3.	In the case that you were using it for the GI bill what were you looking for?
Mostly the forms. I try to avoid going to the VA. I used the VA resource center website, it easier to navigate then the VA website. 
4.	What do you find more beneficial about the VA resource center website?
   Ease of use. And also it's easier to find what I'm looking for. You know, I got since I got my computer up, I'm going to be finding the places that I use. Maybe I can send it to you guys like, for instance, one of the best places websites that I use is the Colorado Veterans Project website. That is very, very easy to use. I can find things even in their search bar. They make things easier, a lot easier than the VA. If I go to the VA's website, it's like daunting just to look at it and to try to find what I want. So I guess you know, in today's society, with instant gratification. You know, we got to get things done. Now. It's just easier to use other websites for my VA needs than using the actual VA website. Now, there's sometimes there's certain forms I have to go to the VA website to look for.  But I try to avoid the Va website, because it's very difficult to use. In my opinion.
Okay. You mentioned that you mentioned that word difficult. If you were to kind of like gauge the level of difficulty, let's say on a simple scale. Say, one is super easy and 3 is really difficult. How would you? How would you rate the va.gov site as far as ease of use, you know, finding things like you mentioned?
I'd give it one of the worst numbers. Like on a scale of one to 10, 10 being the best, I would give it like a 3 or 4. It's like, you know, all right, I'm on their I'm on their page. I'm glad I got the computer up, because that'll help us out. You know, it's like, for instance, if you go on their homepage, it's like, Well, where do I go? You know it's like, okay. They got 3 options on the drop down menus. And I'm like, okay. Then they got the search bar in the middle. And then if I let's say I'm just typing in GI Bill.  But see, like I type in GI bill on the search, va.gov website. And it's like, okay all right. So there's a list of things that come up. And you know they've gotten better over the years, I will say with their website. You know, they have the forms, it's just it's just easier using another website. For. For like, for instance, like the Colorado Veterans Project, that's a good.org. That's a good place. That's usually where I go to this just seems like it's like, Blah, you know, it's like ugly, the VA website.
1. About how often do you use VA.gov?
1. Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for? 
     - What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for?
1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov?
## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have.
Yeah, this is actually good. Cause I usually don't. I usually don't use my phone. My to back, says Va, it just seems like it's easier on a computer. You get to see more on the screen. But anyway, so I'm scrolling down here. At least they got the search bar there in the middle that way. I can go do something right away. So, I'm scrolling down, signing in fraud featured. Anyway, common topics, they should be featuring the common topics. That's what I'm here for. So, claim. These are probably the most common. Yeah, most common topics that people are looking for. Like. For instance, for me, let's say I'm looking for more GI bill stuff. You know I was like, where the heck would that be? That's not on the common topic list I don't think doesn't look like it would be browse by benefit. Okay, well, actually, this doesn't look too bad. It looks very boring. But then that’s the VA very utilitarian. 
When you say boring, what do you mind if I ask what would make it less boring? If you don't mind me asking.
I think we humans, we're such a. We're such visual people now because of the Internet and phones and stuff, you know, like. I like it when apps and stuff have icons for things. You know, that visually, really kind of like, this sparks my mind a little bit, you know, and I don't know what kind of icons they could use. but like it, just that just seems drab. You got a battleship gray. Which being in the Navy. I'm used to the battleship gray, then you got the blue, but you know, at least it's functional, and it's doing what you're what it's supposed to do. But I think icons would add something to it. like, I said, because we're such visual people now. Things have to grab us, you know. But then that's not the Va's job. The VA’s job is to get me to where I need to go. So, but it just seems kind of like
## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
Without making a phone call, that would be the first thing I would do. They need to put the phone number at the top. I would click on claims. Talk to the veterans crisis line that is important. They have the white real-estate up there why not put their phone number up there. So now base on the scenario, I already submitted a claim. It’s telling me how to start from scratch that’s useless. I was expecting something that talks about the time period. My temptation is to call, but it has a claim status tool. I’m gong to click and hope it doesn't get me lost in search hell trying to answer a simple question. We humans are getting lazy if we don’t see something right a way we don’t want to scroll down. I am seeing claim status twice not, so okay I am going to click on it. Here you go typical VA crap. I would just get on the phone or get on the computer and go to a 3rd party website. I know this is a prototype, but this did not answer my question unless I missed it. This sent me to a loop and wasted my time. 
Go to search and let’s do D.
You just get stuck in loops, I kind of cringe when I have to go to the VA website. Ther are 2 results what? I want to see the frequently asked question section, that’s where I hope to find an answer. Instead I am stuck in a loop.
Let me ask if you were using the Colorado Veterans project what is on their website that makes it easier?
It’s Coloradoveterans.org. They have a nice scroll down list that you can find anything you want on here. 
Can you go to the top, when you browse through this can you not see similar things on the VA website here that you are talking about on the other website?
There is a lot there on the other website, this site is missing categories. The other site is designed for local. 
Going back to the top, please look at the topics listed here.
I see the search bar that is probably all that I would use. Yeah we have categories, but links to my part of the country are missing. A lot of stuff is going to be missing because every area is different. I can look through all this but I still need to find what I have locally. Nationally I only go to the VA for forms. 
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you.
This is going to be a treasure hunt on this site. I would go to benefits, and health care hopefully. That’s a tough one that’s a pretty good question. I think the first thing that came up looks good. This is useful. I would click on the first one, this is something that every veteran has to encounter. Latin needs work. I know this is a prototype, but its telling me stuff I already know. 
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
I would go back to the previous results and look at the other scenario that I saw. Here is the thing with the VA I always come to a dead end. I always have to end up calling. That is another reason I don’t use the VA website.
It there anything else on her that can fine tune your search?
Can I click on a tag. Community care is what I clicked on. Almost everything leads to a dead end. Here is another thing and I click on that and it’s going to another dead end?
How would you define dead end?
This doesn’t give me another logical step to use. It doesn't even give me a number. It gives me the possibility in 2 sentences. You have to go to another website. Social media is better than the VA. It would be helpful if there was a link to get me to the next step. I use reddit a lot I can go there and ask a question and someone with experience can help me. 
I don’t trust the VA, I do trust what other veterans say on reddit. To answer  your question there is no trust factor here. I’m forced by the VA website to go outside of their system. 
## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
That’s a good one too, I actually did that last year. I’m not familiar with this format. It could be under payment, or claim. I think last year I have to do a claim. This is where it would be better to call. I would go to claims. Having been on this part it’s probably going to be a loop. So in this case I would click on intent. Once again, no matter what I’ve got a call. 
Is there anything from the top page that might help you find out about the travel reimbursement?
It might be under health care. I’m not seeing anything. It’s still a claim. It could be under payments. 
Scroll back to the top. You mentioned search. Have you used the filters? What would you expect to see with the filters? Good question, maybe the topic. No this is a bunch of nonsense. The filters don’t even help. 
What would you be looking for in filters in this scenario?
A accurate search. That was a good question. It’s just better to call. I still think it’s under claims so I go there and let’s see what I find here. That’s a good question. Now I’m back here. Please tell me Rodney this is not the finished product.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information.
Oh boy, that’s the dreaded one when you have to deal with forms. I would look under records and documents. That should be at the top, that and claims that is what most veterans are looking for. There is nothing here, I have to go back. It might be under profile. At this point I’m lost again. The end game is a phone call at this point I would give up.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this. 
Signing in to the VA.gov that’s where I would go. Okay well, this is a prototype. (page is in Latin) I assume there would be answers on this page.

## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this.
Payments and debt, that’s where I would go. I go here, oh there’s the GI bill. I would assume hopefully on here, and it’s not here I can find out just a plain page of what I owe. That’s more a profile thing there, I would look at my profile and see if I owe money that way.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
What does resources and support mean to you?
It’s not giving me support, to me the support is the phone number. They should just say resources, I don’t view the VA website as support. 
## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
Let’s say I want to work for the VA, I have actually thought about that. I would click on career resources for military and go from there. I am actually thinking about opening a small business this would be beneficial for me to see what they could do for me. 

## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes
1. Overall, about everything you've seen in this session...What worked *well* for you? I like the search bar there. They need to put the phone number up there. It just seems like they have things backwards there. 
1. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you?
1. What would you like to *change or add*? The filters sucked. It just seems like I have run into a lot of dead ends here. 
1. *[If they didn't use filters]* Did you see the words with light blue underneath them?
     1. What do you think they are, and how might you use them?
     1. I don't remember you using them before. Can you tell me more about that? 
     1. Would you like to try them now?
Sure let's do veterans, and then I'll do like careers and employment. So, I apply the filters and let’s see what magically happens here. So I clicked on it and only 2 results come up. 
Yeah, that's just our prototype. If you scroll back up at the top, though, I think if you might be able to click on the search bar for it to hide this search term. It's little window. Okay, there. So as you came into the filters, notice these tags here at the top. What would you think those are doing, and what might you assume they would be?
I mean where it says veterans and career and employment. Well, that's just that's just showing me what filters I have.
Let’s go ahead and go into one of the pages there now. They were listed in the results. Just go into one of those articles. 
Career. Let's do a career assessment here with the O*Net. What the heck is O*Net? Okay we'll see. Well, I'm gonna learn what the O*Net is now. Never heard of it. 
So as you came here. In particular, we're talking about the filters. What would you say these, what would you assume that these blue bubbles are there for? What would you assume those are going to allow you to do?
That's gonna narrow down my search significantly, just like any other filter. Like if I’m shopping on Amazon. One the left side there’s always the filters.
Does that help you? Yes, it shows me maybe I need to do more filters. I like that they keep that up and show me my filters. I like too that you can click on the tag. That’s useful, that would lead me to at least something. 
          1. What do you think about using them? 
     1. Which ones are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any missing that you think should be there? 
1. *[If they used filters]* Let's look back at the filters you were using.
     1. What did you think about using them? 
     1. Which filters are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any filters missing that you think should be there? 
1. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?
