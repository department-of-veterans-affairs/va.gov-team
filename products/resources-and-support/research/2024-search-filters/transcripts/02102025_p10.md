## Warm-up Questions

1. I understand you are a (Veteran/service member/family member/caregiver). Is that right? 
   (Active-duty Army) No I’ve been out of the service since October 2022
1. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone) 
     It’s an Android Samsung
1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I can dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, or (smartphone only) my colleague could text it to you. Text
1. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? 
    A little bit of disability because of injuries that occurred during my time of service. 
1. When you want to learn about a program or service offered by the VA, where do you go to look for information? A variety of sources. I’ve really learned to trust reddit when it comes to looking at certain websites I use google, and definitely the VA website.
   

1. About how often do you use VA.gov? Hardly ever, I already came into the service with a master’s degree, some of the benefits on there I don’t really need.
1. Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for? Yes, so there was some confusion. I tried to get go on the Va. About maybe about 4 months ago, to see if I could get some clarification on it. So, I know for the army you know, when you get out you get a DD214 or something like that. I ended up learning that for the National Guard, which is what I was in the National Guard. We don't get the same form we get just kind of a service record. And I was actually able to find that information on the Va website. So that was incredibly helpful, because, it didn't seem like anybody else could really give me a good answer on that.
- What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for? 
1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov? Very good. Now I I've noticed an improvement in it in like the last year and a half or so I'd used it extensively about 3 or 4 years prior, and it was much more frustrating than it is now. The ease of use has definitely increased.
What particular aspects, if you’re able to explain, have become easier to use? The labeling ,the language on the page you know, and the search functions are much better, miles better than they were previously.
## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have.
Certainly resources and support. I like that. There's a search bar immediately right under. That makes me think I can get to what I want to get to rather quickly. Beyond that the menu certainly takes my attention because I know that's gonna break down to certain categories which I would probably find very helpful. Depending on what I'm looking for.
Should I go ahead and press the menu? Will something occur if I do. 
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and try to try to do that. Nope, nothing is happening. 
Okay, so what would you do next?
If the menu wasn't working I would use the search function below to type in 5 you know, type in whatever I'm looking for.
And if you could again explain what you're seeing and what you think about what you're seeing on this screen here.
I really like the featured function. Probably, you know what I'm thinking is the most pertinent things that are coming up right now that probably most veterans have questions about the Pact Act specifically, and the benefits, fraud and identity theft. I'm sure those are concerns with everything that Musk is being allowed to do. I really like the common topics underneath as well, because, you know, people are gonna find what they want to find. I imagine the majority of them right there. I'm sure they've been researched and labeled Common topics for a reason. So, browse by benefit, I really like that, too. You know, it lets you know what your benefits are, and kind of probably the most common things there. So, this is very well designed. As I've come to expect when I've used VA.gov. You know once in the last 4 months, and even a little bit, you know, before then.
What else would you like me to do here on the screen for you, if you like me to scroll back to the top or? I mean no, not really. I think I got a good idea of You know what's being shown to me.
What does the title tell you about what might be available here on this page?
Well, I really like that. The the crisis line is in red. You know that people can access that if that's what they're experiencing, if they have need of that right away from there. What really comes to mind is the resources and support and the then the very helpful blurb underneath that. Where you're just literally explaining to people. Hey, this is how you can do it. For. Yeah, this is what you can look for this is how where you can find it. And then, even beneath that for people that perhaps aren't very savvy with technology. Hey? We're gonna offer you, step by step, instructions so very reassuring. Very well done in that regard.
## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
I would begin to scroll the homepage, and because what I saw a minute ago I would assume it’s a common topic. I would click on the decision review and results. I would scroll down looking over and spending time in the decision review FAQ’s then I would look at the other two especially “What your decision review or appeal status means”, Especially clarification on that 3rd one. There what your decision, review, or appeal status means, so that I have a good understanding of of what occurred and what my options are moving forward.The text in the blue bubble what does that indicate for you? It tells me I’m in the right area. I was looking for decision review and appeals. 
Decision reviews would be where you wanted to go first?
So it's not the most expedient route. That would be the second one choosing a decision. Review option. But I would look at like knowing that it's been denied, and that I'm gonna I want to, you know, refile it, or whatever I would want to look at the FAQs first, so that I kinda have a thorough understanding. So decision reviews and appeals obviously sticks out I would click on that.
Coming into this page, what would you be expecting to see and what would you be wanting to do?  Yeah, I'd immediately head to decision reviews and appeals.
And what even though this is, you know, kind of dummy placeholder text here, what would make you want to click on decision reviews and appeals? Just because I mean, that's what I'd be seeking from from what you, from your prompt, your verbal prompt. You said it was denied. And there's that that blurb underneath that's very helpful as well. If you disagree with the VA. Claim.
Okay, so I'll go ahead and click on this, as you had indicated decision reviews and appeals? The FQ for this immediately catches my attention to answer questions I might have. 
Click on decision and appeal FAQ’s. Oh ok I imagine there would be more than place holder. I would go back to the previous page. I would go back to choosing the decision review options because I would have that knowledge already. 
So we're on the top page you had initially indicated. You would like to go to this decision reviews and appeals. So we did that on the subsequent page when we came down we clicked on the FAQ page and then we came back. And now you indicate you wanna go here. So, while I'm walking us through there on this page we came in from that top page, the decision reviews and appeals. The text in the blue bubble, what does that indicate for you? It just confirms that I'm in the right area. It it's narrowed down from the previous search options that are commonly looked at, and it tells me, oh, you know, this is where you're at decision reviews and appeals.
Now you had indicated you would like you would then likely go into choosing decision review. Was that correct? After looking at the FAQs. If I felt like I had a thorough understanding, then. Yes, if I still was a little confused, I would look at the prompt below there. The what your decision review or appeal status means, so I can get clarification on that.
In this case, which one would you like to look at? Let’s look at the third one since the last one was a place holder. Maybe this one will take is to something. Yeah okay kind of what I figured.
In general, though, if you had seen information that you were expecting to see here what would you want to do in that case, and also, if you were still not sure or weren’t satisfied with the info you got? Well, I would then begin looking at alternate sources. Specifically google, reddit typing in claim denial what to do now. 
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you.
Two different options come to mind, with the best one, in my opinion, at least initially, being healthcare, where it says browse by benefit. There you go. Eligibility, eligibility for community care outside the VA.
What would your confidence level be that you are in the right place here. I feel very confident. 
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
This one is a little trickier. Because it isn’t in any of the areas of common topics. So I would search for travel reimbursement. (option T) How to file a VA travel reimbursement claim online. There you go, reimbursed Va. Travel expenses and mileage rate. Can you go down a little more? That makes more sense how to file a VA travel reimbursement claim online. 
Let’s click on that one. There you go, this seems like the place to go for that information.
So I'm going to ask what was your expectation once you didn't see what you're looking for. As you scan down the page and then use the search. And coming into this page, what was your expectation? How was this process, or this pathway to get to this page for you.
Very easy, very user, friendly. It's what I've expected, because I was able to find my information when I used the Va. Website 4 months ago, very quickly in the past. So, I was expecting the same.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information.
Records and documents come to mind. Although that might end up being just my record and documents. Scrolling down to look at brows by benefit. I would use the search terms at the top of the page. I would choose search term S, just kidding I would type in the main words. (search term E) Scrolling through this one is a little tricky here. I would utilize the claim status tools, it would be a pending claim correct. (let’s say pension benefits) yeah that’s what I was thinking I would click on evidence to support pension benefits. Scroll down. Yeah, there you go find out what the evidence must show and what documents you'll need to support your claim. This was very quick very easy, I didn’t feel stressed or anxious through any of it. 
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this. 
Scrolling down, so one thing kind of hit “signing into VA.gov” I would like to scroll some more but keep that in mind. There you go worse comes to worse if I need help, I can give that number a call. 
What made you think signing in, but still go down and look for a phone number?
So just kind of what immediately came to mind to me was that when creating these websites and making them as user friendly as possible the demographic that you're probably catering to the most are the older veterans and having something you know, with their with their various technological challenges having it as one of the top things signing into VA.gov seemed like it would be a pretty good prompt but I had actually remembered the phone number from a previous scroll, or I thought I had remembered it, and that just confirmed it. When we, when we went down and saw it.
## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this.
I would flee the country! Scrolling down, Payment and debt. Scrolling down I would keep scrolling, none of this seems helpful. VA debt management and waiver for VA debt both look good. I would look at debt management first. Yes, this seems like it would be it.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here. Scrolling, careers and employment, scrolling, there we go O*NET. I'm actually familiar with O*NET. So that's always cool to do it, and every couple of years to see if anything's changed. But as of right now, I'm very confident in where I would want to be employed at if I was seeking employment, so I would utilize the career resources for military and surviving spouses instead. I'm confident I could scroll down and easily find a 6 figure job just waiting for me.
## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes
How would you go about trying to make use of those different features, whether it's the menu or those links, as we were scrolling down the search feature like, when would you want to use those one or one versus another? That would be kind of a case-by-case basis. I know the majority of reasons that people come to the VA website is for very common things that most people look for. I would probably use the search function more for like specific request that aren’t covered in the common areas.
1.	Overall, about everything you've seen in this session...What worked *well* for you? Honestly, all of it. I mean, even with all the different prompts you were able to provide, we were able to provide we were able to find everything within a minute. 
1. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you? No, you know. But again, that has to come with the caveat and my own bias, I'm very comfortable with, you know, you using the Internet and using search functions. And I know that's gonna vary greatly from user to user. And you know, if people are technologically savvy, and with it or not. This feels very dummy proof to me.
1. What would you like to *change or add*?
1. *[If they didn't use filters]* Did you see the words with light blue underneath them?
It didn't seem necessary, for, like everything we were able to find, we were able to find quickly. If it's something that I believed was a function that I would need to utilize. I would have utilized it.
     1. What do you think they are, and how might you use them?
     1. I don't remember you using them before. Can you tell me more about that? 
     1. Would you like to try them now?
So, I like right away that you kind of filter it out to information that's pertinent to different populations. Whether that's veterans, family members and caregivers or active service members. So that's incredibly beneficial right there. Below that the benefit an excellent idea. (Click on that please) There you go again. The most common topics, probably, that people seek clarification on. And then, even below that topic being able to click on that. So I mean, yeah, that all seems pretty straightforward to me. 
If you're going to use these, which ones would you want to interact with here? Which ones would you want to select? For example.
What applies to me is veteran for sure in the audience.  From there, I’ve always wanted to learn about my future burial so let’s click on that. From there I would show the filtered results. I don’t know how I’m going to do a decision review if I’m dead. Oh boy. (This could be the prototype here. 
1.	What do you think about using them? While it’s useful I don’t think that the audience that it would be most useful for would be savvy enough to use them.  If they are not technically savvy they aren’t going to understand what a filter is.
     1. Which ones are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any missing that you think should be there? 
1. *[If they used filters]* Let's look back at the filters you were using.
     1. What did you think about using them? 
     1. Which filters are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any filters missing that you think should be there? 
1. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 

**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** *(yes / no)* yes
- [If yes:] Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? no
