# Notetaking Doc for Resources & Support Search Enhancements

## Warm-up Questions

1. I understand you are a (Veteran/service member/family member/caregiver). Is that right? 
   Army veteran and veterans’ family member.
1. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone) 
     I have a smart phone
1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I can dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, or (smartphone only) my colleague could text it to you. Zoom chat should be fine. 
1. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? 
   The hospital and VOC rehab and some education stuff.
1. When you want to learn about a program or service offered by the VA, where do you go to look for information? Sometimes I will just look online to see what I can find. I usually just google VA benefits or whatever I am looking for,
  
1. About how often do you use VA.gov? Not a whole lot usually if I need something from it. 
1. Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for? I was on it the other day checking the status of a claim.
     - What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for? It showed me that it had received documents from one place but not which one and that one was pending but again it didn’t tell me which one.
1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov? It’s fairly easy but I’ve been on it enough to click buttons and find what I am looking for.

## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have.
It looks like a basic welcoming menu you have the option to sign in and I don’t know if it will let you sign in and save everything or not, sign in and kind of look around. Usually on something like this if I have a sign in option I would do so.
It there a task that you think you need to sign in for.  Not usually I am just hoping to find things that pertain to me. 
What kind of information are you hoping to find here?
When I think about resources and support
Let’s take a look at the rest of the page and scroll down the screen. What are your thoughts? Nice I like that they have common topics that clearly a lot of people are looking for. I like the things that are on there. 
What do you like about common topics? I like the little plus signs that I can click on and I would think will take me to answer questions I might have. I like the one above the benefits. Like community care that is something I use a lot of. 
## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
I would probably scroll down to the first section, common topics and then click on claims and claim status first. I would also probably sign in too because that would be more specific to me. I would probably look for a phone number on it. I like that, the claim status. Especially the evidence to support VA pension, DIC or accrued benefits claims. There is probably more but I don’t think I am in the right spot. Well first I would check Claim status FAQ’s. I am fairly confident I am in the right spot I would scroll down. I feel like I am on the right track it has the tag for claims and claim status.
So what does a tag mean to you? I don’t know if I can click on it but I would assume I can click on it and it would take me to more information about what I am looking for. Click on claim and claim status, I would scroll down. Did it bump back, I feel like it bumped me back. Because it brought me back to the same menu before we clicked on the FAQ section. 
What would you assume the text in the blue bubble is doing on this page? I would guess it is a filter because it says filter right below it. 
Is there a time when you would you use filter over tag? Not really, I am assuming filter would help me filter things down and a tag would take me to where I want to be.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you.
I would go to common topics and click on community care. I would scroll down and look in eligibility. I’m fairly confident that I am in the right place. That one was kind of easy.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
Scroll down, I would maybe go to payments thinking that travel pay would maybe be under there. Scrolling down click on reimburse VA travel expense and milage. I would scroll down. I am fairly confident I am in the right place.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information.
I would scroll down records and documents? Scroll down
What type of things are you looking for or hoping to see? I guess not in that area. For example pension benefits. Since we didn’t find what you were looking for in that first area. What would you do to find what you were looking for, let’s say pension benefits? It would be under brows by benefit and then pension. Scroll down and probably go under intent to file, I guess that’s where I would at least start. I’m confident that I am in the right place.
So you were scanning those links and didn’t see anything you wanted to see. How often would you use a search function on VA.gov? I usually just push buttons. 
In this case if you wanted to search what would you search? I would search Pension, or search term P, let’s use E. Scroll down, I guess since it caught my eye I would go to the top one because I saw pension up there. Then scroll down. I’m pretty confident. 
When do you think you would use search, or tags or filters? I would use search if I had a general idea of what I was looking for. And the tags if I knew what the specific thing, I was looking for like say pension I would click pension.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this. 
Usually I would sign in, but I would go to the bottom where there are the plus signs. I would expect to see a phone number, email, and hours. 
Is there anywhere else on here you would go to for help signing in? Probably resources.

## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this.
Scroll down I think I saw payments on there. Payments and debt under common topics. Scroll down to see, nothing is grabbing my attention off the bat. I would go back to the main page and probably use the search function. Scroll down and see what it gives me. Maybe the debt management but nothing is jumping out. The word management is throwing me off. 
Let’s go there like you had mentioned, what would you like to do next? I don’t know if I couldn’t find anything I would go to contacts and find a phone number to call.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
I would scroll down, career and employment would be one of the first things I look at. It depends on if I want to work for the VA or if I want the VOC rehab program or programs that would get me back out into the workforce. 
In this case what would you want to look at?
I guess education and training. As you’re scrolling, what do you see what do you wan to do? Maybe the top one GI Bill and other VA. I’m not very confident. I would probably back out and maybe type in job skills or employment assistance or go back careers and employment. Searching for job skills let’s see where it takes us. What would you want to see here? Maybe an FAQ section about this program can help us do this an contact information.
