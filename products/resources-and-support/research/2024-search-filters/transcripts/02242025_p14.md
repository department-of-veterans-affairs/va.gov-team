# Notetaking Doc for Resources & Support Search Enhancements

## Warm-up Questions

1. I understand you are a (Veteran/service member/family member/caregiver). Is that right? 
   Army veteran, correct.
1. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone) 
Smartphone
1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I can dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, or (smartphone only) my colleague could text it to you. Zoom chat
1. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? 
   Disability benefits, and I used my GI education benefits. Va health care.
1. When you want to learn about a program or service offered by the VA, where do you go to look for information? I usually learn about the programs that are available to me, either from newsletters that are sent out or by asking my doctor.
  
1. About how often do you use VA.gov? I probably use va.gov to like refill my medications and stuff and message with my provider once, twice a month.
1. Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for?  I was reordering a prescription.
     - What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for?
1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov? I think that health information like how to message your provider. It's very easy. Looking to see your scheduled appointments is very easy. Your like health lab results is very easy. Pharmacy. Renewal is very easy. Looking up your GI benefits is very easy. The thing that is really difficult, is figuring out who to call when I want to schedule an appointment.
What in particular makes that difficult for you?  It is like top secret information, what the direct phone line number is for any organization. I can only ever find the like call center number. And even if I locate another number, then it like routes me back to the call center number. So, you can only take the call center people and so that is difficult on VA.gov. So, I never go to VA.gov to look for phone numbers because it's always the same one.
## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have.
So, my thoughts are that I like that. It has a show, filters button. Then what is probably the most common things like how to sign into VA.gov. I assume these are all the most common things people want.
Show the filters button, what do you like about this? That I can filter by what applies to me like, I am a veteran, an active service member, what benefit I’m looking for that kind of thing.
Now that you’ve opened that what do you like about what you’re seeing here? Is there anything that you feel would be missing? I like the audience is the first breakdown, benefit is obviously a key one and topic. I’m just liking like what do I think would be missing? No I would day nothing is missing other than that contact information. 
When you come into the top of the page, what does the title tell you that you might be able to do? Or what type of things might you be able to do here on this site? Just resources.
What do resources and support mean to you in the context of the VA and Va benefits?
It makes me think of information. Things to help me, documents.
## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
I would probably do a quick scroll and see if it’s one of the top things to find a link. If I don’t see one because I don’t think I do. There is nothing that says status. Oh, hang on clam status too FAQ. I would probably pick this one. 
Do that, and as you come into this page what are you looking for? What are you thinking? And how confident do you feel that you are headed in the right direction? Is it supposed to be in Spanish? (it’s the prototype) Okay, the tags. Well, I don't know a lot about submitting the claims for status. I’m not sure how the tags apply. Tags are a little overwhelming. I guess I don’t know how they apply or how I want to use them to find what I’m looking for. The word tag doesn’t mean anything to me. Is it supposed to say something along the lines of claim and claim status? Are you looking for like that kind of thing like the word tags here doesn't mean anything to me. It's like, the word tags, and a series of other words.
Okay, what else about this page as you came in from that link earlier? And what else might be contributing to? Maybe some of the lack of confidence that this is in the right area, perhaps. With the exception of the with the exception of the language. Honestly it has bad grammar, so it makes me think the website is fake.
What might make this page give you more confidence as you come into the page?
I would change the organization of the page. Right? Like claim status, will ask questions. I would put the box up top that says, find out what kind of information you can get from the status tool. Learn how to use the tool to upload new evidence, to support your pending claim. And then again, like, what are these tags like, the word tag doesn’t mean anything.
Those tags, those blue bubbles. What would you assume you might be able to do, or what might they be there for? I assume that the first 3 are similar to the audience filter that you had before. Like, if you’re a veteran, click this, if you’re active etc.  The others are just like focus topics. If you have a question about burials and memorials, click on this. If you have a question about survivor compensation, click on this. 
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?  I would make my best guess and click on something. 
I’ll ask you to do that. What are your thoughts now coming into this page, considering where we come from the last page with those tags?  I'm pissed. I'm pissed because it just routed me back to the same web page that I was that I just came from.
Now in this case what would you want to do? What would you want to see? Different web pages. Did it lead to something else right? Like, if I click on education training, I would assume that it would take me to a different web page.
What do you assume that the blue bubbles on this page are for? It has applied a filter.
If you apply the filter, what would you assume is happening?  That it has filtered all of the articles that were existing on the page before down to education and training.
Is what you just describe the same as what you’re seeing here as you scroll down? No, I think they’re unrelated.
Okay, what would you be looking for? So GI Bill and other VA education, absolutely that's true. I can kind of see how direct deposit would apply, maybe to decision reviews. Compare VA Education that makes sense. But then you're getting into like, decision review, and changing your legal name. What does that have to do with education and training?
The parts of the interface that we've been discussing so far, like we came into the page from a link, and you mentioned the tags almost right off the bat. And now we're looking at these filters. What are your thoughts about? How that is kind of structured in this test site? The tags and the filters versus what you were maybe expecting. The filter I like the tag, I don’t think it’s the right word, maybe topics or filters again. 
You had mentioned that. Correct me if I'm wrong. If this is a wrong statement, I think you had mentioned that you feel like the order of these, the content is out of place. Is that an accurate statement like, where the tags are versus. 
Yeah I agree. 
If those were flipped how would that change your confidence level? I think I it would tell me I’m in the right place. 
## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you.
If I didn't know that the word was community connect, I would probably like go to search, and I would just say non-VA provider. (Search term C) After I hit search I would scroll down and see what it became. Eligibility for community care outside. Yeah, I would read like the first topic paragraph. I like that you’ve got a couple of lines.
How confident that you are headed in the right direction? What are your thoughts as you come into this page? The title of the page is good, it gives me confidence. The tags make more sense here. The tags is now tagging  what the page is about. 
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
Search term T. The first result is a good one. Reimbursed VA travel expense. I would click on it. Now the tags again make more sense right. Like whom does this apply to and then it tells me the blurb about what this page is. 
Is there anything in particular that is making more sense for the tags? It's the number of tags that I'm seeing. The first time I sad that the number of tags was overwhelming, and it didn’t narrow anything down. But here this is telling me that this page is related to Veterans, Family members and care givers, Health care, payments and debt.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information. Once I go to this page I would go to common topics. Then I would be like of maybe its records and documents I would click on that. 
How confident are you feeling that you are in the right direction? So, when I look at this, I can see that it's applied sort of like filter. But then these things don't seem to help me about what I was looking for, about my, what I need to submit.
What would you do in this case? I would probably it the back button, and then look at some of the other things down here. (Let’s say pension) I would click pension and see what’s in that section. The fourth one would be what I would pick. Now I feel pretty confident when I click on this, it’s going to take me to where I need to be. I think this page is a good summary. It talks more about the topic, documents, and then says find out what evidence you must show and what documents for your claim.

What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this. 
I would probably go to signing into your VA account online. And this I would feel confident with this. Get your answers to about how to sign.
Okay, what helps you have confidence of anything in particular on this page? It tells me that it's going to answer my questions about how to sign in.
## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this. I would put it under payments and debts. That's what I decide to click. This is more about policies to me, how to get money. VA debt management would be what I want.  I would click payments and debts. This is more like policies to me like how to get benefits and how to get money. VA debt management is what I want. Also, I can get a waiver for what I owe. I’d click on debt management if I wanted to find out how much I owed. Again. I like that. It tells me what the page is gonna do get answers to my questions about these things like who it applies to, and then what to do like. Then more about that like, learn why, learn why you may owe us money, and how to check your balance, how to repay.
What would you want to do after reading the entire article. What would you hope to do? I hope there will be a link that would take me to check my balance. I didn’t know you could check your balance.

What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here. Browse by benefits careers and employment. I feel good about the first and second result. I don’t know why it wants me to change my legal name but the first two are good. I’ve never heard of O*NET before. I would probably click on that and see what kind of job I would like to have. 
So, in this, as we've gone through, you were scanning through and seeing different. Let's call them features or functions of the site, you know. So, from the search to the filters. And then there's these links you've been noticing and interacting with. How do you think you would use each of those different features? And when is there a difference in how you would use those features? I think the page is organized very well. If I’m impatient I can search quickly if I just want to look something up. I think featured is a good idea. What I would probably use this page most for is like va.gov like if I went to this, and then there's like my sign in and then I like that you have common topics below that. I would probably look there first before I searched. 
What lead you to look at common topics first before going to search? The hope that my question is a common one and thus the VA has laid it out nicely on some kind of webpage. Instead of searching and getting hits that aren't relevant. This might lead me exactly where I want to go.
## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes
1.	Overall, about everything you've seen in this session...What worked *well* for you? I liked the format of the page. I like the ability that when I search something I can apply some different filters. I was thinking about like, do I want a most recently updated and I don't think the answer is, I think the answer is no, I don't think that matters just thinking out loud to myself. I like that there is the common sections that worked well. My biggest complaint is probably the tags because it wasn't until I got to it like the third or fourth time is when I was like oh, that's what the tags mean. Otherwise, it was what is this? What does this mean to me?
Anything else like those tags, and, like you mentioned, maybe changing the placement of where those tags were. Anything else that you would change or want to change.
I think the first thing we did there was an overwhelming number, it became so big it wasn’t helpful. I think tags is a good background feature. A person types in the word veteran person types in the word disability, and that's what helps you pull the page forward. But for that part of the interface, I think it just makes it a little bit confusing. Or do tags put it at the very bottom of the page. That is what most replicates other platforms that people are probably familiar with. Like social media, they have tags, and so that that would just translate better for people right like it looks.
1. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you?
1. What would you like to *change or add*?
Where do I go to call somebody, how do I get ahold of somebody. That is honestly the hardest thing to do. Some sore of directory. That is probably the thing that I get most frustrated with is calling. Otherwise the website looks really good. 
1. *[If they didn't use filters]* Did you see the words with light blue underneath them?
     1. What do you think they are, and how might you use them?
     1. I don't remember you using them before. Can you tell me more about that? 
     1. Would you like to try them now?
          1. What do you think about using them? 
     1. Which ones are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any missing that you think should be there? 
1. *[If they used filters]* Let's look back at the filters you were using.
     1. What did you think about using them? 
     1. Which filters are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any filters missing that you think should be there? 
1. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 

**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** *(yes / no)* Yes
- [If yes:] Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? When I blew my nose.
