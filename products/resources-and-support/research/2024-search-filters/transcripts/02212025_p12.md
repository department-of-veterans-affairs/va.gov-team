# Notetaking Doc for Resources & Support Search Enhancements

## Warm-up Questions

1. I understand you are a (Veteran/service member/family member/caregiver). Is that right? 
   I am a caregiver yes. My Dad
1. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone) 
     iPhone 16
1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I can dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, or (smartphone only) my colleague could text it to you.  I think Zoom chat should be okay.
1. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? 
   My dad is 79 and has lots of health conditions we have sought lots of medical support from the VA. We’ve been working with the VA for a long time.
1. When you want to learn about a program or service offered by the VA, where do you go to look for information? We usually go to the VA website or call the VA. I’m more inclined to use the website.
   
1. About how often do you use VA.gov? Maybe once a week or every two weeks.
1. Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for? A week or two ago to get information about some mental health support for my dad.
     - What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for? Yes, I did.
1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov?
I find the site user friendly, if there is nothing in the drop down you can search for key words. I find it very easy to work with.
## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have. When I look at a page like this I am thinking about what I am searching for. Assuming I’m already I am signed in I would go to the menu and see if what I am looking for drops down. If not, I would go to the search bar. If I can’t find anything through those to things I would scroll down and see what I might find here. 
What other things do you see on this first page here? I see veterans crisis line, VA.gov, I can go back to the home page, sign in features, common topics. My mom and dad would be more inclined to call the number, I am more inclined to use the site. 
Resources and support what does that mean to you?  A lot of things maybe supplemental services for my dad or support for me and my mom. Maybe something where you can get tickets for events. Or services that would help with quality of life. 



## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
I would check the menu if not I would scroll down to I would pick claim and claim status. What is the next thing you would like to do? I’m going to scroll down to see what it has to offer. I think I’m going to go with claim status tool FAQ’s. My confidence level is 80% sure that this is the right link. I’m scrolling down I would go back up and click on claim and claim status, I think. But it seems like that’s what I just selected. (It’s the test site there would be more information) How confident that you are in the right place? I think I would be headed in the right direction. 
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next? If I get stuck I may contact via email or just call.
Going up a bit, what do you think those blue bubbles are for? I see it mentions these are tags I’m assuming I can tap on any one of those and there would be information to what I taped on. Go ahead and click on that. This was my fear, it looks like it took me back, I was thinking it would take me further out not back. Scroll down you see another word bubble what do you think it is? This bubble is the same. I don’t know what the purpose is. I feel like it would take me back and forth. 
Go back to the top what are you seeing in the results? The highlighted claim and claim status and I’m thinking my next step would be the FAQ’s. When you enter an article and there is a filter that takes you to a page with a tag and you click on the tag for more detail what do you think? I think it could be useful. 
## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you.
I would do the same thing instinctively  go to menu, then scroll down and I think I would go to health care. Eligibility for community care outside the VA. I would tap on that. I feel confident I’m in the right place.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
Based on the last two searches I might skip the menu and scroll down. So I don’t, there’s not tab that is clear where I could get that information. 
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
Type in travel reimbursement in search tab. This is what I was looking for. 
For you, you mentioned you don’t want to search for key words. What is the reason you don’t want to search. I’ll do a search if I must, I just look to see if it’s already there. I’ll do a search if I have to. 
## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information.
I’m here under common topics I think I would look under records and documents. No this is not what I need. I may go back, maybe try payments and debt. No  this is not giving me what I need either. I may do a search of compensation and records. Applications documents okay. I’m expecting to see something like required documents. Maybe if I clear payments and debt that would help. Okay let’s see now. It looks like the evidence to support a VA pension is maybe what I am looking for. What is affecting your confidence? When I think of supporting documents I am thinking of the documents we need to file to receive compensation. As you are reading, how confident do you feel? To me this is a good introduction, but I would expect to see a link I can go to that would give me a list of those documents. 
How are you feeling over all about your ability to drill down into this and find what you are looking for? I feel pretty comfortable, I feel pretty good here. 
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this.  I would go to the menu to see if there is a support tag. If not, I would go down. Here it says signing into VA.gov but I am looking for something that says trouble signing in or something like that. 
Signing in on top and then signing into VA.gov it seems redundant but maybe not. I am looking for something that says need help.

## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this.
I just saw it before I would scroll down and look for payments and debt. What are you hoping to see as you scan? I don’t know some sort of debt profile; we don’t need debt management yet I just need to see if we have debt first. I think debt management is the closest thing here. But I feel like something is missing here. 
Are these articles at least in the realm of what you are looking for? Maybe. So, if I’m understand you just want to see something with the debt you owe? Yes. 
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
Yeah I just saw that too. Careers and employment yep. What are some things you’re hoping to see? I guess I would go to this O*NET but I would expect that to be at the top, because if not for the veteran we wouldn’t have anything. I would want to see those features first. Select whichever one you think you should choose. How confident are you. I am very confident. 
## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes

Looking at the area for applying for a pension. 
The filters are great it gives me the ability to be more specific. Of course, this is helpful yeah it’s just something I haven’t utilized.

     1. Which ones are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any missing that you think should be there? No I think those are good choices. 
What would you expect from those filters.
I would expect it to be more precise. 
Okay, apply those and what do you think? This is what I expect.
As you come into the VA.gov page when might you use those different tools? I could see myself using filters a little more, I don’t think it’s much faster that what I have been doing before but yeah it’s helpful.
