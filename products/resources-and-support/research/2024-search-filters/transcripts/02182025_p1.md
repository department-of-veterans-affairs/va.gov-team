# Notetaking Doc for Resources & Support Search Enhancements

## Warm-up Questions

1. I understand you are a (Veteran/service member/family member/caregiver). Is that right? 
   That is correct.
1. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone) 
     A Samsung mobile cell phone android.
1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I can dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, or (smartphone only) my colleague could text it to you.
 Wow you are getting a little too technical there, but I guess a Zoom chat.
1. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? 
   Wow let’s see. I’m 100% disable veteran so obviously I get benefits that align that way. I have medical coverage and I’ve got counseling if I need it . Burial when the time comes. Yeah, I’m pretty acquainted with the benefits for me.
1.	When you want to learn about a program or service offered by the VA, where do you go to look for information?
Probably the veteran service office.
And that’s a local veteran…?
Yeah, I don’t have to go too far for that. Probably 20 minutes away.
   

1.	About how often do you use VA.gov? 
Oh, very often probably at least once, twice a month sometimes more because of instant messaging and stuff you know.
1.	Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for? 
Well I had an issue and I needed to message my primary. I found out I had to do this login ID.me thing and that kind of upset me but that was change of arrangement which somebody did. I’m still wrestling a little bit with that. 
     - What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for?
I actually went to the to not the loging me completed all that now I am trying to do the IDme which is asking for multiple forms. I am still working on it to be honest with you.

1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov?
I have been working with that since it started so I understand the change in policy and format, so I have had to work with it. I pushed through it sat with it and I didn’t have any help with how to use it. I finally figured out how to get the things I need. Found my way through it and became a premium member and all that. With me it’s using and, hands on stuff that I learn best.
## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have.
First off, I see in bold print Resources and support, I have to process this a bit in my head as to where this will go. Then search or filter for information related to VA benefits and services including step-by-step instructions for using va.gov tools. Okay, so I guess I come to you so ahh. I need to fill in something not sure what. So, I see show filters, so I might go to that. Do you want me to proceed with what I’m thinking or. 
Yeah, that’s perfect kind of verbalizing what you’re thinking and what you’d like to do.
Okay, curious about filters. So, audience filter by audience, veterans, family members, care fivers, active service members. That’s the audience.  I don’t really understand. I guess the audience would be me. I mean when I think of audience, I think of somebody other than myself. So, I’m not sure where that’s going to go. I tap on benefit and topic I suppose. I go to benefit and there is all the listing of benefits which is pretty comprehensive. And then, topic claims status, community care.
Okya, now I’s tarting to  get a little bit.. I gotta have you know I gotta obviously have some, apply filters. Yeah I mean I obviously have to have a purpose for being her so. I’m not sure what that is other than, I mean if you want me to go somewhere with this or not, but it’s pretty straight out. I mean if I obviously if I check something I’m going to get a reaction right. 
Looking at these filters here, are there any items that you expect to be here or that you would like to have seen?
No, I’d say that they are standard. Yeah, no, they’re pretty clear forward. Again I think the audience is a little bit like, okay what’s happening here. Who am I letting in on this.
So you would have some questions about what the audience is?
Yeah, I mean when it says veterans I’m thinking jeez that’s a big group. Family members and caregivers, I’m not sure if I’m compromising my privacy. 
When you first came in what does resources and support mean to you?
I’m not going to take it for anything more than what it says. I think it is a Gateway to what’s beyond that. I’m at va.gov home so obviously it’s related to that. 
## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
Oh my goodness. Well apparently I would have to sign in to va.gov that would be the first access point to anything. I would guess go through those loops. I suppose once I get there I got common topics, claims and claim status. So I would think that would lead me to there. 
What would lead you to feel you have to sign in?
Oh, well nothing led me specifically other than experience. It says signing into va.gov. I would guess that means I have to sign in and set up some kind of password and the login thing. I mean it might even be just vague information at this point. Not vague but specific information as to how to sign up. 
Is there anything else on this website that might help you find information about when you might hear back from the VA about your application status?
Not specifically other than you know the general claims and claims status, I mean that’s the only thing here that would be in that same arena if you will. Claims and claim status, common topics is like a general overview if you will. I don’t know if it would take me to specifics.
Okay, go ahead and try to enter that link you just mentioned.
Here we go, I’m here on the page resources and support search results. I’m here at your intent to file a VA claim showing 1 0f 3 with 1 filter applied. What do you want me to do here?
What would this page lead you to do? What would you feel about what you are seeing here? What were you expecting to see when you came here?
Oh wow! See now, this, I’ve got a brain injury, so this is starting to get, I’m starting to get spun a little bit on the your intent to file a VA claim. I’ve gotta really slow myself down to find out how notify us of your intent. Okay again this is generalized information. You know I prefer talking to someone other than trying to read and deduce and get to the various levels if you will. Okay evidence to support VA pension. What is that? Am I ins a court of law here? Here's frequently asked questions I would probably go to that. Of all the things I would probably go to the frequently asked questions and find out what kind of information you can get from claim status tool. 
Can I ask you to go ahead and doo that?
Okay, here we go tags. Ahh okay (reading out loud) now we get into the latin> 
I have no expectations anymore. This is quite different from what I would have anticipated. All I see is Latin. This is pretty funny, at 6 0’clock in the morning this is what you do to me. 
Can you go back to the top page and relive us. How would you say your experience was for you trying to dive int look at a little bit more information.
Well, I mean I’ve been doing this for quite a few years now so you think I’d be more comfortable with it, but I’m still apprehensive if you will. There is so much different designe there’s not a lot of standard out there.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you.
Community care. Although we have need help at the bottom and I would normally defer to that, but that itself is a nightmare. So, yeah community care.
I would say that. 
Alright . I’ll ask you to go ahead and do that whichever one you would click on here.
Took me to resources and support. Okay eligibility for community care outside the VA. Do you want me to read these?
Yeah, what would you. Which one of these do you think would be. Would grab your attention the most here as you come to this page?
I’m generally a person that starts at the top so I guess eligibility. But I know I qualify so. 
What does community care mean for you? Well yeah it enables me to go to a private doctor or say I have to travel too far away, or they are 3-4 months out to be able to see me, there are options in the community. 
What would you do next? 
For me personally I know I am eligible for community care. So, how to get community care referrals and schedule appointments. Yeah, I might do that. I mean again it’s levels and I mean, I’m pretty well acquainted, generally I go to my primary, that’s my first contact and they would get things going. So, I know that enough to accomplish that. I’ve got a few phone numbers in my phone that can also lead me in that direction.
Okay so thank you for letting us know that in general you would probably and correct me if I am wrong. You would go to your primary care provider instead of going to the nest level, is that an accurate statement?
Yeah, probably because I need authorization and I would think that would be the most expedient way to get it.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
Oh, wow, other than… no I don’t see anything on here on this page that I could do that. I am actually not reading anything, there is nothing here that says travel compensation.
What would you expect to see here?
Under common topics there would be travel reimbursement or something like that.
If you’re not able to find what you are looking for what would you do next?
I would call the Portland hospital; I know that they have a department there that deals specifically with travel and reimbursement. Although this is one of the things I am going through right now is this transition of how to acquire that. They used to have paper forms that you could get in the lobby there. They’ve changed all that now. So this is a whole big change happening in the VA system I suppose. I am still working through that now.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information.
I guess, claim status. If I’m hearing you right, I have submitted documents and I am wanting to see the status.
You had to submit documents but you don’t remember what they were how would you look that up?
I’m going to go with records and documents I suppose under common topics. Records would mean somebody is entering data somewhere that says that I have submitted this and not that I suppose.
Here’s how to change a direct deposit, is this where I am supposed to be? It’s sending me to payments and debt. 
It could be an issue on our end. What would you expect to see?
I mean jeez. My hopes have been often times dashed against the rocks of despair you know. Because o f the slow you know, I mean I understand volume and the input. I want to find something that would represent what I’ve done and the work I’ve submitted.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
I can go to chat, I am old school I like to pick up the phone and talk to somebody who is helpful or go in person.
## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this. 
I noticed at the bottom of the page there is a phone number you can call. Time were here Monday – Friday 8:00 am – 9:00 pm Eastern time, I appreciate you saying eastern time the often leave that little nugget out. That’s where I would go. I would anticipate having to get put on hold forever right. Which, sometimes I get infuriated and hang up sometimes just I’ve been on hold for over an hour and a half. And then when I get on you know I’m talking to somebody in the Philippines and has been outsourced and the next thing I know we’re not taking care of business. 

## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this.
I guess payment and debt. 
Go ahead and do that.
Reimbersmetn for travel arrangements. Am I on the right page? (Yeah)
Wow, I’m a little overwhelmed right now by the language and stuff. How to change direct deposit, VA debt management… VA debt management.
Okay, I am at debt management. Oh, now we are back to the Latin.
What would you expect on this page?
Something in English. I get information overload, and I tend to shut down when that process is happening.  
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

If I recall correctly, you initially had seen the search area. How often might you use a search feature like that on these pages, in these cases? Is there any reason why you particularly choose not to use that search?
Again, I’d say information overload at this point, and then the wording is not specific to the question I suppose.

## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.

## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes
1. Overall, about everything you've seen in this session...What worked *well* for you?
1. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you?
1. What would you like to *change or add*?
Travel reimbursement could be a little more obvious. 
1. *[If they didn't use filters]* Did you see the words with light blue underneath them?
     1. What do you think they are, and how might you use them?
     1. I don't remember you using them before. Can you tell me more about that? 
     1. Would you like to try them now?
          1. What do you think about using them? 
     1. Which ones are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any missing that you think should be there? 
1. *[If they used filters]* Let's look back at the filters you were using.
     1. What did you think about using them? 
     1. Which filters are you unsure about what they mean?
You mentioned the audience, were there any other filters you were unsure about?
The benefit and the topic those were straight up. That’s well organized, this is pretty much what I would expect.
1.	Are there any filters missing that you think should be there? 
You had told me you'd be hoping to see reimbursement and things along that line. Is there anything else in the filters that you see here? Is there anything that might be relevant for travel?
No, I don’t know what else to say.
Can you select the one for payments in filters here?
Okay it gets me to reimburse VA travel and milage rate. Which I probably want to get to right?
Go ahead and do that.
I’m there. 
So as you came in and now kind of seeing how those filters will work when you apply it how would that be for you if you were wanting to quickly find topics again, I appreciate you mentioned you were hoping to see reimbursement, but kind of seeing how these filters now work once you apply it. How would that be for you ion general?
 Well, once I have an understanding of where to go, I mean my problem again is also memory. I mean I could do this today comeback tomorrow and not remember how to do navigate. Another thing with me too is just tapping on things and trying things out, my problem with that is I find myself in a vortex and don’t know how to get out or undo what I have done.
Tags
Again, tags does nothing for me. Links would be a better word for me. 
How often do you use tags on the VA website or other websites?
I have never heard of the term tags. I don’t know what tags mean. I would guess if I click on a tag it would take me to another link. But again, I am not sure what tags mean.
Let’s go ahead and click on one of those tags. What are you seeing as you come here to this page from the previous page?
Back to resources and support. Search results and signing into va.gov. Again I’m starting to get a little confused. I’m not sure where we are going with this. 
Go back to the top, what do you see right below the search of the search bar?
Below the search bar I see veterans.
What would that indicate to you here? 
Wow as opposed to the others, I guess it would be inferring that I am the one dealing with this.
You clicked on the tag Veteran. This has taken you to all veteran related links. How would that be for you if you were trying to find information on those topics. 
Of all choices I am going to veterans and or veteran, so I am comfortable with that.
Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?
I didn’t get into the login stuff, I’m not sure what that entailed. Not sure if you are using IDme for a long time we had a password which worked well for me.
