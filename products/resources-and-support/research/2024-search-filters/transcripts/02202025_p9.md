# Notetaking Doc for Resources & Support Search Enhancements

## Warm-up Questions

1. I understand you are a (Veteran/service member/family member/caregiver). Is that right? 
   Army veteran.
1. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone) 
     iPhone
1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I can dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, or (smartphone only) my colleague could text it to you. Zoom chat.
1. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? I've got experience with going through the claims process. I've got experience managing my prescriptions online. I've got a fair bit of experience with community care. Either the optometry dental, and then just things that are available at the hospital where they send me to a local doctor.
1. When you want to learn about a program or service offered by the VA, where do you go to look for information? I will try to go to VA.gov first to see if I can find it. If I can’t I will do a google search, sometimes that will help me and then if that doesn’t work I will go to a Facebook veterans group I am a part of.
   

1. About how often do you use VA.gov? Maybe 2-3 times a month. My most interaction is checking an appointment or a prescription. Sometimes I use that app I don’t know if that counts. It’s 50/50 app or website.
1. Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for? The most recent time was to check on a claim. My daughter had done an additional semester of college and I had filed that claim in May or June for the fall. It still hasn’t been through the system. SO I was checking to see if there’s any change there.
- What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for? In a sense that I found that there is no update yes. But I was hoping to find more detailed information. 
1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov?
I would say it’s not easy, but it isn’t always hard. It depends on what I am looking for and if I have been through that process before. I know how to use My Healthe Vet and how to get what I want from there. Sometimes is straight forward like online submissions. It has gotten a lot better. For example, my wife moved to Champ VA and it’s hard to find information about that. 
## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have.
I guess this is a page I would have come to, to find something. Sorry I didn’t have a search in mind, I guess that would help me.
What are you looking at what were you hoping to see here? WellI guess I was just clicking into the, I was curious to see what the filters were here, and how you know how I might be able to tailor what I’m looking for. I think audience is good because as I mentioned before my wife is recently on Champ VA and we have no experience using it. There is no Champ VA website, and it can be a long wait on the phone. So, it’s nice to see that you know possibly filtered through that. The benefits kind of goes back to what I mentioned earlier in terms of being oriented around what I’m trying to accomplish. You know how the VA is organized. Rather than trying to figure out what to navigate in terms of organizationally, I can just look for in this case maybe health care that is the biggest thing I interact with. 
As you look at this filter display, and you’re opening each of these sections. Is there any topics that you would expect to be represented here? Or, what are your thoughts about what you see under each of these sections? Well, I think it's a good way to break this down between. You know, if I can choose the intersection of, say, veteran myself. And then I could go specifically to community care if I was trying to figure out, you know, status of something there, or I could go straight to healthcare. I’m not sure if it would take me to My HealtheVet or just that would be in the search results.
Yeah, I'll ask you to go ahead and try to interact with this. And perhaps some of the things you mentioned that you might want to look for.
Okay. Alright. Well, I can see that this is good in terms of seeing that what I actually picked and maybe I had accidentally clicked on something. It looks like I can click a little X to clear that. Let's just say that I don’t know if that’s a topic I would look for. For me I might look for prescription for example if I could go straight to that page. 
Sorry, this is a mockup, not all functions work. As you see the results displayed, what would you be looking for, and how is what’s displayed here meeting your expectations?
I’m quickly scanning the title to see if it’s obvious to me that’s the one I was looking for. Can I get free health care prescriptions as a veteran. I’m assuming you are not logged in so this has to be high level. I’m hoping this link in blue here would take me somewhere to I can complete an action whether it’s to login. I like the related information. Maybe I didn’t type in the search well or picked an article that wasn’t exactly you know hopefully these  would be things that are related to what I was looking for.  

## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
Well, I would probably make use of these filters. I would pick veteran, disability, decision reviews and appeals. I would apply those and let’s just say search term J is what you said right.
On the previous screen when you were adding your filters what were you expecting to see when you clicked apply filters? I was expecting to see what we see here, they showed up as filters. Since I didn’t first type in the search term. I would have really thought it would do anything per se. But once I typed in the search terms, I would expect it to show only items that matched these 4 filters, Maybe I’ve selected too many. There’s nothing available in this scenario. 
You mentioned you might enter something in the search. What would you be trying to look for when you put in those filters. What would be the motivator to then further search on those filters? To try to find the amount of time I should expect between submission and decision. I would expect to see some kind of article.
Go back and try those filters once more. I would like to see when you activate those filters. I could probably click decision review, but I am going to click claims and claim status.
What are you looking for or expecting to see? I would be looking for how to apply for disability, what is the time frame on claims, what’s the process a claim goes through. What documents are needed I guess I would want to see that as well.
As you look through here what are your thoughts about the results you are seeing here?
I think this would give me a good place to start. If I’m looking for decision review, I am past intent to file. All the different aspects to filing are here. So rom intent to file all the way through you’ve got a decision. Claim status tool, I think is great, decision review FAQ, hopefully in there it will well me what the decision time frame looks like. You know the documents I might need to support for. 
What would you do next at this point?
I would go to the FAQ’s and see if time frame is one of the FAQ’s here. Hopefully that would be addressed here somewhere.
What is your confidence level that you are in the right direction?  Well, I would expect this would be one of the biggest questions that veterans ask, so my confidence would be high. That hopefully that is what you’ve addressed here. If it was something more specific to me, maybe something not a lot of veterans don’t run into, then I might have lower confidence. 
Are there any elements of this page that help you feel more confident that you’re in the right place or heading in the right direction? Well,’ the decision reviews and appeal Tag is here. So that helps me feel like I’m in the right place.
What do those tags mean to you, or what would you assume that their purpose is? That they would somehow match up to the filter categories or the filters that we picked earlier. I would expect that those filters are matching to these somehow so that I’m not seeing anything her that didn’t match one of my filters.
Now if you came to this level and at this point you weren’t sure if you were in the right place what would you do?
I’m clicking on this tag, oh, okay. So it just took me back. So I click obviously, I clicked on the decision reviews and appeals tag thinking okay, well it’s not here. But maybe I put too many filters on. Let me just click on this tag by itself and see what comes up.
What are your thoughts now based on what you’re seeing? After clicking on that tag?
Well, if the assumption is that I didn’t find it in the FAQ now I feel like I’m being presented with the same. I feel like all 3 of these were on the initial screen. Now I feel like I’ve gone in a circle.
In this case here it is most likely that it is because this is a mockup and limited functionality. How would you feel if you were presented with more options?
I would definitely explore and see if I were able to find an answer to my question.
Okay lets go back to the first page again. As we have been discussing you’ve mentioned some areas of this site as you scan through, and we’ve interacted with a couple of different pieces here. When you think of the I’ll say the tools that are at your disposal here to find information. We’ve used the search a bit, we’ve used the filters, and we were just mentioning the tags and other things that might be available to you on this page. When might you want to use, for example, say the search compared to the filters? Or when might you just want to scroll through and try to find something as you scan through?
I think if I come to this page, I’ve already got something in mind. I would expect to go to menu if I wanted to go to the main disability page, where I would expect there to be very general information about what is disability, how to apply for it, that kind of thing. So I think if I came to this page, I’d already have a search in mind or a topic in mind. I would probably immediately type in the search term and maybe apply filters to it if I don’t see it in the initial response. I don’t remember if these go away, I don’t think I’d even see these to be honest. I think it’s great actually that you’ve identified some of the common searches or topics or tasks right up front here.
What makes you feel you might not see those common topics and things you just mentioned? Well, because I feel like I would have something specific in mind that brought me here so I would go immediately to search. The phone screen being so limited I might not scroll down. I might scroll to see filters but I wouldn’t want to scroll past the search terms. 
That makes sense. And it made me think of a question for you. When you are looking for info about services on the VA how often will you be on a mobile device? Oh, that’s a good question, if I’m home I would say it is almost 100% on the computer. A scenario where I would be on my phone is if I was out and another veteran asked me something or they said hay I’m really having trouble. It’s not too often that I am out and about and think Oh, I’ve gotta check how to file a claim. 
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you.
I think the first thing I would do is, now I don’t know how to answer that. Now that I’ve seen these here I would go straight to community care. If it was my first time on the page I would do a search. (Let’s search C this time) I might choose veteran and then scroll and see. I assume it would tell me about community care but I don’t know if it would tell me what I need to do to receive it. 
What does community care mean to you? To me it’s any doctor outside the VA. Like if I need glasses I could get glasses.
you mentioned you hoped it would show you what you need to do to receive community care.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
I think I would come in here and honestly, I would type in travel pay. (lets hit T in this case)
So, this is travel expenses and milage I think that is going to have the information that I am looking for. Then I think it will tell me what it is, but I’m hoping it would tell me how to file. Hopefully there will be a link, and I have done that before, but it takes you to another system.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information.
I would go to the search bar and type in apply for disability documents. (In this case search E). In this case I probably would come in here (Filters) and the reason I’m think this is I expect there to be 20 search results because this is so broad. I would click on records and documents to see if it would give me a narrower search result. (In this case lets say it’s your pension benefits that you are applying for.) Well, so then, this one is close right on the mark for what I was hoping to find. And again, you know, it tells me what it is. I would think that's gonna be very accurate. I would hope down here in this scenario maybe under related information I would see something about what documents are needed. Or maybe this link here might take me to something specific to what I was searching for.
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this. 
If I hadn’t already seen down here signing in to va.gov. I probably would have signed in first and hope there is something like having trouble signing in click here. 


## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this.
I would never check for that I would assume the VA would tell me. What would I search for, maybe VA debt. (lets do option P). Okay, owe VA money. That’s pretty straight forward. In this scenario I think I would just search because I don’t have confidence that I know where what category that belongs under. If my search results didn’t have anything let me just look. Okay so I would go to VA debt management. If this wasn’t here and this was all the other I might go back to refine my search thinking okay, maybe I didn’t type in the right search term. 
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
So, since I have seen this, I probably would come down here. I'm not sure what to search on. That's what's driving me skipping that search bar. So I would probably come down here and go to careers and employment. I would try that first, this is such a big topic I wouldn’t know where to start to be honest. 
What might you do to kind of further to zero in on what exactly you’re looking for, and what are you seeing here compared to what you were initially? I guess I would click on career resources for military and surviving spouses you know if I couldn’t find specifically.  Lets say this is all kind of generic, I would probably go back and search for something more specific like Job search.

Amanda’s question
Was anything confusing or felt off to you, like maybe shouldn’t have behaved in a certain way or anything like that?
It’s hard to say when a lot of the content is just that kind of gobbledygook filler. But no, I don't. Well, I think maybe the fact that the filters actually is a positive surprise. The filter is actually change the content below before I put in a search term, because I kind of did it backwards where I went to the filter first, and I went to the search term. Yeah, I wasn't expecting that. But maybe that's a good thing. No, I can't think of anything else that it was surprising.
Anything else that was positive for you there, Keith, or that you thought worked well on the flip side of that question?
I do like the fact that I forget how they were phrased but you had those two groupings, maybe search by or common searches and then search by benefit. I do really like the way that’s put together. Then I don’t have to figure out what’s, sometimes you have to do a translation of what am I looking for? I’m looking for a job, but that’s career in VA in the VA language under career topics. They’re in education potentially, right? So, it give me a nice starting point, if I’m not sure what to search for.
