1. Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for? 
Last time was a couple days ago to go to My Healthe Vet to check a couple appointments.
     - What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for? Yes I did.
1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov? I think once you know where to find it, it’s pretty easy. But when I first started using it, it was challenging. I think the biggest thing is to know what you are looking for. Like if you don’t know you have to go to My Healthe Vet it will take some time to get where you want to be. I think the biggest thing is people don’t know where to go to find what they need. 

## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have.
This first page seems pretty easy to understand, everything is very straightforward, easy to read. The links are very apparent easy to find. I like that it has the crisis link up top. The links are very apparent (while scrolling through). It seems very easy to navigate, a lot of the topics are ones that people would need to see. Is this the initial page that would come up when you pull VA.gov up. Oh ok this looks like the resource and support page.
What does resource and support mean to you?
This is everything that a Vet would need.

## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
Scroll down first to see if there is a link. I would probably click on decision reviews and appeals. Or claim and claim status depending on what I found on either one. Decision reviews and appeals, I would be looking to see what the status of my review is. Let me go back here. I would probably go to the claim status. I would look here to see what status or stage my claim is in. My personal experience is I have never been able to find information to when I would get an answer. 
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
I would maybe use the search bar if possible or scroll down and call the 1-800 number to see if the have any information.
How often do you call someone?
When I first started I used it a lot but now that I am familiar with the site I haven’t used it in a while.

## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you.
Look at health care click on that. Hmm probably click on eligibility for community care outside the VA. 
At this point what would you be looking for?
I would be expecting to information on how to get health care outside of the VA. What steps do I need to take.
How do you feel at this point on the site? How confident that you are where you need to be on this site?
I feel pretty comfortable at this point. Right now I see the first part is in English but the rest isn’t I assume it would be in English. It has in bold print what the page is about. Eligibility for Community care outside the VA. There are the tags that reinforce that as well. 
What would you expect the tags to do to give you confidence you are in the right spot? I would expect to click on the tags and they would provide me more information to show I was in the right spot.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
I am looking for travel reimbursement or something along those lines. At first glance, I don’t see that. So, I would go to search bar I would type that in.
Let’s search and choose T. What happens there?
How to submit a claim for travel reimbursement, I would click there. It gave me step by step instructions on how to file.
If I don’t know exactly where I am going already, I will scroll through the home page for links or key words. If I don’t find it then I would use the search bar.

What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information.
Let’s say pension benefits. If I am looking for pension benefits, I see it says pension benefits so I would click there. It looks like I would need to go to evidence to support VA pension to see what documents I would need to submit.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this. Signing into VA account. Signing into VA.gov if I’m having difficulty I would go to profile. (Scrolling) what are you looking for? I guess I am looking for help. Normally if I’m trying to sign in and not able to for whatever reason there is usually a help or a recover password. If that didn't work I would call I guess.

## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this.
I would go to payments and debt. Probably VA debt management to see if there is any debt I have.
What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
Go to careers and employment to see if there is any options they have. Career resources I would click on that first. 
Earlier we talked about the tags. What is your expectations when you click on a tag?
Information related to that tag or links related to those tags.
Go ahead and click on a tag. What do you see how does it relate to the tag you clicked?
I am seeing information, oops I clicked on one. 
So the blue bubble here vs the one on the previous page for you what is different?
It looks like the same one to me. It looks like it says the same thing. 
Is that something you have used before? Clicking on tags and it taking you to other things is that a pattern you are use to?
Yes on other things I don’t think I have seen it on the VA website.
When you first started using VA.gov how would have using tags helped your experience?
I think it would have made it easier. 
You have scrolled down and you have mentioned search are there any other features here that you could use to help you find what you are looking for?
Yeah I will click on the menu to see if it has what I need. I may click on filter and see if that helps.
