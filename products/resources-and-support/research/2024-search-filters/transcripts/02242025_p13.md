# Notetaking Doc for Resources & Support Search Enhancements

## Warm-up Questions

1. I understand you are a (Veteran/service member/family member/caregiver). Is that right? 
   Marine Corp Veteran, that’s correct.
1. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone) 
     iPhone
1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I can dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, or (smartphone only) my colleague could text it to you.  Zoom chat is fine.
1. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? 
   Health benefits, prescription, I don’t know what else there is.
1. When you want to learn about a program or service offered by the VA, where do you go to look for information? I’m on a weekly newsletter, and then I’m pretty familiar with My HealtheVet.
   

1.About how often do you use VA.gov? At least once a week. 
1. Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for?  I was looking for, number one to send messages to my PCP, because I live quite aways away from the VA hospital a good portion of my care is Community Care, so requesting community care, or checking my prescriptions.
     - What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for?
1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov?
It’s pretty easy, but I’m not a real sickly person either so I don’t have a lot of health issues in that regard. But to the extent that I can find what I need yeah, it’s pretty easy. 
## Task 1: Landing page impressions
Please look over this page and tell me about it. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see and any questions that you have.
I would assume that this search bar would be all inclusive. I think it might be if I type in prescription or dermatology it would take me there. I see the first thing says signing into VA.gov so I would do that first. Claim and claim status I don’t have any claims. Community care would be very appealing for me. It would be wonderful to be able to look back at history to see what doctors I have used, any future appointments, or any obstructions say I hadn’t been approved or pending requests. That’s what pops up in my mind. 

## Task 2: Decision review
Imagine that a few weeks ago you submitted a request to have your VA benefit application reconsidered, and you want to know when you can expect to hear back from the VA. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.
PACT act and your benefits I guess I would go there. Number one I don’t know what the PACT act is, and I take my benefits for granted, and don’t think anyone will take them away. I know my benefits, or I think I do. (Click on that, what do you see) this is a little confusing to me, I am a veteran, I don’t have family members or caregivers, I do have a slight disability and I am active in health care. I don’t know if those things pertain to me. 
What would you expect those blue tags are there for? I think it is obvious it you’re a veteran you’re are veteran. Disability if you have a disability I am not sure what I can tell you we get a letter annually that tells you what your disability is. Veterans’ disability and health care are the only 2 things that mean anything to me. 
How confident are you that you are in the right place? I don’t have a lot to be truthful. 
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
I would contact my PCP, or click on the messaging that dropdown list covers everything so I would click on there and message someone. 
Where do you see messaging? My HealtheVet

## Task 3: Community Care 
Now imagine that you currently receive health care through the VA. You've heard that there are some situations where the VA will pay for health care from non-VA providers. Show me how you would try to figure out if this applies to you. I guess I would base my understanding on the fact that I have knowledge of what my local clinic does and the VA hospital is 3 hours away. So whatever my VA clinic doesn’t do I would assume I will have community care available to me. I have been 100% accurate in that assumption so far. On this page I would click on community care. Okay we are back to community care there is a search bar. I guess in community care I would type in the search bar what I was looking for. So far I think I am headed in the right direction. Although I have no idea what the filters are, but at this stage of the game I think I am in the right place. I think I would type in the type of community care I am looking for. The blue bubble, what do you think that would be doing? I think community care is pretty self-explanatory that the VA can’t provide care for whatever reason. I don’t know why the x is there why you would x it out. What do you think about the results on this page are you confident you are headed in the right direction? I do. It’s not foreign to me but for someone new this is good information.
Next I want to go to dermatology, I would search it in the search bar.
You mentioned you didn’t know what the clear all or x in the blue box is for. Go ahead and click on one of those. It took out community care, it reroutes you back to general information, not limited to community care. 
How would that filter affect your regular search? Would that filter be helpful for you? I think that’s great.
What would you assume the blue bubbles on the article page and now on this page do you think they are related, and would you use those? I think I would use them frequently for Veterans, health care, and community care. Now you are narrowing it down to my specific and I think it’s terrific. 
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 4: Travel reimbursement
Let's assume that you just visited a VA medical center for an appointment, and you took a train to get there. You learned that the VA will pay you back for the cost of your train ticket if you submit your receipt online. Show me how you would try and learn how to do that.
I think there are a couple of different ways. I could do a search in the search bar. It could be in claims and claim status. I don’t normally think of reimbursement of a claim. I think search bar would give you procedure for filing or if it picks up your name it would tell you that you have filed a claim and what the status is.
Search term T. I guess I would hit the magnifying glass. What are you wanting to do, what are you looking for? Click on how to file a VA claim online.  (do that how confident are you) I feel that I have it nailed. 
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?

## Task 5: Evidence to support claim
 Imagine you are preparing to apply to receive monthly payments from the VA. You know that there are certain documents you need to provide with your application, but you don't remember exactly what those documents are and want to look them up. Show me how you would try to find that information.
What is featured, is it all encompassing for everything? What would you assume they would me?  I would think that should be pretty much all encompassing to be truthful. 
Let’s say you are preparing to apply for pension benefits. How would you find out what documents you need to file? Pension, I would start right there. I would be quite confident that I am in the right place. I don’t know, intent to file a VA claim I guess. 
Are there any phrases or words you would expect to see? How do you file or file, correct or amend that title would be better. But “your intent” puts a different twang on it to me. Intent is just not very clear. 
What if this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?
It is an accurate statement that the last scenario you didn’t feel as confident? Yes, I don’t think I felt 100% that I made the correct turn in the roundabout so to say. 
Anything else you would do on this site to try to make it more relevant? I don’t think I used the search bar. Maybe that’s, I always go to a search bar when I can. 


## Task 6: Sign in
Let's say that you want to refill a prescription but you're having some difficulty getting into your VA account online. Show me how you would try to get help on this. 


## Task 7: Payments and debt
Let's say that you're wondering whether you owe the VA any money. Show me how you might check this.

What if this this page doesn't answer your question? What would you do next?


## Task 8: Job change
Let's say that you're thinking about looking for a different kind of job, and you're wondering if the VA might be able to help you. Show me how you would try and find that information from here.

## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes
1. Overall, about everything you've seen in this session...What worked *well* for you? Signing in is cumbersome and I hope the changes coming make it easier.   I really like the search bar, it can be very specific. 
1. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you?
1. What would you like to *change or add*? The bubbles, I don’t know what that is about. 
1. *[If they didn't use filters]* Did you see the words with light blue underneath them?
I didn’t notice it. I think that this is a me thing, filters can be confusing to me. Looking for a 3-bedroom house in Florida I can see a use for filters but not here. Maybe if I understand them better, I would be able to use them more. 
     1. What do you think they are, and how might you use them?
     1. I don't remember you using them before. Can you tell me more about that? 
     1. Would you like to try them now?
Yeah. Oh wow. I think it points you in the right direction. 
Let’s use these filters to see if you can find out about your pension benefits.
I would hit veterans and then pension and hit apply filters. This is interesting it’s kind of bringing you back to that original page. I was kind of confused, I thought we were narrowing it down but then it threw me off. (it might be our prototype) I think they were good, I see on here there is pension again, why education, and disability is on here next to it. 
          1. What do you think about using them? 
     1. Which ones are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any missing that you think should be there? 
1. *[If they used filters]* Let's look back at the filters you were using.
     1. What did you think about using them? 
     1. Which filters are you unsure about what they mean?
     1. Are there any filters missing that you think should be there? 
1. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 

**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** *(yes / no)* Sure
- [If yes:] Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
