## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [MODERATOR NAME], and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

I work on making technology easier for Veterans and others to use in order to get information and benefits from the VA. 

What I *hope* to do today is to get your feedback on something new that we're working on.

What I *don't want to do* is add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits from the VA. We may look at things that have caused you frustration, and I want you to know up front that I cannot make that better for you right now. I do not have access to your records, nor do I have any contact with claims reviewers. But I'd like to understand your frustrations because they can help me advocate for improvements to the process in the future.

If you need help with an existing claim or issue, we can connect you with someone after this session. 

Today I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll ask you to do some specific tasks using a website I will share with you.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was OK to allow people to observe this interview, and I want to double-check this again with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*
   - Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth?

- We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*Select Record, then Record to the cloud.*

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session?

*In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save. (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

**I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: 
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*


## Warm-up Questions

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. I understand you are a (Veteran/service member/family member/caregiver). Is that right? 
   - Thanks for confirming that.
1. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)

1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I can dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, or (smartphone only) my colleague could text it to you. (RECORD choice)
1. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? 
    - Health care / education / career services / disability / home loan / pension / life insurance / burial benefits / __________
1. When you want to learn about a program or service offered by the VA, where do you go to look for information?
    - Google / Facebook / Reddit / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call / email / VA.gov / ________________________

1. About how often do you use VA.gov?
1. Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov and what you were looking for? 
     - What were the results? Did you find what you were looking for?
1. How easy or difficult would you say it is to find information you're looking for on VA.gov?

## Task 0: Screen sharing 

I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before you do this, I want to make sure you know that I will see your screen, so if you want to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.

I'd like you to open a new window in a web browser and start sharing your screen with me.

[Confirm screen sharing]

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to [dictate/put into the Zoom chat] for you to use: **http://bit.ly/4gpazHd**

Did you get the link?
- If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)
- If link doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome),
private window (Firefox, Safari), or InPrivate (Edge)

[Confirm protoype is visible]

### Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says Share (on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click **More...**) or **Share Screen** (on computer, button is green).
     - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
     - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says **Share**. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose **Screen** (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.
- iPad: **Broadcast screen**
- Backup plan if they can't figure out how to share screen:
     - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? [Give mouse control--doesn't work w/iPhones] Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

### Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom.
   - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat.
      - (If don't see chat, ASK:) Do you see the red **Stop Share** button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the **Chat** button in the center of the Zoom controls.
   - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
