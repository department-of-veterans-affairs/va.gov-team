# Research Plan for Resources & Support Search Enhancements
**Product Team:** Sitewide Public Websites 
<br>**Timeframe:** February 2025

## Background
Initially called the "Learning Center", Resources & Support (R&S) leverages a variety of Drupal content types to provide an unauthenticated self-serve library with targeted, supplemental information to help Veterans and other beneficiaries understand their VA benefits. Since launching in 2020, R&S has expanded to include 100 published articles (as of December 2024). We expect the number of articles will continue to grow via the ongoing migration of content to VA.gov from legacy sites. 

CAIA's recent work to evaluate the content that is currently in the Benefit Hubs (428 published articles as of December 2024) determined that as much as 50% of the content is expected to be moved into R&S. This anticipated growth accelerated the prioritization of ensuring the R&S experience adequately supports discoverability and Veteran understanding.

### OCTO Priorities 
Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits. 

### Veteran Journey
- Getting Out
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Putting down roots
- Reinventing myself
- Retiring
- Aging
- Dying

## Research Goals	
1. Get user feedback on the new filter design and functionality to find information
2. Understand which of the search, filtering, and browsing options users choose to interact with and in what order
3. Learn if the labels and groupings of filters align with user mental models
 
### Outcome
Validate the proposed design so we can start building it. There may be a second round of usability testing once it is built in Staging to get feedback from assistive tech users.

### Research questions

**Goal 1. Get user feedback on the new filter design and functionality to find information**
- Do users understand how to access the filter overlay modal?
- Do users understand the and/or logic between filters across/within filter groups?
- Do users understand the Apply filters, Clear all, and X buttons in filter overlay modal?
- Do users understand how to dimiss a filter once it's applied?
- Do users understand how the filter chips on results/detail pages (w/X) work vs. on the landing page (w/o X)?

**Goal 2. Understand which of the search, filtering, and browsing options users choose to interact with and in what order**

- What do people do first--searching, filtering, or browsing? 
  - Do people ever use filters before searching? Why or why not?
  - What do people do next?

Observe the usage of the following navigation items:
- Header
  - Hamburger menu 
- Landing page
  - Search box
  - Show filters button
  - Featured links
  - Common topics
  - Browse by benefit
- Results page
  - Breadcrumb
  - Search box
  - Show filters button
  - Dismissible filter chips
  - Clear all chips
- Filter overlay modal
  - X (close) button in top right
  - Collapse all/expand all accordions
  - Individual accordions
  - Individual filters--select one or multiple
  - Apply Filters button
  - Clear All button
- Detail page
  - Breadcrumb
  - Filter chips
    
**Goal 3. Learn if the labels and groupings of filters align with user mental models**
- Do users understand the filter group meanings: Audience, Benefit, Topic?
- Do users of each audience type choose the filter that aligns with them?
- Do users understand the individual filter labels?
- What search terms do users put in the search box?
- How do search terms overlap with or differ from filter labels?
- Are there other filters that users expect that are missing?

**Other questions**
- Do users find the information they are looking for, regardless of which path they take to get there?
- Do different user groups (Veterans, family members and caregivers, service members) have different outcomes?
- Are there other factors (e.g., frequency of VA.gov use, VA benefits received) that affect how easily users are able to find relevant information?
- What are user expectations of the scope of R&S search vs. site-wide search?
- What are users' previous experiences with searching/browsing for information on VA.gov?

### Hypotheses
1. Users will understand the search, filtering, and browsing functionality available to them 
2. Users will understand the labels of filters and filter groups 
3. Users are able to find the information that they're looking for

## Methodology	
We will conduct **remote moderated usability testing** to observe research participants using a mobile prototype. 

### Location
Sessions will be conducted remotely over Zoom with transcripts please.

## Timeline

### Prepare
Before recruitment starts, we would like to **request a kickoff call with Perigean** to align on recruitment criteria and terminology for screener questions in the survey and emails that will be sent to Veterans. We would also like to discuss the relative priorities of recruitment criteria and how the criteria are prioritized when recruiting replacements for participants who cancel in advance.  

Dave and Rodney are available for a kickoff call during any of these times: 
- **Mon Feb 10** 10 am - 5 pm ET
- **Tue Feb 11** 10 am - 1 or 2-5 pm ET

Please invite Rodney and Dave to the kickoff call.

**Prior to the kickoff call, we would like a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey** for this study so we can review it beforehand.

We have scheduled 3 **pilot tests**:
- Pilot 1: **Feb 7 at 12:30 pm ET** with Rocio De Santiago
- Pilot 2: **Feb 7 at 2 pm ET** with Steven Strailly
- Pilot 3: **Feb 12 at 4 pm ET** with Lee DeIarm

### Research sessions
Planned dates of research: **February 18-24, 2025** 

We would like to request that **Perigean calls each participant** to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them. And please include the session time **in each participant's own time zone** (from their address).


### Length of sessions 
* Session length: **60 minutes** 
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes
* Maximum sessions per day: 4
