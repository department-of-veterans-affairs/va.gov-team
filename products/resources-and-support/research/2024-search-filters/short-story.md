# Better Filters, Better Searches: What Veterans Need

## TL;DR  
Most Veterans find what they need through search and browsing, but filters remain underused and misunderstood.

## What We Did  
The Resources & Support (R&S) team at OCTO conducted usability testing with a Figma prototype to understand how Veterans interact with search, filtering, and browsing tools. The goal was to refine filter functionality and ensure labels align with user expectations.

## Key Insights  
- **Browsing and search dominate user behavior**  
  - Most participants relied on browsing or searching rather than filtering.  
  - “I noticed [the filters] and completely ignored it, cause I felt like I didn’t need it.” – P12  

- **Filters are appreciated but underused**  
  - Only 3 of 12 participants opened the filter modal unprompted. However, many found it useful when prompted.  
  - “Clearly the filters are great because it helps to be more specific.” – P12  

- **Tags cause confusion and frustration**  
  - Participants struggled with the term “tags” and their functionality, especially on mobile.  
  - “Tags mean nothing to me.” – P1  

- **Filter labels are generally clear**  
  - Most users understood filter groupings like "Audience" and "Topic," with only minor confusion.  
  - “The word ‘management’ is throwing me off.” – P11  

- **Mobile design creates challenges**  
  - Limited screen space discouraged interaction with filters and tags on smartphones.  
  - “The phone screen being so limited, I wouldn’t want to scroll down.” – P13  

## Between the Lines  
Filters hold potential to improve task efficiency, but their low visibility and misunderstood functionality limit their impact. Veterans may default to browsing and searching because these methods feel more intuitive and familiar.

## Yes, But  
While most participants understood filter groupings, unmet expectations for additional filter options (e.g., specific benefits like Chapter 35) suggest gaps in alignment with user needs.

## Why It Matters  
This research informs OCTO’s mission to improve digital experiences for Veterans. By addressing filter visibility and usability, the VA can make self-service tools more intuitive, helping Veterans access benefits information more efficiently.

## What’s Next  
The team will enhance filter visibility, re-evaluate tag terminology, and refine mobile design. Ongoing monitoring via Medallia will track user feedback post-launch.
