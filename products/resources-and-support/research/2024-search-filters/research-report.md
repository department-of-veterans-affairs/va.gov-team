## Research Goals
The Resources & Support (R&S) section of VA.gov provides an unauthenticated, self-service library of targeted information to help Veterans and other beneficiaries understand their VA benefits. This research aims to evaluate how the new filter design and functionality supports discoverability and user understanding, especially with the anticipated growth of R&S content.

The goals of this research are to:

1. Utilize a Figma prototype to get user feedback on the new filter design and functionality to find information.
2. Understand which search, filtering, and browsing options users choose and in what order.
3. Learn if the labels and groupings of filters align with user mental models.

## Research Questions

1. Goal 1. Get user feedback on the new filter design and functionality to find information
   - Do users understand how to access the filter overlay modal?
   - Do users understand the and/or logic between filters across/within filter groups?
   - Do users understand the Apply filters, Clear all, and X buttons in filter overlay modal?
   - Do users understand how to dismiss a filter once it's applied?
   - Do users understand how the filter chips on results/detail pages (w/X) work vs. on the landing page (w/o X)?
2. Goal 2. Understand which of the search, filtering, and browsing options users choose to interact with and in what order
    - What do people do first—searching, filtering, or browsing?
        - Do people ever use filters before searching? Why or why not?
        - What do people do next?
3. Goal 3. Learn if the labels and groupings of filters align with user mental models
    - Do users understand the filter group meanings: Audience, Benefit, Topic?
    - Do users of each audience type choose the filter that aligns with them?
    - Do users understand the individual filter labels?
    - What search terms do users put in the search box?
    - How do search terms overlap with or differ from filter labels?
    - Are there other filters that users expect that are missing?
4. Other questions
    - Do users find the information they are looking for, regardless of which path they take to get there?
    - Do different user groups (Veterans, family members and caregivers, service members) have different outcomes?
    - Are there other factors (e.g., frequency ofVA.gov use, VA benefits received) that affect how easily users are able to find relevant information?
    - What are user expectations of the scope of R&S search vs. site-wide search?
    - What are users' previous experiences with searching/browsing for information on VA.gov?

## Methodology 

Using a [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/cg8VNnxFOxw7lb10FVHpi5/Resources-support?node-id=834-6977&p=f&t=4Al9acYZgonf0ncD-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=504%3A6304&starting-point-node-id=1014%3A7143&show-proto-sidebar=1&hotspot-hints=0&hide-ui=1) created by our Designer, Dave Pickett, we conducted 12 remote moderated usability testing over Zoom. 10 of the 12 participants were able to share their screen and navigate the prototype on their own. Two of the participants were unable to share their screen, but were able to proceed with the moderator sharing his screen.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Users will understand the search, filtering, and browsing functionality available to them.
   - **Partially True:** All participants understood the browsing and search capabilities. Only a few participants engaged with the filter functionality without prompting. Most participants understood the filters once prompted. One area that caused confusion was the relationship between tags and filters.
2. Users will understand the labels of filters and filter groups.
   - **Mostly True:** Most participants seemed to understand many individual filter labels they encountered, and understood which ones were relevant to their tasks.
3. Users are able to find the information that they're looking for.
   - **Mostly True:** Most participants were able to find the information that they were looking for in most cases. Only 2/12 participants gave up on a task without locating a relevant article. 
    
## Key Findings

1. Almost all participants found the desired information via browsing or searching

2. Only a few participants opened the filter modal without prompting
 
3. Most participants were able to successfully use most aspects of the filter functionality

4. A majority of participants expressed frustration or confusion related to tags

5. Almost all participants understood the filters and filter group labels

## Details of Findings 

### Finding 1 - Almost all participants found the desired information via browsing or searching
- 10 of 12 participants were able to accomplish all tasks
- 2 participants gave up on at least one task
- 7 participants navigated primarily via browsing (with search as secondary)
- 4 participants navigated primarily via searching (with browsing as secondary)
- 1 participant navigated primarily via filtering (with browsing as secondary)

### Finding 2 - Only a few participants opened the filter modal without prompting

- Only 3 of 12 participants opened the filter modal without prompting form the moderator
> “I see show filters. So I might go to that. (Opens the modal) Okay, so curious about filters. So filter by audience: veterans, family members, caregivers, active service members...“ - P1

> “I was curious to see what the filters were for. How I might be able to tailor what I’m looking for.” - P9

> “I like that. It has a show, filters button. I can filter by what applies to me like, am I a veteran? Am I an active service member?” - P14

-  8 of 12 participants were able to access the filer modal with some verbal prompting by the moderator
   - Some participants noted that they had seen the Show Filters button but chose not to open it
   - These participants expressed appreciation for the filters feature once they did open it

> P12: "I noticed it and completely ignored it, cause I felt like I didn't need it". 

> P12: “Clearly the filters are great because it helps to be more specific. I think these are good choices (options).” 

> P10: “It didn’t seem necessary.”

> P10: “I like that right away, they have you filter for different populations. Below that, the benefits, this is an excellent idea!”

> P13: “Filters can be confusing for me, so I tend to stay away from them.”  

> P13: “Oh, that is good! It narrows the field down dramatically. I think it points you in the right direction unequivocally.” 

-  1 participant was not able to succesfully interact with the filter modal

### Finding 3 - Most participants were able to successfully use most aspects of the filter functionality

- 11 of 12 participants understood the Apply Filters buttons, but the majority did not specifically interact with the Clear All or the X buttons.
> “I would clear this filter that it's put on the claims and claim status filter so that I could go back to look at the other link.” - P8

- 8 of 12 participants were able to successfully interact with the filter chips and tags
> “I would guess it is a filter because it says filter right below it. I don't know if they would be clickable.” - P11

> “I don’t have any idea what those filters are. I don’t know why the x is there. Why you would you x it out” - P13

- 6 of 12 participants demonstrated a working understanding the and/or logic of the filter groups, though most did not explicitly state their understanding

> "I can filter by what applies to me. Like, am I a veteran? I'm an active service member? What benefit I'm looking for. That kind of thing" - P14

> "I would expect to be able to, you know, click on any of these and use it to narrow down the information that I'm searching. Just depending on the scenario.” - P7

### Finding 4  - A majority of participants expressed frustration or confusion related to tags
- 7 of 12 participants expressed frustration or confusion related to tags

- Frustration caused by expectation of tag functionality
> “This is what I feared. it looks like it took me back to that first page. I wanted to go further out, not back” - P12
 
> “I’m pissed. it just took me back to the same page that I just came from!” - P14

- Confusion caused by the word “tag” 
> “Tags that means nothing to me.” - P1

> There needs to be an explanation of what a tag is, what a filter is.” - P8

- Frustration about amount of space taken by tags
>  “I'm not sure why it it pops up, and you know, clobbers that space. In other words.” - P4

>  “Oh goodness… it’s got more tags!! - P8

- One participant did not scroll below the tag section to see the content below. 
> (Clicks "claims & claim status" tag on the Claims FAQ page) “Now I am confused because I was already on the Claims Status FAQ, so something does not make sense to me” - P8 

### Finding 5 -  Almost all participants understood the filters and filter group labels
- 10 of 12 participants understood the filter group label meanings
> “I don’t really understand. I guess the audience would be me. I mean when I think of audience, I think of somebody other than myself. So, I’m not sure where that’s going to go.” - P1

> “This is a little confusing to me…. I am a vet, I don’t have any family or caregivers, I am not an active service member, I do have a slight disability from the VA, and I am very much involved in healthcare. I don’t know if those 3 out of 5 things pertain to me” - P13

- Only 1 participant found the a filter label confusing
> (Looking at Debt Management) “The word ‘management’ is throwing me off” - P11

- 6 participants had expectations for filters that did not exist
  - P1 hoped for "reimbursement" to be a more obvious option, possibly as a standalone filter or within a travel-related category, when looking for travel compensation
  - P3 expressed a desire to filter information more specifically by benefit type, such as wanting to see information specifically related to Chapter 35 under education benefits or distinguishing Champ VA information more clearly within healthcare resources.

## Additional Insights

**Finding 6 - Many participants (6 of 12) made comments about limited screen size**
> “The phone screen being so limited, I wouldn’t want to scroll down. I might scroll enough to see filters, but I wouldn’t want to scroll past the search terms." - P13

> “When we don’t see something right away, we don’t want to scroll down any further” - P6

**Finding 7 - Most users wanted to use sitewide navigation features**
- 7 participants specifically mentioned wanted to sign-in to see personalized content that was relevant to them and their task
- 3 participants mentioned wanting to use the header navigation menu
- These features were not functional in the prototype

**Finding 8 - Participant's previous experiences with searching/browsing for information on VA.gov**
- 2 participants shared negative experiences trying to obtain information from VA.gov
- Other participants had generally good experiences 
- 4 participants made comments that the experience has been improving
