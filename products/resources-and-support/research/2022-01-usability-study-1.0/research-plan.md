# Draft: Research Plan for Search & Discovery Team, Resources and Support, Submit Feedback Tool 2.0
Jan 2022

## Background
Resources and support (R&S) contains tier 2 content (benefit-adjacent content). The Submit Feedback Tool was introduced to R&S article pages last year with the option to rate articles as either good or bad. As a part of the Submit Feedback Tool 2.0 product initative, once a user rates an article as 'bad', we would like to implement a way for users to report the reason why they rated the page poorly. We would also like these issues to be actionable and easily accessible for the content owners so that improvements can be easily made.

We would like to make improvements to the layout of R&S article pages. Overall, links on R&S articles do not have a high engagement rate. CTA had the highest click through rate and Tags had the lowest click through rate. Participants in the <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/learning-center-mvp-findings-summary.md">last R&S research study</a> did not see tags as clickable. <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/research-findings.md">Previous research</a> has shown that users are hesitant to click on R&S because the name and we would like to further explore that issue as well. "Value and Purpose" was also identified as a top issue during our <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/32746#issuecomment-970466533">roadmap session</a>.

### OCTO Objectives 
Improving Resources and Support will allow Veterans and those in their support system to find information on utilizing their VA.gov account, gaining supplemental information on benefits, and easily find links to apply for benefits or make changes to their account.

### Veteran Journey
Resources and support impacts the Veteran journey from Starting up and all phases thereafter.

## Research Goals and Questions	

### 1. Validate that users are able to easily use the Submit Feedback Tool to rate the article page and report an appropriate problem.
- Are users able to find where they can report feedback?
- What do users expect to see after they submit feedback?
- In what situation would a user rate this page? Why would they rate it 'good', why would they rate it 'bad'?
- Does the wording make sense? If not, what should it say?
- Do the options under "Report a problem' make sense to users?
- What other types of problems would they expect to report?
- What do users think about the amount of issues presented to them? Is the amount overwhelming?
- What are their perceptions on the difference between this feedback tool and Medallia?
- **Content creator question:** 
	- What type of feedback is helpful and actionable to them?
	- How can we make this feedback more accessible to them?

### 2. Are users able to easily navigate and discover additional content on the article pages?
- Are CTAs clear to the user?
- What do users think of the "Related information" section?
- What do users think of the "Va benefits" section?
- What do users think of the "Tags" section?
- Do users utilize a search bar on the article pages?
- Do users utilize list of topic links on the article pages?


### 3. Is the name "Resources and support" a helpful title that tells users what they will find?
Previous usability studies have shown that participants have felt that "Resources and support" was not indicative of the content available and it prevented them from clicking the link.
- What do users think of the title, "Resources and support"?
- If users do not feel like "Resources and support" reflects what they find on the section, what else would they name it?


### Outcome
We will confirm whether:
- Updates allow users to provide feedback which will inform content editors on changes that can be made to improve R&S articles
- Updates to R&S article pages improve navigation and discoverability of more R&S articles
- The name "Resources and support" accurately informs users of what content they will find


### Hypothesis

- Users will not know that tags are clickable
- The tags currently used, such as 'All Veterans', are not helpful
- Users will be more likely to use a topics link section that search bar to look for another article
- Users will understand how to report an issue after rating an article as 'bad'
- Users will not find that the name "Resources and support" reflects the type of content on the tool


## Method	
We'll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom using a prototype.

### Location

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We will recruit Veteran participants using a lean maximum variation strategy. We'll leverage Perigean's recruiting services to find our participants.

### Recruitment criteria
Schedule 16 Veterans for a minimum of 8 successfully completed sessions.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

- 50% of participants should be able to participant from a desktop device.

- 50% of participants should be able to participate from a mobile phone.



**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

**Gender**
- 8 women, 8 men

**Inclusion**
- 3 participants who use assistive technology (e.g. screen reader, magnification)
- 10 participants who identify as other than white
- 5 participants who identify as other than straight/heterosexual and cisgender
- 8 participants age 55+
- 8 participants who identify as having a cognitive disability
- 5 participants who do not have a college degree
- 5 participants who live in a rural area


## Timeline
If you are using Perigean to recruit please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote research, 2+ weeks for in person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
What dates do you plan to do research? 

### Length of sessions
How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. 
Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 
Please request enough dates and time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.).
