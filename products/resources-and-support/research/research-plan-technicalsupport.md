## Research Plan for [Reimagining Technical Support (Screensharing), 6/27/2024]


## Background

To assess the feasibility and potential impact of implementing screen sharing capabilities in veteran support services by gathering insights from veterans. 

Where is your product situated?
[survey](https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/questions/nrkfwu5m).

## OCTO Priorities
Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

## Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter?

## Research Goals

Understanding Veterans' needs can help identify the specific needs and preferences of veterans regarding support services. This is crucial to ensure that screen sharing is a solution that aligns with their expectations and comfort levelsâ€‹.

- Assess Needs: Understand veterans' needs and preferences regarding support services.

- Evaluate Potential Impact: Measure how screensharing could improve service delivery and satisfaction.

- Identify Barriers: Identify technical, privacy, and acceptance barriers to adopting screensharing technology.

- Gather Feedback: Collect qualitative and quantitative feedback to guide decision-making.


## Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:

What will I do with what I learn from this question?
Does this question serve the goals of my study?
Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the conversation guide.

## Hypothesis
Based on our understanding of the problem space and our assumptions, we can formulate the following hypothesis:

Implementing screensharing capabilities in veteran support services will lead to increased satisfaction and improved issue resolution times among veterans who have adequate technical resources and comfort with technology. However, concerns regarding privacy and technical barriers may limit adoption among certain subsets of the veteran population.
