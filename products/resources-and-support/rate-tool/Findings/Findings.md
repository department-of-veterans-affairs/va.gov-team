## Research Goals
_Veteran Journey
Resources and support impacts the Veteran journey from Starting up and all phases thereafter.

Research Goals and Questions
1. Validate that users are able to easily use the Rate Feedback mechanism to provide feedback on the article pages and report an appropriate problem.

- Are users able to find where they can rate and report feedback?
- What do users expect to see after they submit feedback?
- In what situation would a user rate this page? Why would they rate it 'good', why would they rate it 'bad'?
- Does the wording make sense? If not, what should it say?
- Do the options under "How would you rate your experience' make sense to users?
- What other types of problems would they expect to report?
- What do users think about the amount of issues presented to them? Is the amount overwhelming?
- What are their perceptions on the difference between this feedback tool and Medallia?
- Content creator question:
- What type of feedback is helpful and actionable to them?
- How can we make this feedback more accessible to them?

2. Are users able to easily navigate and discover the rate your experience feedback mechanism on the article pages?

- Do users utilize rate your experience feedback mechanism on the article pages?
- Do users utilize the feedback button near the footer on the article pages?

3. Is the question "How would you rate your experience" a helpful title that tells users what they will find?

- What do users think of the title, "How would you rate your experience"?
- If users do not feel like "How would you rate your experience" reflects what they find on the section, what else would they name it?

## Research Questions

* Validate that users are able to easily use the Rate Feedback mechanism to provide feedback on the article pages and report an appropriate problem.
* Are users able to easily navigate and discover the rate your experience feedback mechanism on the article pages?
*Is the question "How would you rate your experience" a helpful title that tells users what they will find?

## Methodology 

_We'll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom using a prototype.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1.	Locating the rate tool will enable people of diverse technical abilities, ages, and disabilities to rate their experience on resources and support URL’s.
i.	MAYBE FALSE: Most participants ignored the instructions and were unable to locate the rate tool without help from the moderator, but many were able to succeed without help provided. Once found they were able to successfully follow the flow of questions and submit their responses.
2.	The Rate Tool will enable people of diverse technical abilities, ages, and disabilities to submit and share desired feedback on resources and support URL’s.
i.	FALSE: Same reasons as above. In addition, the veterans expect to provide detailed responses in open text fields.
3.	The feedback from the Rate Tool will alleviate problems with Resources and Support URL’s.
i.	FALSE: Same reasons as above. Veterans expect to customize their responses to fit their individualized needs/problems while on the R&S URLs.
4.	The Rate tool near the bottom of the R&S page will be missed when they scroll off the screen.
i.	MAYBE TRUE: Rate tool at the bottom was unnoticed by some participants who saw it after prompting. However, for some it was intuitive to scroll near the bottom to provide feedback. 
5.	Labels repeated above every question will create confusion, especially to users of screen readers.
i.	MAYBE TRUE: Labels repeated were ignored by all except two participants. A few mentioned being confused by the repeated Success text.


## Key Findings
1.  9 of 9 Veterans are less likely to provide feedback if they can resolve their issue/problem without assistance.
2. 9 of 9 Veterans do not feel heard when providing feedback, and they expect an open field text to customize their feedback to ensure that their specific issue is resolved. 
3. 7 of 9 Veterans expect immediate action to assist them with the completion of their task.( i.e. , a prompt to call in or send an email ) 
4. 8 of 9 Veterans will exhaust all options before leaving feedback on VA.gov, that is call the VA contact center, use the menu options on VA.gov, send emails, go to their local VA office when trying to resolve a VA related issue.
5. 5 of 9 veterans scrolled to the bottom as a result of not finding a feedback mechanism at first glance. Veterans were able to locate the rate tool, but not all veterans intuitively scroll near the bottom of a page when asked to provide feedback. 
6. 2 of 9 Veterans desire an assertive feedback mechanism that they do not have to go to far to find (i.e. intercept survey, chat bot). 
8. 4 of 9 Veterans expect minimum clicks when  performing a task such as submitting feedback. (i.e.one page, 3-5 questions) 

## Details of Findings 

_Key Findings
1. Veterans are less likely to provide feedback if they can resolve their issue/problem without assistance.

**9 of 9** participants state that they have ignored or skipped over forms on R&S pages and do not often scroll down the page to see the rate tool. 

All participants were asked by the moderator where they might provide feedback on the R&S page. Most skimmed the top of the page and then decided nothing was applicable. All of them searched for an answer first then they intuitively scrolled near the bottom of the page to locate the rate tool. 

**P7** Very few (times used form to submit feedback). I think it is because most of the feedback is very passive. Most of the time I give feedback, If can’t solve my problem. I am not looking to give you feedback if I am trying to resolve my issue.

2. Veterans do not feel heard when providing feedback, and they expect an open field text to customize their feedback to ensure that their specific issue is resolved.

**9 of 9** Veterans feel unheard. They expect follow ups (i.e., chats, calls, emails) when providing generalized feedback, and they expect an open field text to customize their feedback to ensure that their specific issue can be resolved. 

Currently, Veterans aren’t expecting a response or change from the feedback that is given on the R&S pages. This means that they may or may not provide feedback even when they are experiencing issues on R&S pages. As they suggest, more information is required from them to solve what they are experiencing. 

**P5** points out that when she reached the success page and confirmed that the form was completed, she was dissatisfied as she expected to provide more details about her experience. 

**P7** just because I find this information useful doesn’t mean you should stop there. You could have the pop up or a decision tree on why that information was helpful. I would follow that direction. You don’t know what part was useful. You can still go with the same, like this. I would advise collecting more information unless you are not looking for that.
Keywords: open text fields, contact center, emails, direct responses

3. Veterans expect immediate action to assist them with the completion of their task on R & S pages. ( i.e. , a prompt to call in or a prompt to send an email )  

**7 of 9** when asked how they imagine providing feedback if the page was not helpful many of them concluded that they would like to have open dialogue with someone who can quickly resolve the issue they are experiencing on R&S pages. 

**P3** Being able to type up what I am looking for or tell you what I think should be added. Or even an email where I could share more information including videos or voice memo. I would upload a voice memo where I could share my information via voice, or I could screen record and upload a video to help other Veterans step by step.

**P7** Ultimately, I would want a little chat icon so I can talk to someone really quick.

**P8** In terms of saying this was not helpful I would want to give feedback of what could be helpful. If this does not show me all my options, I want to know what my other options are. It would be helpful if there was a phone number, I could call that I could tell them that page did not work. A place I could leave my email address so someone could contact me. Propped to add more information I will tell you how to make it better or what I expect to make the page better.

4.Veterans were able to locate the rate tool, but not all veterans intuitively scroll near the bottom of a page when asked to provide feedback.

Only **5 of 9** veterans scrolled to the bottom of R&S pages because they could not find a feedback mechanism, at first glance. The other participants didn't understand where they would go to provide feedback and got stuck (most read the content on the page provided), and so the moderator explained that they needed to scroll down this page to locate the Rate tool.

•	Several participants said that if they couldn't find the form, they would try something else (e.g., going into their local VA, Using the help line) before giving up.

**P3** I would do if I couldn’t find anything and wanted feedback I would. I would probably click those lines by support if it didn’t give me options there, I would get to the menu bar to search for feedback. I would submit feedback right there and if I couldn’t find anything I would click no I didn’t find this page helpful.

**P7** So again, I wouldn’t find this, I mean no one would. I would not typically use this unless I was really frustrated. I think this is not very proactive on wanting feedback. It is an afterthought at the bottom of the page.

**P13** I am trying to click on contact us, but I am not getting anywhere. I would go to contact us to see if there was an option for feedback, phone number, or email that I would be able to get in contact with them to send feedback.

5. Veterans expect minimum clicks when performing a task such as submitting feedback. (i.e.one page, 3-5 questions) 

•	**4 of 9** participants state that many things on VA.gov require too many steps, and as a result they become frustrated. 

**P1** Too many steps in any process

**P2** A lot of Veterans get frustrated. If there are too many steps that would be one of my reasons for saying no because it is too confusing. With new technology you can’t forget about those who are older, especially if you don’t show us the changes.

**P12** She’d use it if she couldn’t do what she needed to do, if info was buried. For example - “If I was a first-time person getting on [the site], you have to go through so much to even get onto the VA website. There are too many different walls. Once you sign in, you have to go through [multiple screens].”

7.Veterans desire an assertive feedback mechanism that they do not have to go to far to find (i.e. intercept survey, chat bot). 

•	**2 of 9**Veterans desire a pop up. The veterans mental model suggest that they are on the R&S page to find a solution to their problem, so providing feedback is an afterthought.

**P7** I think it is because most of the feedback is very passive. Most of  the time I give feedback, but I can’t solve my problem. I am not looking to give you feedback if I am trying to resolve my issue.

## Additional Insights

_P01 Every time I click on it you have to go through several pages to identify and  authenticate yourself. I just want to put in my password and go in. I  understand why they are there, but sometimes you just want to get to where you are going. If you want to sightsee you take the slow route if you want  to get to where you are going you take the quick route. 

_P10 I had trouble signing in when it first came up, and still sometimes I have issues with logging in. I have all 4 logins because I have had issues with one of them at some point and created new logins.

_P12 I would use it [ rate tool] if she couldn’t do what she needed to do, if info was buried. For example - “If I was a first-time person getting on [the site], you have to go through so much to even get onto the VA website. There are too many different walls. Once you sign in, you have to go through [multiple screens].”



## Recommendations

*Consider including an intercept survey on R& S URL's

    *P2 Ultimately, I would want a little chat icon so I can talk to someone really quick.

    * P13 I think if I hit either one of them a drop-down box would come up to elaborate on my yes or no answer.

*Use 3-5 questions and include an open field text to capture the veterans feedback.

    * P2 I think the next thing it would ask me would be what did I found helpful. A box would pop up and have me enter what I found helpful/not helpful. A comment box for me to put information in.
    * P3I would look for I would assume a text box or be able to enter my information so someone would follow up with me.
    * P7 I would expect a form, some basic free hand form, or two a couple rating, a survey like form. That are the two things I am expecting. Free form is where I can type in whatever.
    
*Gather data  from the  Rate tool that is inclusive for all teams, and share the data in data requests.

   * P8 I want to be able to contact them to tell them that the page is not working and to see if there is something I am missing or misunderstanding.
   
*one modal to reduce clicks.

* P2 A lot of Veterans get frustrated. If there are too many steps that would be one of my reasons for saying no because it is too confusing. With new technology you can’t forget about those who are older, especially if you don’t show us the changes
 
## Next Steps

- Implement the latest version of Medallia which addresses previous accessibility issues.

- Iterate on design and prepare for staging .

- Additional user testing in staging to uncover accessibility issues.



## Further research needed

-9 participants were recruited, and 5 were considered to have accessibility issues. However, the participants did not actively use their device in the study.
