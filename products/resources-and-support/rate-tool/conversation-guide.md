## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Camille Green and Perigean is taking notes.
I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about a rating tool that we are interested in utilizing that will allow Veterans to rate multiple pages on Resources and Support. You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we want to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll ask to confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans' experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we get started with the discussion, let’s begin with a few general questions so I can learn a little bit about you. 

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself. What do you do in your spare time?  
2. How long have you  served in the military? What is your branch? 
3. What do you typically do day-to-day in your current role? 

Excellent. Thanks so much for your answers. 


## Scenario

Imagine you are having trouble logging in to VA.gov. You've searched the website on how to sign in and you landed on signing in to VA.gov on a resources and support page. Now let's imagine that you are unable to find the sign-in information you were looking for. Before you leave the page, you decide that you want to rate your experience with signing in to VA.gov. Today, we’ll look at a concept for rating your experience when on a resources and support page for signing in to VA.gov.

## What → Resources and Support + Signing in to VA.gov 
o	Scroll down the Signing in to VA.gov page.

o	View the Rate Your Experience feedback mechanism.

o	Select feedback options and explain.

Can you walk us through how you are actually using the feedback mechanism and your daily experience? [Probe: Would you say that the process resulted in a positive, negative, or neutral experience? Can you elaborate?] 


Where would you go to give feedback on your experience with signing in to VA.gov? 

 What does “Feedback” " mean to you?

From your perspective, how are these feedback mechanisms different, if at all? What makes you think that?

### Things to watch for:
- [Does the participant notice the Rate Your Experience feedback mechanism on the page?]

1. You want to rate the sign-in to VA.gov page. Without clicking/typing anything, please describe where you would go on the screen to rate this page. 
2. I want to direct your attention to the “Rate Your Experience” feedback mechanism near the bottom of this page. Without clicking/typing anything, please describe what you think will happen if you click the "Yes, it was helpful” or “No, it was not helpful” button.
3.  In what instances would you use the “Yes, it was helpful” button? Why? 
4.  In what instances would you use the “No, it was not helpful” button? Why?
5.  In what instances might you want to add more information about your experience on the page? Why?
6.  When asked if you want to add more information what do you expect to see? Why?

 


##  What→ Bad Response/Ideal Responses/Enhancements/Hesitation for the feedback mechanism 
o	Overview/thoughts on Rate your experience 

o	Overview thoughts on updated Medallia form 

o  Any questions for me? 

Imagine you want to provide more details about your experience on the page. In what instances might you want to share more details, and why? 

### Things to watch for:

- [What does the participant expect after submitting that the problem is on the page?]

1.  How do you imagine sharing more details? Why?
2.  When you see the success, what do you expect next? Are you confused looking at the success message on this screen? If so,  why?
3.  If the problem is not on the page itself, why would you or would you not continue to provide feedback? Explain. 
4.  Please describe if the responses on the form reflect the information you would like to share. What information would you want to add or remove from the form? Why?
5.  In what instances would you expect to use a "Written response option?" Why?
6.  In general, how do you feel the rate tool is working for you? Do you feel that the rate tool is serving its purpose? Can you elaborate on your thoughts regarding the rate tool? [Probe: What worked well and what did not? What process or issue changed their userflow? What would make it better?]
7.  How frequent or infrequent would you engage with and use this feedback mechanism? What in the process causes you use it or engage with it, and why?
8.  Do you think providing this type of feedback is effective? Why or why not?
9.  On average, how long will you spend providing feedback? 




## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable with us sharing a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners for the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is helpful to us as we continue to ensure that VA.gov works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veteran you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
