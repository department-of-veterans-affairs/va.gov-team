**Tags**
| All Veterans | Claims and appeals status | Payments and debt |Sign in |
|--|--|--|--|
| 74 | 5 | 13 | 9 |

- All articles are tagged "All Veterans"
- Content style consistency: Should we update tags to be consistent with language used elsewhere on VA.gov and R&S
	- Claims and appeals status = Decision reviews and appeals
	- Sign in = VA Account and profile


**Topics**
| Burials and memorials | Decision reviews and appeals | Disability | Education and training | Health care | Life insurance | VA Account and profile |  Other topics and questions |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 5 | 3 | 5 | 18 | 7 | 5 | 17 | 22 | 

 - Many articles in "Other topics and questions" were also included within other articles. Should the "Other topics and questions" only be used when the article does not fit in to another topic section?
 - Should more topics be created that match VA benefit hubs?
