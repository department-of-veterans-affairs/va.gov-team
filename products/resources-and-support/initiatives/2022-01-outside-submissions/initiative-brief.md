## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
   - R&S article pages are not optimized for the best user experience for veterans, 
<a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/archives/resources-and-support/discovery.md">analytics and user research</a> confirms this problem. <br>
The Content Team does not have enough bandwidth to continue adding additional R&S articles. There is currently not a workflow to allow for more editors to add additional articles to R&S.
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
