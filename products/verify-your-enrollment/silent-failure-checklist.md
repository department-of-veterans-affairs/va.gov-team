## We don't have any silent errors!

Great! Please let us know that you went through the checklist above as a team and did not find any silent failures in our Slack channel: [#zero-silent-failures](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C07KTTFP308) and send us a link of a copy of [this](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/platform/practices/zero-silent-failures/how-to-discover-if-your-app-has-silent-failures.md#checklist) completed checklist. If you don't connect to a backend system, you don't need to fillout the checklist but let us know in your message.   You don't have to hang out in there once you have notified us. Just pop in, tell us who you are (which team and in which portfolio) and that no failures were found. Thanks!
