## Research Goals
VYE fits in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) in numerous phases and has meaningful moments, such as: 
- Veterans actively serving: Managing military and family obligations
- Veterans getting out: Engaging VA to access benefits and services
- Veterans starting up: Finding something to do
- Veterans reinventing themselves: Acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials
- Veterans putting down roots: Taking care of my family
- Veterans putting down roots: Engaging VA to access benefits and services

The goals of this research are as follows: 
1. Evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed solution
2. Evaluate our place in the VA.gov system
3. What might we be missing in our understanding of our Veterans?

## Research Questions

**Evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed solution**
- Are our perceptions of Veterans goals accurate?
  - Verification #1
  - Checking history #2
  - Managing profile #3
- Is our proposed design simple for Veterans to use to accomplish their goals?
- Are Veterans able to quickly and easily verify their enrollment? 
- Do Veterans need additional touchpoints (e.g., emails) to accomplish their goals?
- Is our two-page proposed design sufficient for users to easily find their desired information?
- Can users easily update their address and direct deposit information?
- Is the label, "Your Benefits Profile" sufficient to communicate the types of information contained in the profile? 

**Evaluate our place in the VA.gov system**
- Are there other messages before or after interaction with VYE that our Veterans need?
- How do our Veterans find VYE (e.g., email link, Google search, onsite search, navigation menus, etc.)?
- How effective are these channels to Veterans for finding VYE/WAVE?
- Would Veterans prefer to verify their enrollment over the phone or via text as opposed to verifying via a web application? 

**What might we be missing in our understanding of our Veterans?**
- Are Veterans confused by the process of enrollment and how that information is communicated to the VA for verification?
- Do Veterans need more insight into backoffice processes (e.g., pending documents and processes)?

## Methodology 

We used two unmoderated tools to accomplish our research goals:
- Chalkmark (unmoderated)
- OptimalSort (unmoderated)

We utilized Chalkmark to provide evaluative results and first-click analysis for the prototype. Participants were given a few simple tasks and will be asked where they would go to accomplish the task. 

OptimalSort was used for an open card sort to ensure our labeling structure and overall flow match expected user mental models. 


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**The new VYE design will provide a much simpler process for Veterans to manage their enrollment verifications as compared to the overly complicated WAVE tool.** 
- WAVE is challenging to navigate and use. 
- A more streamlined and succint design will be sufficient for Veterans to manage their enrollment verifications.
- In-context design clues will remove the need for complex user guides.
- User do not need to see backoffice processes that are currently contained in "Pending Documents."

**Veterans will be able to easily find and access the VYE application.**
- Existing processes are sufficient to bring Veterans needing to verify enrollment to the VYE tool (e.g., email prompts, Google search, onsite search, etc.).
- Veterans might prefer IVR or text-based verification processes for managing enrollment. 


## Key Findings

1. **Our major design assumptions are validated.**

2. **The combined verification page may cause confusion for MGIB users.** 

3. **79% of users want to use another method to verify their enrollment.** 

4. **Users report mixed experiences with the existing verification process**

5. **Some users reported negative experiences with the broader VA**


## Details of Findings 

_To add images: ![text](link - add image to github folder and link here with .png)_

**Our major design assumptions are validated.**

In the first-click analysis users behaved as we expected:
 1. 93% of users clicked the alert box button to verify their enrollment

 2. 67% of users found the additional info box relating to errors in enrollment information. Though not correct, an additional 20% of users clicked the support phone number in the footer of the page.

 3. From the main verification page, 87% of users correctly associated the benefits information page with the need to edit their direct deposit information

**The combined verification page may cause confusion for MGIB users**

Only 26% of users clicked on the correct areas for the _Verify school enrollment for GI Bill benefits_ page, which we identified as the following two areas:
 - the "For Montgomery GI Bill benefits" anchor link at the top of the page
 - the sign-in button under the "For Montgomery GI Bill benefits" section

 The users who did not click one of these two areas primarily focused on the Post-911 benefits or the side navigation.

This could provide problems for our users if they mistakenly sign in to verify for Post-9/11 benefits instead. 


**79% of users want to use another method to verify their enrollment** Users would prefer using the VA app (46.4%), text messaging (21.4%), or email (10.7%) to verify their enrollment. Only 21.4% of users would prefer to use a website to verify their enrollment. 

We also saw this sentiment in previous research interviews with users who reported that they preferred the simplicity of "just pressing a button" in order to verify (no log in, no calling, etc. 

0% of users reported wanting to verify via phone call. It should be noted that in previous research interviews some participants reported wanting to call the customer service line in the case that the website confused them. Some seemed to prefer calling as a primary method.

> _I don't understand why the verification methods can't be the same for all of the benefits. That seems a little weird to me._

> _Had a [phone] rep who took forever to get back to you._


**Users report mixed experiences with the existing verification process**

Users provided some feedback that the current and past verification process has been mostly difficult to use.  

> _Iâ€™ve used VA education benefits four times and the process for using them has always been relatively easy._

> _I had started with active duty GI Bill, then converted to 9/11 GI Bill, and now with my dependent eligible.  I had set aside two years for my daughter, but I have no way of understanding what I'm looking at, and seems less now.  **The site needs to be simple to understand and intuitive to navigate**._

> _When I was attending school it was very stressful submitting forms._

> _Had a rep who took forever to get back to you._

> _Seems fine, does the job well. Probably would help to have a FAQ and a bot that would help you with the questions._


**Some users reported negative experiences with the broader VA**

Participants report a variety of experiences with the VA ranging from "_This has been heart wrenching_" to "_My experience has been great._" These sentiments were echoed in our previous remote interviews and usability sessions where users both passionately complained and praised the VA.  

> _When my post-911 benefits expired, I applied for the S.T.E.M. grant and was approved. However, I could not use the S.T.E.M. because it expired with my GI Bill benefits. This was unclear to me or the financial department at my school, which has now caused me to file for student loans. Why would I need to simultaneously use a S.T.E.M. grant and the GI Bill? I had 7 classes left to finish my degree and planned to use the S.T.E.M. for these classes, but it never got paid. **This has been heart-wrenching** because I was almost done with 4 more classes in the SUMMER 2024 semester. I had to apply for student loans for the current semester I thought was covered. I was supposed to graduate on June 14, 2024, but now I can not. **I feel like I was set up for failure, in accordance with what I have come to expect from my government**._

> _VA website very difficult to navigate through the pages. and very hard to [find] information._

> _My experience has been great!_


## Recommendations

* Consider MGIB enrollment verifications as a future candidate for support in the VA App or through text messaging. Currently, the Post-9/11 GI Bill enrollment verifications can be conducted via text messaging, which users love. 
* No further design changes are suggested from this research
